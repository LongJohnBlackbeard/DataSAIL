2021-05-25 19:15:15,stocks,"NVIDIA long term is a strong play. You have earnings, stock split and ARM acquisition as three question marks with the ARM acquisition being the biggest in my opinion. If the ARM acquisition falls through it will cause a correction, whereas if it goes through I could see the stock pushing $800."
2021-05-25 18:44:41,stocks,"For me, NVDA has two, big short-term events that will affect the stock price, its earnings report tomorrow (will probably make it go up or down a few percentage points) and also their stock split next month in June (will also probably cause a big change in price, although not sure which direction). Also worth considering, fears about inflation have previously driven down NVDA's price the past few months and might continue to cause volatility in the near-term future. In a vacuum, though, I think NVDA should be a good stock to own longer-term."
2021-05-25 18:53:14,stocks,"The split is nice and Nvidia is doing well, but my eyes are still on the ARM merger. If that gets the nod from regulators, Nvidia is golden. If it does not, growth becomes harder for Nvidia. The reason is that ARM as an architecture stands to expand into the desktop segment. Apple is transitioning, and Windows has the software support but is lacking the hardware. The merger would give Nvidia control over the architecture and companies like Apple and Qualcomm would have to pay royalties to Nvidia who could at the same time churn out their own ARM chips."
2021-05-25 18:26:26,stocks,After the 4-1 stock split it will make it look cheaper and more appealing to people. I‚Äôm in Nvidia for longgg

2021-05-25 19:02:40,stocks,"Eh,

Within a couple of days on off hours I think a person can be reasonably well informed. 

You do not need to be an insider to know that a company has a better product than their competitors, that there is a large runway for growth in sales/revenue/profit, etc. This is not to say you can predict the unpredictable, but you can make a good accounting superior to the majority of traders out there."
2021-05-25 19:53:21,stocks,You may have an opinion that a company has a superior product when it doesn‚Äôt. There may be a large ‚Äòrunway for growth‚Äô but share prices often don‚Äôt reflect the underlying fundamentals of a particular company.

Thanks for the recap! Clarida said today that FED may 'start' talking about tapering bond purchases in the upcoming meetings. I googled how that may effect the stocks when it happens eventually but found conflicting news. Some says not a big deal as long as interest rates stay low, and some say this is bad news for stocks.

Morgan Stanley CEO also said ""‚ÄúMy personal view is rates are likely to rise in the early part of next year, and not in 2023 which is currently the projection,‚Äù Gorman said at an online conference in Tokyo Tuesday. ‚ÄúThe Federal Reserve will be driven by whatever their numbers tell them. I am just giving you my opinion. ‚Äù   this scared me a little tbh, as I can't find a safe heaven when that finally happens"
2021-05-25 17:03:19,stocks,"Thanks, hope your day has been good, cheers!"
2021-05-25 18:55:45,stocks,Thank you as always!
2021-05-25 17:12:18,stocks,"Ans Jerome Powell in an April 14 meeting said ""We will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance"" and stocks still had a great month. This is not new, quantitative easing is always the first to go after the economy recovers and no longer needs liquidity injections. I think youre putting to much on a single statement.

Moreover, if youre worried about rates potentially rising in early 2022, I think youll miss out on some great gains. 

The market will always have risk, up to you to put it into context of the broader market and interpret the potential ramifications of that risk. I personally think we're fine"
2021-05-25 17:13:56,stocks,"""The Federal Reserve is driven by what the numbers tell them"", here you hit the nail on the head

The Fed has consistently said they want to see a ""string"" of strong labor reports before any adjustments to the policy are made, something whcih, going by the April Job Report, is currently not happening"
2021-05-25 17:20:43,stocks,"thank you so much for your opinions, I learn a lot from you!"
2021-05-25 16:55:25,stocks,"For what purpose?

2021-05-25 16:15:43,stocks,"You can follow up to see if they are worth anything but don't be surprised if the shares were not just transferred to a digital format and already accounted for with the person's estate. 

That being said the certificates could fetch something on EBay for collectors and such."
2021-05-25 16:27:15,stocks,"You won't be able to claim the shares unless you are the executor of the decedent's estate so you might as well not bother.

If you decide to go forward with the process, the transfer agent will ask you for a death certificate and letter of testamentary to confirm you're entitled to the shares."

2021-05-25 17:23:25,stocks,"To the 1 or 2 people that were helpful and gave advice using their knowledge of this subject thank you and it really is appreciated.
  To the rest of you I promise life is alot happier and more enjoyable when you treat the rest of the people you come into contact with,with kindness and compassion.
  If your first thought when you see someone's post is to attack them and be hurtful upon your first contact with them I suggest you take the time to look into your own mindset and feelings of harming other individuals only in the attempt to make yourself feel better because you  are smarter and more moral than them in your own eyes.
  Karma is a real thing. If you fill a glass to over flowing it will spill upon you and all those around you.
 It is upon you whether you fill it with happiness or hate."
2021-05-25 17:12:40,stocks,"So assuming that the shares are still aktive, as in the company still exists, there are generally two types of shares, registered shares and bearer stock. It seems since there is a name on the certificate that they are the former. In that case the certificates themselves don‚Äôt do anything for you, since they don‚Äôt really matter, what matters is the name on the shareholder registry. It might be possible to claim them after some time if they are abandoned property,but I doubt it. Talk to a specialised lawyer about that, if the shares still have value."
2021-05-25 16:27:41,stocks,Quite sad that this is not the first answer.
2021-05-25 16:41:34,stocks,"So what would you consider the right thing to be?
 I'm also curious why you think I haven't already done that at least the simple search for it?
 You also have no insight into the context of how it was found other than being told it was found dumpster diving so if I told you whoever was cleaning this person's place out had also thrown away the baby pictures of their children and grandchildren and along with other items and letters easily noticed as being cherished by this person does that have any weight bearing on ""doing the right thing"" or should I just find the location this person lived at and hand them over as I inform them they might have thrown away something of monetary value along with the ones of sentimental value? Does the right thing include giving it to someone who hasn't spoken to this person in 30 or 40 years or is possibly someone that was just a care taker for the last 6 months of this person's life? 
  Myself I am not physic and not able to read minds or see the past or future so am unable to know what ""do the right thing"" might entail but if you know I would gladly take that information and use it  to the best of my abilities."
2021-05-25 16:22:14,stocks,Really appreciate the information and yea the lilbit I've looked into it has said most often they are only valuable as collectors items but ehh you never know lol.
2021-05-25 17:04:44,stocks,"Thank you for that clear and straightforward answer that sounds like advice from someone with a large amount of experience and knowledge about the subject.
 So far as I can tell with the research I've done the person has no decedent's or spouse alive to claim any of the shares in the companies attached to these certificates."
2021-05-25 16:17:46,stocks,"Wow really? How awful does your life have to be just to see a post asking for information and think "" I know what will make me feel better I'll be an azzhole to this person"".
  Smh really feel bad for you I hope stuff gets better for you and you find some way of being happier in life."
2021-05-25 16:28:14,stocks,Lol you know how people r now a days

2021-05-25 17:00:13,stocks,"Shares don‚Äôt work like that, and haven‚Äôt worked like that in a long time. You can‚Äôt just find a certificate and claim the shares as yours.

 Seeing as how you and many others here are experts on morality and how each of us should handle every situation without having any context of that situation to begin with I'm surprised you haven't gotten in contact with the world leaders to let them know how they could be doing ot better if they would listen to your expert and perfected advice about all of the world's issues.
 I will be leaving this sub reddit very quickly. I'm sorry I even posted any comments asking for advice in this sub. If I'd have known how toxic and ill tempered the people here were I'd have never posted a thread in the first place.

I hope you were fortunate enough to grab the dividend.  If the Disney partnership materializes I think that will be a nice little bump.

2021-05-25 16:46:39,stocks,sorry to say but there is a disconnect between gold miners and gold spot right now. I bought NEM at the peak of gold spot. NEM has now broken even for me but gold spot is nowhere near the same level.  Looking at it from a mean reversion perspective would suggest that miners are overvalued and gold spot is undervalued.

2021-05-25 17:38:08,stocks,"Silver is better in bull markets, gold better in bear markets. Been that way forever. Silver considerably more volatile, but that‚Äôs expected.

I really can‚Äôt recommend any retail investor holding physical silver. It often costs more than one makes. Spot on silver is $28.14 now. The lowest price for bullion on the biggest online dealer is a 15% premium above spot. That doesn‚Äôt include shipping costs or storage costs. Then, when you sell, you will be faced with another 10% premium. Potentially up to 15% for silver. So with premiums, excluding shipping/storage costs, to make 10% ROI, silver spot needs to rise 40%.

Edit: Found a 100oz bar for 12.4% premium at another retailer. Better but still painful."
2021-05-25 19:34:08,stocks,"Well if everyone was talking about it, i didnt hear it. I bought because of potential stimulus money being printed and the inverse relationship between monetary supply and its value. But sure, undermine the sentiment by assuming it was a fomo. The underlying reason I purchased it still remains and is why have lost nothing on the investment. Even warren buffet joined my party until he realized that the entire market is riding on rehypothicated collateral. Good luck!"
2021-05-25 17:54:10,stocks,"In the short term, yes. If there's a correction to historical norms, none of that will matter. Investing in physical silver isn't a standard play on returns like most people are familiar with. It's a hedge against USD, as well as a prediction of a correction to standard ratios. 

If silver corrects to its mid 1900s ratio of 1:45 gold:silver, that's a 50% return, on top of any incremental growth from both metals. I'm fine with 15% above spot for that (which is atypical and only a result of unprecedented demand of this past year). If it corrects to its historical value against the USD, that's a significant jump in price.

Most PM ""experts"" would put realistic fair value of silver above $100. That's again assuming accurate pricing to its previous value against the dollar. A few make the case for $1000. I think that's a stretch, and more in line with the pre 1900s pegged value of 1:15 gold:silver. But even at $130, does it really matter if you paid $32 for an ounce when spot was $28? Especially if anything were to happen to devalue the dollar even more than it already is. Both the Euro and the Renminbi are gaining traction as a global reserve currency.

But really, I'm not in silver because I think it's going to be some outperforming asset. It's a hedge against hyperinflation. At 3-5% of a portfolio, I'm fine with the current prices. And it's value against gold leaves it undervalued even with premiums factored in."

Try to get that avg down so when it jumps again you sell at a minimal loss or break even( still have to pay taxes I think so you still have a slight loss) the concept of buy and hold is literally hold a stock till you feel like you no longer want it. This isn't something new the strategy hold is a time and true method. But you have to do other things like double down set up exit plan . Maybe next time buy in slowly. Wait for a significant dip buy small again . Wait for another dip buy again. If you only have small amounts of cash. If you rich buy however you want. But for the poor like me buy frugally. Dumbfucks

Your arbitrary time period doesn‚Äôt mean anything. Expand that time period to a year and they have massive growth. Nothing about that predicts the future. You can choose any combination of time periods to fit whatever scenario you are looking for.

>so they only have to return to where they already were

Says what? Says who? Why do *you* know this and everyone else doesn‚Äôt? Where‚Äôs your proof? 

>Wall street spent months talking about moving out of growth and going to cyclicals

No. The talking heads talked about their analysis of money flow.

The money flow is entirely obvious. Pandemic destroyed cyclicals, so money flows out of that into tech/medical. Pandemic eases, money slowly flows back into cyclical. But we also see money flowing into commodities. So now we get to predict where money flows back into. Or does it just settle to pre-covid. Most analysts see the money flowing to the most reasonable forward earnings; that is not tech. 

Just because a once in a century event inflated the price of a stock, doesn‚Äôt mean that price is representative of the company‚Äôs outlook. The price movements in 2020 were not organic. 

>so eventually they‚Äôll go back

Again, where‚Äôs your proof? Why do you know what they are going to do with their money when they don‚Äôt even know yet?

I‚Äôm willing to wager you have not evaluated any of these growth stocks for future earnings and are basing all of your decisions on the 1Y stock chart and wishful thinking that everything is guaranteed to return to 52W highs and you started calculating your returns. Probably been watching too much Ricky Guttierez.

Third time was for a rash and fever my son had. The doctor completely misdiagnosed him with some much more severe and rare viral infection.

Covid also forced my PCP office to greatly improve their online system and after hours nurse system. So now Teladoc has even less relevance.

2021-05-25 15:41:17,stocks,"I think you got triggered. You‚Äôre abstracting what I‚Äôm saying. I‚Äôm making a very simplistic statement about what happened. Wall Street did move out of growth we saw it happen with the prices as well as reports like: Cathie selling, Chamath selling, Branson selling, a lot of SPACs are down and out. Growth went down and ppl back out, that‚Äôs not the talking heads.

I‚Äôm not saying anything will happen with mathematical certainty. However, I think it‚Äôs very very very unlikely that Wall Street will never return to growth positions. It inherently part of how the market values everything. So it makes sense that after they come out of cyclicals they will return to growth. Maybe they‚Äôll go to financials first, who knows. But that‚Äôs the point of the post. 

I half understand your position but the other half seems abstracted and ranting."

2021-05-25 15:49:56,stocks,"Agree with this. Recently looked at BB because of the hype it was getting. It currently trades at almost 5.5x sales, which is fine for a growth stock but it's revenues have been pretty  flat or slightly falling for almost a decade. More debt than cash and it has nearly 10% of its shares shorted. Plus I couldn't get behind a company that was so shortsighted to believe that nobody would every use a smartphone without a physical keyboard for business.

The others, such as Google and Microsoft, are only good for people within the same organization.

This is somewhat consistent with my real-life experience. The only time I ever needed to use Google Meet was for a local training event. On the other hand, if I ever attended a conference or webinar hosted in another state or country, it was always through Zoom."

2021-05-25 15:44:52,stocks,"You‚Äôre right, Wall Street will never ever buy growth stocks ever again. That makes more sense. Square and UBER won‚Äôt be around in a couple years."
2021-05-25 16:01:22,stocks,"You keep saying growth stocks. But it‚Äôs pretty clear you mean tech growth. Not all growth is down this month. A lot are up.

And yes, I am bearish on growth tech, like most people."
2021-05-25 16:10:18,stocks,"Not necessarily but yes overall tech stocks are high valuations. I meant growth in general, but no not all of it is down. Most of the valuations have come down to earth a little. For instance BYND is a high valuation and is down. They just signed a deal with UK food distribution so they‚Äôre expanding and to me it looks like it will likely grow into a higher valuation as it gets to where it is now (where it dropped).

SLDB has been developing genetic therapeutics for years and is not profitable. However; given that the mRNA vaccines have shown to have tremendous value I would say it seems possible that they will be discovered since they have years and years of mRNA research in hand. 

So I do actually mean growth overall, not just tech. But what I just wrote was a little speculative mixed with DD. I just mean overall, companies that are being funded to grow will have a return in investors."
2021-05-25 17:04:03,stocks,"BYND didn‚Äôt fall from a sell off though it happened at the same time. It dropped 15% within days after Tyson announced their meatless burgers. Tyson was an initial investor of BYND and on their board of directors. They sold their position and gave up their board seats citing a conflict of interest (ie, they learned their process and started replicating it). If the taste is even marginally close, Tyson will win in logistics, distribution, and business relationships. I bought Tyson earlier this year because of BYNDs evaluation.

SLDB is interesting. Though every other pharm is doing just fine with their mRNA research. I‚Äôd only be attracted to SLDB as an outlet of people getting scared of Moderna‚Äôs insane valuation or the fact that Moderna, JNJ, and Pfizer could write a small check today and purchase them."
2021-05-25 17:39:05,stocks,"SLDB isn‚Äôt a vaccine company so it won‚Äôt be effected by vaccine news. They have proprietary stuff they can license as well as the long term data they‚Äôve accumulated regarding mRNA. Medicine over the last 10-15 years has been trying to make genetic therapy the cure all. Medical community is hyped on the vaccine as proof of mRNA and are going to try to use it for everything from curing blindness to muscular dystrophy. All genetic therapeutic companies will likely have an increase in value due to market share of a new proven medical technology. That‚Äôs somewhat speculative but since the entire globe is being injected with mRNA  it‚Äôs pretty miraculous proof. whereas a 2 years ago ppl thought it was a pipe dream. We‚Äôll see. 

BYND had bad news but it had some sell off too it wasn‚Äôt all at the same time..but yes. Normally investors would hold through that news but it looked like everything was falling back. 

Either way, I‚Äôm not pitching these companies I‚Äôm just noticing tends. These were just two examples I thought of."

2021-05-25 13:35:16,stocks,"I'd like to add a sentence or two about margin. It is baffling to me how easy it is to get into margin. Margin is the epitome of investing more than you can afford. Unless you know exactly what you are doing or do this as a full time job, relying on margin to finance your investments is a red flag.

I maintain a zero permanent margin policy. I will use it to buy stuff when bank transfers are not quick enough to transfer the cash needed, but I always pay it off 100% within a day or two. Relying on margin permanently and getting used to the securities you buy *as your own* is a mistake. In reality, on margin, your securities are collateral, so even the stuff you bought with your own money is in some ways no longer yours."

2021-05-25 13:12:11,stocks,"Excellently written, most if not all start in loss due to commission fees and such so it‚Äôs about learning to take the rough with the smooth and gains with the dips. Sometimes step away from your portfolio especially the long holders out there. If you believe in your stocks, your ETFs, your investments for the long haul then try not to become fixated on them all the time. 

It‚Äôs definitely easy to be drawn into buying the dip, especially on this social channel ha! Avoid the confirmation bias and know exactly what you can afford and if it‚Äôs worth it.

Keep a financial planner for budgeting. Always put expenses for bills, pensions and to be perfectly honest a little to enjoy for commodities before thinking about investing more. If your financial planner has been budgeted that you can do, say, 200pcm then do that. Don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs an obligation though."

I used to think of it as money down the drain, simply because at one point in my life before investing, my money **was** going down the drain.  This let me not worry about short term fluctuations.

Now that I have serious (to me) money invested, this mentality has drifted away.

I have my savings in cash, and those are what keep me from short term worry."
2021-05-25 17:02:23,stocks,"I agree with everything the OP said in their post. I invested a good chunk of my cash (about 20%) in the companies that i believe in such as Amazon, Apple, Airbnb, Microsoft, Facebook, Nividia, Paypal, AMD, Palantir, Snowflake, Beyond Meat and will not ideally have to touch them for at least 5-10 years (that‚Äôs the goal). I saved a good chunk of cash for the dips when the market crashes. Sometimes days go by before i look at my portfolio.
I think people who are panicky when the market starts going down and start selling do have their money in the stocks only for short term gains. These people could be losing on big gains in the future.
Id rather have a line of credit ready and untouched as my emergency funds than sell stocks at a loss when the market crashes. Yoi can pay off the debt (if needed to be used) probably in a year when the market bounces back. 
When you invest in the companies that have healthy balance sheets it is almost guaranteed that they will bounce back."

>thinking about your investment as ""money you have"" to boost your confidence in your bank account. If you have $2k in your checking account but tell yourself it's OK because you have $10k in stocks, you are way in over your head.

Not sure if I agree with this. I have \~65k (CAD) in stocks, \~3.5k-4k in BTC and then the remaining \~10k in my bank but I still think of it all as my 'money' and my net worth. I could always cashout all of my stocks today and have that money in the bank (after taxes of course), but I'm also very aware that my portfolio can drop 5%+ in a day, it's still my money and I can still sell it and have that cash in the bank whenever I want though."

What's sad and I didn't put in the post, is that my generation has historically low wages and I think the rise in retail investors speaks to how many people are using the stock market as a second income source.

2021-05-25 19:16:25,stocks,"I think margin has a place and shouldn't be as scary as people make it out to be. The problem is it's a form of leverage and with that carries risk, and people combine multiple forms of risk to screw themselves over. It's like a power tool. Treat it with respect it makes your life nicer, but if you don't things will go badly quickly. 

A little margin on a support level on a blue chip, with plans to rebalance/deleverage if things don't go as planned? Can be very lucrative and still relatively safe. Buying speculatives and meme stocks at 100% leverage at whatever price because surely it will go up, with no exit plan? Yeah you're going to get fucked."

Yeah, it's not bad to sell for a loss, but if a large portion of the market is dropping like flies, and lots of newer people are down at least 30%, maybe selling when lots of things are going down on FUD isn't the best idea."

I've gone through two periods where I realized I had over extended what I could afford and both times I caught myself because I realized I was constantly checking the stocks and agonizing over dips.

It's easier to have confidence and ride out the dips when your aren't risking more than you can afford, I just never put it in that perspective until recently."
2021-05-25 14:12:26,stocks,"The problem with all these money-you-can-afford-to-lose its that it ignores the reality of investing being a common retirement/wealth preservation-growth plan. 

People building up their portfolios until retirement, then drawing down throughout retirement to finance their outgoings. Or similar pre-retirement scenarios. People cannot afford to lose this money, but it's also the only way that they'll be able to afford their end-goal.

Equities are an inherently risky asset class, but it's about balancing your risk capacity. If you gamble in meme stocks, then yeah - only use money you can afford to lose. If you build a solid diversified portfolio or go index with long-term tolerance, then it's more like ""money you can go without for 10-20 years"".

2021-05-25 19:32:52,stocks,"My dad gave me a warning when I first started investing that haunts me to this day and its where this particular bit of advice comes from. See we grew up in a very affluent area where we were middle class but most around us were considered pretty wealthy. My dad worked for a uber rich family company and the higher ups he interacted with used to always toss around big boy talk of how much they had in their portfolios or real estate, etc and on paper they were millionaires. Many would even talk down to my dad about how he wasn't rich because he wasn't investing properly (mind you these guys made 10x what my dad and were born into it so they had zero idea what it took to actually earn your money). He did invest he just always bet a cow instead of the farm which all these supposed millionaires thought was just the dumbest. 

Then, 2008 rolled around. These guys were bankrupt almost overnight. Suddenly their millionaire status was reduced to nothing. Much of what they owned had been bought on their net worth and when the crash happened, that net worth went to zero. As the company began struggling you can imagine the toddler tantrums that occurred because suddenly these guys couldn't pay mortgages and were essentially broke. Several of the non family personnel were laid off and had to sell property at a huge loss just to keep above water because their properties were worthless. Even some of the middle class guys that thought investing was the way to go got screwed because their savings were so much lower than investments. My dad managed to be ok and he bit his tongue when the same people who treated him like an idiot for not pouring his savings into the stock market came crying over how unfair it was that they now had nothing as if it was some injustice.

If you can lose 65k and still be ok, power to ya. Too many people think investments are sure things and while they aren't exactly a craps table, it's not a good mentality to live by. Personally, I make sure we have enough in the bank to cover six months of no job and lost investments.

Another did a promotion in mid 2020: 0% margin rate until the end of the year. Free money.

Except nothing is ever free.

I use margin sparingly, and never for stuff I couldn't afford. It mostly comes down to timezones and bank transfers. Get in on that later day action in North America when European transfers will only clear the next day. But never to finance stuff I couldn't afford."

These people are ""investing"" and don't have a defined loss tolerance, so they'll watch it bleed and bleed until they're down 30-50% because ""they're holding it long term"" and then they sell because they didn't actually want to hold it long term and just wanted to get rich quick."
2021-05-25 14:29:41,stocks,"Maybe this should've been more specific to retail traders just investing in stocks. More and more of the millennial generation isn't just investing for retirement. Wages being what they are, a lot of people invest for things like home down-payment, student loan payoff, etc. It's becoming a much more short term endeavor as people try to bridge the gap their parents didn't have.  

My husband has a work retirement account he's always put more of his paycheck into the same way his parents did so that some day he can retire comfortably. When covid hit we were offered the option to withdraw to help cover covid expenses. My husband cried when he saw how little was in the account. He did the math and if inflation keeps up over the next thirty years that retirement account, plus the pension match that would come when he hit retirement would barely be 60% of what he would need. Unless he died five years after retiring."

2021-05-25 16:48:15,stocks,"Yeah so many necessary jobs now where the wages haven‚Äôt risen to meet current cost of living i.e. social work, education, etc. Most people can‚Äôt afford homes anymore since real estate is pushed as an investment vehicle instead of a home to live in. Most first world countries have dropped the ball when it comes to foreign investment in real estate. Tons of rich Chinese people/investment companies are buying up property everywhere to park their money in. 

All the loosely defined rules and regulations for politicians trading, SEC ineffectiveness - market is essentially rigged for the wealthy elite. 

US is such a wealthy nation now but the wealth inequality just gets worse and worse. All the companies have politicians in their pockets in the name of public private partnership. Very infuriating that we send taxpayer money over to Saudi Arabia and Israel with the stipulation that they use it to buy weapons for us. 

Higher taxes are essentially useless because the government is terrible at allocating funds to use. Hell - they‚Äôre bad at passing meaningful legislature which is supposed to be their job... so much time/resources wasted playing the political game for power and wealth rather than doing their jobs. We are kind of fucked, our 1776 government wasn‚Äôt made to scale to this level.

If you've invested what you can afford, the hit doesn't hurt as much and you can afford to ride it out. BUT what often is the case and has happened to me, is you realize during the crash that oh shit, I put way more than I can afford into this and so the knee-jerk reaction is to sell and get your funds back. My advice here is if you're in that situation, wait for a rebound and then sell what's reasonable to put back into your bank account. The most dangerous time to realize you've put more in than you should is when a stock crashes."

Also it could backfire, if you wait for a dip, that dip might not happen.  The dip could come and maybe it just sinks lower. So many variables.

I was in a similar situation and honestly i just dropped the lump sum and let regression to the mean take the wheel"
2021-05-25 13:15:24,stocks,You are supposed to have a price target in mind for the long term. Lets use VTI for an example. You might think this will hit $400 one day. So buying now is seen as a discount and if it goes down you get happy because more of a discount from the $400 or whatever is your price target.
2021-05-25 13:06:25,stocks,"It‚Äôs all relative and about perspective.

Look at overall gain - not gain per share."
2021-05-25 19:56:51,stocks,"One solution is to buy dips. Here is a simple calculation for you:

`shares to buy = Stock price at last peak / current stock price * current quantity - current quantity`

In this case, you might say use 25% of your money to buy regularly and keep the other 75% to buy dips.

You can also use this leveraged approach (the simple solution is 1X leverage):

`shares to buy = (Stock price at last peak / current stock price * current quantity * leverage - current quantity * leverage)`

Basically in this case, with a 2X leverage, if it goes down 1%, you'll buy 2% more shares. If it goes back up to where it was, you'll get about `% decrease^2 * leverage` profit from the movement backup and `% decrease * leverage` additional profit as the price continues to move up.

Warning: Avoid using more than 1X leverage if the price is crashing rather than just dipping, you'll want to wait for it start to go back up before you use higher leverage, to avoid it dropping even further. 

*Only use this approach if you are confident the stock will go back above the last peak within your time horizon (which for investors is probably years)*

Of course, the dip may not happen in which case, dollar cost averaging is still important, hence it should still be used, but definitely keep some buy aside to buy dips as they come."

2021-05-25 12:45:23,stocks,"Yes. When you are clearly winning with a stock, it‚Äôs ok to sell a little bit to realize some gains. But if the company‚Äôs future looks bad, you should just cut your losses asap."

2021-05-25 14:23:30,stocks,Either sell off slowly or constantly reset your stop losses.
2021-05-25 16:25:28,stocks,Yes so I use the lot buy theory. Sell the lots as you bought them. So your last buy should be your first sell. Eventually you will be selling for longterm capital gains since your oldest shares are still there. Perfect example is AMD I have shares at $9 but I‚Äôve added on the way up and it‚Äôs been in a channel since July so I buy some each time at the bottom of the channel at $73 and sell around $88 to capture profits while waiting for it to break out but I‚Äôm not touching my shares from $9 to $64

2021-05-25 14:09:34,stocks,"Of course. I started doing this over the last year or so with stocks that ran up really well.  Countless times I've sold an entire position only to watch it rebound soon after and leave me behind.  So selling part of the position is a good way to protect some profits and rebalance your portfolio, without getting out of a position entirely."
2021-05-25 12:43:46,stocks,Imo the same logic applies. I do have a secondary personal rule of it's okay to skip a dip or a rise if I think theres more to come the next day.  Dont feel pressured to buy or sell every rise or dip but you should take some on the way up.  It just helps to not regret later and you're loaded back up and ready to buy the next pullback.

I am very good with tracking them and making sure to close out if it is unfavorable. A family emergency came about and I was unable to attend to my stocks for two days. I had 10 spy put credit spreads that went ITM at expiry and I was unable to close them out before expiration due to said emergency. A took a net loss of 1000 bucks (which in the grand scheme of things isn‚Äôt the worst case scenario but still sucks). 

Two days later, I look at my TD Ameritrade account and it exercised the short and long leg to cover. Because it exercised basically 1000 shares of spy, it shows up as $420,000 cost and $419,000 proceeds. This equals out to 1000 dollar loss. I obviously did not put up that much capital.

My question is, when I go to file my taxes next year, is the only thing I need to worry about is my total net gain/losses for the year? Or will this 420k somehow skew my taxes and mess with my tax bracket at all? This has never happened to me and I am just trying to figure out if anyone else has had a similar situation.

The major growth in Amazon's advertising unit means its revenue contribution is now 2.4 times larger than Snap, Twitter, Roku and Pinterest combined, and it's growing 1.7 times as quickly, according to Loop Capital. 

Amazon's ""Other"" unit, which is primarily made up of advertising but also includes sales related to other service offerings, grew revenue a massive 77% year-over-year to more than $6.9 billion in the first quarter, the company reported last month.

This is another bright spot of amazon stock. Ad revenue is highly profitable like AWS, so it could use the profit to support other business. The ad revenue is growing very fast so it could able to compete with FB and Googl in the future. The stock is trading under $3300, investors should consider buying some and hold.

2021-05-25 16:51:41,stocks,"""2.4 times larger than"" is more than thrice as big as, not just twice as big as. 2.4x+x=3.4x. The logic that makes ""two times larger than"" the same as ""twice as large as"" would also make ""fifty percent larger than"" the same thing as ""fifty percent as large as."""
2021-05-25 11:21:10,stocks,"Yea this is why I don't think the advertising revenue is that sustainable.  It's just Chinese sellers bidding against eachother to sell one of 10000x versions of random products.   And the problem is the more they bid to show up at the top, the shittier their products are because they're spending more money on ads and less on making quality products.  

During the pandemic it was very profitable for them, but it's clear Amazon needs to curate their selection more to avoid driving customers away."

They aren't as competitive on prices anymore as I hardly ever see them beat walmart, target, best buy etc. Their search results are absolutely atrocious; if I search for 17"" Asus laptop with 144hz screen and then sort by lowesy price I don't want to see a bunch of laptop chargers and shit. Their shipping has become a bit unreliable. They touted 1 day shipping and that was a huge flop. 

We just aren't getting good value for the Prime membership anymore."
2021-05-25 13:57:46,stocks,"It‚Äôs useless to even try to buy anything from them at this point that isn‚Äôt direct from the company that made it.

Hell, even if you buy a ‚Äúreal‚Äù product, you may get an email six months later telling you that the flea medication you bought your dog was counterfeit and could be toxic (and actual email I received).

Then the vast majority of those sellers wind up on page 50, with zero sales, so they spend a ton on ads, which they quickly find is a fool‚Äôs errand, then they ultimately realize that the only way out is to pay Amazon to discard all of their merchandise (for a hefty fee). The amount of waste that this creates is insane. We are talking about a VERY large percentage of products on Amazon that wind up in the dumps. It needs to be stopped."

I don't just do it on principal, I do it for myself, I value knowing that a store has vetted a product and can show me it and it's specs more clearly and accurately. I even use eBay to find good sellers covering certain niches and they do a better job of vouching for their goods over Amazon.

Just last week I ran out of espresso...a mortal sin...and it took Amazon five days to ship it and three days to deliver. I hadn't even thought about since I was out of town and now I'm just pissed lol.

I think all of us can agree that most of the shit that we get on there can definitely wait a few days for shipping and if not we can take our asses to an actual store. What we pay for is different though and the service since the pandemic (as expected and I understand the delays for things at it's peak) sucks so hard."

2021-05-25 14:47:18,stocks,"Most companies(if not all) that grow in size become less efficient. From business decisions and processes to technological innovation , things move very slowly and become inefficient.

You only need to look at modern examples (standard oil comes to mind) to see how breaking up monopolies benefited shareholders immensely. Standard oil was broken up into 34 separate companies and many of those become some of the largest and most powerful companies today. Not only did it increase the share prices of these forms, it more than quintupled JD Rockefeller net worth. 

In general companies that become very large can become very fragile ( think aig) when a company that large fails, there are significant impacts to the market and their own shareholders. By breaking up monopolies into smaller parts companies the market can become more ‚Äúantifragile‚Äù (if you don‚Äôt know what that means go read the book by Taleb) but essentially it prevents the greater possibility of significant and harmful effects (aka market crash or company bankruptcy)."

2021-05-25 18:09:00,stocks,You‚Äôve completed ignored everything I‚Äôve said about why monopolies are bad... monopolies are inefficient and dangerous. That‚Äôs why we have antitrust.
2021-05-25 18:13:20,stocks,"You stated that the larger companies get the less efficient (typically).  Amazon is an example of one that has gotten better and better the larger they've gotten.  And they expand into different areas versus just dominating a single one.

Amazon isn't a monopoly.  We can't just call companies a monopoly because they are large and successful."
2021-05-25 18:35:21,stocks,Amazon is a big player in many industries but is not a monopoly in any of them.
2021-05-25 18:42:20,stocks,"I never claimed Amazon was a monopoly. Read carefully what I wrote. I said Amazon has significant market power ( it‚Äôs very hard or rare to have a true monopoly , so in economics we use ‚Äúmarket power‚Äù as a proxy to describe a firm who has monopolistic features.) And Amazon absolutely has market power in web services, digital goods (such as diapers, e-readers ect.), therefore they should be broken up , because they‚Äôre are significant impacts to the market and it‚Äôs dangerous to have a firm that large. Economics, for the most part, only covers anticompetitive component of antitrust. Large firms like Amazon are demonstrating that when I firm is significantly large they can impact things like local and state tax structures and incentives. They are automatically given a seat at the table when it comes to larger political decisions. Instead of ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚ÄúAmazon. And the other people‚Äù.

That‚Äôs the dystopian future Amazon has painted for us. It‚Äôs far surpassed any ‚Äúmonopoly‚Äù we‚Äôve seen thus far. It‚Äôs so successful and so powerful economic literature hasn‚Äôt even caught up to it. It‚Äôs quite scary in that sense."
2021-05-25 18:44:44,stocks,"Where did I state they are a monopoly? Did you not read what I wrote....?

2021-05-25 09:38:39,stocks,Stocks splits have no effect on your position. Reverse split is exactly what it says it is. E.g. a 4:1 reverse split means that you will hold 1 share of stock after the split for every 4 shares of stock you held before the split

When in doubt always go the exchange website itself. So the company consolidated its shares. They took back your old stock and reissued new ones for you at 23/1 ratio. You are seeing a 2200% return because that is your raw price return (.92/.04)-1. Your true return is your market value from yesterday to today and I suspect it didn‚Äôt move that much. 

Your return will return to normal tomorrow and you‚Äôll forget this ever happened. All you get is some annoyance for your return calculation being wrong for the whole day."

I work for company that is part of large multinational conglomerate that owns many other companies in the same sector. Our parent company is listed on NYSE. However, it is considered low P/E and high dividend value stock that recently got quite expensive so I don't own any stocks of it. Also... knowing how things work from the inside... I actually don't really want to hold any shares of this company... At least not at the current price.

Regarding owning shares its no big deal. We get little training videos about how we are not supposed to trade on insider information and how we are not supposed to trade shares just before and after earnings but other than that, no problem, anyone can own company's shares and I don't think you need to declare anything to HR. Also, we have shares ownership programme where employees are allowed to buy company's share at a discount. I think it's buying shares at cheapest price that quarter or something like that. Didn't really look into it much.

Looking forward to hearing from other people."

They both have a well rounded retirement package so holding shares was meaningless to them. Looking back, I would have never done that, as said telecom is a top dividend payer on TSX.

My wife also worked for a REIT. Her annual bonus was paid as straight options, no discount.

To a lesser extreme, you are typically not allowed to trade except during certain periods after earnings calls, so if you need to access that money you might have to wait a month or two to sell. If they have a discounted espp or other stock compensation it makes sense to maximize that, just remember to periodically take steps to diversify."

I know some of you are very experienced with stocks, researching information about them and doing your own dds. I am really interested in knowing more about what you research and find valuable as information when you look at stocks. I am a small youtuber that would like to provide the best videos for people like you interested in the stock market and I thought it would be nice to know what you expect to see in videos about that!

* When you are researching a stock, what do you usually take a look at? Do you just do research on google and see where it takes you, or do you have a usual way of proceeding?
* Do you often go on YouTube to learn more about a stock? If you do, what do  you usually expect from a video you are watching? Is it more general information like how the business works, what the industry looks like, what are the financials? Or is it more for technical analysis with charts and everything?
* When listening to a video, what is the most crucial information you want to have to feel like the video was not a complete waste of your time?
* Finally, is there anything you love from certain youtubers that make you come back? Or that you hate and make you never click on their video again?

I would really appreciate it if you could answer some of these questions, or just your general opinion would help me provide people with the best content (and provide content that they are actually looking for!!)

Low P/B ratio compared to competitors can sometimes mean bankruptcy risk. Other times, it‚Äôs actually a gold mine. For example, if you look into the company and their balance sheet is strong but their margins are low, they just need to scale their operations to get better margins. If they already are in the process of doing that, then the market just hasn‚Äôt reacted to it. You buy in cheap and others will FOMO in 6 months when their net margins get +10%.

Of course, there are many possible reasons for a low P/B ratio and you may get burned, this example is just one of my main plays now summarized so it came to mind."

‚Ä¢ Investing: I love dividend stocks (can share the ones I hold if you want), as when dividends are reinvested, it results in compound growth
- management, previous track record especially if there‚Äôs a change in the board
- amount of cash they have as it‚Äôs something they‚Äôll always be able to rely on
- P/E and P/S ratios
- dividend payout ratio (ratio of the dividend to net income, as it means less money is reinvested into the company)
- I also own a few ETFs that I count on holding until retirement and also count on reinvesting received dividends

Trading: got burnt a lot in Feb and March, more stressful and overall time consuming so don‚Äôt recommend
- catalysts such as earnings and positive news about their performance or something coming up (be an early mover, don‚Äôt follow if it‚Äôs already up 100% in 3 months)
- growth potential and addressable market as well as future outlook - if you get caught holding the bag (like FUBO, SKLZ, NIO, PLUG, etc.) you can turn it into a long term investment
- theWalrus Street on youtube has some great DD videos, still waiting on BDSI to pop or at least grow 5-10%

2021-05-25 16:42:15,stocks,"As a swing trader (someone who buys/sells within 2 weeks), I find my stocks through general people, [shiftsearch.com](https://shiftsearch.com), certain indicators on thinkorswim that help me find stocks with a low RSI, upcoming events (such as earnings, or company announcements), some watchlists i've created for certain sectors, and if i'm day trading, premarket volatility. My most important tool is, however, listening about a stock that is being hyped up, then formulating my own opinions on it.

A good example of a stock being hyped up is $SQ, and their whole [checkings account fiasco](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-05-24/square-to-take-aim-at-jpmorgan-with-checking-savings-accounts). I bought in some calls before market close yesterday, sold it this morning, no need for financial analysis (although I probably should've) Just a check on people's hype, a look at the article, my own trust in the company, etc... You probably shouldn't do this, but for someone like me who spends their entire day swinging, this is pretty normal.

An example of me using indicators is that I use ThinkOrSwim stock hacker to set up and find stocks with a low RSI. The scanner gives me a list of stocks, I check their net change, how many days they've been bleeding out, if its their first time being this low, how unsure is this company, are there any clear patterns, etc... A good example is when I bought $JD (I think a week or two ago?) It was near the lower band of RSI, and while Jd has been sort of bleeding in the past months, it had clear indications that it rises, then falls a little bit lower than what it use to be.

 Use EMA5, EMA10, MacD, RSI, Bollinger Bands, etc... and hope to god that nothing random happens in the market, and you're kosher.

Hope this helps!"

I try to look and see if they're planning to expand into a new region and then research how well they might be able to do that. 

How are they valued today, and how will that valuation look like in 1 yr, 3 yr or 5 yrs + if they grow their revenues by an amount I see as reasonable. 

Do they have any sort of advantage over the competition and is that advantage growing/shrinking? Will they be able to maintain the advantage for the foreseeable future? 

Maybe consider looking up the google trends to see how their popularity/searches fluctuate. Has the company and their main product been on a strong decline in the last 10 years in terms of popularity/online searches, why? 

Of course look at financials as well. Free cash flow, margins, debt/assets, etc.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

It would be the contrarian thing to consider the possibility of TNX actually not hitting 2% for a while.

Possible that rebalancing is the reason for TNX looking like this though? It is the last week of the month, after all...

There also seems like there is still a lot of pent up demand for housing out there that I don't think a rise in interest rates will completely eliminate and you could see a tick up in inventory once moratoriums start ending (probably will still be some time before those homes would actually hit the market though).

2021-05-25 14:33:45,stocks,what kind of information are you looking to get from them
2021-05-25 11:50:12,stocks,"31 dollars?   


I mean you can go for it, but it's just one share. I doubt this is going to explore to something like GME. Even if you buy one share and it goes up 5 dollars and you sale tomorrow, you will still need to pay a short term capitol gains tax on it, so your profit is still being cut. With that amount of money, personally, I'd just keep holding and putting more money into your account, so you can make a more meaningful purchase."

2021-05-25 13:12:51,stocks,"Not sure, they didn't say when, only that they will pull off 4B from the market. Either way, that's about aa 4.2% share price increase."
2021-05-25 13:49:38,stocks,"It absolutely does.

But the changes that have been made don't equate to a 800%+ increase in company valuation.

2021-05-25 08:12:11,stocks,I think what will be interesting is the CPI is decently high right now and if the central bank keeps printing money for the fed to borrow the kind of doesn't help the inflation concern. So business in turn increases prices in anticipation. I might be wrong but I think that's how it works a little. I am sure I am missing the reasoning behind why this works this way.

2021-05-25 13:30:06,stocks,Tbh I was one of the people who thought that the tech sell off would last until Halloween at least. But in a sense I think trying to say whether the stock would rise or fall is pretty dumb because it's very hard to say what happens in a couple of weeks or what would happen inbetween. At $150 it would have been stupid to say it will go 200 and also stupid to say it will go 100.

2021-05-25 12:18:33,stocks,Interested to see how heavy a crater forms in growth. I cant imagine anyone really red is just gunna sell for loss all the way down. Some may.. but anyone who caught fomo in Jan-Feb started last summer during low interest rates. They are the buy and hold strat through and through and will likely come up with summer money instead of cutting losses. Inflated MM positions could see further sell off which is concerning which is where I see the dotcom bubble mirror. People who bought over inflated tech (stuff that tripled between October and now on no new news) are definitely in for a wake up call.
2021-05-25 12:37:18,stocks,"Oops. ""If"" fed is what I meant. Curiously looking forward to June 10. Summer starting, low unemployment may signal inflation.. but only in the short term. What do you think moving toward the summer? More cash. More value,consumer cyclical, or ride growth and hold"
2021-05-25 12:13:05,stocks,"Great analysis here. The gas analogy really hits home how hard they have come with the stimulus. There will be near term restructuring under the Biden admin. Honestly, I can see (long term) shifts into renewable tech. I just feel like NO budget of anything will get passed. Taxes may increase.. hopefully.. and that will make companies less profitable. I've pulled my short terms and will sit on cash for now. Anything underwater after buying the dip dip dip dip dip dip in feb march I'll let marinate. Most are longs anyway. If we go red.. I mean Hard red.. I'll be happy to DCA any of those and kill when we green again. Cheers."
2021-05-25 11:33:35,stocks,"I disagree with your analysis. IMO the market isn't sure which way to go, and any little piece of news can jolt it up or down."
2021-05-25 11:28:42,stocks,Well markets do often go up back to back and other times they take a break. Today is interesting because it started strong and the projections were for a green day but it seems its turning red. NASDAQ -0.1% now
2021-05-25 14:31:42,stocks,"To name a few: NTP, YUMC, VRTV, and others.

My current focus is investing in Chinese stocks and stocks I see as undervalued. I‚Äôm also trying to diversify in different markets and industries when possible."
2021-05-25 17:25:00,stocks,I think they are technically options... so it wouldn‚Äôt have an affect on stock price right?  The reason synthetic stocks are relevant is because of FTD fees every 21 days. Is there a way for these hedgies to profit enough to offset the FTD fees and wait indefinitely though?  I have to imagine they are expecting to get squeezed so what would their ‚Äúcounter‚Äù be so to speak?  I‚Äôm not invested in AMC but I‚Äôm curious what the HF are thinking or planning.

RH will charge you a flat fee of $75 to transfer. if your account value is greater than $25,000, fidelity will waive this fee if you reach out to customer support. otherwise, it will show as a negative $75 cash balance until you make a deposit into your fidelity account (then they‚Äôll subtract $75 from the deposit.)

$75 is well worth it in my opinion for peace of mind that fidelity bank is a legitimate brokerage. i‚Äôve been with them now for about a year with my retirement account, and 4 months after moving from RH. feel free to reach out if you have any other questions :) their customer support is also super active in the fidelity subreddit."

Its a single video game... yes the business model is very interesting and i am sure it does great, but 50.721B for a video game is a lot.


By comparison, Activision is a whole bunch of highly successful games which earns far more money, and they're only worth 75.021B.



I think Roblox is very overvalued.



In pure numbers, activision made 8.09 billion USD in 2020, and roblox made $920 million.


Additionally as a gamer, i think even the most successful games rarely last forever. A game still played 20 games years later is a miracle, and the revenue is usually down by a lot, no matter how great it is. Activision is managing to keep up revenue by constantly innovating with new games.


Just my opinion tho, i haven't actually played roblox itself but its hard to imagine it being more than a trend."

While I am not really in that scene, I have many friends who are and they love their Funko. Not just that people resell their Funko pops for hundreds or even thousands of dollars. So collectors get into it too. Kids love it as well, they have toys that cater to hem as well. All while having a very iconic design, making it very marketable yet adaptable to new franchises. Very large addressable market. Smaller cap than Hasbro or Mattel so they have a larger growth runway and they are more nimble and their management seems to be in touch with their core fanbsse and understands what they want. 

Not to mention their foray into NFTs but tbh I don't really understand that scene so I can't say much. To me it's a nice bonus but not really the main selling point to me.

In my understanding the most mainstream way of thinking says, yes, it's a good idea. And almost everybody thinks that *some* loosening of monetary policy and stimulus was necessary.

2021-05-25 11:19:05,stocks,Another reason may be because they are trying to get included in the DJIA which is a price weighted index. A share price of 600 makes NVDA basically ineligible due to their disproportionally high share price. At 150 they could be included.
2021-05-25 07:09:48,stocks,">and is not supported by fundamentals.

Weird comment there, to be honest. The stock is splitting - currently at nearly 650 it was at 580 before the announcement.  After a split it would still have traded at 145 a share at pre-announcement prices for the same market cap. At what price do you think a company should consider splitting their stock?

The only fundamental that changes is the number of shares outstanding which will rise from 622M to 2.45 billion. If you're referring to the market cap of the company (around 385 billion) not being supported by the recent results then OK, it seems a bit overvalued based on P/E and P/S ratios, but that didn't stop them running up to nearly 600 per share before any discussion of a split."

2021-05-25 09:29:49,stocks,Nvidias historical average P/e pre covid is around 45. Currently it's p/e is 90. So it's about twice the valuation as it has historically held.
2021-05-25 11:39:05,stocks,630 I bought when it was at 600 tho
2021-05-25 10:08:14,stocks,"That seems an odd view to me. Why does anyone split their stock? It's basically always to manage the liquidity of the stock.

Berkshire never split their main stock because they wanted their investor base to be small and high value - like institutions or high net worth individuals. They don't want it particularly liquid.

Tesla split their stock because they wanted a larger investor base and for it to be accessible to retail investors because they believed that institutions didn't believe in them. They wanted it very liquid.

NVidia's leadership clearly believes that at the current price and given the current trends that the stock is becoming less liquid because the price-per-share is trending out of the range that casual investors are willing to trade in, so they are splitting the stock to bring it back into the 100-200 range which will make it more liquid. That's not a cosmetic reason in my opinion."
2021-05-25 18:17:55,stocks,"Agreed but reasonings are 1. It allows more retail investors pick up shares easily     
2. Easier for compensation packages.    
Lots of stocks seem to want to keep their shares around 100 dollars a pop. I was surprised they didn't do a 5/1 or 6/1 split even."

2021-05-25 11:43:31,stocks,"As the other person said, what he means with ""no fundamentals"" is that there is no value gained out of this. There is no reason the price of the stock should be affected, as your 1 share turns into 4, but each is at 75% less value, meaning your 100$ invested into Nvidia pre split are still 100$ invested post split.

Of course it's true that this is beneficial, it allows people that can't buy fractional shares (is this really still a thing, that some people don't have access to that?) to buy a full share, yes. But there are no fundamentals to claim that a price increase or decrease would be justified. 

You can make a case that the lower price allows more people to buy in, but the impact of someone not being able to spend 600$ and now being able to spend 150$, what's that for a 400B market cap stock? Sure you can hope for a 1-2% increase MAYBE, but I believe this is way to hyped up for what it actually is."

Still quite common, especially among international investors. Up here in Canada, none of the bank-owned brokers (RBC, CIBC, BMO, TD, Scotia) allow clients to purchase fractional shares. From what I know, only Interactive Brokers and maybe Questrade allow Canadian investors to purchase fractionals."
2021-05-25 16:30:41,stocks,"here‚Äôs a thought, is there ever a ‚Äúfundamental reason‚Äù for a stock split? no, some companies just want their stock price to be lower, it‚Äôs a preference of the company. i‚Äôll accept any of the stock splits in the past decade"
2021-05-25 14:34:34,stocks,Koyfin?
2021-05-25 16:55:21,stocks,"That's what I was getting at - there's no reason other than to manage the relative liquidity of the stock. It neither adds nor removes value.

Now, the *effect* of the increased liquidity might be a bump in the price, but that's a judgement on the company value, not on the relative merits of a split or no split."
2021-05-25 17:10:09,stocks,"No, there is no fundamental reason for the stock split, which means this shouldn't be a reason for a change in price. Now of course the entire market is just based on investor sentiment and literally anything can happen, but I think the point the person wanted to make was that there is no reason to be hyped or similar for this. 

Take earnings for example, if they are insanely good you can be hyped about it, or really good news in general. That still doesn't mean that it has to go up or anything has to change, but a positive move should be most likely (of course, depending on many factors. E.g. if it beat expectations but investors had even higher expectations and the earnings were shortcoming of that, then it will fall regardless).

When it was first announced to be discussed someone got quite upset in the thread and noted that the value of the stock isn't changed by this move. I was surprised by his anger because the comment he replied to didn't indicate that, but for some reason (and I have seen that plenty after that post) it's almost treated as if you just get free shares or other benefits by many people. I am not claiming everyone, I am also not claiming it's the majority, but enough people to be noticed."

2021-05-25 17:13:44,stocks,"There are actually reasons to do that, aside from listing the stock (which can be a significant increase because different markets allows additional buying power), but for a psychological factor when you need to make a public offering or sell shares in general to make money. 

After 2 4:1 reverse splits a 16 million share offering turns into a 1 million share offering. While the value is exactly the same, for the reader it sounds very different, simply because humans suck at large numbers and a ton of investors don't really know what they do - at this point I wanna greet the guy who once thought that any stock above the price of apple is automatically a bigger stock, fully ignoring outstanding shares for market cap."

2021-05-25 06:34:54,stocks,What would that be?  Many Japanese and European brands are made in the US.  While on the flip side more than a few 'American' brands have most of their components made south of the border or are primarily assembled there.  Which makes a 'foreign' brand more American than a traditionally American one. If NIO or others become popular enough they may open plants here in the US...so 'chinese' or not it would mean US jobs.  Anyway..would be great to have more factory jobs for US workers but the public serpents in DC sold us out long ago.  Convinced they want to destroy the middle class.

When asking ppl why a Range Rover or X5 or Tesla you always get to hear "" because they are better than our cars"". So it is not only that.
You have to keep in mind that Chinese dont really trust their own products as much as well. 
I think that is another thing that NIO has to fight against. The lack of trust in Chinese products.

Also they have to set up their brand to make it a product to be desired by the ppl. Cars are a status symbol here. As of now a NIO isnt as nice to have as a Tesla or a BMW."
2021-05-25 07:46:05,stocks,"Double Post:

There certainly is the desire to catch up to Western brands in general and the unveiling of Chinese cars at the Shanghai automotive exhib definitely makes people proud and gets them to talk but in the end they end up buying Teslas because Tesla is Tesla, know what I mean? It's got a different ring to it than Nio.

But it is true. Nio has opened a showroom in a space that couldnt be more prominent in one of the more upscale shopping malls. There is always someone inside but it is not really crowded.

Apart from that ppl just love BMW, Mercedes, AMG, VW and especially Tesla over here. I feel it is not a given for Nio to grab a good share of EV market. Especially with VW around breaking into the EV market as well."

2021-05-25 05:26:41,stocks,"So a growth stock can be multiple times overpriced or we can just straight ignore the fundamentals? NIO at the moment is as big as ford or volvo based on market cap. Nio makes 50 times less money (revenue) than ford yet it‚Äôs value is the same. NIO wont be abe to make as many cars as you think in the next several years. I think NIO can be great in the future, and the price of 30 dollars will be justified only in 10 years, when they can make and sell enough cars and maintain a stable revenue. Now it‚Äôs a young and heavily overpriced company, which is a common phenomenon at the end of a bull run, but nothing is Ok about the pricing of NIO. It‚Äôs a company between 1-3 dollars per share. This does not mean that it‚Äôs bad or can not be a 40 dollar company after a long period of time. But now, and based on their fundamentals and rationality, and considering the possibilities for the next five years, NIO is again heavily overpriced. Same for Tesla which is a 50$ stock at most."
2021-05-25 04:52:19,stocks,these are chinese zombie companies.  the fact the ccp can dictate input prices and nio cant generate a profit from day one speaks your greed and lacks business or investment understanding.

I'm not saying you;re right or wrong, this is all anecdotal and I have no idea.

But I'm another Kangaroo (hehe) and for example, I notice where I live in Sydney's Eastern Suburbs and Sydney in general, the types of cars you see sound a lot like what you're describing in Beijing.  I know when I go to other cities in Australia, I don't see the Range Rovers and the Audis, Bimmers, etc. The cars are a lot older and even if they're newish, way less flashy. 

China is a huge market and a huge country, I wonder if Nio is more common elsewhere that isn't as focused on status?"

Apple also manages good returns despite having a horrible marketshare for computers, yet profitable.

Tesla has been unable to keep their lead in both technology, car quality or marketshare. Their cars are getting more problems and start to get a tarnished reputation (the other day they had their own ""battery gate""). Their driving assistance has not outperformed the competition in any test done by a objective third party, on the contrary. And their marketshare in Europe in general and Norway in particular is deep red. Elon going to China to try to butter up Xi Jinping by praising the dictator is a show of *fear*. Tesla is bleeding in Europe, they need a new market...one with less competitors"

I certainly live in of the more affluent areas but even when venturing around the city the cars dont necessarily turn into Nios or Li or Bogward.
They turn more into BYD and Great Wall of China or whatever the name is of that car manufacturer. These are cheap and easy to buy.
I cant speak for second and third tier cities but I would reckon it's the same with the cheap brands. But that's only a guess of mine.

I have seen shitloads of Lexus, Bugattis, RR and Bentleys. It's not like ppl cant afford a NIO or a Li. If you ask a Chinese Tesla or Nio? They will go Tesla 9 out of 10 times. Chinese just dont like to buy their own stuff if they can afford not to. And they can.

What you see drive around here a lot is BYD and other Chinese brands that fish in the lower priced end of the market. Here Chinese is king. Even in EV."

I would also love more serious EV companies like NIO to succeed, but from an investor perspective at the moment they are all priced as if they'll compete with the likes of Tesla and VW, even though none of them has managed the two biggest challenges of becoming an automotive company (getting to mass production and profitability) and they have a ton of other risks."
2021-05-25 09:14:16,stocks,"2% efficiency of what they could be at. VW, MB or Toyota are even lower. Their unit production per m2 is much lower than for Tesla's Gigafactories, and they haven't even built their first Gigafactory that includes every part of the process yet."

A split is done in hopes of getting more investors and then raising again their share price. A reverse split is not so encouraging because it is looked upon as the company is struggling to maintain compliance. Both are done strategically to help the company in the long run.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"I do a lot of trading for someone that identifies as a ""value investor."" Am I doing this investing thing incorrectly? Some context: I have a Roth (40% of portfolio), 401k (20%), and a taxable account (40%). 

Scenario #1) I like to keep my dividend and REIT stocks in the Roth. Typically, I'm looking for low PE and high yield (typically over 3%, but some in the 4-6% range). Anyway, I've seen a lot of these stocks appreciate significantly. In 2021 alone, I sold positions that appreciated 29%, 15%, and 18% respectively. My thought process was: I bought those stocks with the expectation to make $x return over the next y years in dividends. However, since the appreciation was so good, I hit that goal in just a few months. Sure, the dividends didn't change, but the yield did! So, now instead of getting 3% on my positions, I'm getting somewhere in the twos. Why stick around? So, I move out of those positions into others that can return 3% or more. 

Scenario #2) I try to minimize taxes in my taxable account. For example: A year ago, I had a huge loser. I didn't want to be in that position any more so I sold it. However, I didn't want that loss to go unrewarded so I also sold a winner. I bought the winner right back. The idea was to get a higher cost basis on that stock while still keeping it. This means when I actually sell it, I will pay less capital gains. Is this a good strategy? Or is there a better approach?"

> In a recent interview, Klaus Zellmer, Board Member responsible for Sales, Marketing and After-Sales at its passenger car division, said that if Volkswagen launches an autonomous service, it could charge vehicle owners 7 euros per hour and hit profitability. If the cars on its platform were to average 30 miles per hour, vehicle owners would pay 29 cents per mile for the autonomous service in addition to the 70 cents per mile to drive personally owned gas-powered cars today, the two costs summing to roughly $1 per mile. While less expensive than the average taxi today, according to ARK‚Äôs estimates robotaxis at scale will be priced profitably at only 25 cents per mile.

> Charging vehicle owners per hour is a telling go-to-market strategy for VW‚Äôs autonomous taxi platform. ARK believes that personal car ownership will dwindle, if not collapse, as autonomous taxi networks proliferate and prices drop to only 25 cents per mile. Rarely do taxi rides last an hour or more, suggesting that VW is likely to transition to a per mile price if its autonomous strategy meets with success.

> While it has had some false starts, Volkswagen now seems to be making strides in transitioning from a legacy auto manufacturer to a software enabled, autonomous electric future. ARK will continue to monitor VW‚Äôs progress.

Why is ARK Invest still emphasizing autonomous driving technology?

The bull case for Tesla (TSLA) has always been much stronger on the second-life energy storage front than on the autonomous driving technology front.  Only today is Tesla reconsidering its earlier rejection of lidar technology, but that's because there has been a credible embrace of it.

Tesla has made its bet with Luminar Technologies (LAZR) because [Volkswagen has embraced lidar technology and made its bet with Argo AI](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/naooit/electric_vehicle_volkswagen_embraces_lidar_for/).

Nonetheless, just like with Tesla, the [bull case for the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mnxdex/oops_dd_underestimated_volkswagen_by_2025_could/), is, in my opinion, much stronger on other fronts: scale, charging networks, bidirectional charging technology, the company's own planned foray into second-life energy storage, and so on.

*Disclosure: Long VWAGY and POAHY.*"
2021-05-24 22:17:05,stocks,"Pretty clear Tesla dismissed LIDAR because the sensors where expensive and admitting they would be needed when cost feasible would hinder Elon's ability to sell a FSD soon dream to everyone.

My guess is get a stripped system they will call ""Full Self Driving"" to avoid having to do retrofits. Then quietly start shipping cars with Lidar when it becomes cost effective.

Think of the millions they have made selling FSD to leased cars since 2016 and we are still no where close today."

You can‚Äôt have full autonomy with lidar.  lidar is a joke
2021-05-24 22:50:00,stocks,"Sigh, one should verify news before making decisions on it. Due Diligence and all.

TSLA isn't reconsidering LIDAR despite many claims that suggest they are. 

What is really going on, is that *TSLA has been using LIDAR to calibrate their vision range detection for years*, and someone took a picture of this setup. This means that every now and then they use a handful of LIDAR fitted Teslas to ensure the distance measurements that Autopilot/FSD are predicting are working accurately enough, and make any adjustments if needed to the system, so that they are working accurately enough. This doesn't imply they intend to start using LIDAR on the Teslas they sell.

Here is an article from 2016 that is also proposing that Tesla is going to be using LIDAR because it uses LIDAR for calibration, and stands by it's reporting even (after 5 years it seems to they still haven't moved to LIDAR):  
[https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated](https://www.thedrive.com/news/5804/elon-musk-may-be-secretly-planning-to-use-lidar-in-future-tesla-models-updated)

It has an official response from tesla (when they did have a PR department) at the end that reads:

>A spokesperson for Tesla responded with this statement: ""The claim that Tesla may be planning to use LiDAR as part of its self-driving hardware suite is fundamentally untrue. We regularly test our own technologies against other sensors to calibrate our camera, sonar and radar system.""

This is not anything new, it's probably something that's been done since they rejected LIDAR in the first place (if you are going to reject a sensor, verify that your system can do everything as well as if it had that sensor)."

Another major catalyst is Peloton. Peloton is losing money and making a lot of acquisitions, they have spent more than the $500 million (the cost of entire NLS which is profitable). If NLS crushes again, which they will! (The question is what traders do with the report) PTON should use their beefy valuation to make an acquisition which would be immediately accretive to earnings for PTON. PTON is losing money and NLS is making money hands over fists. 

**These are just some of the 1st Quarter 2021 and some 4th Quarter 2020 highlights.**

**1st Quarter of 2021 Net Sales Increased 120% to $206 million, the highest quarterly sales in company history Operating Income of $39.7 million is third-highest in company history EBITDA was $40.4 million compared to $2.3 million last year** 

**1st Quarter of 2021 Cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and available-for-sale securities were $113.2 million, an increase of $86.8 million, compared to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash of $26.5 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Debt was $13.6 million compared to $28.4 million as of March 31, 2020.**

**Fourth Quarter EBITDA improved by 578% to $40 million compared to same period last year**

**Fourth Quarter Operating Income of $41 million is the second highest since our founding in 1986**

**On a full year**

**Company Achieves Full Year Revenue Guidance by Growing Revenue 79% to $553 million**

**Full Year Operating Income was $78 million and Full Year EBITDA was $84 million (Wait a second at $17 this company trades at $525 million‚Ä¶.isnt that just 7x PE)**

So let us recap some of this here. This company which sells BowFlex, Schwinn and other brands is growing 120%, is making serious cash, had the best sales quarter in the company‚Äôs history and trades basically near 6PE. This past quarter was the 2nd most profitable quarter in its history after the 4th quarter of 2020. This has pulled back from $30 about 4-5 months ago after 2 amazing reports. You will not find 120% growth in profitable stocks. I understand that eventually maybe 2-4 quarters down the road the growth will slow. But the company has forecast this quarter at 50%....I believe that is modest..

Also, PTON is going to lose about $200 million because of their treadmill fiasco. NLS doesn‚Äôt have a fiasco, if anything PTON should plug that issue and make a purchase. PTON with BOWFLEX! The possibilities‚Ä¶

2021-05-24 22:07:00,stocks,"Peloton makes fitness equipment, Nautilus makes fitness equipment, so comparing them at a high level seems logical. But Peloton has positioned itself as a fitness social platform and lifestyle brand, whereas Nautilus is making tomorrow's yard sale items. It is an apples/oranges comparison.   

The closest competitors to what Peloton is trying to create in no particular order is: iFit/NordicTrack, Echelon, and Apple. You'll notice that only half of those even make equipment, and that is very intentional. Again: Peloton is a social platform and lifestyle brand, the physical equipment is almost *secondary*.   

I cannot guarantee that Peloton will continue to be the next big thing, but I totally understand the current valuations. Heck it could be the next Beats headphones as an Apple acquisition, they're basically an Apple clone already and Apple could roll them into Apple's new Fitness ecosystem seamlessly.   

PS - I am not, in any way, shitting on Nautilus. They still do what they've always done: Make equipment. They just now have competitors that are doing more/throwing out a larger net.   

PPS - On Nautilus's Schwinn brand's home page right now is a bike with the tag line: ""Designed To Work With The Peloton¬Æ App."" I rest my case."
2021-05-24 22:42:59,stocks,Peloton has a whole digital infrastructure built out on AWS. Peloton is massively overvalued but they saw huge popularity during the pandemic and now they‚Äôre essentially trying to buy growth and prevent competition through their acquisition strategy. Nautilus is pure brick and mortar. Very different companies but I can see why they‚Äôre worth comparing.

 All these people chasing any and all overpriced growth stocks might get burned real bad in the long run, meanwhile the profitable companies will dust off their scraped knees and buyback their entire float while unprofitable companies are SOL.

I always work out outside, and I'm a very active, very healthy person. Lots of my friends are the same. We all make fun of people who use things like Peloton products. So the actual value doesn't come from the workouts but the social media? To me, that sounds ridiculous and I don't get why they don't just use Instagram or whatever.

2021-05-25 16:16:28,stocks,"It‚Äôs a status symbol, like an iPhone. iPhone users have other, potentially better options, yet Apple is the largest company in the world due to the status symbol of owning an iPhone and customer loyalty.

I don‚Äôt believe people who are serious about exceecise are pelotons target market, but instead different groups of people. One group is either the working parent or stay at home mom who doesn‚Äôt have the time to or can‚Äôt just leave to go to the gym and need to squeeze something In. Another group is the people who ‚Äúwant‚Äù to work out but go in and out of having the motivation for it.  They think paying for an expensive bike and a subscription will get them to work out.  Or people just want to have ‚Äúfun‚Äù and be part of something ‚Äúpopular‚Äù. Hell, I even know many people who own different cheaper exercise equipment brands and have a subscription to peloton. The above describes every person I know with either a peloton or peloton subscription. 

Just because there are ‚Äúbetter‚Äù options for the serious active and healthy persons lifestyle doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs useless.  Honestly, what target market is larger? The us is known for having an obesity problem and everyone knows they need to exercise more.  And I am sure peloton is trying to figure out a way to wiggle their way into in person gyms as well to gather the more of the excercise market.  If someone is in the market for cardio equipment , the first place anyone is going to look is peloton."
2021-05-25 12:41:22,stocks,Just because you and your friends don't understand it doesn't mean your thesis is valid or logical lmao. Your personal anecdote is worth nothing
2021-05-25 15:51:18,stocks,"The market is saturated, but the way I see it is that Peloton is like Apple. I personally know people who love Peloton and would probably buy anything if it had Peloton branding. That is eerily similar to Apple. I remember when Apple was consistently making inferior products compared to Samsung and other Android phones and yet they sold out because of their loyal customers. 

On top of that, they also sell clothing. Owning Peloton product is a statement just like owning Apple product is a statement. One of the biggest reasons why Peloton hasn't been profitable is because of the massive amount of money they have put into marketing and development. They spend roughly 40-60% of their yearly revenue on marketing per year. They truly are positioning themselves to become the top of the line industry-standard company. 

If you're deciding to buy or sell Peloton stock based on the performance of yesterday and today, you are buying and selling the stock with the wrong intention. This is a long term hold, in my opinion this is the fitness version of getting into AAPL in the early generations of the iPhone. Peloton is a huge disruption in their industry when you take into account the full company and not just the production side of it. Like someone else said, other companies sell future yard-sale equipment. Peloton sells an experience, and if a person buys the bike and subscribes to their business model, it'll take 4 years to make the same gross revenue from their subscription as they did with the bike. I get that 4 years is a lot of time, but other companies aren't adding that kind of value to their product. Other companies bucks stop once the customer has purchased the equipment.

 Also something that no one really takes into account is that Peloton still has yet to **really** enter the commercial market. Gyms have yet to properly utilize Peloton to increase their customer base. Peloton has worked with some hotels, allowing guests to sign into their Peloton accounts on equipment in the hotel gyms. I can see a world in 5 to 10 years where most gyms offer some form of Peloton-specific gear/sections of the gym/classes"

It‚Äôs been amazing to have during COVID obviously, but I‚Äôll explain why I bought before lockdown.

‚Ä¢	In the winter where I live, it‚Äôs dark and probably raining (Seattle) by 5 PM so I‚Äôm not going to be working out outside for half the year, at least.
‚Ä¢	Going to a gym involves bringing clothes and gear to work with me and then adding at least some extra commute time to get to the gym before or after work, which I don‚Äôt need more of.  Said another way, if I want to get a half hour workout in at a gym then it will require a lot more time than a half hour to actually make it happen.  I‚Äôm busy and would rather wake up, bang out 30-45 minutes on the bike, and continue getting ready for work.
‚Ä¢	My company and many others in the area offer fitness subsidies to employees.  I get a $500 fitness subsidy per year but have to spend $1,000 for them to reimburse the $500.  With Peloton‚Äôs zero down, zero interest payment plan I can spread the cost over multiple years and my company will end up having paid for a significant portion of the bike.  Hard to spend $1,000 per year on fitness otherwise, unless you want to pay for classes that require commuting to.
‚Ä¢	I get a way better workout with an instructor than I would if I was just spinning on a stationary bike.

I‚Äôm sure my reasons don‚Äôt apply for everyone‚Äôs situations, but I will absolutely be using my Peloton for a long time.  All that said, the stock is overvalued lol"

&#x200B;

In bank accounts you get protections from the FDIC. In investing accounts you get protections through SIPC. These are things that help make sure you are protected, up a certain amount of money, if the financial institution goes under your assets are protected.

You don't have that with a Futures account.

Regulation is done through the CFTC, Commodity Futures Trading Commission. They regulate often through industry groups set up by commodity exchanges. They are are also more passive and provide a legal area where people make claims against each other on contracts. 

Futures are often leveraged. You can lose more than what you invest into it and they can get significantly risky. If something big happened in the market it is possible some couldn't pay their contract and there could be a shortage of money/run on money of futures account holders. 

I'd also note that financial futures trading is relatively new in the last few decades. Back in the '70s it was primarily for hedging for agricultural crops and mining operations, many of the regulations for the market have been established in the last few decades.

This means they haven't hammered out all the rules, not have they seen all the problems they might arise from financial futures trading during market conditions this trading hasn't been through yet.

A 3% dividend in a company atleast matching the gdp growth rate is infinitely better than a dying company paying a 7% dividend. Get both the price of the shares increasing and the dividend.

Edit: if you're willing to do homework, I always reccomend individual stocks. It's easier to just buy the etf, but you can just go to a dividend etf and pick out the companies that are still growing atleast the same rate as gdp."

Even prominent dividend investors from YouTube like Andrew Jikh are now pivoting away from having a dividend heavy portfolio.

Otherwise, if you are keen on dividends, research dividend aristocrats or go with a dividend ETF from Vanguard or Fidelity."

2021-05-25 14:41:31,stocks,"When you are young, you should be seeking safe stocks/ETF's because your experience is poor. Doesnt matter if they give a dividend though I would recommend it. When you are young, your goal is to learn, not to become an overnight slumdog. 

Dividends are nice because they give you a shot of cash to play with which encourages you to do more research (learn) and buy more stuff. Never use DRIPs when young (or ever if you plan to be active). Learn to do things yourself. Again, the goal between 18-30ish is to learn. For every slumdog there are 9 others who have to start over at 30. I recommend sticking to BKLC and VTI unless you actively learn about valuation and market history.

As you get older and wiser, thats when you should start taking more sophisticated positions. 30s is probably the right time (giver or take) because, odds are, you have faced at least one bear market and one inflated sector pump and dump by then and learned from it. If you havent, then stick to safety and be cautious. Time is on your side.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"$HTZGQ - PUT ALOT OF WORK INTO THIS DD, FINAL VALUE ESTIMATE  **Two things to start:**

1. I am not a financial advisor. What follows in my interpretation after doing much research and consulting with my broker. Consult yours before making any decisions.
2. I own 102,500 shares currently. I really don't care if they go up or down over the next few weeks. They will be worth the same regardless as I plan to hold until the Bankruptcy exit plan is concluded unless the price breaks $12.

**Now, what you came here for:** How much will I be paid for my shares of Hertz when Hertz executes its exit plan?

**There a 3 parts of the pay out:**

**1)** You will be paid $1.53 cash for each share, plus

**2)** Each shareholder will get an equity distribution on a prorated bases of 3% of the total purchase price of the entire company. Roughly $1.00 per share, plus

**3)** Then there are the warrants. A little complicated, but hope you follow. Exact wording from the agreement: ""Each Eligible Existing Hertz Shareholder, has the right, but not the obligation, subject to and in accordance with the Rights Offering Procedures, to be eligible to subscribe for up to one (1) Rights Offering Share per 0.9554 shares of Existing Hertz Parent Interests that it holds, at a purchase price of $10.00 per share, subject to the individual limits included in the calculations in Item 2 of this Subscription Form."" So for example on 100 shares you would get (100/.9554) = 104.6682018002931. Which becomes 104 warrants because all rounding is down downward. Each warrant can then be purchased for $10. Here is the tricky part. You can convert by exercising the warrant, or you can sell the warrant itself. For this example we are going to sell the warrant. And here is why nobody can give you a concrete answer because the value of the warrant is COMPLETE SPECULATION. For my example I am going to assume that the new Hertz, with its reduced debt structure and red hot rental market, will get back to a pre-pandemic level of $20 per share. So you could sell each warrant for a $10 profit. ($20 share price less the $10 warrant purchase.) *Just a note: HTZ traded for as high as $46/share in the good times, which is what the new HTZ will be entering. The good times. Low debt. Hot market.*

**So here is the math on 100 shares:**

1. $1.53 cash out (x) 100 = $153 **+**
2. $1.00 equity distribution (x) 100 = $100 **+**
3. 104 shares times $10 profit **=** $1040

Total income from you 100 shares would be $153 + $100 + $1040 = $1293. or **$12.93/share.**

If you currently owned the 100 shares for todays close price of $6.39 you investment is $639.

So staying it thru until the exit plan concludes and selling your warrants would net you $654 ($1293-$639).

**This is why I say I'm a bull on this stock. I believe that the total value of each HTZGQ share is really somewhere between $13-$20 per share. I will not sell unless the $HTZGQ crosses the $12 line before the exit plan is executed. Most estimates you see assume being able to modestly sell your warrants for about $15 per share. Which means a price of around $7-8 ($1.53+$1+$5 warrant profit=$7.53) is the total value. I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A SEVERE UNDERVALUE.**

***But regardless, lets just say that the $7-8 is the call. you have a more than 20% upside in the current price of $6.39.***

The only thing that is speculation is the end value. Somewhere between $7 and $30.

2021-05-24 20:34:32,stocks,"I think you just need to stop worrying about value vs growth. Dig into the actual company.  A company can be both if analyzed correctly. 

 I'll use INTC as an example.  Still strong in earnings,  pays dividend,  great balance sheet,  but the consensus is that they lost market share and will continue to do so.  The stock dropped. Nothing fundamentally bad about the company,  and they're reinvesting in increased manufacturing capacity,  facilities,  expanding in automotive etc. This is not only value,  but dropped into ""growth"" territory.  You can pay about 10x earnings,  3x book and 3x sales. Which is both value,  and you can't buy any peers growth for that cheap.  

Now I'm not saying go buy intc,  not was this the intent.  I used this as an example of how you can dig into everything about a company first,  look at the stock price last,  but rather than being caught up in value or growth,  find a fit for both."

We can use the Dow index as a measure of the broad value and cyclical stocks and Nasdaq for the growth/tech. The US economy is in full swing towards reopening and it‚Äôs rebound in the values is already being seen, with Dow being up 12% YTD and Nasdaq trailing by half the amount at 6% YTD.

If you ignore the outside noise,  and make a calculated decision,  there is nothing about the company that wouldn't make you buy.   Short term investors and Wall Street will always go for the flavor of the month or the quarter,  like tsm, Nvidia, amd. There's no margin of safety in those right now.  You also argued that they are positioning for execution 2-3 years... well isn't that why we invest? For the future growth? That shows they aren't going to lie down.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Just a trade idea. There could be a great opportunity in the mortgage sector. RKT, HMPT, LDI UWMC. Share thoughts, PROS, CONS? If you do not follow the mortgage sector, RKT is the market leader and reported earnings just 2 weeks ago. Their report was a miss by a penny but still made close to 2 billion dollars as a company. When RKT missed the entire sector dropped drastically. The main stocks that crashed were LDI, HMPT and UWMC. I strongly believe RKT was the culprit. Famous for being short as high as 35% just a quarter ago. I believe the sharks were still nearby and ready. The short % has not been updated since earnings and is at 7%. I believe the new short is once again at 20% or above. The very next day following earnings the rest of the sector has been attacked. The difference with these companies and most stocks, especially tech/growth is they all make serious, serious money!

**LDI makes close to 1 billion a year, just made over 300 million. Announced a special dividend of 200 million or 62 cents a share. They announced a regular dividend per share. The market cap is slightly over 4 billion. Yes, they have a PE ratio of under 4! Cash flows to buy back shares instead of using money for dividends. They have lost over 1.2 billion in market cap since RKT report.**

**HMPT just made 149 million the past 3 months. They have lost over 500 million in market cap since RKT reported. They have not announced a dividend or anything yet. The company trades at 2.5x earnings. They make cash!**

**UWMC, did the right thing makes cash and announced a 300 million buyback. I believe they have smoked out the shorts as it dipped as low as 6.25 and has recovered nicely.**

**RKT makes roughly 8 billion a year! They are valued near 35 billion and have lost over 14 billion since earninings! They last quarter gave out over 2 billion for free via a special dividend of over 1.14 per share. They have 2 billion shares! They make over $4 per share and trade under 17!!!**

LDI trades 200,000 shares daily! The stock is under 14!! Can you imagine a 100 million buyback?? They are giving 100 million via dividend and just gave 200 million special dividend they can do it!

HMPT trades just over 100,000 shares at about 6! Even a 20 million buyback will moon the stock. They just made 149 million the last 3 months!

Good luck everyone. Happy trading!"

2021-05-25 17:12:03,stocks,"**Avoid.**

Are you trying to make a quick buck, in it for the short term, or long term investor?  

**RKT** came into focus a few months ago when it came out that it was being targeted by short-sellers ($24/sh).  The CEO took the strong arm position that he was going to go against them and the stock responded positively (due to GME being in the news then).  This was prior to earnings, and even CNBC commented on it compliments of Cramer IIRC ($28/sh)

A few days later it went back down to it's prior price point ($25/sh), and though earnings were positive, it continued to decline.  Now $16/sh.

It's basically under attack and as many saavy investors recognize, short-sellers are betting against the company for a reason.

In that business, you make money from the interest (as a lender, compliments of amortization), origination and other fees as a service provider.  

Interest rates declining incentivize people to refinance a mortgage, or to move to a new home (property tax caps be forgotten).  This means greater profits when rates are decreasing.  

Interest rates have no more room to go down, and people are going to hold on to their mortgage rates (0.5% to 0.75% difference) meaning amortization plays a role in favor of the borrower.  

Millennials have been adverse to buying homes, preferring to rent.  Builders in large cities have accommodated this trend as well.  Evictions have held off and affordable housing coming into a larger role the last few years.

Long term investors like Mr. Buffett have exited the financials market (e.g. WFB) which include lenders.  Back to that original question, what kind of investor are you?

I remember WAMU and Countrywide.  Today it's dominated by Quicken and a dozen years back it was another lender (forgot the name) and it'll be different a dozen years from now.

Anyhow, I'd avoid the entire mortgage / lender sector:

* Refinancing decreases when rates are low, or increasing
* COVID has impacted income for many people
* Evictions on hold, but now that they can be relaxed, expect people to exhibit poor credit
* Preference for renting in city-centers versus buying in the 'burbs.

But hey, that's me.  I'd love some data for someone to convince me otherwise."

2021-05-25 01:34:58,stocks,"I think there's probably good trades to be had, and these all are probably an ok long term investment. UWMC is my favorite and I too think 10 dollars is a fair, I hold some in my retirement account. In my trading account its been one of my best trades to date, and I do like the company. So this is not meant to be overly negative because they have a few great things going for them. but the industry as a whole is predicting a major draw down. Both Rocket and UWMC have outlined this in their earnings calls. Both of these companies make most of their money from refinances and both note and estimate significantly less earnings in 2022. Go look at their 2019 earnings compared to 2020. I'm convinced they saw the writing on the wall and saw it as a great time to go public. Smart move.

>**UWM originated $42.6 billion in refinance volume during 4Q20, as compared to $20.3 billion in 4Q19. UWM originated $139.6 billion in refinance volume in FY20 and $57.9 billion in FY19. UWM‚Äôs 2020 production mix was comprised of 76% refinance and 24% purchase.**

UWMC also pushed away \~500 of \~12000 brokers with their ultimatum, and who knows if that number will trend upward as more loan officers and companies get annoyed by being held hostage. Imagine if their client gets quoted a better rate from Rocket, as a loan officer their job is to deliver affordable, good loans, and if they cant use them to service the needs of a client, it would be pretty shitty spot to be in. I think in the long term this will be fine, but in the short term I think it was a bit short sighted. Great tech, industry leading close times, their slice of the mortgage pie is growing yoy but with some unfortunate turmoil short term (Market draw door, 500 less lenders working with them, etc)"

Do your own research of course but just keep those two things in mind because they are indicators of a financial crisis just like what happened in 2008. Mortgages defaulting and heavy sales of mortgage back securities are a recipe for disaster. This is the major con in my opinion. Secondly stock prices are set to drop when collateral is called in. Since big firms own lots of these stocks because they are seen as relatively safe there will be a sell off.

2021-05-25 09:38:35,stocks,"Bear in mind RKT has a very high retention rate for it‚Äôs sector. Most clients who purchase with RKT will refinance with RKT. 

Cash-out refinance is also RKT‚Äôs bread & butter, which is looking pretty sexy considering all the consumer debt and home value increases. I used to write those loans, they were absolute no-brainers and RKT‚Äôs target market is definitely laden with consumer debt. RKT retail bankers are going to be calling everyone‚Äôs ditzy aunt and uncle to get the credit card debt out of high interest accounts and into the mortgage. You wave $200+ savings/month at someone and they will be hard pressed to say no.

Then consider RKT‚Äôs residential product is priced 1-2 points higher than its competitors, these guys do it all for the volume, because as we all know they get paid the crumbs of the origination volume. 

This RKT thing isn‚Äôt over yet. They have so many leads and the lead flow is so insane. Not to mention a bunch of mortgages are still in the money. For whatever reason, not everyone qualifies for a refinance, it takes a couple of tries for some borrowers. Those borrowers are RKT‚Äôs safety net. 

If you‚Äôve ever been called by a RKT banker, you know exactly what I‚Äôm talking about"

Right now everyone is just sitting in place because there‚Äôs no chair for them to move to. It‚Äôa actually bullish for the mortgage sector because more purchase loans will be written.

Also I‚Äôm sure you know this but lenders are obligated to give options to their clients. Don‚Äôt ask me know I know this but I‚Äôve seen some of these covid cases (12+ missed payments) go into a 40 year loan mod at market rates (~3%). Now I‚Äôm pretty sure that‚Äôs just an FHA thing but lenders make a lot less off those loans than say, 15yr fixed 2.375%. Remember the investor gets the cake, in slices every month, while lenders get the crumbs. Those slices have been getting a lot smaller.. less crumbs 

But when the lender is proactively reaching out to their clients on a weekly basis to get them signed up for those sorts of loans, while it‚Äôs great from a public housing and fiduciary perspective, and might end up with a few referrals, it‚Äôs not so good for the bottom line.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Virgin Galactic II. Initially, I wanted to come into this post completely unbiased, I wanted to present the bull and bear case and give you a complete overview of sentiment and questioning from both camps, but I couldn‚Äôt help myself. Let me say it out loud, SPCE has an argument to make, I‚Äôm here to answer the 3 harshest criticisms that I have heard from the easiest to most difficult. No company or stock out there is a guarantee, I am not here to sell SPCE, it is still high risk as before, but that‚Äôs the nature of space exploration isn‚Äôt it‚Ä¶

Critique #1 - Revenue:  The company has millions in cash, enough to continue burning for 2 years. They plan to generate income via paying customers, astronaut training, low orbit cargo/experiment carry assignments, transportation offerings, sponsorship, and more. If this company doesn‚Äôt see future earning possible, why would they move forward to build more ships? Why would they hire more staff? Why would there be 3+ other companies wanting to eat into their market share?? 

Critique #2 - The Competition: ‚ÄúSpaceX and Blue Origin are going to eat the market, leaving SPCE with zero-to-little gains.‚Äù

 \#Debunked:  Let‚Äôs start with the elephant in the room, SpaceX, Elon Musk has presented concepts for SN high-speed point to point travel, getting anyone from NYC to Shanghai in 4 hours, that sounds wonderful at first but let me tell you 3 points on why this is out of touch. 1. Have you heard the noise created by a SN ship? Do you think that could take off near or within NYC and all its resident would be fine with a bomb like take off? This means they cannot be anywhere near a major city, you would have to travel to a remote place to get on the supposed fast flight‚Ä¶ 2 Boarding this ‚Äúfast flight‚Äù requires a suit up, when you get into space launch, you must train to do this, you must wear an astronaut suit, the concept of just passing through security and into your flight seat as a casual experience is unfathomable for the next few years, it‚Äôs not going to happen, flights from NYC to Paris cannot happen within minimal hours without so many other factors getting in the way of that time convenience...not in a rocket at least. #3 What is the main objective of SpaceX? Definitely not a relatively small market like space tourism, SpaceX is dealing with developing a system of launch logistics that rival shipping and train systems, they have been assigned to provide a lunar lander, they have the opportunity to secure the largest and most lucrative of satellite launches, and they have tight deadlines if they want to deliver the promise of making humans live on Mars, there is so much more and simply far too important of assignments that SpaceX has in front of it to pivot and go after a smaller market segment like fun filled space tourism. Now let‚Äôs talk about Blue Origin, this is VGs biggest rival as of today, but BO is clearing behind SPCE. BO was started with the purpose of getting to the moon and making humans multi-planetary via space hotels, this vision has faded off as of late. BO was in competition with SpaceX for lunar missions and lost coveted contracts to SpaceX, the only reason why BO is in space tourism is because it could not meet its original goals, it‚Äôs now pivoting out of necessity, a company mission statement is important, and BO is confused and lost. The experience that they are offing is lesser than what SPCE is proposing, their ergonomics, standard up and down flight experience, the aesthetics of the ship interior and exterior are all subpar in comparison to SPCE. They don‚Äôt have an airport to take off from‚Ä¶I could go on all day. VG is founded by Richard Branson, a man with a lifelong experience in hospitality, entertainment, and travel markets, BO is founded by a man who found the cheapest way to ship boxes and cancel mom and pop stores forever, if you pay any attention to the staff of a company before you invest, VG is a no brainer. VG has a CEO and upper level staff with experience in Disney, BO has upper management with experience in mechanical systems‚Ä¶.are you noticing a pattern?‚Ä¶.

Critique #3 - Death:  I‚Äôve read the comments ‚Äúthis is a disaster waiting to happen‚Äù, ‚Äúthey will get canceled when thy kill somebody‚Äù‚Ä¶.for the record, this is a great critique and justified concern, death of a client would be both heartbreaking for VG and a setback. To answer this we must look no further than other transportation and extreme entertainment industries. Let me ask you, has anyone died on a plane, in a car crash, a motorcycle, perhaps skydiving?...certainly if a death occurs on an SPCE flight due to a crash VG will have legal corners covered.

.....

I do not have a crystal ball, I do not offer financial advice. I just wanted to share because I hear the arguments over and over, anyone out there who is taking interest, now you know, SPCE is real. This company is a retail favorite, love it or hate it, we are all unable to look away‚Ä¶ in an era of pent-up travel demand, the roaring twenties can only be ushered in by something as lavish as SPCE, whatever your take, wish them luck.

.....

NOTE: The wealthy pay 50,000+ to scale Mount Everest every year, (Everest is cold, physically demanding, and utterly dangerous) why would they not regularly pay for SPCE?

NOTE: The cost to fly to space was over a million just years ago, VG can fly you up for 250k."

2021-05-24 20:13:53,stocks,"Rebuttal #1: They have no revenue right now. Why are they building more spaceships? Even if they weren't confident about their future, what other choice do they have? They could just return all the money to shareholders, but have you ever seen an organization do that? It isn't that simple. Board members that don't think they can accomplish the task would make more money by liquidating their stock at the current price -- which some have.

Rebuttal #2: You are right that SpaceX is in a different market. They can go orbital, which is cooler and lasts longer than 5 minutes -- but currently costs 10s of millions per seat. They will need starship to bring that down but if they can -- at similar prices, SPCE has no way of competing against that.

BO is on the trajectory of doing orbital, but they currently have a comparable suborbital experience to SPCE and it's going to happen roughly at the same time (first paying customer in the summer). The existence of this will reduce SPCEs margins and market share.

I'm not quite sure there will be enough people interested in a mid-6 digit cost 5-minute experience. Everyone is handwaving here. Even if there is, SPCE has an uphill battle in getting the cadence and margins up because of it's 6 passenger-per-flight model an hybrid engine. And it's not easy to scale for the future given SPCE's mothership-spaceship design."

With that you can value the stock. Assume that everything goes well,  what number of dollars are they going to bring in every year?

Compare all this to spce's plane model. Anyone can get on a plane and just strap in to enjoy the ride. The market share BO would steal is negligent if they even manage to get any share at all.

2 Key Things From 3D Systems' Earnings Call That Investors Should Know | NASDAQ

Earlier this month, 3D Systems (NYSE: DDD reported first-quarter 2021 results that easily beat the Wall Street consensus estimates for both revenue and earnings. The stock skyrocketed 35% the next day.

In the first quarter, the 3D printing company's revenue rose 7.7% year over year (and 17% excluding the impact of divestitures to $146.1 million. Growth was driven by continued strength in the healthcare segment and a stabilizing of the industrial segment, which was hard hit by the fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic.


Moreover, the company posted a profit on both an adjusted basis and according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Adjusted for one-time items, net income landed at $20.9 million, or $0.17 per share, up from a loss per share of $4.5 million, or $0.04 per share, in the year-ago period. GAAP net income was $45.2 million, or $0.36 per share, up from a loss of $18.9 million, or $0.17 per share, in the first quarter of 2020.

Earnings releases tell only part of the story. Following are two key things from 3D Systems' Q1 earnings call that investors should know.

1. The company's competitive advantages
From CEO Jeffrey Graves' remarks:

There are three things that inspire my confidence in our future. And I believe they should inspire yours as well. First, we clearly by far have the broadest technology portfolio in the industry. [...] Second, I'm convinced that we have the brightest and most creative application engineers in the industry. [...]

Third, as one of the largest and most experienced companies in the industry, we have the scale and the infrastructure to not only support our customers' needs when they initially implement additive manufacturing, but also sustain them over the lifetime of their equipment by providing key services and consumables that are vital to their ongoing business success.

As to Graves' first point, 3D Systems does have the broadest offerings in the 3D printing industry in terms of technology to my knowledge, at least among publicly traded companies. It has several polymer technologies and at least one metal 3D printing technology.

For a couple of points of comparison: Rival Stratasys (NASDAQ: SSYS, another well-established pure-play 3D printing company, doesn't have a metal 3D printing technology. Newly public Desktop Metal (NYSE: DM is just in the early stages of commercializing its metal technology and only recently expanded into polymers via its February acquisition of EnvisionTEC.

His second point about having ""the brightest and most creative application engineers"" is too subjective to address.

I'll also agree with Graves' third point about 3D Systems having a scale and experience advantage, at least relative to most other players. That said, there's a caveat here. Under the prior two CEOs, the company prematurely released products that had quality issues. So, while scale does usually provide various advantages, it won't do so if customers are hesitant to buy a product from a company due to concerns about quality. Hopefully, this issue is largely behind 3D Systems, but investors still need to keep an eye on it.

2. Ramping up its healthcare business organically and through acquisitions
From Graves' remarks:

As you can see in our numbers for Q1, we're seeing rising demand for new applications, particularly in our healthcare business. To meet this demand forecast, we're expanding our Denver, Colorado, location by roughly 50%. [...] Through this next phase of investment [...] we'll be able to reduce time to market for new medical applications, continue expanding our product offerings, and better support the holistic needs of our growing healthcare customer base.

In Q1, 3D Systems' healthcare revenue surged 39% year over year to $72.5 million. This segment accounted for 49.6% of the company's total revenue of $146.1 million. So its business is now essentially evenly split between healthcare and industrial.

As Graves said on the prior quarter's call, the company's healthcare business ""brings a bit higher gross margin on average than our industrial business."" So, naturally, it makes great sense to focus somewhat more on applications that are more profitable.

In addition, 3D Systems announced several days before it released its Q1 results that it had acquired Allevi, a small Philadelphia-based bioprinting company. Bioprinting refers to using 3D printing technology to print animal and human cells to produce three-dimensional, functional tissues. This was a smart move and expands the company's involvement in this space, as it's been collaborating with United Therapeutics (NASDAQ: UTHR in this realm since 2017.

Graves said one key intermediate-term application of bioprinting is to help pharmaceutical companies speed up the drug development process. A longer-term goal of those working in this space is to print fully functional solid human organs such as the liver, heart, and kidneys for transplant purposes. Regenerative medicine, as it's often called, is in its infancy, but it has humongous growth potential.

‚Ä¢ I sold 5 of my shares when the price hit $186.

‚Ä¢ My remaining 5 shares in the market showed a new ""cost"" of $1190 which didn't make any sense to me. I expected the new cost to be $880 -- Cost of $1810 - \[5 shares\]\*\[$186 sell price\] = $880. 

‚Ä¢ I then bought 5 shares back when the price hit $178 leaving $40 in my cash account. 

‚Ä¢ My new cost is $2080 for all 10 shares. So a $208/share cost average.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, May 24, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, May 24, 2021**

After weeks of volatility, stocks rallied today as fears over rising inflation forcing the Federal Reserve to tighten monetary policy tempered. As I have said for weeks, there are several reasons I thought the initial reaction to the April Consumer Price Index, which saw the S&P 500 (SPY) lose 4% in three trading days, was overdone and I am glad to have taken advantage of the dip particularly in technology stocks. The SPY closed 1.01% and is only 3 points away from its all-time high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) closed 1.68% higher and the Dow Jones (DIA) closed .56% higher. 

As the US economy reopens, we are seeing a surge in consumer spending (we saw a 10.8% increase in spending in March), supply is having a hard time catching up to rising demand, which of course, causes a rise in prices. As the economic reopening continues and supply in various consumer industries is able to catch up, inflation is expected to slow down. In a nutshell, this is why Jerome Powell and other monetary officials consistently refer to current inflationary pressures ‚Äútransitory‚Äù.

Moreover, while the market was shaken by the April Consumer Index, as has been reiterated in the recap before, the Federal Reserve has consistently said they are looking towards significant progress in the labor market before any significant adjustments to monetary policy are considered. In the Federal Reserve‚Äôs April meeting minutes, ‚Äúparticipants generally noted that the economy remained far from the Committee‚Äôs maximum-employment and price-stability goals‚Äù.  Jerome Powell and other monetary officials have reiterated several times that they want to see a ‚Äústring‚Äù of strong labor reports before major adjustments to policy are considered. The April Job Reports showed only 266,000 jobs added back to the economy, widely missing analyst expectations and marking a sharp deceleration in job growth from March, bolsters that argument.

On a slightly sour note, the meeting minutes also said a number of participants suggested‚Äù that as the economy continues to quickly, ‚Äúit might be appropriate at some point in upcoming meetings to begin discussing a plan for adjusting the pace of asset purchase‚Äù, which have currently been going at a rate of $120 billion per month. However, it‚Äôs important to note the meeting toke place before the release of the April Jobs report, which greatly bolsters Powell and other monetary officials' argument that the labor market remains below the Fed‚Äôs targets and roughly 8.2 million jobs short compared to pre-pandemic times. onth. However, this is not a surprising statement and one Powell himself has said before. Back in an April 14 meeting, Powell said, ‚ÄúWe will reach the time at which we will taper asset purchases when we have made substantial further progress towards our goals from last December. That would in all likelihood be before, well before, the time we would consider raising interest rates. We have not voted on that order but that is the sense of the guidance.‚Äù As a reminder, quantitative easing is a process in which the Fed buys government bonds in order to inject money into the economy. It is only natural that as the economy recovers, less money needs to be injected into the economy in this manner. The Federal Reserve gave absolutely no signal it was even considering beginning discussion on raising interest rates, which is what market participants are really concerned about. [Read the entire meeting minutes here](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20210428.pdf)

Michael Jones, CEO of Caravel Concepts said, ‚ÄúI do think it's been a pretty healthy sideways chop. It's taken out some of the speculative excess. The biggest pullbacks have been in some of the most pricey names. That all feels very healthy to me.‚Äù

**Highlights**

* The court case between Epic Games and Apple (AAPL) s expected to end this week as both sides prepare closing arguments. As a reminder, Epic Games is accusing Apple of antitrust behavior by taking a 30% commission from sales in the app store and blocking companies from using third-party payment options. Apple says it prevents third-party software to ensure consumer protection and the commission is in-line with other app-store developers, like Alphabet. The result of this case will have very wide ranging implications.
* Amazon (AMZN) is reportedly nearing a deal to buy the Hollywood studio MGM for roughly $9 billion, in a deal that would turn the movie studio into a streaming asset for AMZN. According to people familiar with the matter, a deal could close as soon as next week.
* Investors have rejected a record number of executive compensation plans in non-binding votes of U.S.-listed companies this year, objecting to pay rises and the easing of performance targets in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, according to an analysis by consulting firm ISS Corporate Solutions. I hope this trend continues moving forward and urge shareholders to continue voting no on potential compensation plans. A record 14 S&P 500 companies had more than 50% of investors reject executive pay packages so far this year. 
* Ford Motor Co said on Monday its new electric F-150 Lightning Pro for commercial customers would be available at a starting price of $39,974.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Let's talk dry powder real quick. If I'm expecting the market to decrease over the next few months (or year), how much dry powder is typical for the educated investor.

Let's keep it simple. Say I have $100k in the market as we speak. I have like $2k in cash within the account. I'm not going to bring outside cash into this equation. If I'm betting on a downturn and I want to store up some dry powder to start buying dips incrementally (as to not catch falling daggers) and to just expand my powder systematically a bit at a time. How much in cash should my ""dry powder"" tentatively be?

Compared to my current ratio of 98k invested and 2k cash, should I liquidate some positions and go to like an 80/20 ratio...70/30....60/40....etc.

Like I keep hearing that it would be smart to have some dry powder on the side as rates, inflation, supply chain issues, etc, etc, etc make the market volatile. We'll, I know everyone has a different opinion, but no one even mentions what their ratio is and why...

Right now I'm practically fully vested. But I'm debating on cashing out some positions and holding it in cash for upcoming Q3-Q4 plays (or even beyond). I'm really trying to avoid timing the market (even though this is what I'm technically doing), but what's the ""average"" cash position ratio if people are taking the ""dry powder"" route...?

But the anti-trust argument to split up Amazon seems like a weak one to me.  Why/how are they a monopoly? Because people buy anything retail from their online stores? Ebay and Alibaba are two big boy competitors in ecommerce. But perhaps the argument is specifically about brick and mortar stores? Walmart and Costco are going nowhere, in fact they're both just getting bigger. So Amazon has lots of healthy competition in the (e)commerce space. 

And how about AWS/cloud? Now, this is an area they truly are dominant in, with respect to market share. But with Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and Alibaba Cloud being great alternatives I don't see the monopoly argument here either.

If the current share price is $4000 and they do a 4:1 split so each share is $1,000 I can now buy 4 shares with the $4,000 I had planned on using to buy 1 share.

If Amazon does a dividend after the share split I get paid more cus I hold more shares since dividends are paid out based on how many shares you have, so yeah, fuck off if you don‚Äôt understand that.

Also it‚Äôs not ‚Äúcompound interest‚Äù it‚Äôs ‚Äúdividend reinvestment‚Äù you‚Äôre thinking of. There‚Äôs no interest to compound for stocks. Use the right terms before trying to sound like you know what you‚Äôre talking about."

Now that you understand that we will go to the next point. Do you really think that, when a stock splits, that the dividend per share is kept the same or is that split into 4 as well? Did you see apples dividend go from 1% to 4% when they did the stock split? Or was it still 1% per share? Hint: it stayed the same percentage. Finally, I used the term compound interest because that's the true strength of dividends (reinvesting them). I assumed you understood that but that was before I knew you didnt understand how dividends operate when a stock splits. You really thought youd get 4x the dividends haha what a guy"
2021-05-25 16:17:21,stocks,"Are you really this stupid? I never said you get 4x the dividend but you end up with more shares which equate to more dividends as time goes by.

Jesus Christ. And why are you using 3.9k as an example? If you have 3.9k you can‚Äôt afford a single share of Amazon. And post split you‚Äôd be able to afford 3 so yes ‚Äú.75 of a pre-split stock‚Äù but what does that even matter?"
2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Apple Stock Analysis: Is AAPL a good buy? Hey there guys, I just started analyzing stocks more and I thought I¬¥ll try to do that and post it here. That¬¥s my first analysis that I post anywhere. If you have any feedback for me that would be great and highly appreciated. If you have questions feel free to ask, I¬¥ll try to answer everything. 

&#x200B;

Today we will look through the basics of Apple¬¥s business and then see if we can come up with a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock using discounted free cashflow. 

This is not financial advice and I personally own shares in Apple. Nevertheless I will try to stay as unbiased and objective as I can.

First let¬¥s review their different revenue streams. Their biggest stream, around **50%** of their sales comes from the **iPhone**. The **Mac** makes up around **11%**, the **iPad** around **9%**, **Services** around **19%** and **Wearables, Home and Accessories** around **11%**. 

For the valuation: 

We take **analyst estimates**, we discount that by our **required return of 8%**. Then we use the **perpetual growth rate of 2,5%** and that gave us a fair value for Apple¬¥s stock of **$90 per share**. But because we have to account for **Apple¬¥s debt** as well, our **fair value of equity** would be **$86 per share**.

Now feel free to include a margin of safety to that. 

Because Apple¬¥s price is higher right now, I don¬¥t think buying more is a good idea. Although you can always dollar-cost-average. That¬¥s where you invest every month the same amount.

Where I see Apple¬¥s stock price in 5 years. We can calculate where the price might be in 5 years with the **Earnings Per Share (EPS TTM)**, the **Estimated Growth Rate** and the **Future P/E Value**. With this method I get a stock price of **$242 per share** which is higher than what it is now. 

What I¬¥ll do. I believe in Apple. I think they will stay for a long time and innovate even more. That¬¥s why, although the price is not where I would want it to be, I will continue to **dollar-cost-average**. That way I don¬¥t mind the volatile market and hold for the longterm. 

Thank you for reading and I hope I¬¥ll see you again."

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Can someone explain the inflation worry when the banks have excess liquidity? If banks have an excess amount of liquidity and the fed is trying to get people to spend money, why would the fed raise interest rates and make it more beneficial for people to hold onto their money? To me it only makes sense to drop interest rates to the negatives so people are forced to spend money or lose it. People aren‚Äôt going to spend money when commodity prices are high, so deflation would also prove to be beneficial for the economy IMO.        

How does increased interest rates cause more spending when all it does is cause commodities to go up and force more people to spend significantly less? Negative interest rates are also something that will boost retail growth as retail businesses will be able to borrow money at a negative rate and pay their employees a higher wage to get their business started/back running.       

If I‚Äôm not mistaken, back when Europe was in a negative rate environment, didnt Powell say he would consider negative rates when America is trying to reopen?       

Can someone ELI5 it for me? What exactly am I missing and what was the historical trend it follows outside of a Black Friday crash and 1970s inflation? ‚ÄúIf‚Äù something extreme weren‚Äôt going to happen, what do you think would be the most likely outcome?"
2021-05-25 04:17:07,stocks,"It's already very easy to borrow.  They're not engaging in negative interest rates, but they are engaging in quantitative easing, which means buying up assets apart from just US treasuries.  These operations are at $120B per month right now, which is huge. 

In my understanding negative interest rates have never been implemented in the US, and politically I'm not sure how viable they would be. Interest rates are already very low, just not negative.

As for why they might raise rates, you have to keep in mind that the Fed has a dual mandate: full employment, and stable price levels. The point of lowering rates and QE is precisely what you said: stimulating the economy, making borrowing easier and hopefully creating jobs.  

You can't just engage in QE forever, however.  QE is basically printing money, because the Fed buys assets with money it creates electronically.  If they create too much money and there's too much of it sloshing around in the economy, then this raises prices on goods and services, which is inflation.

The general economic consensus is that some inflation (generally 2%, but even 4%) is good because it's better to have an excess of money than not enough.  This facilitates growth.  

However, more than that is a problem because prices start to become unreliable.  With 10% inflation something that cost you $100 last year would cost you $110 today, which is significant.  People don't know how to price things which leads to confusion and a lost of faith in the dollar.

So the Fed is playing a balancing act of stimulating the economy and thus creating jobs, while at the same time trying not to go overboard and keeping price levels steady.  Remember, this is their dual mandate.

With Covid the concern is actually *deflation*, because production and spending have been gutted, causing prices to fall.  That's why they're still engaging in QE and encouraging some inflation... they want to bring the economy back to full employment and health. 

There are some fears that they may be running a bit hot and inflation will cause them to need to raise rates sooner rather than later."

The point of buying now with deflation is the low interest rates and low commodity prices, knowing that inflation is around the corner once the demand stabilizes. I think the point of not buying during an inflationary environment is the high interest rate of borrowing, and the high returns from saving.

I want to follow a ""safe"" strategy of essentially investing the majority of my funds into ""the market"" and trying a mixed strategy of growth and dividends; I've been doing this by putting the majority of my investment in ETFs such as VTI, SPY, QQQ, SPYD, SDIV and NOBL with the heavier investments being VTI, SPY and QQQ. I do have some individual stocks but the majority of my savings are going to the funds already mentioned.

I am second guessing my strategy as I feel I'm being redundant by investing in many ETFs that track of he same holdings.

I'm in my early thirties, have a house, no debt, and a job with a good 401K which I'm already maxing out.

Should I consolidate into two or three of these?"
2021-05-24 20:33:51,stocks,"It‚Äôs ok if they overlap for a reason. Just be sure why and know what difference you‚Äôre adding.

This, or something similar, is a common portfolio.  Say you‚Äôre younger and you want to be slightly more aggresssive and by more growth stocks over value, you can add more in QQQ to achieve that. Get more returns, with more risk, when you don‚Äôt have to worry about a crash nearing retirement.

Even though SPY and VTI have many of the same holdings, it also has much more and lots of value stocks, so by adding 5-15% QQQ you‚Äôre increasing your exposure to more tech and growth stocks. It‚Äôs more volatile, but generally grows faster.

So instead of thinking of it as overlap, I‚Äôm using it to make my portfolio a little more risky beyond the S&P 500.

But if that was your intention, you don‚Äôt really need NOBL. That‚Äôs a lower risk, lower return fund. On the flip side‚Ä¶. Say you keep $20k in your savings account, but want to be able to access another  $40k in safer assets in your investment nets for bad years where there is a crash and lost of a job, the. You might choose to make $40k in investments in bond and low risk equity ETFs, and then everything over $40k follows the strategy you want.

What you could do is buy more small caps and mid caps. I like to keep 10-20% in small and midcaps. The Russell 2000 and the S&P 400 are indexes that will accomplish this. Mid caps over long periods have outcompeted the S&P 500, but tends to be more volatile.

Another thing you can consider is getting SPYG and SPYV instead of SPY and you can balance your own ratio between growth and value stocks. You‚Äôll have to rebalance them over time when one grows more than the other."

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Need opinion on my ETF and how it would hold up during a stock crash due to fed raising rates. The ticker is INFL. It is supposed to take advantage of inflation. I think inflation is going to be way worse than we think. Is this a good bet? I been in it two months. 
But now I am wondering how this will hold up in a stick market crash when institutional investment moved to bonds due to the fed raising rates to 2% to stop inflation. Do just the bad stocks go down and the stocks that are not effected by inflation go up? Or do all stocks go down?

I'm just wondering if this is a good bet for high inflation and high interest rates"
2021-05-24 20:55:28,stocks,He said he was making a bet. No one knows what will happen. Not even the PhD economists at the fed. They've said they will change their policy if inflation turns out to be persistent and they're.juat going to follow the data. I agree with jpowell and I think inflation will be transitory but that's just a projection. We have to wait to see what happens.
2021-05-24 21:01:31,stocks,"All stocks will go down if rates are raised. The PE multiple will contract. In a high inflationary environment money now is worth significantly more than money later. So stocks demand a higher discount value. Prices come down and expected/demanded yields go up. 

But once the crash happens it would be a good time to buy. The expected yield will cause asset prices to inflate at a higher rate.

It's kind of confusing. Why would prices come down if everyone knows prices will go up? It's the time value of money. Money now becomes worth a lot more than money later. 

Not to mention many companies may go bankrupt if they can't afford to borrow debt at high rates."

2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"Learned that in option trading, trimming your contracts or taking 10% profit is still profit. I'm not that big of a risk taker onto holding my contracts for too long. But sometimes taking 10% profit or when you see the stock just rising. You can trim it 50%. Then if you see  it going down slightly you can take 100% profit. So you reduce the amount of risk and also being patient onto when you want to make a call or a put throughout the day. Knowing the charts also reduces the risks.

Making $10,$50,$100 a day. Still adds up on total gains for yourself."

2021-05-24 20:41:43,stocks,Lock in short term taxes on every dollar of gain! Sweet!! /s
2021-05-24 23:16:23,stocks,Usually I look at the chart then pick my position that is appealing and give it a 1-5 hour timeframe or if the stock started jumping I would trim it. But I would risk it like. It went up 40% then I would still hold it? Well I wouldn't tbh because it's just too much risk to hold it the next day.
2021-05-24 21:24:43,stocks,"But I was up by some percentage I randomly chose, so I cashed out! Then immediately bought something else with it, thus putting those same dollars at risk all over again. Why have money invested in something going up when I can just move it to something that's not going up?

I know you're not expecting me to buy something else that's also going up. That'd just be taking on some other guy's 10% gainer, and as previously discussed, we sell those.

Maybe the real trick is have a buddy system.  I'll buy something and when it goes up 10%, I'll sell it to you and buy your 10% gainer from you. We'll just ""switch horses.""  That was, we avoid the problem of 10%ers going down, as we've proven they do, because we'll both be at 0%! It's a genius strategy!

2021-05-24 21:32:54,stocks,"You can‚Äôt really get ‚Äúburned‚Äù with covered calls or cash secured puts... and although you can short options, shorting itself isn‚Äôt the same thing as options. 

Covered Calls is guaranteed profit as long as your strike price is above your cost basis. You just limit your gains at your set price. 

And on the flip side, Cash secured puts is actually a great way to get shares for a cheaper than the current price. Of course the risk is that the stock may drop even further than your strike price, but in most cases, you do this with stocks you want to hold long term anyways."
2021-05-25 04:15:52,stocks,That's for spreads where people haven't closed legs.
2021-05-24 22:33:03,stocks,"Lmao. If I could give you a prize, I would.

In all seriousness, I have learned to hold on to my winners- but it was a hard lesson to learn. Believe it or not it can up a lot more than you think kids! 

If you sell when you make 30% you could miss a lot of upside. On the other hand if you hold on when you lose 30% you could lose a lot more (yes seriously) or you could be holding a very long time.

On the latter point, I have held TEF since 2011 when it was $25. I refused to sell it at $18. At $12. At $9. Well it's $5 now. It was never a big position but man has it taught me a lesson on losers. Now I keep holding it only to remind myself to sell losers I don't believe in. Lol. I should probably still sell it. Garbage company and management team - give themselves positive marks in shareholder comms despite driving the company into the toilet."
2021-05-25 00:00:00,stocks,"$RICK and $MORT It's not a meme; they're both genuinely good stocks. I have 5% in $RICK and 1.25% in $MORT.

$RICK is up 435% since last year. They manage up-scale cabarets, strip clubs, and nightclubs. There's no other publicly traded company like it. Until someone comes up with a strip clubs and porn ETF, I'm gonna continue to allocate 5% to it -- my next-highest allocation for an individual security is $AMZN at 2%.

$MORT is ""only"" up 61% but it's still down ~30% since its pre-pandemic high. It's a mortgages REIT. Considering 2/3 millennials don't yet own a home, if mortgage loans and payments never get back to their pre-pandemic levels, we're gonna have bigger problems than an underperforming REIT. Plus, it has a 10% dividend yield which is bananas.

I'm not a financial advisor and my DD is that I like strip clubs and over-leveraging my home equity to go to strip clubs."

2021-05-25 09:46:52,stocks,"Like I pointed out, prior price action has no bearing on the future in the long term. It‚Äôs finance 101.

The deep value is that the company‚Äôs FCF it‚Äôs being rated at is below 12X its EV. We expect the market to rerate it to 15-18X FCF over the long run due to the quality of locations and owned real estate. This represents the prices being under valued, REGARDLESS of the 400% run up. The market is under rating this company because of 1. Sin stock 2. Low coverage 3. Misunderstanding of its non club locations 

Stop pointing at a chart and saying ‚Äúhey look it‚Äôs run up‚Äù. That‚Äôs exactly what everyone said about AMZN, AAPL, MSFT, etc. it‚Äôs run up because of its fundamentals over time or it‚Äôs ability to grow sales, regardless of the run up. Future FCF growth and being rerated at a higher multiple is the deep value we hope to see unlock."

I honestly wouldn't be surprised if it doesn't see $145 again this year though. ""Potentially getting close"" can mean the $130's.

I ultimately found to it to be more of a learning tool than anything else, which helped me avoid rash decisions based on hype and emotion. On another note, MF has some pretty solid podcasts like Industry Focus. Might be worth checking out a few of those to get a feel for the vibe there."

You‚Äôll see so much hate on this thread. But if you buy their official recommendations and hold them long term you‚Äôre going to crush the market. Or at least I have over the last 10 years
2021-05-24 22:43:06,stocks,Absolutely a lot of people don‚Äôt like stock advisors for that reason. But if you use them as a learning tool to invest there is a lot of valuable information in their reviews. And it defiantly helps shape the way you look at companies!
2021-05-25 00:33:57,stocks,"I don't know how that 45 billion was calculated, but Naspers spun off Prosus to manage assets (but my broker doesn't support Prosus). According to Prosus, Naspers own 72.5%, and their (Prosus) assets are about 140 billion. So that * ownership portion is over the market cap of Naspers without taking into account their domestic holdings. So the only way you could say Naspers isn't trading at a discount to their assets is if you look at Prosus as a completely independent company, rather than a subsidiary that's itself publicly traded. 

I never look at the PE of companies whose job is to invest in other companies, it's misleading. It's an OTC stock but it's still an ADR it's not some fly-by-night company with a secondary listing and undefined ownership."

2021-05-24 21:05:10,stocks,Intelligent Investor by Ben Graham and Mr. Market. Helped me really redefine what stocks are and figure out why I‚Äôm buying.
2021-05-24 21:07:09,stocks,"I look for what I feel is a good company with damaged reputation.  The odd thing is, when I talk about investing in these kinds of companies, people always down them and talk about the possibility of bankruptcy.  The reality is, if you invest in a company that is at its best, where do you expect it to go?

During the pandemic I looked at carnival Cruise lines, it had been on a downwards trend prior to the pandemic, but took a beating during the pandemic.  March of last year I invested into carnival Cruise lines, about a month later the stock had already lost about a third of its value from where I bought in because there was a couple ships floating around with bodies on them that nobody would let come into port, so I bought more... I have achieved about a 150% profit on that stock now, it is close to 2.5 times my original investment.  I expect it's got about another 25 to 30% over its current value once it's full up and running again...but it's been pretty flat for a while now. Probably overvalued for its current situation. I don't expect it to get to his pre-pandemic stock value due to dilution and debt.  When I bought more carnival Cruise lines in april, I also purchase Royal Caribbean. The value of that one is close to three times what I put into it.

I had looked at Boeing a long time ago when the max got grounded. I'm kind of glad I didn't buy into it back then, because it took a long time before they fixed it and started delivering them again.  More recently they had a couple aircraft have their engines come apart in flight. Pratt and Whitney engines.  Pratt & Whitney is a private company, I can't invest in them through stocks. So... I invested in Boeing. It was trading about 250 when I bought into it, was trading at about 350 pre-pandemic.  I expect it to get back up to 350 when things are full up and running.  Its dropped since I first bought into it, so I buy a couple shares here, couple shares there. It's trading at less than 250 now, but I'm in the positive on it.

Rolls-royce, their premier engine had problems, hollow veins that were cracking.  This stock is so cheap it's almost like a penny stock. It seems to go nowhere, hovering right around 1.50 right now.  I don't expect this to go anywhere short-term, but I do expect it to double over the next two or three years. They are supposed to go cash positive the second half of this year.  Whenever I have extra cash in my portfolio, I buy a few shares.

I'm not recommending any of these stocks, I'm just trying to explain my thought process behind how I invest.

The stocks that I've taken the biggest beating on, namely SPACs, are ones I've heard about through other people, and followed their advice.  I definitely don't know everything, and I'm paying my tuition to learn, but I think I'll paddle my own boat from now on and not follow what other people say.

I don't day trade, I invest for the long haul, and when a stock that I'm in goes down, if I still feel good about its prospects, I buy more."
2021-05-24 22:50:20,stocks,"The big thing is to always keep in mind that it is a true market. There is a buyer/seller and winner/loser to each trade. Do not get emotional with a trade when it doesn‚Äôt go your way, because there is someone on the other side of that trade that wanted something different from you and they just happened to be right this time. 

Cut it loose and move on. Stick to your rules like the bible and never look back."

2021-05-25 09:04:40,stocks,"I just felt like you're suggesting people who can't afford a computer shouldn't be investing in the stock market while there're phones more expensive than computers.

Nowadays, some people don't even have to have a computer to work, they're on their phones and tablets, and that thing runs on apps, not web pages and .exe programs. Most of the retail brokers have their own apps because if you don't, ain't nobody gonna stay with you."
2021-05-25 09:16:32,stocks,"Yes, I am suggesting that if you cannot afford a couple hundred dollars for a computer so that you can do better research that scrolling through Reddit on your phone and looking at pretty lines on an app then you are not ready to be investing yet. 

That sure makes it sound like you have little to no disposable income, and if that is the case you absolutely should not have your money tied up in any type of risky investments. 

If you are going to tie your money up in higher risk investments like the stock market you need to do your homework beforehand. It‚Äôs not impossible to do that from an app, but it‚Äôs considerably more difficult to research and analyze company finances on a 5‚Äù screen. 

‚ÄúInvestment‚Äù apps are not brokerages. If you are investing your money you need to invest with a proper brokerage. They all have apps as well if you feel like your best investment decisions are made on the go. People should not be asking ‚Äúwhich app is the best for me to invest‚Äù they should be asking ‚Äúwhich brokerage best suits my needs.‚Äù If someone does not understand the distinction then they have not done enough research to be investing. Apps such as Robinhood just proved that when they let a bunch of ignorant people get on their app and gave them margin to buy and extremely risky stock in an elaborate pump and dump and then get fucked over because they don‚Äôt have enough money to handle the transactions, which would not have been the case at a real brokerage. 

If people still don‚Äôt understand what happened and all they care about is how pretty the lines are then they should not be investing."
2021-05-25 11:32:09,stocks,"What the hell are you talking about? I don't know which country you come from, but if your company is providing clients to purchase and trade on stocks, options, ETF, futures and etc, you ARE a broker. 

There no such thing as a ""fake broker"" only a less reliable broker, I'm pretty sure whatever broker you're using right now, they probably have their own apps (unless you're a time traveler from the year 2000's)"
2021-05-25 12:12:20,stocks,"Do a little research on the whole GME debacle and why that happened with Robinhood and other apps and the difference between Robinhood and a broker like TD or Fidelity and come back for a chat when you have some idea of what youre talking about. 

It will probably take a while if you‚Äôre only using your phone for news. Maybe that‚Äôs why you missed it in the first place."
2021-05-25 14:11:07,stocks,"Oh, so you do know TD Ameritrade and Fidelity. Do you know they also have apps, and most people trade on apps nowadays?"
2021-05-25 15:29:29,stocks,"If you‚Äôll scroll back and actually read any of my comments you‚Äôll see I covered that in probably the second or third thing I said. All brokerages have apps. 

Choose the better broker and use their app if you want. My whole point is that you should not be choosing the best app for investing. Convenience of pretty lines and easy to press buttons is jot what is important in a brokerage. 

Why are you so intent on defending Robinhood and garbage like that? Do you work for them or something?"

2021-05-24 20:31:34,stocks,Why would you assume inflation has not been fully priced in? I think it has been. The infrastructure bill is already much smaller than the initial proposal that influenced inflation models. And it still has to pass for any of that impact to actually play out.

2021-05-24 22:39:27,stocks,"I live in small city usa (50k people).  We have the common vehicle lots, 1 of each...Every dealer is close to empty on stock.

I can't see any positive when there are no vehicles to sell.  What happens when dealerships start to fail because they have no cars to sell?"
2021-05-24 22:47:59,stocks,"I have a similar setup as you.  I have

Regular IRA - Converted from profit sharing 10 years ago...Managed by Merrill

Roth IRA - I don't contribute every year...Managed by Merrill

Regular 401k - Target date fund managed by my employer

Roth 401k - Target date fund managed by my employer (currently gets 30k each year...19.5k + 6.5k catchup + co match).

I have about 100k in my personal ETrade account that I manage.  It's more of a hobby.  I can't tell you how many times I've wanted to manage the IRas and 401ks...I can tell you that I'm glad I didn't.

I sleep much better at night when I have a rotten run in my personal account but know my real wealth is safe.

Be smart, try to hit the home run without a huge amount of risk.

You didn't mention 401k in your original post...Not sure if that's available."
2021-05-25 04:19:56,stocks,So you don't think the energy density of 400 kWh/kg that people usually use as the requirement for electric planes is realistic?
2021-05-24 23:45:18,stocks,They got rid of the prime pantry stuff too and rolled it into just prime.
2021-05-24 22:14:53,stocks,Bill Ackman owns 6%. That‚Äôs high conviction from a value investor.
2021-05-24 22:09:58,stocks,Great expectations already priced in.
2021-05-24 21:16:03,stocks,Use a brokerage that lets you do fractional investments. Then you can toss  whatever you can afford into whatever you want and own a fraction of the stock.
2021-05-25 19:07:52,stocks,Exactly. It's the best tasting and textured of all the oat milks. I've tried them all and oatly is the only one that doesn't taste like slimey watered down oatmeal. It foams really well in coffee too.  I just read they are developing a non dairy cheese too.
2021-05-25 09:40:07,stocks,"My personal sceptisism stems from the fact that is sweden, where oatly had been around for a while, new brands produce similar products at similar quality but to a better price, I have not looked at the numbers, but their oat milk is pretty much the second choice to Oddlygood (Valio, I think). Maybe that trend will spread eventually. At the same time, they are at the frontline of producing oat-based products and have made it on the international arena (even though some of their stuff really suck, like the yoghurt)."
2021-05-25 00:53:48,stocks,Should be the same for oatly since (anecdotal) a good portion of their sales should be to baristas
2021-05-25 00:49:40,stocks,"Not a vegetarian but tried to reduce animal based products a bit.

Tried almost all alternative ""milks""

Nutbased and oatbased are the only ones that taste really good.

Nutbased, like almond, have the water consumption problem, but that might not be a topic for many as long as it's not a broader topic.

See the flash crash of a popular REDACTED after talks about its environmental aspects.

That leaves oatbased. Oatly and alpro taste the best. I will always prefer buying them over the store brands if there is a sale"
2021-05-25 08:40:32,stocks,"Oatly‚Äôs sales soared during the pandemic. They‚Äôve increase drastically in grocery stores and even coffee shops. Also Oatly is now offered at Starbucks. And coffee shops like that have done alright since most people just come in for pickup, drive through, etc."
2021-05-25 09:53:27,stocks,It‚Äôs nothing similar o√§tlig haha
2021-05-25 08:51:25,stocks,"OK, thank you for the insight. Here in Germany a lot of the smaller shops just closed down completely"
2021-05-25 03:45:09,stocks,You don‚Äôt. You lose a lot
2021-05-25 13:11:58,stocks,Love this stock. Easy hold and add more on dips. Timeline of growth is interesting but should be a steady climb
2021-05-25 15:55:38,stocks,Not that patience but willing to sit on it for a year or so lol
2021-05-25 15:48:47,stocks,I am interested in investing PSFE but I am going to wait until it reaches 10ish range. I feel like it‚Äôs going to drop further and it will go below 11ish.
2021-05-25 15:52:38,stocks,Yea that seems to be the floor. Was there last week so could make it's way back down. Somewhat volatile right now
2021-05-25 15:54:01,stocks,I am thinking around 10.50ish but let‚Äôs wait and see if that happens lol
2021-05-25 15:58:37,stocks,Best of luck
2021-05-25 14:59:14,stocks,You're living in your own sandbox bud. There are literally robots delivering pizzas and you claim self driving vehicles are impossible. Nearly every single new car produced today has some sort of self driving feature. I can't imagine what definition of done is for you.
2021-05-25 03:36:52,stocks,"Hey can yiu help me? I have been wanting to buy DraftKings as my second stock. Glad I didn‚Äôt at the time it was around 60. I feel like when the pandemic lessens and as you said, football ramps up, a call would be a great purchase. I sort of understand calls, but need help with which date and price,etc. DM me if that‚Äôs easier. Thanks"
2021-05-25 03:38:31,stocks,ELI5 please
2021-05-24 21:34:14,stocks,When does the dividend return? I think I would become a shareholder if they brought back that \~5% dividend.
2021-05-25 14:39:33,stocks,Ford also has a lot of debt. How do you think that will factor into the stock price
2021-05-25 13:04:56,stocks,"They've been shaking things up lately and while I'm no expert, I think it's part of a broader strategy that will last until they see where they land. If you're looking for a good dividend stock, go for RWT. 6% in March. Also a good rebound stock considering they were steadily at $17 prior to covid and have been on a good recovery trajectory back to that. Currently hovering around 10.90"
2021-05-25 15:20:49,stocks,"Man that's such a crazy question in today's market. What's weird about ford is people seem to scrutinize it with harsher light than other companies which is interesting. The truth is many auto companies have massive debt to earnings ratios including tesla who's stock price is wildly inflated given all its financials and product quality. Ford is a long standing company and I don't see their debt as concerning as I would a startup or a company that has limited product diversity. Their profits are still growing and d/e is still decent compared to others so I don't see debt handicapping then anytime soon.They are very undervalued given all financial factors but they are a company people seem to love to pass on. That's what I see affecting their price the most.  If they can't get people excited about them, they won't see price growth. I've heard the new leadership is determined to make investor relations a priority which is a good sign stock wise"
2021-05-25 18:30:58,stocks,"REITs are not the same thing as dividend stocks tho. And, its not that I am looking for a dividend stock but more that earning a dividend would mitigate the risks with holding Ford. No question that the new electric F-150 looks very solid but there is just too much intense competition in the electric car space with companies even operating in niche areas such as trucks/SUVs. I think Tesla and some of the Chinese stocks will continue to be very formidable competition for Ford and others. Additionally, companies that operate in niche areas like electric SUVs might have a better ability to specialize in them.  The other issue is that historically Ford has had some issues with quality and calling back cars. I think if that were to happen again during the rollout of these electric trucks, the Ford stock will tank which is why I would like to have a dividend to protect against all of this. Just my opinion."
2021-05-25 12:35:38,stocks,Why is SLCA not going anywhere?
2021-05-25 14:01:23,stocks,"UGH.  Sooooo boooring.

But yeah.  You're not wrong."
