2021-06-22 19:21:00,stocks,"I'm planning to get as much of it as they'll allocate me at the IPO price. They have a large user base and I think it says something that their % graduating medical students is higher than their total % US MD users -- namely that they will continue to be adopted by younger doctors at a high rate. They have a somewhat diversified revenue stream, which includes physician recruiting, big pharma marketing, and the new telehealth platform. With regard to recruiting, I think that locums work and gig work in medicine will become more and more commonplace. There is a common perception that the newest generation of doctors is more lifestyle-oriented than previous generations and I suspect that this will lead to a greater frequency of nontraditional career paths and a platform that connects doctors with jobs will benefit from this trend if it is borne out. I don't think many hospital systems are posting jobs on Craigslist or Monster or whatever. With regard to the marketing division, I don't think big pharma is going to stop spending tons of money on advertising any time soon. Their dialer app, with phone, video, and fax, is super useful in its free form and they are contracting with large health systems to offer the full ""Dialer Pro"" suite, and this is where the big telehealth money is at, not sole prop family docs and psychiatrists. That said, I think they could corner the private practice market as well given the portability and scalability of their product. From a business perspective, reading over their S-1, their financials seem pretty strong, they haven't had to fundraise in like 7 years, and they are already profitable. I think their real product is enterprise solutions, and they have good retention and profitability with their current customers. I think people who are looking at this as just another social media site are misinformed about what the company really does, and there is potential for a lot of growth in the telehealth sector.

Some potential pitfalls I envision:

\- Telehealth may go away. Insurance companies all started paying for it during the pandemic, but they may pull back, and that would cause one of this company's main revenue streams to dry up. Counterpoint: The general public has had a taste of telehealth and they like it. My clinic is returning to more in-person visits and most patients seem to prefer to continue to be seen via video. If the insurance companies take that away, people will be pissed. I think the cat is out of the bag.

\- Telehealth is a somewhat crowded industry. Zoom, AmWell, and Webex are just a few of the other companies offering HIPAA compliant video chat solutions. AmWell has a leg up insofar as the premier electronic health record (EHR) supports integration. Doximity does not have this feature. Zoom has household name appeal (though Doximity is also a household name amongst physicians). Counterpoint: of the platforms I have used, doximity is the easiest and most user friendly, and if I were opening up a private practice tomorrow, it would be my platform of choice. AmWell is glitchy. Webex is clunky. Zoom was not HIPAA compliant from the get-go and is, as such, a bit of a late comer even though it was the dominant video conferencing software of the pandemic. Plus, bad press about ""zoom bombing.""

\- Pharmaceutical advertising dollars may be diverted back to more traditional venues as things open back up and drug reps can come give sponsored talks to prescribers in person again. Counterpoint: I doubt that big pharma is going to turn their back on a captive audience of 80+% of US physicians. Many (esp younger) doctors are skipping the drug rep lunches these days anyway, and see it as a relic of a time long gone.

\- They will probably not continue to grow exponentially. The last two years were a fluke (or a catalyst) and you could argue that Doximity was just in the right place at the right time. I'm not expecting explosive growth but I think this company has a strong future.

I'm not the most well-informed about the industry landscape nor am I a financial advisor, just a humble resident physician who has done a TON of telehealth over the past 15 months and have had great experiences using Doximity's software. Do your own research, make your own decisions, this is not financial advice, etc."
2021-06-22 17:59:02,stocks,It’s only really used by doctors for their free phone number spoofer to make it look like you’re calling from the office and not your cell phone tbh fam
2021-06-22 19:21:41,stocks,So far no one knows what they are talking about. I’m a doctor but the worst people to ask about this are financially illiterate doctors. Their financials are solid. Taking the full reserved amount I was offered
2021-06-22 18:18:58,stocks,Not a fan. It’s essentially social media for doctors. Don’t see them being a huge player in the telehealth sector when there are other companies with a significant head start and better product

My car is not currently under my LLC and if for any reason a customer gets in my car I have them sign something that was drafted for me by an attorney.

Again, big reason for concern is an attorney would say to keep it separate (like what you said, the LLC protects my personal assets) but my CPA sees it as a if “If I make a lot of money in my investments I can use the net worth to grow the business through business loans or increase what I pay myself”"

I do think batteries are a stop gap measure for something else."

2021-06-22 19:31:29,stocks,"It’s mainly capacity. No sense in developing a vehicle if no one can buy the fuel. That’s why plug is enticing. They are the company supplying hydrogen (H) in the future.

2021-06-22 19:16:13,stocks,They do more than just vehicles. Hydrogen fuel cells have many uses including backup power for warehouses and data centers.
2021-06-22 16:58:06,stocks,Would like an opinion from those who think otherwise... would love to hear an explanation why PLUG is a buy. The stock was stagnant for years and years and now it’s a good buy lol.

2021-06-22 18:05:13,stocks,"MSFT definitely feels like the unpopular step child right now when it comes to the big FAANG+M stocks. I've been buying into it heavily for months, at a minimum I've been buying 2 shares every pay check. But I rarely see others calling MSFT a buy at reddit or in investing channels. I've seen some people argue that they just won't keep growing, and a lot of others saying it's just too expensive. It doesn't normally get that much love (or even a lot of mentions at all) in investing youtube channels either.

AMZN is almost always called a buy whenever anyone talks about it, I practically never see anyone argue not to buy it, and I've never seen anyone use any kind of analysis/numbers to justify it being overpriced.

AAPL has some people who say it's stupidly overpriced, and some who say it's a crazy steal right now if you look at the forward PE ratio. It's just a more polarizing stock that has a lot haters and a lot of loyal fans.

GOOG & FB have their haters, but also have a lot of people who have been saying for a while that they're really undervalued. I've seen so many youtube videos over the last year or two calling both of them great buys.

NFLX has it's doubters with many others making their own streaming services these days, but I still see a lot of people who argue they're still a great investment and will continue growing despite these challenges."

2021-06-22 19:01:34,stocks,9%ish I believe this year. Depends on whether a new console releases. 3rd quarter of 2021 financial year had Gaming revenue at $3.53 billion.
2021-06-22 17:59:40,stocks,"Like being a gamer is a qualification to judge Microsoft’s long term game strategy. 

Don’t get me wrong, I love my PS4 and the only thing preventing me loving a PS5 is getting my hands on one. But Sony is placing all of their bets on the PS5 doing well. Their usual strategy is getting a huge hardware install base fast, and right now that’ll be a challenge with shortages. 

Microsoft is taking a small hit on the hardware install base, but they have a HUGE advantage with having Windows and Gamepass, both which don’t need to worry about having a large Xbox install base. 

There's also how much of their revenue share truly comes from gaming. Sony gets about 25% of their revenue from gaming, relies on that segment to keep the lights on, and doesn’t have much spare cash to expand that segment. 

Meanwhile gaming only makes up 9% of Microsoft’s revenue. They have cash on hand to expand, and can leverage their assets like cloud computing to expand further then physical hardware limits. They don’t need gaming, but they see it as a segment they can dominate, and that might be true if Sony doesn’t pick up the pace."
2021-06-22 17:42:28,stocks,You think the PS5 is in a better position for the future than the Xbox AND PC’s? Microsoft is making changes to the windows store to be a steam/epic competitor in windows 11. Xbox/PC game pass also seems to be a hit. The ability to swap between xbox and PC and resume your progress along with a ton of other features that the PS5 can’t do is pretty cool too. Why would Sony be in a better position for the future of gaming here?

 - Contacted by a government agency and quietly asked to fix it in-house.   
 - Refuse, forcing an embarrassing public slap by a government agency.   
 - After being demolished online and in the media, finally back down and agree to a vague fix.    
 - Half-arse fix (software pin code, instead of safety stop/plastic shield) that took months to roll out.    
 - Now try to charge a subscription for the shit software fix.

Essentially they are saying they rushed a safety update and it works via your Peloton subscription connection. They are working on a version of that safety update that does not require the subscription but it is not ready yet. 

The stock being up 8% probably has a lot more to do with the news that they are entering the wearables market that was announced today. 

If this drops tomorrow I’ll be looking to swing it again. With even this little publicity I imagine it’ll pressure them to knock out that update faster (which is fair, it benefits them to drag their feet) and when the armband or watch that monitors your heart rate et all comes out, well, could be very good for them."

2021-06-22 17:58:26,stocks,"Putting a lump sum in the market as soon as that sum is available, as opposed to attempting to time the market entrance, is a special case of dollar cost averaging.

DCA is simply investing the same amount of money at regular intervals, over some period, typically as soon as the funds become available for investment. A single lump sum shortens the period and interval to the same length. It's still fundamentally DCA.

The motivation behind DCA is that time in the market is better than timing the market."

Lump Sum typically outperforms  DCA in all relevant metrics. You outperform DCA more often on the sample of \~2,500 days observed, the average return was much higher, your rate of losing more than 10% of your investment is lower.

Your 2/3 win rate for lump sum most likely wouldn't hold true for all scenarios."
2021-06-22 16:37:34,stocks,"Not true, investing is not all gambling or else nobody would have been able to make any money from this farce. 

I know your numbers point towards lump sum being better, but theres way too many variables to actually draw a definitive conclusion. For example one flaw is assuming everyone dca strategy is the same weekly buy in period. 

My previous comment was pointing towards averaging down a stock literally in daily intervals. So i buy something then if it falls tomorrow, i buy more than i keep doing this until it goes up. Thats why i said lump sum was harder to do since it would require buying pretty much at the bottom of a drop. 

Basically our beliefs differ since our trading intervals differ."
2021-06-22 16:58:08,stocks,"Ah right.

I also wonder how big the impact would be if you don't DCA every 1st of the month but just slowly enter the market on dips. Of course that would be pretty much impossible to analyse as you never know which day you would have bought."
2021-06-22 17:34:53,stocks,I wasn't talking to you either. You're just space I put my comment under.
2021-06-22 16:47:02,stocks,"I respectfully disagree. Just because you're able to improve your odds of winning doesn't mean it's not gambling. Go look at legends like Michael Burry who is gambling on the stock market crashing with his Tesla puts amongst other positions. 

In any case, definitely don't want to go back and forth. But I've run the same analysis assuming daily DCA and came to the same conclusions. Lump Sum > DCA, regardless of daily, weekly or monthly intervals. If I had to guess it's because on average the market improves so each additional day your money is in the market it has a chance of growing and compounding. With DCA you hamper that a bit."
2021-06-22 17:20:28,stocks,"If you can come up with a set of parameters we can model that in. do you buy based on a daily dip? Or weekly? When during the dip do you buy? If it dips even further the next day do you buy even more? What (%) of your money do you put in to buy the dip relative to your overall budget you're wanting to invest?

I'm not an index fund investor, so for me it depends on the state of the companies I would like to buy into. On top of that I prefer to be fully invested, so I don't really have experience with buying dips like this, but I'm curious to know whether strategically buying dips instead of just buying whenever you have money available could improve my ROI.

Perhaps another Redditor that does invest like that could help us out?"

2021-06-22 15:30:10,stocks,"An economic depression is a period of sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. It is a more severe economic downturn than a recession, which is a slowdown in economic activity."
2021-06-22 15:31:18,stocks,"In economics, a recession is a business cycle contraction when there is a general decline in economic activity.[1][2] Recessions generally occur when there is a widespread drop in spending (an adverse demand shock). This may be triggered by various events, such as a financial crisis, an external trade shock, an adverse supply shock, the bursting of an economic bubble, or a large-scale anthropogenic or natural disaster (e.g. a pandemic). In the United States, it is defined as ""a significant decline in economic activity spread across the market, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in real GDP, real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales"".[3] In the United Kingdom, it is defined as a negative economic growth for two consecutive quarters.[4][5]

Governments usually respond to recessions by adopting expansionary macroeconomic policies, such as increasing money supply or increasing government spending and decreasing taxation.

Put simply, a recession is the decline of economic activity, which means that the public has stopped buying products for a while which can cause the downfall of GDP after a period of economic expansion (a time where products become popular and the income profit of a business becomes large). This causes inflation (the rise of product prices). In a recession, the rate of inflation slows down, stops, or becomes negative. ((((Straight From Wikipedia))))"
2021-06-22 15:32:19,stocks,"An economic depression is a period of sustained, long-term downturn in economic activity in one or more economies. It is a more severe economic downturn than a recession, which is a slowdown in economic activity over the course of a normal business cycle.

Economic depressions are characterized by their length, by abnormally large increases in unemployment, falls in the availability of credit (often due to some form of banking or financial crisis), shrinking output as buyers dry up and suppliers cut back on production and investment, more bankruptcies including sovereign debt defaults, significantly reduced amounts of trade and commerce (especially international trade), as well as highly volatile relative currency value fluctuations (often due to currency devaluations). Price deflation, financial crises, stock market crash, and bank failures are also common elements of a depression that do not normally occur during a recession. ((((Wiki Pedia))))"

1. Technical pattern in a consolidating bull-flag since March, which matched their previous peak way back in August 2018 pre-pandemic. Two straight days of 5% pops. Really breaking out right now. MACD has spiked way past the indicator line, showing great momentum. Still waiting on some volume.
2. Going into peak sales season of summer/fall. Swim vacation summer, back to school.
3. Aerie has been a runaway hit for them, growing to close to a 10% share of the women's underwear and lingerie market, all this while Victoria's Secret continues to lose share at a precipitous pace, down from 32% to 21% in the last five years. Aerie has grown sales in Q1 2021 89% yoy, online sales grew 160% yoy, and operating margin grew to 26%, meaning that they are at an inflection point to take full advantage of operating leverage and convert incremental sales to profits.
4. I see continued momentum into Aerie, and in a best case scenario, **I could see them PASSING VICTORIA'S SECRET in market share in five years,** especially as malls continue to die, and especially if they continue to build upon synergies in their growing ath-leisure, lounge and swimware lines. Aerie's OFFL/NE label, as a lower cost ath-leisure alternative to Lululemon, has been picking up a whole lot of steam among Tik Tok influencers. I see bike shorts coming back in a big way for the first time in 30 years, as a high cut alternative to yoga pants in the heat of the summer.
5. Huge things happen to returns when you pass a respected market leader in a slow moving industry. DPZ (Dominos Pizza) returned gains to investors outpacing Amazon over the past ten years, as they slowly overtook Pizza Hut in market share for the first time. These things don't happen often, but when they do, cash in. Aerie has an outside chance to pull it off......... Assume Victoria's secret doesn't grow (as it hasn't been) and revenue is stuck around 7B/year. Aerie is at 1B in revenue, growing >50% per year. At 50% growth rates per year, they will do it in 5 years. Assuming a steady rate of growth rate decay, slowing to 18% per year in 5-7 years, they'll do it in 7 years.
6. I see the Jeans segment, though stagnant for years, to pick up in the next year for their flagship American Eagle brand, because jeans are undergoing their first supercycle change in 20 years, as skinnies head out the door and relaxed/mom styles, high waists, boyfriends, wides, flares and skater/JNCO cuts all compete for dominance of Gen Z/Alpha. AE is smartly positioned in all of these categories. Expect their AE line to grow in line with other jeans comparables like Levi Strauss.

For seemingly much of the whole apparel sector, I mean. 

I have lots of stocks with a higher or no PE (not profitable). But I still recognize that there is such a thing as a stock with a low PE meaning something very specific about earnings in absolute terms. VIAC for instance. GM. F. These have a low PE despite the growth they're showing. That's my point. 

Reopening plays I do like, even though they have had a huge runup, are ONEW, THO, CWH. Whole leisure sectors (camping. RV, boating) are still trading at a low PE despite showing massive growth in revenue forecast. These to me are a buy now because the whole sector can rally from here and still be undervalued by PE. Not so for GPS, AEO, etc.

So sure, undervalued within a possibly overvalued sector."

2021-06-22 10:52:46,stocks,"It’s all the same. Call premium is taxed at current ordinary income rates. 

Added issue is that selling a short dated sub 30DTE or deep in the money, the IRS views that as an effective sale date. So it will lock in the holding period when you sell that call, even if it’s assigned when the stock “should” qualify for a LTGC holding tax rate."
2021-06-22 10:44:33,stocks,"You only pay taxes on the gains, so surely you can be a bit more tax efficient in some case scenarios, but again if you buy at 10, sell at 12, you pay tax on 2, not 12"
2021-06-22 11:05:43,stocks,Sadly in my experience anything that makes money still results in taxes. Covered calls are taxed the same as short term gains I believe.

2021-06-22 15:15:11,stocks,"Could you expand on this effective sale date? I sell a lot of CCs and want to make sure I'm not screwing up something tax related.

Are you saying the underlying is counted as short-term gains when a 30DTE call is assigned, even if I've held those shares for what would normally qualify for long-term capital gains?

If so, that has huge tax implications and makes a solid argument for CCs on long-term holds being super risky. I fortunately only sell CCs on short term holds, but this is very useful information."
2021-06-22 10:49:27,stocks,"so even if you trade in and out of position profitably, you arent compounding your taxes?

I thougjt if you sell for a profit and rebuy lower your taxes will be compounded. But i think youre right"
2021-06-22 16:27:07,stocks,"No, if you already qualified for LTCG, then you never lose that status on the underlying.

But if it’s short term held, and you sold either at sub 30DTE or ITM (deep or not), then the call sale date is the date they use as a record of sale if you get assigned. Even if the assignment comes when the underlying should have qualified for LTCG.

Basically it’s to prevent people who held a security for 11 months, sell a in the money (thus capturing premium benefit for selling it based on market conditions today) and then when it gets assigned a month later they qualify for the LTCG tax rate.

IRS won’t allow that. They will stop the holding period on the date the call is sold if it gets assigned in the future."
2021-06-22 10:52:51,stocks,"Well, it would be a wash sale and reset your cost basis. 

So if you..

3/1 but at 11

Your current position is a 1/1 cost basis of $10. 

It gets a bit more complicated around end of year, but this is the gist"

2021-06-22 11:42:08,stocks,"Would the new cost basis not be 11?


Appreciate the explanation!"
2021-06-22 17:21:22,stocks,"what he said is incorrect.  Selling less than 30DTE will reset the time regardless of how long you've been holding the stock.  For example:

Have 100 shares of aapl for 5 years.  Sell a 2 week covered call.  The call expires worthless.  11 months later you sell the aapl share,  you'll pay short term gain.  Look into qualified and non-qualified call if you want to know more."
2021-06-22 11:51:44,stocks,I’ve probably commented this wrong and been corrected 100 times. Smh.
2021-06-22 11:44:12,stocks,"I’m so sorry, I get this wrong way too often, but the new cost basis would be 11 as wash sale rules only apply when selling at a loss as the other posted pointed out.

So if you 
1/1 buy at 10
2/1 sell at 8
3/1 buy at 9

Your cost basis is not 8, it’s 10. 

But in the above, I was incorrect, it would be 11 as you suggested."
2021-06-22 17:45:11,stocks,"Damn, that's good to know. So basically, if I want to pay long-term capital gains on a position, I have to hold it for 12 months after selling a short call, regardless of how long I've held it before the call.

This would also seem to suggest that getting assigned on a short-expiration call would always trigger STCG on the underlying."
2021-06-22 17:51:11,stocks,"The main risk I see is if you keep selling an unqualified calls, then you will never actually be eligible for LTCG. However, from everything I'm reading, it seems that once you are eligible for LTCG, it stays that way regardless of the calls."

Most of the stock on here have low short exempt \[most zero\], and AMC has 1,500,000. The second highest short exempt is BB with 442k, their are maybe 30 other stock above 100k and every other stock is sub 100k or closer to zero. Even with that data, most stock do not have a high short exempt/short volume ratio.

**So my questions are:**

1. What would be the reason for short exempt being at these extremely high levels be?
2. How can 20% of short volume on the day be short exempt? Is that normal and under what circumstances does that happen?
3. Does the SEC know about this or have a role to play in such a high short exempt number?
4. Is this something retail should be worried about or questioning for the stock?"
2021-06-22 13:05:11,stocks,"Short exempt is a short sale order exempted from the uptick rule. The uptick rule states you can only short a stock on an uptick, however in 2007 the sec eliminated this and changed it so that you can't short if a stock has 10% or more from the previous days closing price, however it is possible to get an exemption from a broker for the rule."

2021-06-22 12:41:46,stocks,"Major investing subreddits have become too popular.  If the consensus is that a company will outperform in the long run, then the stock is likely already priced accordingly and will be unlikely to outperform the market.  Reddit obviousy functions by consensus (upvote/downvote) and thus when a subreddit goes mainstream, its recommended investments become those that are mainstream.  In r/investing nowadays all you hear are echo chamber recommendation for total market etfs, faang, commodities.  Anything out of the ordinary is quickly downvoted.  5-10 yrs ago when the communities were smaller people were more interested in hearing about lesser known stocks and underdogs with an actual chance of beating the market."

What would you all suggest?

I am not too clued up on ETFs beyond S&P & NASDAQ. Which is why I’d like to hear about some alternatives."
2021-06-22 07:58:16,stocks,"I personally invest 10% in one of my home country’s ETFs( I am guessing in your case that’s the US), in my case the DAX
Then I have 10% in some kind of physical Asset (Gold, real estate etc.)
I put 60% in to a MSCI World ETF  (I personally like physical ETFs but that’s up to you)
The MSCI World consists of 1600 Companies, from which 67% representation are US Stocks.
To not overweigh the US representation in my portfolio I put the remaining 20% into an Emerging Markets ETF in which there are no US Stocks!
So all in all I have a very diversified Long term portfolio with pretty good return.
Also be sure to not just dump in your 100k in one go, but rather slowly invest over the time span of a few months, to make usage of the cost average effect!
I personally am a big fan of ETFs and I really recommend you reading into the topic. It’s a great long term investment.

this is not investment advice, I am not a professional"

ARKG, ARKK, ARKX for no brainer innovative industries. Also ARKF.

MSOS, THCX, YOLO for booming Canadian and not yet peaked American cannabis industries.

Look all these up. They're very well managed. Federal investments in these areas are actively being passed and have been passed."

I don't think I'm too old for any of the ARK funds but I'm also keeping out of them, at least for the time being. Don't take that as indicative; it's personal preference, but they offer some pretty speculative growth opportunities.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Option sell/buy strategy question Say I own shares in a company, and the stock trends pretty well within a range.

I sell a put at it's lowest, but the strike is one notch more OTM (higher premium, and capitalizing on the stock swinging back up the range), and use the credit to buy a call at the same strike as the put 

I'll have a little bit in credit still, so I can use that to close out the put when it swings back up, to lock in my premium, and protect against the swing back down and assignment

Then I sell the call contract to bring my profit higher, and sell an ATM call, and when the range swings back down, close it to lock in the final premium

I know the risk, if it doesn't follow the range, but that last call contract I but if I feel the natural swing will continue

Also, does this strategy have a name?

Sell put/buy call at same strike"
2021-06-22 07:17:12,stocks,"Sell put+ buy call = synthetic long stock.

Your risk reward is the same as buying 100 shares. 

In this scenario since you're selling an ITM put.

Your breakeven = 100 x spot price less premium recieved. 

Pros: you have exposure of 100 shares using less capital

Cons: potentially illiquid options /slippage."

Thanks for reading :)"
2021-06-22 06:01:38,stocks,"Maybe save up until it is worth using a proper broker? No fees or low fees usually come at an other cost like privacy, security or not even owning the stock but a token."

2021-06-22 10:42:27,stocks,Damn. That’s brutal.
2021-06-22 06:42:24,stocks,"I mean, I imagine the reason why you'd want to invest those 10 euros would mostly be in order to ""get some experience"", rather than hoping to drive lambos in 2 months from now, right?
If so I'd recommend listening to previous advice here, don't bother with cheap brokerages, since those usually are not worth it really. Just save up until you've got enough capital to invest into things you like, or open a paper trading account till then."
2021-06-22 10:11:50,stocks,"Okay, then let me rephrase. In my experience no bank/broker will work for free for you to invest those 10€. 
So I highly recommend that you invest enough money to cover your costs. Maybe a savings plan with low amounts every month or every quarter would be a better option for you."

2021-06-22 10:56:08,stocks,Even before free trades I would contact Schwab and request 100 free trades or that I would transfer me account away. Every time I got them. Probably helps that my account was always a decent size and they didn’t want to lose a customer.

**Technical analysis (TA)** uses historical price movements, real time data, indicators based on math and/or statistics, and charts; all of which help measure the trajectory of a security.  TA can also be used to interpret the actions of other market participants and predict their actions.
        
The main benefit to TA is that everything shows up in the price (commonly known as **""priced in""**):  All news, investor sentiment, and changes to fundamentals are reflected in a security's price.

TA can be useful on any timeframe, both short and long term.

""*With the stock having underperformed meaningfully YTD and vaccine/re-opening progress gaining steam, we see this as a particularly attractive entry point ahead of what should be an accelerating revenue re-build in H2/21 (driven by sports attendance rising, in-person schooling this fall, and return to office),*"" notes the firm. Aramark is rated at Buy with a price objective of 44. 
* **Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG)** is highlighted as a top SMID cap idea given accelerating brand momentum and strong dealer feedback on HOG’s launch into the on & off road Adventure Touring motorcycle category, which should support market share gains in the U.S and Europe. 
* **L Brands (NYSE:LB)** makes the list again on the expectation that the August spin of Victoria’s Secret will lead to multiple expansion for Bath & Body Works. ""*Trends remained robust QTD following a strong 1Q where sales were up 10% vs 2019 excluding a 5% estimated benefit from stimulus*,"" adds BofA. The firm's $90 price objective values BBW at 12X the FY22 EV/EBITDA and VS at 5X. 
* **Alaska Airlines (NYSE:ALK)** is also on the list for having has one of the best balance sheets in the U.S. airline sector and holding modest net debt relative to pre-pandemic on aggressive cost and capex cuts.

2021-06-22 13:15:21,stocks,"I hold it, imo you have to know why you are in it. They have a practical monopoly on L2 charging which is different from the L3 charging that Tesla talk so much about. L3 charging is more expensive but you can charge to 90% in 40 mins. CHPT L2 is like a traditional charger where it will take you a couple of hours but it is way cheaper and they sell home chargers too. Whether you invest in a L3 Charger or L2 Charger company depends on where you see the future of charging EVs lie in. If you buy CHPT you basically believe people will on charge their cars at home or at work or when shopping. Basically you will never take a pitstop like how you top up gas right now. It happens when you are at a place for a long time.

&#x200B;

It could be a good swing play as well if you think that the infrastructure bill will lead to the government investing in L2 Chargers over L3 (which I believe they will)."

Many others have fully abandoned cable boxes and are just using Roku's with the cable company app now.  The Roku TV's are lightweight to carry outside and many are buying them for outdoor TVs."

It doesn’t seem like Biden is in a rush to push pro-cannabis legislation anyway, and a lot of the remaining states without legal rec are either fighting rec sales directly (some states literally acting against their own ballot referendums) or lazily approaching the issue."
2021-06-22 06:28:55,stocks,"Terms of the special dividend are not 100% locked until price is also announced.  Everything now is their intended plan.  

If you’re in for the dividend, you need to be holding shares at close of business on 24th.  If not, your brokerage may be eligible to receive the dividend instead of you.  You really need to check with them about their policy, especially if selling.  Some of the “app” platforms do not process transactions when you think they do, or only at market open or market close or when it is cheapest for them for volume.

The special dividend payment is on 25th (usually 2-3 days before seeing it settle) and merger transaction on/before 30th."
2021-06-22 08:58:59,stocks,"A quick glance says it's a pretty good company all around.  Steady revenue, profit, and free cash flow growth over the years.  Assets exceed liabilities.  In an industry that undoubtedly has a future.

Price to free cash flow is actually pretty good... about 14 times.  I usually like to buy for less than 20.  Check mark there.

PE ratio, however, is much too high.  It's currently at 35.  I would prefer something at 15-20.  Debt to EBIDTA is also just over 3, which is my normal upper bound.  It's not a huge amount over 3, so maybe forgivable, but I'd like to see them paying that down, especially with potential rate hikes coming.  I didn't have time to check if that's been the case.

I'm not exactly sure how PE can be so high but P/FCF can be so decent.  I would look into that if I were you.  A rudimentary look at the chart tells me we're currently at ATHs, too.  So I like this company, but probably not at this price.  Me personally this is the kind of company I'd have on my watch list and be ready to snap up as soon as we have a significant pullback.  That's part of a wider strategy on my end, though, because the cheaper you buy something the higher your overall return.

Good luck!"
2021-06-22 11:20:32,stocks,"A lot of times it is part of a reverse split, especially for those sub $1/shares.  So if you have 400 shares at $.50/share ($200) you'll end up with 50 shares at $4/share for the same total valuation ($200).  If you have left overs, brokerages that do not support/have partial shares  usually pay out the remainder of the balance for anything outside of the clean reverse split ratio."
2021-06-22 13:25:00,stocks,"I've rarely seen it talked about that way, especially with the more memey stocks like DKNG, GNOG and others getting more attention. It's a good solid long term hold even if it's a bit overvalued(but what isn't these days?)"

2021-06-22 17:04:43,stocks,"COVID originated in China one way or another.  But the cause of the illness becoming a global pandemic is that the previous presidential administration killed off all 30 of our embedded Epidimiology expert field offices.  These were incredibly effective and stopped countless pandemic-potential diseases in their tracks, so killing them off in 2018 made the COVID-19 outbreak inevitable.

Those field offices were incredibly important.  They were our best people, located in all the highest risk hot spots.   They were trusted in the host countries and would detect and help squash epidemic diseases in vitro.  Worst case, they would absolutely have given China (and the rest of the world) a six month head start.  And their presence would have totally prevented the phase in which China was able to deny COVID's existence for several months while it grew and spread around the world."

Also these companies thrived in a pandemic situation will they still thrive through inflation (i mean they have mountains of money already so they wont go outta business)?

2021-06-22 13:40:37,stocks,wait if they are reducing their gas production by 40% why are they drilling for fossil gas in the largest cold water coral reef in the world.
2021-06-22 17:18:03,stocks,Glad to see you have it all figured out!
2021-06-22 09:35:55,stocks,"Right after they got 2B in cash for the transformation?


no fking wonder yall crying bout tech being down 5% jeez"
2021-06-22 09:40:04,stocks,fuck I missclicked and bought more :)
2021-06-22 13:51:44,stocks,"Well it sounds like next to it not in it(but semantics). Their reduction is over time. As of now, the world still needs a shit ton of oil because like I said above, we're not moving fast enough in other places to push off of it for decades at this rate. Either oil companies keep pulling out oil for the time being wherever they find it or oil prices hit infinity dollars."
2021-06-22 13:54:04,stocks,"I definitely see oil use for the next 10 years but is it reduction if they are expanding their supply? A drilling program is expensive and takes awhile to break even, doesn't this indicate that they intend to increase oil production rather than decrease."
2021-06-22 14:08:48,stocks,"Well I'm not gonna pretend to know how much oil is left in each location they have, but I'd guess some places are running lower on oil than others. So adding new places would offset that if they know they're gonna need continued supply for years and years. I know they have also been selling off various spots to other companies."
2021-06-22 14:20:36,stocks,"Fair enough but I think the location of their drilling site is also a (valid) cause for concern. Considering how much BP have damaged the oceans, I feel like we should not support this drilling at all. At least not near coral reefs."
2021-06-22 14:40:48,stocks,"BP certainly have messed up in the past. So it should be monitored closely. It sounds like from the article as long as there are no spills, it wouldn't hurt the wildlife and might even help stop the overfishing in the area by creating a restricted area of no fishing. Key is to incentivize them to make sure they work safely."
2021-06-22 14:44:48,stocks,"How would you incentivise that, especially when one mistake will destroy the local eco-system that will take years to recover"
2021-06-22 15:00:02,stocks,"Subsidize the costs of extra safety measures and inspections? Tell them they're banned from Africa if they fuck up? I don't know off the top of my head but I'm sure there are measures that could be taken. You can't make it 100% safe but you can come close. Alternative is the current overfishing continues to ruin the ecosystem anyway. Again, the only real solution is to stop making all of our products/vehicles reliant on oil. No demand = no search for new oil."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"I spent time in two of the largest Bay Area malls to find out how the economy and retail companies are doing in the real world. The past 2 days I was in two of the largest Silicon Valley malls scoping them out, talking to shoppers, employees and observing the environment.  Briefly here is what I discovered:

-People are out!  The malls were busy and people seemed happy to be out in the mall again.  

-About 15% went maskless, but still 85% still chose to wear masks even though not required

-While the malls were busy, I wouldn't consider sales to be at a high level.  Most people were eating, walking, enjoying the time out.  But as I observed from different angles (throughout the mall, cashier lines, exits of mall) most shoppers did not have or leave with shopping bags.  

-When asked (I spoke with 14 different shoppers) nearly 80% said they felt cautiously optimistic for the economy going forward.

-There were two positive exceptions, one major and one minor.

Minor exception: Nordstrom.  They had some lines, more customers than other stores and active buying throughout.  

Major exception: Luxury goods.  Gucci, Coach, and the rest all seemed busy but above all else, the king of all was Louis Vuitton, consistently had a packed store with lines down the mall waiting to get in.  

-Nike shut it's stores for Juneteenth which unfortunately for them was a prime Saturday shopping day.

-One surprising active location was Dave and Busters.  I was drawn in by the noise and surprised to see so many young people in there.  It's become the modern arcade and it was packed with game players.

-Nearly every single retail outlet had a ""Now Hiring"" sign.  Truly an amazing sight to see how demand workers are right now.  

And finally, major competitors Annie Anne's and Wetzel's Pretzels are both doing well but poor Annie is not winning this fight as of now."
2021-06-22 02:14:06,stocks,"Thanks, now all I want at midnight is a pretzel"
2021-06-22 08:31:55,stocks,I would recommend going to a mall in a less affluent area
2021-06-22 07:39:20,stocks,"Peter Lynch would be proud. 

The advice is now a bit outdated, but Peter Lynch was one of the greatest investors of all time and he talks about how that’s how he did a lot of his market research: with feet on the ground at the mall. 

And there is some merit to that. Regular people will notice trends well before Wall Street. 

Example, you may have noticed how every young person at every social gathering started drinking hard seltzer’s a few years ago and made good money if you invested in SAM who makes Truly. You would have noticed it’s popularity before wall street saw the big numbers on their quarterly sales 

Or you would have made a lot of money if you invested in Lulu lemon if you noticed how popular yoga pants were becoming and that they had the longest line of every store in the mall."
2021-06-22 03:58:24,stocks,Annie Anne’s May have lost the battle but she will win the war! Best lemonade around imo
2021-06-22 08:35:28,stocks,I work in the trades and I have more work than I can handle. everyone I know who works in the trades has more work than they can handle. Many are not even accepting calls or are booked out for months at a time. I’m also in the Bay Area.
2021-06-22 03:05:32,stocks,Do you mean Auntie Anne’s?
2021-06-22 09:21:14,stocks,IMO your sample size is too small….
2021-06-22 04:11:32,stocks,ITT: Anecdotal evidence galore.
2021-06-22 02:17:36,stocks,"I just went into a Long John Silvers and the place was popping, doesn’t mean I’d invest in them"
2021-06-22 02:12:05,stocks,Good job. I never see the economy so good
2021-06-22 08:13:45,stocks,Dave and Busters was one of my best pandemic plays over the past year. Haven't been in 16 years but I think I owe them a visit now!
2021-06-22 08:24:10,stocks,unemployment hits new highs yet businesses all need workers XD
2021-06-22 09:35:07,stocks,"I frequently travel between New York, California and Florida. It’s amazing to see the radical shift. FL never really locked down, but when NY shut- they really shut down. Which is amazing when you consider the majority of us were cooped up in our 500 square foot apartments, looking out our 18 inch windows at freedom (if we even had a window). 

I remember walking down Times Square in May 2020 and it was quite literally empty- I should have taken a picture; probably never seeing it empty again. 

Now the place is bustling- trains are packed, streets are crowded, and having to schedule restaurant reservations 3-4 weeks out in some places. 

I bought SPG and a handful of restaurants, retailers, and leisure (DRI, CAKE, FL, cruise lines etc) in August and they outperformed almost everything else I own now.

I love tech (about 70% tech heavy) but when I see the unrelenting crowds I can’t help but load the boat with more “boring” stocks even when some are hitting well above pre-pandemic levels. Took on debt? Sure. Diluted shares? Sure. P/E ratios high? Sure. But I’m a simple investor. I buy what I like. The best of breed will gobble up market share of those that didn’t survive."
2021-06-22 04:19:25,stocks,Sounds like a waste of time
2021-06-22 02:10:53,stocks,What’s your point?
2021-06-22 08:20:18,stocks,This is why I bought 10k worth of LVMUY a few months ago.
2021-06-22 08:58:12,stocks,thanks for the effort. Maybe do another visit in a week or 2?
2021-06-22 09:04:17,stocks,Really curious to know exactly which malls you’re talking about.
2021-06-22 09:14:32,stocks,Very interesting.  One thing I learned in the last few years was that companies that are hiring often beat the market.
2021-06-22 16:57:46,stocks,I’ve also noticed Nordstrom is doing well in my area
2021-06-22 19:19:17,stocks,"One thing for sure, I don't care where you live, there's help wanted signs every where. Don't count on a big crash coming soon."
2021-06-22 09:10:13,stocks,"The Bay Area is only slightly more representative of the real world than Disney World. 

Still appreciate the info, but I think a more attainable area would make more sense for this kind of thing (think Chicago, Dallas, Denver, Minneapolis for instance). Wetzel's Pretzels isn't even a thing to much or most of the country for one."
2021-06-22 08:49:54,stocks,"Sounds like people are out, looking to economically signal again. Unfortunately few will take up jobs. Help needed everywhere. And production still needs massive  help as well so other goods may not be there for the buy."
2021-06-22 08:38:41,stocks,Most people shop online and you also did this ‘study’ in an area with lots of wealthy people who didn’t lose their jobs during the pandemic
2021-06-22 07:41:23,stocks,Enjoy it while you can though millions of americans are facing evictions and about 15% of mortgages are at least two months behind on payments.You get a surge of shopping because people feel good treating themselves then reality hits when the bills start to roll in.
2021-06-22 05:39:32,stocks,Bruh no one cares about mallsZ you live in the Bay Area lmao where the cost of living is double anywhere else. The Bay Area is not an indication of the market and economy. 90% of Americans couldn’t even afford to live there…. Your delusional
2021-06-22 04:49:37,stocks,I doubt it walk around I love in the area there are tons of boarded up buildings of old shopping centers and lots of for lease signs. Bloomingdales mall was fairly busy but I didn't wanna bother buying anything with such a high mark-up at that mall
2021-06-22 12:12:42,stocks,So much hate from basement dwellers in here. Glad you got out and combined it with market research. No reporting will give you data that fresh.
2021-06-22 11:14:50,stocks,The “Now Hiring” isn’t a demand for workers. It’s people not willing to work while supplemental unemployment $$ still being paid. That party is slowly but surely ending & leeches will be back to work lol
2021-06-22 03:41:26,stocks,"My fiancée went to the Westfield in San Francisco to buy some shoes a few weeks ago, prior to full reopening. The mall itself was pretty empty, but there were lines of Chinese tourists buying multiple pairs of shoes at Ecco. I’m not at all surprised that you’re seeing the most business at luxury brands.

Also, the Away store in Hayes Valley had a line out the door on Saturday. I guess everyone’s splurging on new luggage for their first trip in over a year!"
2021-06-22 07:11:52,stocks,Westfield valley fair?
2021-06-22 09:15:20,stocks,Yes people are out like a mofo
2021-06-22 13:12:17,stocks,"One data point that is in a wealthy area with a good climate isn't good enough to extrapolate how the economy is doing. Shops in Beverly Hills, or equivalent in Dubai are probably doing great too. Head to more rural, or poorer areas:)"
2021-06-22 17:12:55,stocks,"Try going to a mall located outside of one of the wealthiest counties in the country.

This is as dumb as asking a minimum wage burger flipping teenager what they think of the income tax rates."
2021-06-22 02:27:44,stocks,With some of that fake cheese :)
2021-06-22 05:45:23,stocks,a sweet pretzel and then look out for me
2021-06-22 02:26:53,stocks,Mmmm sour cream
2021-06-22 09:32:33,stocks,Why
2021-06-22 14:13:54,stocks,"I recently was at several malls in Atlanta. The kind with a Macy's and Costco near by. Not high-end. They were poppin'. Mall was full, lines to check out. Lots of people had shopping bags."
2021-06-22 08:23:55,stocks,"Exactly this. A lot of dismissive comments but would they dismiss Yeti going from 12 to 90 in less than two years? All you had to do was pay attention to what people had in their hands. 

And if you live in/near a college town? Fucking gold mine if you pay attention. Especially female trends (Wall Street slow to act. ULTA anyone?)"
2021-06-22 13:47:00,stocks,"Absolutely. In 2012 you could've seen that ""everyone"" was on FB and a $20 price was a steal for the future. 

Same with ""everyone"" using Venmo then Paypal acquired them back in 2013. 

Same with Monster Energy if you were lucky enough to foresee the energy drink mania that began in the 2000s. There was a LONG period of time between energy drinks going from a niche product to stocked in every grocery store and gas station, to the rise in stock price. Years, maybe nearly a decade. 


Same with ~2017 or so, you started to see Square payment processors EVERYWHERE at retail and restaurant kiosks. 

Hindsight is 20/20 but the Peter Lynch advice ""buy good companies that you understand"" is as relevant today as ever."
2021-06-22 19:10:43,stocks,Or try buying a house and see that Zillow is the defacto standard and the whole agent process is not worth the fees involved.
2021-06-22 15:39:51,stocks,"I noticed this with my friend who runs a hedge fund.  Every time we go out, he's asking businesses lots of questions.  ""Are you guys advertising a lot on facebook?"" ""How do people hear about you?""  ""You guys busy lately?""

Basic things that I couldn't care less about as a consumer, but an easy conversation to start with any employee/employer."
2021-06-22 19:48:52,stocks,Legend Peter had it easier as he was not competing with computers. My baby brother programmed those computer for Chase. It is losers game now.

2021-06-22 10:08:35,stocks,Great Mall and Valley Fair
2021-06-22 10:17:48,stocks,So Wetzel's has lots to room for growth you say? ;)
2021-06-22 12:43:17,stocks,And also have time to travel to and aimlessly wander around a shopping center.
2021-06-22 09:01:08,stocks,"Americans evicted for payments are not going to spend money at Nordstrom, Luis Vuitton. The OP comments are still valid."

2021-06-22 15:11:52,stocks,"I do retail analysis for a living, and it's just a point I try and get home when looking and observing shopping behavior.  Living in North NJ, demographically we faired much better then the mean with income disruption over the last 15 months,  and in many cases have a plethora of spending power for GM where this money would have gone to experiences in prior years.  North NJ or other affluent areas vs rural areas, or areas reliant on travel have seen an absolutely different time over the last months.

Even before COVID, I would do store visits in central PA, southern NJ, basically outside of my bubble, and you cant help observe while you shop, so you know your area through osmosis (lack of a better word)."

AMC seems to be almost back to pre-pandemic levels so about 20% capacity. I do love going to the movies and use to use the AMC pass and prefer it over Regal. At least where I am they have big recliner seats, things are more spaced out and I like that I can order food ahead of time."

Also when I go insolvent and/or die it's still his money 100%.

My challenge: Make the boy wise enough to not waste it on sports cars an other liabilities, instead keep investing and spend moderately. If he chooses the wise path, I will keep feeding his depot with money until he has his own life supporting income source. If he chooses to make a 50k world travel and buys a Porsche... then financial support will stop. Also if I recognize he joined WSB xD

Edit: As another redditor noted, it is totally feasible to go insolvent AND die."

Safe Option; Index Funds (S&P500), BlueChip Companies (Apple, Google, Amazon) 

Risky Option; Individual stocks, growing markets (Tesla) or even crypto if they allow it. 

You’re extremely lucky to have something built for you early so in my true opinion go for option one and when you get consistent disposable income then go for option 2."

2021-06-22 01:07:02,stocks,"I started investing during college and graduated last year. If you really never want to worry about it, get a financial advisor. If you want to save money, invest into an index fund or several ETFs. This really depends on how much you have to invest. 

My recommendation and what I did:  
Invest in an index fund such as VTI.  
Set up automatic deposits and try to maximize your Roth IRA or 401k, or both, depending on your financial situation.  
For investing, learn as you go. I really enjoy stocks, statistics, and finance. So I read about investing strategies, stocks, economical situations, etc. I like learning. The more I learned the more I moved away from VTI. Not that VTI sucks, but I’m young and wanted to actually invest based on what I learned, see my hard work pay off or go up in flames. Statistically, the market is more likely to outperform me. But it’s a risk im willing to take. 
Also, since you’re young, don’t be afraid to take on more risk. Im not saying start yoloing on options of stocks you didn’t research but just saw on the front page, but you can definitely start taking more risk than purchasing VTI. 

But honestly, if you set up automatics deposits, utilize tax-advantaged account, and buy VTI, very hard for you to go wrong."

AAPL 10.5%

MSFT 13.4%

GOOGL 3.9%

AMZN 2.7%

NVDA 8.8%

Total: 39.3%

Meaning that it has to grow significantly each year from now to match that valuation. Of all those companies, it has by far the highest amount of priced in growth. Which does make sense, because it's the smallest of those and smaller companies will grow faster. But for comparison, right now Microsoft has about 10x the free cash flow of nvidia but only 4x the market cap. Meaning, relative to Microsoft, nvidia is pricey. Also, Facebook has about 5x the free cash flow of nvidia and 2x the market cap- almost exactly half of Microsoft, meaning Microsoft and Facebook basically have the same valuation ratio. So to reach the same valuation ratio of Microsoft and Facebook, Nvidia would have to grow 2.5x faster yoy then both of them.

And this growth would have to eventually be in the form of free cash flow."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"DCA and Cost Basis I am a little confused about DCA and how it effects your cost basis, particularly when you feel it's time to sell some amount of the position.

Let's say you start a small position in Stock A at $100 a share. The market has a bad week and Stock A drops to $80 a share. You decide Stock A is undervalued, seeing as you were happy to invest $100 a share, so you buy a bunch at this level, bringing your cost basis to ~ $85.

Stock A begins to see an uptrend, and you decide to trim some of your position at $90 seeing that your position is now profitable. Since virtually every broker defaults to FIFO (First In, First Out) wouldn't you first be selling your initial shares at a loss since they were purchased at $100?  Is there any way to avoid this or have this calculated differently, other than manually selecting the individual lots as some brokers allow?"
2021-06-21 20:51:20,stocks,"You can set your preference with your broker. Usually you have three options, FIFO, LIFO, and average."
2021-06-21 21:09:15,stocks,"Let’s say you had 100 at $100 and 100 at $80. This means your cost basis is $90. 

If the share price went to $95 you would have an unrealised gain of $5 x 200 = $1,000. 

If you decided to sell some, say 50, and have the option to choose tax lots you could sell 50 of the $80 lot, which would give you a gain of $15 x 50 = $750 and you would have to pay the relevant tax or you could choose to sell 50 of the $100 for a loss of $5 x 50 = ($250) and you may be able to use this as a loss for tax purposes (depending where you live). 

In my first example your remaining lots would be worth $250 (if share share price stays at $95), and the second would be worth $1,250. 

It mostly comes down to what you want to do tax wise.

Does that help?"
2021-06-21 20:53:17,stocks,"You can pick from the major cost basis methods with most brokers. The right one for you is always situationally dependent and it can be switched, it just can’t be changed after you complete a sale, only going forward.

There are just too many variables for anyone on a forum to offer a simple suggestion that will be optimal for you. Good luck.
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Just Kicking Myself This morning at the open I looked at FIGS.  IBD drew my attention to it over the weekend.  But it was up about a quarter and I thought it was a little too much past a buy point and I didn’t want to chase it.  Got home tonight and saw where it was up 17.06%.  Don’t you just hate those woulda, shoulda, coulda’s?"
2021-06-21 20:37:47,stocks,"If you believe in the company, sell puts right?  It drops to where you are comfortable, you have to buy it there. If it doesn’t, take your premium and walk a way a winner."

2021-06-21 21:44:43,stocks,"My thing with FIGS is that it is like LULU for scrubs, it has a following. Problem is the market is small, no one outside of healthcare is gonna buy them, but you have people who never go to the gym who by LULU"
2021-06-21 20:33:13,stocks,Was on my watchlist as something to catch on a pullback.  Just sitting here watching it like a 🤡
2021-06-21 21:17:05,stocks,"Not as bad as me and KNBE last week. Know the company from working in IT, wanted in but saw it had gone up 6% which I thought was a lot and would for sure drop the next day… it’s up more than 50% since then."
2021-06-22 00:23:48,stocks,"Stock trades are risk assessments, nothing more. 

Instead of wishing you had a time machine, remember why you didn’t pull the trigger. Try to go back and see what info was firmly and concretely available to you that you didn’t act on. Remember what made you nervous enough to not jump in."
2021-06-21 22:41:22,stocks,Well why didnt you buy it? You either need to have more risk tolerance or just eat the missed opportunities.
2021-06-21 23:39:40,stocks,"Yep. Told myself I'd take a big bite of CTXR if it hit close to $1.50 again weeks back. It did, and I hesitated then didn't wanna fomo on the way up. FML."
2021-06-22 00:12:12,stocks,Figs is a very popular brand of scrubs that nurses wear because they are very comfortable to wear and also stylish.
2021-06-22 00:54:05,stocks,I put 1k into wi$h and watched it jump 20% yesterday...I’m crying I didn’t put in more.

2021-06-21 22:48:58,stocks,I like this strategy
2021-06-22 00:52:57,stocks,"Brilliant, is there any downside with this strategy ...say with aapl for example? How much do I lose if it crashes hard?"
2021-06-21 20:42:22,stocks,The thing is I do believe in the company.  I just stuck to my disciplined plan.  Ugh
2021-06-21 21:58:15,stocks,You are correct but this stock chart was screaming at me to buy it.  It was a good set up for an IPO stock.  I just don’t chase after a 5% move up and today’s slight move at the open had it up 6% so I held off.  It proceeded to go up another 16% throughout the day.
2021-06-22 07:46:16,stocks,"Not just for nurses, all healthcare workers. I work in healthcare at a large hospital, a lot of us have not gone back to business clothes and never will. A lot of my partners have bought figs scrubs. I don't have them because I'm cheap, but I also didn't buy a Yeti cooler. This is how I view Figs. No moat, but a cult base and growing adoption due to product quality and a shifting macro trend. I own enough figs stocks to buy enough pairs for life probably. Did the same thing with PTON, bought early, still don't have one but have enough just in the stock"
2021-06-21 22:44:52,stocks,"I’m a nurse, and I don’t see it being valued at 5 billion dollars."
2021-06-21 21:45:04,stocks,Do you mean that company that was worth $4 billion dollars this morning?
2021-06-21 21:40:36,stocks,"I really don’t worry about valuations in IPO’s but I do like trading in them as they break out of a first stage base.

So do you also think everyone should sell their TSLA shares?"
2021-06-21 21:49:28,stocks,This was just going to be a trade for me.  It’s what I do.  I don’t think I have ever held a stock over 3 months in my life.
2021-06-22 00:15:46,stocks,The other thing is LULU has branched out into tech with the mirror. Can't imagine that being a thing for scrubs (maybe sleeping pods? I don't know shit about the medical industry)
2021-06-21 20:36:02,stocks,I also thought about buying some calls.  I just missed out on my best percentage day ever.
2021-06-21 22:45:21,stocks,I am a disciplined trader and stick to my plan.  It was 6% past my buy point so the risk/reward right there isn’t where I want it to be.
2021-06-22 02:04:59,stocks,The premiums I’ve collected running the wheel on NIO and RUN have been enough to keep the lights on.
2021-06-22 01:01:01,stocks,"Well technically any stock CAN go to 0. So I believe your potential loss is going to be 100 X the strike you sold the put for.

Edit:  put plainly the downside is you could wind up paying more for the stock than it’s trading for on the market if it crashes deep below your strike.  However, that would put you in the same place you’d have been if you bought it before the spike, held and then crashed."
2021-06-22 05:28:45,stocks,"Say you sell an AAPL put at $100. That means you need $10,000 as collateral. So your downside includes the opportunity cost of what else you could've done with the $10,000."
2021-06-22 05:53:02,stocks,Amateur. You’ll learn that you ALWAYS never stick to the plan... sometimes...
2021-06-21 22:23:50,stocks,Going up is not indicative of a screaming buy.
2021-06-22 07:50:16,stocks,"Fwiw I have the same scrubs from training 10yrs ago. Pockets are ripping, but I just sew them back on. Its a point of pride, I can buy 2 sets with 1hr of work. I did buy yeti stock too. I am long Figs"
2021-06-22 07:28:11,stocks,"Ditto. They're a trend and there's nothing special or proprietary about them. Like all fads, it will fade."

actually I do, its crazy overvalued, so bad example"
2021-06-22 02:11:19,stocks,"Still crazy to me that they are just building magic mirrors (cheap, open source raspberry pi project for years) and selling them to fools"

2021-06-22 13:19:01,stocks,That’s fair.  I don’t do this on anything trading over like $40 for that reason.
2021-06-22 08:28:17,stocks,always...
2021-06-21 22:27:10,stocks,"I said screaming at me to buy it.  Not screaming buy.  Reading is hard,"
2021-06-22 13:31:45,stocks,"I agree that the quality is amazing and it looks better than the traditional scrub but no Nurses other than those in US wear scrubs, and not all nurses that have to wear scrubs will spend that amount on a figs. 
To add onto that, they last forever so I don’t see any recurring income for them from existing customers.."
2021-06-21 21:46:24,stocks,Lol.  Good.  I’m right there with you on that one.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Tax question regarding long/short term gains Say I purchased 50 shares of XYZ for $30 in January and 50 more shares of XYZ at $25 in June. If next February I sell all 100 shares at $40, how is the stock I bought in January taxed versus the June shares? Is one considered long term vs the other which is short term?"
2021-06-21 20:37:39,stocks,"If you sold all 100 shares, the gains on the 50 shares you held for more than one year would be considered long-term. If you sold less than 100, tax treatment of gains or loses would depend on which shares were sold."
2021-06-21 21:08:04,stocks,"Even though you sold them in a single transaction, it will show as two transactions, first lot as long-term and second lot as short-term."
2021-06-22 01:33:06,stocks,"Technically it also depends on what type of stocks you own, but we will assume they are of a type that are subject to short/long term treatment for you. 

50 shares with a gain of $500 would be long term, and 50 shares with a gain of $750 would be short term/ordinary income. 

I’ve oversimplified this as adjustments might be available to your cost basis/gain.

Not advice, please speak to a qualified tax professional."
2021-06-22 00:00:46,stocks,I'm going to suggest 2Dys answer isn't.  Biden & Dims are going to change the rules on this B4 we file taxes in 2022 for 2021.  JMO.
2021-06-21 20:48:11,stocks,Agree with this comment
2021-06-21 20:01:48,stocks,I understand that but I’m trying to figure out if the shares that are over 12 months in the same stock are still taxed short term since I bought more shares for a shorter term
2021-06-21 20:06:34,stocks,It depends on the tax lot. You can see the shares purchased and the lot. Fidelity will show short and long term holdings.
2021-06-21 20:03:20,stocks,Depends on the tax methodology you use FIFO would mean they would be long term if I’m understanding you correctly
2021-06-21 22:59:04,stocks,[deleted]
2021-06-21 23:03:26,stocks,"Well I think OP is talking in hypotheticals that’s why they said “if next February”. If they do FIFO long term for the 50 shares they bought in January. LIFO would be short term and weighted avg would be a mix.

Also I feel like I’m doing old finance class word problems 😂"
2021-06-21 23:12:48,stocks,Oh yea. My bad. I was going through to change up my post immediately after my reply. But had decided to just delete. Because felt you were right. But I think OP was just having trouble understanding that it’s 2 separate groupings of stocks lol. So you’re rule was gonna be too advanced for their knowledge level having not seen a brokerage statement and what it’d look like. Rather than 1 grouping.
2021-06-21 23:13:45,stocks,Yea honestly kind of what I was worried about when I answered but I think I gave them enough bread crumbs and google/investopedia can take the wheel
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,What do you guys think is going to happen in the market in the short term in terms of Inflation? It's going to be very interesting to see how the market reacts to inflation especially since well known analyst are predicting indexes to fall 10-20% in the coming months. What do you guys think will happen and which major index do you guys think will be the most affected and take the biggest hit?
2021-06-21 20:33:50,stocks,"Not a chance in hell of another major correction this year barring some new catalyst.  

Inflation in commodities is already dissipating except for oil as production and transportation issues get worked out.  

The money printer the fed has been using in buying up debt is fine as long as worker productivity and consumer/corporate spending match expectations - which aren't that high.  They are looking for 90-95% of 2019 numbers.  

If we don't hit that with ~5% unemployment and decreasing it would be very, very odd.

TLDR; the markets go up this year."
2021-06-21 20:30:27,stocks,"Well just based on the number of places having to increase wages to attract workers and the other places that can't maintain business because lack of workers..... this will affect earnings.... higher inflation (raw materials and labor) which will cause lower earnings.  Stock market won't be able to grow earnings enough to match the already inflated stock prices. 

So, either the market flattens out, or the big guys get out fast (either to take profits or hedge against rising interest rates)  and the market falls."
2021-06-21 20:59:39,stocks,Who cares.  Nothing will matter to any of us in 100 years when we're rotting away in a casket with worms eating our bodies.
2021-06-21 20:54:13,stocks,"Nothing. The market believes the large upswing in inflation is transitory and inflation will eventually come back down to normal levels soon enough. Besides, with the fed buying 120 billion in bonds every month, where else is money supposed to go?"
2021-06-22 19:27:05,stocks,The economy is just getting rev'ed up. Help wanted signs everywhere. Inflation won't matter. Earnings will.
2021-06-21 20:02:58,stocks,Inflation is bullish but so is deflation so who cares!
2021-06-22 05:26:07,stocks,The numbers aren't realistic because of supply chain issues. That's the transient nature of current inflation numbers. Doom and gloom is always great for clicks.
2021-06-21 22:30:44,stocks,"Nice Bear doom-porn. People have been saying stuff like that for ages. 

If interest rates go up, it'll be because the economy is running hot and inflation is sustaining above 3%. As long as interest rates are below 5%, the best place to be is stocks."
2021-06-21 23:46:11,stocks,If inflation will never exist and rates never raised then what? Any negatives of that?
2021-06-22 15:53:46,stocks,Deflation will happen after reopening of the major major economies because of tech advances and efficiency in manufacturing. Its been happening before covid and will continue afterwards. Don’t underestimate humanities ability to produce consumables efficiently and cheaply.
2021-06-21 20:40:32,stocks,RemindMe!  100 days
2021-06-22 01:16:53,stocks,"Ok, thank you for this valuable insight"

2021-06-22 10:46:58,stocks,That's what I was wondering about. If the feds never see inflation and never raise rates then are there implications of that?
2021-06-22 10:58:08,stocks,"They are not stupid. They can see inflation but they are seeing it as transitory. Which tbh the CPI data backs up. After every recession things like Used Cars and Lumber spike in price because poorer people who lost their jobs, find new jobs and need to get a car to travel this demand for used car goes up. Similar for lumber in the construction industry (except add the inelastic supply). 

Personally I won't be too worried about inflation, it will reach 3.5% at the end of the year and next year it will got back to 2% a year and then IR will increase subsequently. There are good arguments for why inflation is not transitory. But most arguments about inflation being long lasting is fear mongering and they don't know what they are talking about or they are seeing the policies in vacuum.

That being said, I am a big proponent of MMT and many stockpickers do not like or agree with"
2021-06-22 11:15:03,stocks,"MMT works if you use all the tools in the tool box...

The way to beat this is by taxing the excess cash out of the system but there is absolutely no appetite for that and the Dems don't control the senate.

If you can only use rates to fight the battle MMT is useless.

And you're right, they're not stupid which is why if inflation was anything but transitory they wouldn't say anything because it would plunge us back into recession."
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Is it smart to just put all my savings in S&P Global and hold? I did that and I'm up 5% in three weeks, if I kept and didn't cash out half a year ago I'd be up 50%. I feel like it's just worth holding it because Buffet said S&P is basically investing in the world. The graph has also been going up steadily over decades. I mean to me it's either S&P or Amazon to go all in with, but idk what are your thoughts."
2021-06-21 21:06:33,stocks,A good rule of thumb is any savings beyond your 3-6 month emergency fund can be invested as aggressively or conservatively as you want.
2021-06-21 23:30:55,stocks,"I’m not sure what you’re asking. If you’re asking if you should just buy the S&P and hold it, then yes you should. If you’re asking if you should dump all your savings into investing, the answer is no. You need an emergency fund of 3-6 months expenses."
2021-06-21 21:52:32,stocks,When do you want the money back?
2021-06-21 22:36:53,stocks,Consider equal weight ETF like RSP. Rest of the ETF’s that are market weighted are risky as 22% of their portfolio comes from 5-6 companies
2021-06-21 23:35:35,stocks,Seems like you want a ticket for ramsey cult
2021-06-21 23:42:13,stocks,Sp500 yes
2021-06-22 09:08:38,stocks,Not all. You definitely want to have some cash at hand to average down in the case of a large dip
2021-06-22 19:04:19,stocks,"Nooo that’s pretty stupid don’t do it, invest in GME instead"
2021-06-21 22:43:15,stocks,Yes the general recommendation is to just buy index consistently and hold if you want hands off investing.
2021-06-21 23:03:34,stocks,Definitely a safe choice but wouldn’t say “smart” or not smart. The potential is exponentially higher otherwise but the risks are greater as well
2021-06-22 01:54:35,stocks,Brk.b I personally think is better than the s&p.
2021-06-21 21:01:03,stocks,No. QQQ.
2021-06-22 17:29:30,stocks,Dude you bought s&p global. The company I used to work for. They handle the construction of the s&p 500 index. S&p global does not equal the s&p 500.
2021-06-22 19:33:56,stocks,Probably gonna be downvoted for this but I wouldn't invest in anything atm because we are on the verge of a huge crash. The market is already starting to bleed. I would hold off and wait.

2021-06-22 10:14:43,stocks,"*You are not holding the thing you think you are holding*, nor the thing that Warren Buffett and others commonly reference.  SPGI is not related to the Standard & Poor's 500 (S&P) index."
2021-06-22 02:53:28,stocks,"I wasn't able to find the exact Buffet quote you're referencing, but based on his other statements, I suspect he was talking about the **S&P 500 Index** and not **S&P Global** (which is a company and the thing you bought). 

The S&P 500 Index is a list of the 500 biggest companies in the United States and is viewed as the gold standard of diversified investments with good returns. Basically every big company you've ever heard of is in the S&P 500, which is why you can think of it as ""investing in the world."" 

S&P Global, which you've bought shares in, is the company that maintains this list, as well as a bunch of other stock markety things. They are kind of supporting characters on Wall Street, doing stuff for big investment firms (like Goldman Sachs) and banks and stuff. It's a perfectly good business model, but it's a very specific business model, and definitely not ""investing in the world."""
2021-06-22 19:37:56,stocks,"You should sell this and buy SPY or VTI. SPGI is not the stock market index investment, it's the company that publishes lists of stocks, etc. SPY is the SP500 index you can invest in, VTI is the total market. 

Make sure you keep 6 months of your needs in cash in a savings account before you invest."

2021-06-21 21:59:42,stocks,That's all gibberish to me.  All I know is the Fed won't let the market crash. If they let the markets crash people will be out in the streets.  They don't want that to happen and you shouldn't either.
2021-06-22 02:46:01,stocks,but how will they stop it? They are running out of tricks?
2021-06-22 02:52:07,stocks,"No they're not.  Do you want the market to crash and elderly people to lose the money they rely on?  That's why the Fed holds it up.

Many people rely on their 401ks to live on.  America will tumble if the market dives and stays down for years.  Smart people know this and won't let it happen.  That's why the average Joe isn't in charge of the Fed."
2021-06-22 04:27:07,stocks,"lol dude I never said thats what I wanted. I said they are running out of tricks. which is true. That gibberish up there you off-handedly brushed aside matters, what the rates are, how much we are currently leveraged, the way the market is currently behaving, it all matters.

I know a crash is going to happen, there is going to be a correction, it's just a matter of when and how bad. Anyone with 2 cents in their head is moving their 401ks around to try and prevent damage from it whether it takes 6 months or 6 years."
2021-06-22 04:59:06,stocks,"Right.  We all know there will be a crash.  There will always be a crash in the future.  So what.  There was a crash last March 2020.  There was one last September, one in February this year.  So what ....

The Fed is not going to allow a prolonged bear market any time soon.  It will be the detriment of America.  It won't happen!

And there's no way to know how to move things around in your 401k.  Most people index and don't touch their 401ks save for adding money every week.

You are trying to time the market.  Good luck.

Besides crashes are good.  Things are on sale!"

From what i understand the index is required to purchase shares of the asset once it becomes part of their index. For example a stock i like a lot, KMPH, is being added to the Russell 2000 and 3000 index monday. Since the index must purchase the asset in large amounts, is the price not guranteed to increase at a meaningful percentage? Why should i not buy calls for this event. Surely it’s not this easy which is why and insight would be appreciated."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Company Moved the Ex-Dividend Date? I tried my hand at a couple of dividend capture moves over the past week or two. 

Checking the Nasdaq dividend calendar on Friday 06/11/2021, I saw that Extended Stay America(STAY) had an ex-dividend date for that Monday 06/14/2021. Pay date of 06/17/2021 at $1.75 per share.

I bought the stock that Friday morning. Held it until the ex-dividend date and then sold on the ex-dividend date. I know the stock normally drops by the dividend amount, but the stock had increased, so I sold to avoid any drops later. I did that on both Robinhood and my traditional broker. 

To date I have not received a dividend from my broker. Robinhood paid me a dividend on 06/16/2021, but then revoked it on 06/17/21. I should have received about $1500 total.

On 06/17 Nasdaq, marketwatch, robinhood, my brokerage, and other market research sites that I visited weren't able to show any data for STAY. By the next day, some were showing the 16th or 17th as the ex-dividend date. (I posted one of the articles that guided my originalndecidion to buy below, to be sure I wasnt crazy and making a huge mistake on my part). 

I called my brokerage and initially they were telling me I sold on the wrong day, but I corrected them and showed that based on the information I had, I bought and sold on time. They also double checked and agreed, so they made a ticket for me that they say they have escalated to specialists, so I'm waiting to hear back. 

How common is it for a company to move its dividend date or cancel a dividend?

I know that STAY just went through a merger, but shouldn't the people who are due dividends get paid regardless if they had the shares when they were supposed to?


https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/extended-stay-america-inc.-stay-ex-dividend-date-scheduled-for-june-14-2021-2021-06-11"
2021-06-21 20:23:34,stocks,The special dividend was part of the acquisition of STAY by BXMT and Starwood. I think you needed to hold the stock through the acquisition to get the dividend along with cash for the buyout. Just a guess on my part.
2021-06-21 20:42:08,stocks,You made a booboo
2021-06-22 08:04:08,stocks,"That's probably what I should have done, but didn't see the need given the dividend dates reported were what they were.

But based on the email I got from Robinhood, it looks like STAY reported the wrong dividend dates and then moved it to ""correct"" it."
2021-06-21 22:08:06,stocks,"The nasdaq article doesn't say it had to be settled, it just had to be recorded as being purchased before the ex-dividend date. 

But I see that I did get an email from Robinhood explaining why they revoked the dividend they paid me:

""The Robinhood team would like to inform you of an adjustment that's being made to your 6/16/21 STAY dividend.

The dividend was initially paid with an ex-dividend date of 6/14/21. This means that shareholders who purchased shares on or after 6/14/21 were not eligible for the dividend. Conversely, shareholders who sold their shares on or after 6/14/21 were still eligible.

Yesterday, Robinhood was informed by the DTCC that the correct ex-date was actually 6/16/21, in order to match the cash merger event. This means that shareholders who sold their shares between 6/14/21 and 6/16/21 were paid this dividend incorrectly, and they will have their dividend removed.""

Based on that email, STAY reported the wrong ex-dividend date. Because Nasdaq, Robinhood, and several other sites listed the ex-dividend date at 06/14/21. That's not my fault."
2021-06-22 08:54:13,stocks,"That's not why. As I posted above, Robinhood said that I woukd have been entitled to the dividend at that original date, which is why they paid me the dividend in the first place. 

They took it back because the dividend dates that were reported were different from what they should have been."

If you are investing for the next 40 or 50 years my first suggestion would be to look outside the US.  If you look at GDP per capita it will be much easier to double in India than in the US.  Take a look at demographics.  If you look at a chart that shows the number of people in each age group you will see that China is very challenged for many years to come.  Most of the European countries have lousy demographics too.  Again, India is well placed as are many Asian and African countries.

&#x200B;

If you look at ""form of government"" you will find there are lots of issues with communism/socialism -- these aren't good places to invest.  The government is too well placed to take your money.

&#x200B;

It is fine to put some of the money into US stocks.  I would rather buy into a small cap fund that allows for companies that succeed to stay in the fund longer (not an ETF).  I would then buy a set of Emerging market mutual funds -- stick to buying the best countries and not broad funds that are just full of China (you want the places that will be growing for decades).

Is this all your money? Then as a student who is likely graduating in a few years and entering the adult world, I’d DCA into the same ETFs, a grand per month.

2021-06-22 02:51:46,stocks,"Start off by paying any debt. Credit card, student loans, etc. Getting rid of interest could save you a higher % than you could safely earn on the same capital (depending on the numbers ofc). That frees up your cashflow for potentially years to come and nothing can change it, because it's the result of a lack of debit as opposed to the value of an asset.

After that, make sure you have a way to make money (your degree may or may not have that covered). If you can't find a job then a $1000 certification course / boot camp / etc. could be the best way to make sure you don't come up short while waiting for your investments to mature, and get you putting more money into investments on a faster timeline.

After debts and income are covered, stocks are a great investment. Other commenters will have better advice than me on that, but I recommend starting slow with reasonably conservative index funds until you learn your way around."

2021-06-22 05:39:40,stocks,"I'm a regular over at /r/superstonk so my answer is going to be pretty obvious, but I'm 25 and here are my thoughts. Currently you're young enough that you can lose a decent bit of that cash and it won't negatively affect your life too much. You don't have a mortgage or kids and although if you did lose some money you'd be missing out on opportunities, your risk tolerance should be as high as it's ever going to be. With that said I'm 100% not recommending you YOLO into ANYTHING. As a new investor you shouldn't be playing with anything more than 20% of what you've got. 

Currently the markets seem to be on a bit of a knife's edge. I wouldn't want to be storing all my money on anything (even 'safe' stocks or the SPY). 

My honest recommendation is to put 5k on GME as lotto tickets (although IMO the DD checks out and it's more of an inevitability than a lotto ticket - please read into anything before putting your money there), and then I'd invest an additional 5k in something to learn the markets and get some growth going in a case where the entire US financial system doesn't collapse within the next 6 months. 

My personal hedge for the latter scenario is in steel. We're in a commodity super cycle and steel stocks are all massively undervalued (CLF, MT, STLD, VALE - you name it). If you're interested in learning more, check out /r/Vitards. Plenty of info there.

2021-06-21 22:51:11,stocks,"I mean, when I was 22 (2002) I bought 100 shares of AAPL for $14/shares (this might have been 2003, but it was either 2002 or 2003).  I sold about a year later when I'd basically doubled my money. If I'd held those without selling anything, today I would have 5,600 shares worth about $739,000 at today's closing price.

So, the easy answer is that I would tell my 22 year old self, spend the $50,000 on AAPL, get 3,571 shares with that money circa 2002 and don't sell. Then my current 41 year old self would have 199,975 shares just from the splits (I.e. not including any reinvested dividends) worth approximately $26.4 Million at today's closing price. And I could retire.

So, that is an easy answer for me.

If we're not playing the ""back to the future"" game, I would tell myself to ""be boring"" and invest that $50,000 in some low cost funds/ETFs at about 70% VTI/30% VXUS (or equivalent), set them to reinvest dividends and pretend like you don't know that money even exists.

This is much more important that telling you how to allocate your money. YOU have to decide how to allocate your money. Learn while you're young!  Avoiding behavior errors will be more beneficial to you than anything else you could do.  Start with ""The Most Important Thing by Howard Marks"".  Why?, because it will teach you how to think correctly about the market. Then read ""The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham"". Once you know how to ""think"" about investing you'll be equipped to make your own allocation decision partially based on your personality and individual circumstances.

1. Put 20% in an S&P500 mutual fund to start.
2. Each month add $300-500 into the same mutual fund. 
3. Only 20% cumulative of your total money should ever go into other things like other ETFs or single stocks. And add to those gradually as well.

This advice is based on where the market currently is, at all time highs. If this were last summer, I’d tell you to put 80% in the mutual fund right away, and buy 10-12 other various large cap tech and dividend stocks with the rest.

By the time I was 30 I was making double that a year, and just about any intelligent person can.
 
When it comes to stocks, either go all the way or just go with some ETFs (VTI is a good one).  What I mean by going all the way is to learn and understand options, futures and all of that - because the best way to make money is to understand how other people are making money."

But man it's hard to watch her struggle. She still hasn't found a job after like two months on her own. I've sent her some money to get her by. It makes me feel like the biggest asshole to know that she's stressed and struggling and I have the means to give her a way better life...

But, I just can't. Not at the cost to my own future. I've got enough saved now I'm going to put it into some funds and live off the interest and travel for years indefinitely. Definitely couldn't do that while trying to take care of her.

2021-06-22 08:19:42,stocks,I always see advice saying to get a financial planner who you pay one time. A financial advisor pretty much makes a % of whatever you make which can take away thousands of dollars away from you over the years. They are a waste of money.
2021-06-22 00:58:01,stocks,I also would like to know. What happens if your investor loses all of your money? Is there an insurance for that?
2021-06-22 11:20:16,stocks,"I’m generally a big critic of financial advisors, however some people are not financially literate and have little capacity to become financially literate or no interest. These people benefit from having someone coach them and plan with them on savings rate, investments, spending, death plans, life insurance, timing retirement, to bounce stock ideas off of, how to adjust their investment from grow mode to conserve mode/income replacement mode, they also manage your company’s 401k plan, and more.

I have a coworker who hasn't felt comfortable investing and they are nearly 55. They have been primarily holding cash. And inflation is kicking their ass. They do still have a 401k so there is still some benefit happening.

Personally I don't employ a financial advisor despite having a sibling who is one. I don't like the fee to effort ratio. I feel similarly about real estate agents, maybe I'd feel differently in w different market."
2021-06-22 15:28:19,stocks,"I paid for a single session with a financial advisor to go over a plethora of things: the stock market, bonds, insurance, planning for my future etc. I knew absolutely nothing about investing at the time, so I learned a lot.

He then told me to invest in VTI and some other market indices, which have continued to make me money. (VTI had made 16.3% yearly return on average the past 5 years, though some financial gurus think growth will slow down).

Paying someone a fee to handle your money seems like a waste tbh unless you are hoping to beat the market, of which there is no guarantee."
2021-06-22 08:03:45,stocks,"I picked up a book at the thrift store to prepare certified financial advisors. It's called analysis of derivatives for the CFA program. Based on what I've read so far, they would look at risk and what is known about the stock at the time. I don't think they look at emerging trends, but compare current data on stocks.  Meaning, at the time AMZN was $200, I think the PE ratio was insane. You had to know more than just what an analysis comparing Amazon to Walmart would show you, and once you factor in risk, most CFA's would steer you away-I bet.

But they should be able to get you steady, safe returns in a steady market.

I'm only in chapter 2, so what do I know?! I didn't know about forward contracts til just yesterday!"

Public sentiment toward the stock market has never been higher, which is a very bad sign for the real value of the stock market.

2021-06-22 16:23:44,stocks,"The sub is perfect for new investors trying to get feedback. 

ETF's like SPY or something that tracks the S&P 500 are great.

If you're not a stock picker which is more or less most average investors, ETF's are perfect. Whether they're actively or passively managed, they're managed. Fund managers are incentivized to outperform every year. So how do you think they do that?

Take a look at the top 25 holdings today in SPY. Do they include some of the best companies in the world? And when do you think they were included in the SPY? Google in 2006, Amazon in 2005. Did you buy those companies before they were included?

If you did, you're amazing.  Eventually good companies get added to the fund, bad companies get taken out. Or their weights go up, or go down.

So sure, past performance is not indicative of future performance. And yea, it depends on when you got in, a high before a black swan event and you got crushed. But over time, there's a professional team working hard to make more money on your behalf, and they're goal, is to make more money. Buy the dip when this happens.

Everyone should have an index fund. VOO, VTI, VT, VXUS, SPY (or some other S&P 500 fund).  OP is well served buying an index fund, where the fund/management team is unlikely to screw up stock picking."

2021-06-22 03:07:39,stocks,"If you are averse to crashes then you’re saying you need the money soon. Or, if you don’t need the money soon and you’re averse to crashes, you don’t understand the market yet. Nothing wrong with that. 

There is zero chance of investing in stocks and avoiding crashes. It’s the avoidance of crashes that destroys wealth creation. Look at the long term chart of SPY. It goes down sometimes, and sometimes a lot, but over time the only direction is up. 

Not investing in stocks is essentially losing money. Inflation will destroy your savings. This is a mathematical fact. Meanwhile, when the market crashes, those of us in stocks will just keep buying, which only lowers our cost basis and increases our future returns for when the market rebounds. 

They key is to literally not care what happens to your money in the market. Much easier said than done, for many, but I can tell you from experience that buying more when the market is down is incredibly lucrative. 

Here’s a very popular saying from Warren Buffett: “Be greedy when others are fearful, and fearful when others are greedy.” What he’s saying is that people tend to get scared when the market is crashing and euphoric when it’s up. Logically, it should be the reverse: when the market is crashing everything is getting cheap, and future returns will be way higher."

Unless saving for a house or kids education, then your core savings should not be touched for any reason bar retirement (maybe a few small exceptions). If you want to touch savings for other reasons, have dedicated places to save them elsewhere. But you need to make a pot of money that is for retirement and keep it that way, untouched for decades."
2021-06-22 14:47:26,stocks,"You could also dollar cost average it in. Spread the sum up into 12 equal monthly payments and buy the same amount every month until you’re fully in. Not sure I would worry about it though, if you’re prepared to wait until 40 years from now to touch it."

2021-06-22 01:39:22,stocks,"Depends on your goals and strategy. If you’re buying large or mega cap stocks and holding  for years and decades, then love away. It’s more when you’re speculating on new or small cap companies and trying to make short term gains that falling in love with a stock can bite you - you put too much money in or keep averaging down, or you don’t sell when you should or worse, wait too long to cut your losses. Good examples: BB and PLTR - they’re both fine stocks if you just buy and forget about them for awhile, but there’s a borderline religion around them on some subreddits, waiting for the second coming (moon)."
2021-06-21 20:56:32,stocks,I agree in the buy and hold strategy was just trying to point out investors don't say buy rumor/sell news. And playing that game around mergers can backfire. Mergers can be good things like when Sprint and T mobile merged. You sold at that merger you would have missed out on some gains.
2021-06-21 21:08:53,stocks,"I said buy and sell the hype/news and not wait for the actual event like a merger. The stock shot up when merger was as approved and then I waited for the companies to merge and then nothing happened. The approval of the merger was a more lucrative play than when the companies actually merged. That was early in my investing. That was my best trade back then. I also bought Ford stock at $1 when they didn’t take bailout money while GM and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. I specifically advising separating investing from trading. There’s money to be made both ways. The buy and hold the goog, Amazon, FB, apples if held would’ve paid more than all of the trading I’ve done in those years. If that helps clarify."

2021-06-22 06:47:48,stocks,"To add. Try to find stocks that start off as growth stocks that will end in value stocks when you're getting closer to retiring.

For example. Aapl is a great example of a growth stock that has or is turning into a value stock. 

PayPal in ten or so years might very well start offering a dividend.

Interstingly, the growth stock that turned into value means you won hard the whole way up. And it matures along with you. I hope to have a handful of picks that I will be able to just hold for basically my whole life."

Someone could take that as the norm now is that SPY will have a 15% return or more; what I believe he is stating is that SPY has been outperforming its average return of 10%. He stated that the last 15 years used to predict the next 15 is a big mistake, and it is. He provided good reasons for it by citing the QE by the FED. If the economy crashes, the FED won’t have that much room for QE since they’ve already been doing it for the last 15 years instead of Quantitive Tightening. 

He provided a strong argument for his claim of using the last 15 years to the predict the next 15 would be a big mistake. He never stated it’s a mistake to invest in SPY or index funds. He just stated that just because recent history (15 years) has been kind to the market, doesn’t mean the next 15 will. It could be the annual rate of 10% of the last 100 years, or it could be even lower."

Basically you should get used to a 5% return and be happy.

BB on the other hand is not nearly as fundamentally sound. It’s far more one of those ‘big potential’ stocks that isn’t even growing. If you see big potential without growth, run for the hills unless you have some serious insider knowledge. PLTR is growing at 50% right now. That’s real potential."

It might even be worth getting into some dividend growth etf for the long term. Not just for having 40 years of income growth, but as a way of transferring cash from slower growth names into shares of high growth QQQ.  Balance the cycle so you do not panic out at the wrong time ( guilty of this myself ) and continually have cash coming in when life hits and makes you use your paycheck somewhere else."

Three months later they announce the PUA (I think ) [Pandemic Unemployment Assistance] to lower the restrictions and guidelines of who is eligible for unemployment. Allowing side gig workers and part time employee or someone  self employed, all falling  under the minimum wage threshold side of taxes.

This is a very broad statement. Basically you are saying there are 2 camps...those who get stoned to death for premarital sex, and those who get looked down on by religious conservatives?

Also what constitutes a sin varies greatly per belief system. And even then there is base acceptance of some higher power, which a lot of people do not adhere to. 

Im just saying, in OPs situation, giving up their entire life/hopes/dreams for consistent sex was an unfortunate mistake. And since they are now divorced, religious aspects do not seem to be the driving force behind the preemptive marriage...thus it was just a dumb decision. 

Also hope OP is ok - this is a very negative way to view marriage. ""Give it all up"" - shouldn't be how it is. You should have your life, she should have hers, and together you make each other better."

2021-06-22 10:23:40,stocks,"There is not 'now' in the stock market, you either are looking into the past or predicting the future. Past performance is a poor indicative of future performance, even recent past like 1 femtosecond ago is past performance. Predicting the future is a risky business, only profitable by mere chance for a very few lucky individuals.

Being said that, as long as we live in a free market society, the stock market will go through cycles of good or poor performance and the economy will continue to grow dragging the stock market up with it (not in perfect sync tho).

What you wanna do is to get the average performance of the market as a whole (world wide). This is very achievable with a good diversification (diversified across industries, geographically, and other factors).

Other things to take into account while deciding what to invest in, are your risk tolerance and time horizon. Without knowing that I cannot recommend anything meaningful to you.

As for me, I like to invest in the US stock market (is the biggest market by far), international, tech sector and Frentch-Fama factors (look up for five-factor model if you wanna know more). I do that via low cost ETFs, mostly from Vanguard, some of the ETFs that I own are: VOO, VTI, VGT, and VBR.

I also own a small stake on IVVPESO (IVV but in Mexican pesos MXN), QQQ, APPL, MSFT, FUNO 11 (REIT for the mexican market) plus a few other individual stocks.

My time horizon is \~8 years minimum and I do like risk (calculated risk, not YOLO type of risk).

Depending on where you live, some stocks or funds might not be available to you, I invest from Mexico and have access to the international market using SIC (Sistema Internacional de Cotizaciones). Your options may vary.

How am i supposed to interpret that? 

You are saying it's punishable in some places:

>*premarital sex is punishable in some parts of the world*

but in all places it isn't punishable:

>*where it isn't*

 it is looked down on by religious conservatives:

>*religious conservative's look down on it*

That seems like 2 camps to me but maybe i cant count.

Also dont assume i am unaware that some disagree with premarital sex, i am aware of this. Im saying i disagree with getting married for the sole reason of consistent sex. 

If your culture dictates you get married before having sex or you get stoned, i would say you either adhere to that belief system and agree so this wouldnt be an issue, or you dont and would not stay within that culture. I get there are edge cases where people are forced into this with no way out and they cant escape or leave...but that seems like a very edge case situation and i doubt those people are here leaving comments on a stocks subreddit."

When you say ""and where it isn't"" you are implicitly stating there are 2 options

2. Where it isnt punishable

The prices of games on the Xbox store, Switch Store, Steam (PC) And Playstation store are all lower or equal to the prices on the Gamestop Website. I personnaly don't see them getting more competitive prices in virtual copy of games. Not only that, but its more convinient to buy the games off the platforms intergrated store. It downloads instantly without the need for a code. There is an argument that parents will still go to game stop to buy presents but they might endup buying simply a gift card for the plateforms store instead.

Even pre-built PCs could be purchased there (and are already for sale on their site, supporting the theory), and the thought is they have the ability to sell all types of electronics, similar to how Amazon started out selling books.

Since I initially posted, they announced raising $1B pf capital in a ATM offering. So they have almost $2B cash on hand, $0 debt, a great name (much better than Amazon when it started out), and a ton of great human capital (check out their recent Amazon hires).

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,GOOGL - why so much insider selling and no buying? Can someone help me understand? Everywhere people say buy Google. But looking on openinsider.com for example shows me that GOOGL insiders are just selling. Is it somehow normal and I just don't understand?
2021-06-21 20:13:52,stocks,Are more people using alternative search engines?
2021-06-22 02:33:34,stocks,"you knew when was the last time Larry Page and Sergey Brin sell a lot of their stake?

in 2016 or something when GOOG is at $600.

insider selling is not a red flag for big tech."
2021-06-22 14:58:18,stocks,"I know a lot of people have mentioned the RSUs and why they typically do not buy. One thing I haven’t seen a lot of is that executives and employees typically automatically sell portions of stock as a block of RSUs vest for tax purposes. Given the majority of tech compensation is in stock, very few people have hundreds of thousands / millions of cash laying around. So they will automatically sell a portion of the vesting stock to withhold for tax purposes."
2021-06-21 20:49:26,stocks,These pricks were behind the corona virus and Silenced medicines that could have stopped all of this
2021-06-21 21:13:51,stocks,Buy after a crash. Too expensive now.
2021-06-21 21:41:15,stocks,Cause it’s massively overpriced
2021-06-22 09:07:48,stocks,"This is the reason. With stocks like GOOG, you’ll rarely see insider buying because they are constantly being awarded shares. 

In such a company, a dip in insider selling is analogous to insider buying at another company (though you’d want to be sure there isn’t another,  compensation-related reason for the dip)."
2021-06-21 20:09:24,stocks,Is -lack of execs buying- an indicator of any sort then?
2021-06-22 10:50:19,stocks,"It essentially is a salary. When you get RSUs, they are even withheld for taxes."
2021-06-22 01:00:53,stocks,"Lmao closing projects that created products that were mostly just experiments and not utilized by a large amount of people is not ""killing off innovation."" Google makes a ton of things and experiments with a ton of things. Obviously they won't keep everything around.

That being said they could definitely use a change in how they market and advertise their own products. It's need to be far reaching and most ambitious. This is of course ironic given how well they can sell ads for others."
2021-06-21 22:54:37,stocks,"No way, I am bullish on them and I can't stand them as a company. But they are too smart. They're always innovating. I can see a world where Netflix goes down cause of competition and they outspend themselves. But Google? Nope. People are always going to need an email. People are always going to need to search something. They have the best browser. They'll only go up and up."
2021-06-22 05:36:27,stocks,"Nope.  Google share is actually growing.   Slightly but increasing.

Their chief competitor, Bing, lost over 10% of their market share in the last year.

Bing fell from 2.61% to 2.27%.

2021-06-21 21:01:34,stocks,"Before I retired, my comp was generally about 40% cash, 60% stock grants, rsu's, and options (not Google). I sold vested shares on a schedule so I could go invest the money and diversify in other companies and also to pay bills. I also kept a ton and when we got bought out, cashed in, negotiated a severance, and said bye bye."
2021-06-21 20:38:18,stocks,"Plus they need to sell some just to cover tax, since vested rsu are not done at their actual rate."
2021-06-21 20:36:54,stocks,"Not in a company the size of Google, most of their compensation would be stock plus essp would give plenty of access to more. Also they tend to have strict rules around the buying and selling of stocks hence they have blind sell plans. It would be easier to divest into something else."
2021-06-21 20:55:19,stocks,"Like the other user said, lack of buying isnt a red flag due to generally an exec's compensation would be weighted so heavily towards company equity, so not all would want to increase their net worth into that. However, because of that reality, it shows how insider buying is generally a strong sign."
2021-06-21 20:16:38,stocks,Not sure why it matters whether they have voting rights or not the same reasons for selling and diversifying exist and Google A and C shares trade at relatively slight spreads so it doesn’t have a large price impact. Nevermind even if they were granted A shares their holdings would have minimal impact on voting due to the large influence of B shares and institutional holders significantly outweighing any A shares they might own.
2021-06-21 23:50:57,stocks,"Innovation without execution is a death sentence.  Ie a money pit.

Apple isn’t an innovator in a lot of ways but their execution is FAR ahead of Google.

2021-06-21 22:58:26,stocks,That's the only thing that I would be bearish about them. The new anti trust law seems to be coming down the pike and will make it harder for big tech companies to buy other companies.
2021-06-21 21:38:28,stocks,Would you say you preferred compensation in cash or in equity?
2021-06-22 09:47:19,stocks,Wait you can negotiate the terms of quitting? What's stopping them from just firing you?
2021-06-22 01:54:34,stocks,Vesting shares are netted by the company on the vesting date to account for withholding. Withholding isn’t considered an insider sale because shares are never actually granted.
2021-06-21 22:37:40,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-21 20:32:31,stocks,"My point was OP was talking about GOOGL, not GOOG, though it's definitely possible they were using GOOGL as shorthand for both share classes"
2021-06-22 00:41:57,stocks,"I think Apple is overvalued right now. Google's moat is basically impenetrable right now, and they have some innovations on the horizon that could pay huge dividends like artificial intelligence and self driving cars. Most of their revenue is from advertising, which literally can't go wrong. Their mobile business is diversified, so that they get the majority of their revenue regardless of what device people are using (even iPhones).

Apple on the other hand derives almost all of its value from the sale and monetization of a specific family of physical devices. If they stumble on an iPhone launch (exploding batteries, poor performance, any number of factors) they could be in major trouble. Apple hasn't made any major innovations in close to a decade, and while their execution has been good any future failures in that execution could cost the company dearly and their market cap could implode overnight.

On purely a risk reward basis, Google seems like a much stronger investment to me."
2021-06-21 21:35:14,stocks,"It is hard to get because people give data to google and not others through the use of google. If you ban google, then people change who they give data to. Hence banning google becomes the necessary element."
2021-06-21 20:07:48,stocks,The streaming services are arguable but TikTok is absolutely stepping into YouTube's market.
2021-06-21 22:07:55,stocks,"Definitely equity, though I'm sure my view is somewhat skewed due to everything working out the way it did. I needed enough cash to cover the mortgage and so my wife didn't panic, but I thoroughly believed in the company, so negotiated a equity-heavy comp package."
2021-06-22 10:52:24,stocks,"People love equity compensation when the stock goes up. But it sucks when the stock goes down. Its also a golden handcuff, if you want to leave, you loose all the future salary you built up that hasn't vested. Makes you feel like a slave. But, its hard to complain when your company's stock pumps massively for no reason."
2021-06-22 10:20:21,stocks,I was a senior exec and I was picked to be the survivor after acquisition but I didn't want the job. The payout from my shares etc. was enough to essentially retire. They wanted me to stay on for 90 days to transition and for that they paid a nice severance.
2021-06-22 01:58:25,stocks,"Yes, but my point is they need to sell more shares since typically the withheld shares are not enough to meet their effective tax rate. Learned this the hard way ;)"
2021-06-22 00:12:24,stocks,Why would they be forced to sell?
2021-06-21 21:58:50,stocks,It's only possible to view insider sales for GOOGL afaik
2021-06-22 08:51:47,stocks,"I see it differently and that’s a good thing because it takes two to make a market.

Google and Facebook are going to be under scrutiny for a long time to come .. even if it goes nowhere the stock will reflect that.

Apple is making significant headway in services. They have the strongest brand presence of any tech company (or any company for that matter).  The strongest, closed-off ecosystem that is ubiquitous across all devices, which they will monetize for decades to come. Making headway’s in health tech. Their services revenue is growing leaps and bounds. Their profit margins are the highest in the business.

As an investor, I want to see: fat margins (check), a strong user base (check), growth prospects (check), strong financials (triple check) and execution by the leadership (double check).  Everything else is just noise.

Google is a relatively young company. Search and ad business aside, how many of their other business can be said to be a home run?  And how many of those other moonshots have failed?   The fragmentation of their android platform hurts more with each passing day.  Waymo is their most prized moonshot but we are yet to see if real-life is ready for self driving cars (IMO we are not, for a decade at least)

Thankfully you can own both instead of arguing for one.  I’m happy to own Google again at some point.. but I’m mostly on the hunt for the next Apple or Google which probably won’t be in tech."
2021-06-22 00:08:13,stocks,"""Banning google"" what? no one is talking about ""banning"" them. Regulation is about breaking them up i.e. Google Cloud becomes one company, Waymo becomes another, Search+Suite is another."
2021-06-21 22:47:48,stocks,"Got it. And if you don't mind me asking, was the company a startup? Is that why you preferred equity? 

For context I work at Microsoft, so with such a blue chip tech company, equity doesn't have as much growth potential."
2021-06-22 00:35:50,stocks,"You are talking about US politics. Google operates on a worldwide stage. People are talking about banning them. In fact, they are already banned for about 20% of the worlds population."
2021-06-21 23:01:36,stocks,"It was. I was employee number 8 and when we got bought out we were about 3,000 strong. I worked at another startup before this one and negotiated a similar comp package. That didn't go so well. We would struggle at home due to the lack of income and nothing came of the equity. Early days MS equity would have been cool but yeah, now very established and while equity is always good, it's not really going anywhere."
2021-06-22 00:39:48,stocks,"Europe, Africa, North and South America are not talking about banning google."
2021-06-22 03:32:58,stocks,"Cool. Congrats on what I'm assuming was a big payout on the second startup equity. Assuming that set you and your wife for life, as acquisitions often do. Would you recommend a young person in early 20s pursue the startup route?"
2021-06-22 00:44:09,stocks,"This can quickly change. Hell, Nigeria, one of the largest countries in the world and one with the most favorable demographics just banned Twitter. US Big tech is facing mounting opposition on all sides and this will only increase.

That is the risk of the stock."
2021-06-22 10:12:03,stocks,"I recommend statrtups to anyone, but it's got to be the right fit for both, and you really need to be able to get a good handle of the future vision of the company, in detail. The downside to early 20s is likely lack of back up capital to allow you to take more equity than income."
2021-06-22 00:47:04,stocks,The market doesn't seem to agree with you. It's $2400 for GOOGL and the company is the 2nd or 3rd largest company in the world and has over $1.5T market cap.
2021-06-22 00:59:22,stocks,A lot of insiders seem to agree with me. We will have to see in a year if it is less or more than 1.5T market cap.
2021-06-22 01:01:07,stocks,"Google execs are smart people. 2/3rd or more of their total compensation is paid in stock. They are shaving off the top by the numbers provided in this topic, it's not fire sales. The market disagrees with you as do the insiders"
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Monday, June 21, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Monday, June 21, 2021**

***Please Note:*** *Hello friends! If you were wondering where the Daily Market has been the last two weeks, I have had a great few months in the market and decided, now that I am fully vaccinated and the US is reopening, to go on vacation to New York (I live in California). I am now back home and ready to get back to the regular schedule! The Recap will be posted every day again from now on.*

Stocks jumped today, with the three major indexes rising, looking to recover the losses after the volatility experienced last week after the Federal Reserve’s outlook was announced. If anything, last week’s volatility shows us that the game of tug-of-war between inflationary pressures spooking investors and the Federal Reserve reiterating it will maintain accommodative policies in place for the foreseeable future continues. As I have said in the past, while I acknowledge the risk posed by the elevated inflation readings, I too believe any pressure is transitory and remain extremely bullish moving forward. 

The Federal Reserve in the United States has a dual mandate: maintaining inflation stable and maximum employment. In light of the pandemic and surge in unemployment following lockdown, its maximum employment mandate has broadened. The measures and tools for achieving these mandates differ and have also changed recently. On the upside, the Fed now has additional flexibility in providing and maintaining accommodative monetary policies, namely near-zero interest rates and quantitative easing, to support the economy. The downside is that as the economy continues to improve, policies may stay loose for too long, leading to inflation and forcing the Fed to respond by aggressively raising interest rates, which would pretty much tank equities. In my view, this is the fundamental risk hanging over the market moving forward: Is the Fed misinterpreting inflationary readings as transitory? In my view, they are not. 

Last week, the spotlight was squarely on the Federal Reserve meeting, with market participants anxious to see how the Fed interprets and plans to react to the higher-than-expected inflationary readings. Analysts broadly expected the Fed to discuss a timeline for tapering its asset purchase program and a potential timeline for interest rate hikes. Instead, the Fed made no mention of a taper timeline and signaled they anticipate the first interest rate hike to occur in 2023. Overall, the report was very positive for equities, which is why the SPY so quickly recovered after an initial dump on Wednesday. 

In my opinion,  it seems the Fed’s decision to leave out a “taper timeline” in the latest meeting reinforces the view consistently reiterated by the members of the Fed that current inflationary readings are “transitory” (meaning not permanent) and largely reflects factors caused by the coronavirus pandemic and the subsequent economic shutdown, such as global supply chain disruptions, materials shortages, and labor market imbalances. Moreover, I suspect Jerome Powell wants to avoid another “Taper Tantrum” like the one in 2013 and intends to be as clear as possible about the Fed’s expectations in order to avoid mixed messages (Read more about the 2013 Taper Tantrum [here,](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/taper-tantrum.asp) but basically markets freaked out after the Fed announced it was tapering quantitative easing passed during the 2008 recession since the economy had largely recovered by that point). In the end, the market kept going unabated, something I find very likely to happen again when the Fed inevitably announces they are tapering. In the end, I expect taper talks to begin towards the end of this year, but the lack of its mention in this Fed outlook meeting is an encouraging sign the Fed is not concerned about the elevated inflation readings. 

Moreover, the median projection among Fed officials is now for two rate hikes in 2023 despite the Fed raising inflation expectation for 2021, another sign the central bank remains unconcerned with the current levels of inflation. While the 2023 timeline is sooner than originally predicted, the two year timeline signals that the Fed will continue to move slowly and deliberately when considering any policy adjustment. 

Later this week, investors will receive the latest update on core personal consumption expenditures (PCE), which serves as the Fed's preferred gauge of inflation. The report due for release on Friday is expected to register a 3.4% year-on-year increase for May, marking the fastest jump since 1992, albeit while still reflecting ""base effects"" as prices rebound after last year's pandemic-induced collapse in prices across the board.

**Highlights**

* Amblin Partners, a movie studio headed by famed director Steven Spielberg, announced a partnership with Netflix (NFLX) to produce future films.  
* Apple became the fourth major digital company to face closer scrutiny from Germany's antitrust watchdog on Monday after the cartel office said it had launched an investigation into whether the tech giant is exploiting its market position.
* Goldman Sachs (GS) said in a note Monday that households were the largest source of equity demand in the first quarter of 2021 after generating net purchases of $172 billion. “We estimate that households currently allocate 44% of their assets to equities, slightly below the all-time high allocation of 46% in 2000. But high cash balances and continued retail participation in equity markets should bolster household equity demand."" 
* EU antitrust regulators will decide by July 26 whether to clear a $30 billion bid by AerCap (AER) to buy the aircraft leasing business of General Electric (GE).
* Bank of America (BAC) said oil may surge to $100 a barrel by next year as travel demand rebounds.

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Risks With Leveraged Funds? In several places, the risks outlined with leveraged funds (TQQQ, UPRO, etc) usually include the possibility of losing all of your principle - e.g. the underlying asset drops 33%, so a 3x fund would go to 0. Unless, I’m missing something, in the history of these funds there has never been an instance where the underlying asset dropped far enough to zero out the principle - at least not in the ones I’ve checked. The warnings claim that these funds are only for the short term and are not meant to be held long term.

While I’m sure there have been some leveraged funds that have tanked, I’m failing to see the risks with a fund which tracks a fairly safe asset like the NASDAQ or S&P 500.

I also understand that these funds have higher expenses, but is there something else I’m missing? I’m up quite a bit so far and I see no reason to sell at this point."
2021-06-22 03:35:13,stocks,"You are missing Volatility decay.

Assume you buy one share of an ETF tracking an index that has a value of 100. The next day the index goes to 110, and the day after that is back to 100.

Result, you are even.

Now what would have happened if you bought a 3x leveraged ETF?
As the underlying goes up 10%, you gain 30%, so your holding value is 130. As the index goes back from 110 to 100, losing (using rounded numbers) 9% of its value, you lose 9x3=27% of 130, that is -35, leaving you with 130-35=95.

Result, you lost 5%

If SPY goes down 33% in a day there's likely bigger problems going on in the world.  That being said if TQQQ existed during Dotcom it would have gone down ~97% and still wouldn't have recovered to the same level as QQQ.  If it existed in 2008 I would have dropped around 93% iirc.  So you can't actually lose 100% but that doesn't mean you can't lose (basically) everything.  In a bull market TQQQ is great.  In any kind of flat, volatile or bear market it'll get killed.  You're basically making a bet that the market won't cool off like everyone says it will."
2021-06-22 11:28:46,stocks,"These leveraged ETFs can't promise 3x over the long term because the leverage resets daily. In a bull market over long term it will do more than 3x obviously, and even though in a bear market it should go down less than 3x, it is still not 3x. The expense ratio is nothing to worry about. You hold TQQQ you know this. Who cares about 1% expense ratio when you're sitting on fat gains. The real risk imo is when the market trade sideways for a long time, you will slowly bleed money due to decay. But a couple of good days should rectify that."

2021-06-21 22:53:21,stocks,"Contrarian point of view:

Overvalued at 50+ PE (remove tax provision, I do them for a living), Margins will decrease as COVID bump falls off, TSMC will eat into their margins, Intel likely will be equal to AMD offering by next year, AMD can't keep growing at crazy rates because no supply, Intel undercutting them on all offerings except high end. Expect continued growth but a slowing in growth rate to 20-25% next year. This is too low for 50+ P/E so multiple contraction likely. Instead of trying to grow supply they use cash on stock buybacks at 50+ P/E, bad use of capital. They are slow to move off X86 and will potentially be left behind as only X86 in next few years as Intel moves away from X86 now. Only area of big opportunity seems like dedicated graphics cards and servers. FAAMG looking to potentially make their own server chips eventually off X86. So may be difficult to continue growing fast. Intel also joining dedicated graphics cards fray with supposedly a 3070 equivalent by year-end. More competition, less pricing power, less margins and profits. Interest rate risk as it is a growth name. Price has likely peaked for the next 3-5 years. Expect + or -25% swings while fundamentals catch up to price. 

Counter argument to my points: Could double in price on hype alone like Tesla or NFLX."

2021-06-21 23:47:11,stocks,"Thanks for your thoughts. Disagree with your assessment though. My opinion is that your evaluation of the technology landscape, and of the competition is off the mark.

The global computing market demand grows exponentially year over year. I believe AMD is in a position to capture a growing slice of that demand. Supply is also flexible. Major foundries are ramping up as quickly as they can; and I am pretty sure AMD already secured some good long-term deals.

Intel is not likely to offer equally attractive products for 2 years. They are experiencing serious issues with company's engineering culture, and their real next-gen chip still has a long way to go. Undercutting the price will have minimal impact if your offering isn't very  competitive. Just look at how hard AMD struggled several years ago.

The stock buyback, in my opinion, reflects the management's strong conviction that the business will grow beyond market expectation. I would be very surprised if AMD does not break $200 per share by 2024. While there are many hyped up tech stocks, I don't think AMD is one of them."
2021-06-22 06:17:41,stocks,People won’t admit it’s overvalued. AMD has to do some close to impossible on their fundamentals to justify its today’s value.

The question is can amd keep beating earnings estimates. I'm betting that after a few good earnings it will go over 100 and surpass 52 week high either this quarter or 3rd quarter. Note they don't have to be blow out results as they only need to show investors that the downside risk is very low. 

It's a wrap in the server space. One unique feature which is huge in new amd chips is the hyperviser security which essentially is specifically made for virtual containers made for cloud provider like Google cloud. The gaming market, especially the higher end is a kill too, but this is a very small business for amd."
2021-06-21 23:39:15,stocks,Unlikely for Xilinx to have major growth based on FPGAs (including any combination with AMD tech). The merger expands AMDs business with more offerings but ASICS are king for all emerging tech.

I dislike the term exponentially. Feels very Cathie woods hype-ish, MBA salesman-ish. The same could have been said for other markets such as DRAM etc before their collapse. 

I disagree on the time for Intel to catch up based on leaks I've seen online for xe gd2 and alder lake. I also don't think AMD ks in position to grab market share as aggressively as necessary due to the supply shortages which will supposedly take 2+ years to catch up on. As a factual example, intel gained laptop market share over the last year and lost server market share. I do think they will continue to grow just not at the speed everyone expects. 

I think this could have been a pivotal moment if they could have supplied enough chips over the last year but they couldn't and gave Intel a free year or two to catch-up."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"What's up with Intel? Intel is currently trading in the mid 50's at a pe ratio of 12.5,  intel is a matured company and no one is looking for a multibagger here and recently it has lost ground to Amd in the consumer cpu market. Now semiconductor shortages has hit everyone hard and won't be reasonable to expect quick turnarounds.

But the thing is there are not many players in the market and there is no technological threat, the infrastructure and research requirements to even make a cpu, set the entry barrier pretty high but this has breed incompetence at intel  imo. 

Now Intel processors are still at least competitive unlike the past years when amd was beaten to the ground by intel. Now this could be the beginning of the downward road for intel if it can't compete with next few launches  but as of today it is simply lagging behind a bit.

Now intel has had a shaddy / unethical reputation with regards to going to extreme ways to win market share, such as designing to perform on specific benchmarks, poaching competitive talent and anti competitive policies and perhaps is not the best place to work. Current management may also be dragging the stock's perceived value, when you look at Lisa su she has been a revelation at amd. 

Talking about the stock it also pays a decent dividend, but paying such amounts of dividend when the company has such a huge debt is questionable. Like why won't there be much better use of the money being paid? Also the interest will pile on like this makes no sense?

I think a structural change at intel is the one thing which can revive the stock and the company else amd might do what intel once did to amd, kinda what goes around comes around. What's your take?

Note: Personally I would go no where close to an intel cpu to build a pc/ gaming laptop, perhaps this is the jist which the price reflects."

Their PEG is also 0.6, and during their last quarterly earnings, they raised their 2021 outlook. Housing prices are also going up due to inflation and low supply.

I'm not sure, though, how inflation will affect their business, as while it might increase prices, it also increases their costs. In addition, since prices have been going up, there have been rumblings of another possible housing bubble.

2021-06-22 03:44:23,stocks,"Give me one argument why it's not possible? All of the things you mentioned are not reasons why it wouldn't happen. They're just signs of someone who's sticking his head in the sand and probably even reasons why it's MORE likely they go bankrupt. The fact that they're as large and old as they are makes it incredibly difficult and expensive to switch to a completely new market. Moreover, they already went bankrupt just 13 years ago under much less difficult circumstances.

> I could've respected you saying they might not do too well in the EV space and not be a top 3 player, but going bankrupt? Come on man, think logically.

This makes absolutely no sense. If they don't do well in the EV space and sell much fewer cars than they do today, they WILL go bankrupt. They'll need to invest billions to make the transition, if that doesn't pay off in terms of increased profitability and/or increased sales, investors will pull out and their terrible balance sheet will bankrupt them."

2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about ETFs If an ETF tracks roughly the same “basket” of companies for a given theme (e.g. QQQ, ONEQ, QLD) why do the prices differ so much?

I get “liquidity” is important but why would someone be willing to pay $350 for QQQ when a Fidelity, Vanguard ETF that tracks the same Nasdaq 100 is only $60?

Also following up to that, why is there such a huge price discrepancy?

You’re not getting any more value out of one ETF over another if they have 99.9% same basket of stocks so what makes QQQ worth 5x more than ONEQ?

Lastly, if an ETF “tracks” the performance of a basket of stocks but nobody wants to buy the ETF how would the value of it rise? 

If I start an ETF that tracks the performance of the S&P 25 and price it at $20/share and nobody wants to buy it but the performance of the S&P 25 all improve 5x overnight I can’t just price my ETF at some arbitrary higher value right?"
2021-06-22 10:45:41,stocks,Even I understood your explanation! Thank you for taking the time.
2021-06-22 00:00:00,stocks,"A word against index funds Nowadays whenever I say anything about investing in direct equities people give me a shrewd look and start preaching about index funds. They generally cite to the figure that 90% of investors don't beat the index. So today I would like to break it down and get to the crux of the matter.

 You can say 80-90% people who PARTICIPATE in the market tend to not beat the index which may include traders and pseudo investors(sell in panic. buy in bull runs).  Creating one's own portfolio over just closing your eyes and investing in the index could give you stellar returns. Just follow what every top billionaire investor tells you to do which could be very easily summed up.

1)Choose companies with a good past track record, clean financial books.

2) They have a moat and clear growth prospect in their industry.

3)Buy at the dips and HODL till the above holds true or you have enough to never worry about money.

Its very simple. Not easy in anyway but simple. I believe, anyone who has average intelligence(like me) and does a decent diligent research, can do it. In a portfolio of 12-15 stocks even if just five do well, you would be looking at a portfolio which would be multiple times better than the index. I'm not completely against index funds. It can be a part of your portfolio but don't make it your life would be my suggestion. It's true that many will fail but telling every young investor(anyone who is entering for the first time) to just jump into index funds would be seriously undercutting there potential to create  wealth."

2021-06-21 22:48:02,stocks,Can just do a backtest
2021-06-22 09:46:41,stocks,"Back testing it's tough for fundamental analysis. At least for me so much of my stocks depend on the companies recent history, current environment, and most importantly what I think their growth and moat is for the future. I would love to back test, but I haven't figured out how to do it.

Back testing works great for technical analysis, and for day trading techniques like swinging and scalping. Please let me know if you have a good way to do it for fundamental analysis."
2021-06-21 23:37:40,stocks,"I don't understand why people approach this topic with such emotion. The pros don't invest in ETFs, they stock pick. Warren Buffett once said  something along the lines of ""the market is a transfer of wealth from the impatient to the patient."" 

Most people do worse on their own then they would in an ETF because they trade on emotions. Retail investors tend to be impatient and chase winners after it's too late and hold on to losers too long.

A stock picking portfolio is likely more volatile, but the returns absolutely can be better. Just think about it logically. The S&P maps the 500 largest companies, no matter their return. There is no strategy. The poor performers pull down the average return. You absolutely hypothetically could pick more winners than losers and beat the average. 

My recommendation to OP is that if he does this he should map every trade he makes date to date against the indexes. This is essential as it will allow OP to see if he is really doing better picking than he would be just going the index ETF route. If there comes a time when OP is regularly getting beat by the index then I believe he should accept his fate and become an index investor.

I've only been investing since 2017. So I could absolutely just be lucky. I know the odds against retail investors so I have mapped every trade I've made against the S&P. My current 3year return is 31.6% annualized. The S&P during the exact same date range is 18%. If that changes I will happily become an index investor. But for now I'm going to continue fine tuning my strategy and learning from my mistakes in order to try to keep beating the major index by 2x."
2021-06-22 04:19:52,stocks,You missed the part that Buffet has said multiple times ordinary people that can't commit hours a day researching should just buy the index. He even backs this up by this being his plan for his personal estate for his family when he dies.
2021-06-22 05:20:24,stocks,"As a huge fan of Buffett, I'm aware. And for the vast majority of people that is the correct advise. I'm simply pushing back on the idea that it's so improbable for a retail investors to beat the index and that no one should try it.

The advise should be. The vast majority of retail investors fail to beat the index by stock picking. it is not easy and will take a disciplined strategy and approach. If you want to try it, understand these things and make sure you measure yourself against the index. OP seems willing to spend time reading financial statements and knows to trade without emotion. So I say he gives it a shot."

2.	They are not just building 1 product but rather a suite of products attacking all sides of the marketplace, from consumer to merchant to distribution. People often only see 1 side and think that’s all Shopify is.
3.	The platform they built gives them a ton of leverage to build adjacent business lines, which they are doing. Competitive positioning is phenomenal.
4.	eCommerce is on a tear and will be for the next decade.
5.	There is virtually no competition - and merchants don’t want second-best in this space. BigCommerce is Bing.
6.	Growth rate will accelerate as the new business lines pick up steam and some of the recent acquisitions become fully integrated.
7.	They have access to an incredible talent pool that views them as a leader and innovator. Talent is a huge competitive advantage.
8.	They are amassing proprietary data of a wide range of merchant and business activity at scale. This advantage will continue to snowball. It allows them to be more aggressive about lending to merchants or leveraging the data across the platform to make it more efficient.

Those fears were based on pre-election remarks. He has since walked those back and said he would simply advocate for tax increases. 

This move of moderation was driven by the results of the Congressional elections, which make extremist plans like full blown nationalization a pure pipe dream. 

The moderation impact of their Congress is a very similar dynamic to the razor thin majority Democrats currently have in the US - friendly to an extent, but entirely insufficient for any earth shattering moves to go through. 

Any discounts based on Peruvian politics fears are market inefficiency IMO. I have a lithium penny stock with rights to a deposit in Peru, and it has been on sale for five weeks. I have doubled the size of my position because of this, and I will look at SCCO as well."

2021-06-21 22:55:12,stocks,"Question about what stocks to keep in Roth vs regular IRA. I didn’t really think too much about what stocks I bought in each account when I started investing. I just put cash in both accounts and when I saw an opportunity I bought with whatever account had enough cash (big brain moves I know lol). I’ve been trying to change the composition of each account based on the tax differences but I wanted to find out about the pros and cons of my strategy.

My aim is to have the most stable dividend paying companies in my Roth because they’re tax advantaged, with also a few high yielders there too. This typically involves going with Vanguard index funds like VNQ and VYM, and a few monthly dividend payers like O and JEPI.

Thing is, I bought AAPL in the Roth account and it’s appreciated. Not sure if I should sell out of this position and build AAPL as a holding in my traditional account. I (like everyone) am bullish on AAPL, so keeping it in the traditional IRA makes it easier to access the potential capital appreciation. AAPL’s yield is also pretty low so the untaxed divs are not as high as they could be with another holding in the Roth.

What do people think makes more sense to do? Keep AAPL in the Roth and just buy more in the traditional? Sell it and rebuild the holding since I’m bullish anyway?"

2021-06-21 22:42:47,stocks,People look at eps for mature companies because it more closely aligned to free cash flow and also it’s one part of the equation.  Companies can try to adjust depreciation and the other stuff but they have to disclose it.  Also you can have a difference in what you report to align for GAAP versus what you report to take advantages for taxes. Companies like UAA or GE try shady crap but it eventually gets to them.

I can’t touch the money in the Roth for a long time right, so wouldn’t it make more sense to put in safer long term investments that pay good dividends? Those dividends are not taxed so by reinvesting divs in a long term bullish asset the portfolio would grow well without taxes.

When you say gain potential do you mean capital appreciation or income potential? Because AAPL is definitely for long term capital and dividend growth but other higher paying dividend stocks like ENB, KO, ABBV, have high yields now that could benefit from being in the Roth. I’m thinking of moving from AAPL in my Roth to a few higher yield dividend payers, as well as VYM, VNQ and JEPI. Do you not recommend this?

What? I'm a Business and CS double major and it's definitely more STEM shitting on business. Business kids know their curriculum isn't hard and don't really care. 

> Some of it is jealousy because STEM majors are smarter than business majors

Highly situational. At my school the engineering school is traditionally the least respected part of our institution; business is the most. Any of us who got in for business could've gotten in for engineering. 

>  most of it is annoyance at the power STEM majors hold in wage negotiations.

Yup, I'm sure my friend doing Citi IB is crying because they lack so much power in wage negotiations :( :( :( I'm not sure how they'll survive on their measly six figure starting salary. Maybe I should start a GoFundme for them? 

You also realise STEM includes a lot of majors that aren't very career-focused right? The average biology major makes about as much as the average English major since you need a graduate degree for any career that actually involves biology. Engineering and tech beat out business but business generally beats out both math and the pure sciences. And again, that tends to reverse in prestige schools. The only field that beats out business in the prestige schools (where high finance is an actual option rather than something you learn about in school) is CS, but even then, career progression is better in finance. And I say this as someone who's working in analytics/tech because they don't wanna deal with the horrible WLB of finance. I didn't choose tech because I thought the salaries were better lol. 

Also you really just deviated from my main point. You didn't make an actual argument against it, you just said that being a good employee is being a slave even though the entire structure of, you know, management makes it so  that it would be impossible for even a majority of people to be employers.

I wondered what was enough cash in my accounts 1M, 2M, or 3M before I retired?

Every time I got  a raise, as long as I didn't think I ""needed"" it I placed the money in my 401k savings account + a rainy day account.  I do not adhere to the 100 - age = amount in bonds, as this will not keep up with inflation.

Surely if you have two ETFs both with an average return of 10% and you buy half of each you would still have an average return of 10%?

You can think of it as the large swings canceling each other out, the average return is always greater than the expected return (which is why Hedge funds for example love advertising their average return).

Here's a quick example I made in Excel to show it, I invite you to do the same and play around with it and I'm sure it will become clear:

 The returns of A and B are the same, the order is just scrambled, so the final value of the two ETF's will be the same but the path they get there will differ. Of course, the average return and expected return of the A and B will be identical. The investment of 50/50 in A and B will also have an identical expected return, but you can see that the average return will in fact not be the same still (2.97% compared to 3.03%).

2021-06-22 19:34:02,stocks,"Rollercoaster today due to delayed filing of form 4 in my opinion.

Asana down 6% today through market close.

Reason: CEO apparently stopped buying shares. He has been buying shares daily since 06/07, as evidence of his form 4 disclosures every 2 business days like clockwork since the initial purchase. Form 4 usually would have been filed last night if the pattern continued. No form 4 within 2 business days usually would mean that he did *not* buy shares on Thursday, June 17th and that his last daily purchase was Wednesday, June 16th.

Asana back up 3% after hours.

Reason: Form 4 filed after hours revealing that CEO actually did buy shares on Thursday (and Friday, and Yesterday). His form 4 was later then the usual 2 business day period, surprising the market."
2021-06-22 19:48:31,stocks,"Happens to me all the time! I'd agree it would still be overvalued at $30, which just made me more sure that $50+ was temporary. I am often wrong and only tried to predict a 1-2 month period, so we will see where it goes soon!"
2021-06-22 19:45:41,stocks,"Interesting. I expected a drop if he stopped purchasing, but didn't know about the Form 4 or the timing of it. Will be curious if it rallies back tomorrow, but I'm thinking it has to slow eventually. Ended up buying August $40p on Monday that are up 35% so far, hopefully (for me and my prediction) price gets under $50 in the next two weeks at some point. Thanks for identifying a potential cause!"

The float on gme is so small which made it the perfect storm."

2021-06-22 10:34:10,stocks,The plan never changed - buy and hold until we bring the entire system down.

2021-06-22 03:17:03,stocks,"I didn't buy it cos I feel I've already missed out on most of its multibagger potential, it's 40x since IPO and 10x in recent years, and an almost $200B company. I don't feel comfortable paying any super-premium valuation for a company that big already, so I think there are better options."
2021-06-22 12:18:57,stocks,"Not sure who the analysts are, but [WSJ](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/CRTX/research-ratings) does have quite a spread on estimates ranging from $14 to $190. Definitely understand the urge to stay away from pharma/biotech/whatever until they're 'proven' - but there is a reason that those stocks see wild volatility and can be made or broken by something like an FDA approval or the results of a clinical trial.

Speaking of what the [FDA approves or condones](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-grants-accelerated-approval-alzheimers-drug), Biogen's Aduhelm is actually the third approved drug in 20 years (2003 being the last approval, and 2001 before that) - so although it has definitely been close to 20 years it would be more accurate to say they approved the first ALzheimer's drug in 18 years. The controversy over Biogen's approval despite a lack of clinical effectiveness is interesting, but for the sake of speculation in the marketplace - you can't deny that Biogen's massive spike of ~60%+ in a single day on a somewhat controversial drug approval hints that there are some major gains that could be made if news in November is good to decent"

2021-06-21 22:03:17,stocks,"Couple points here: 

1) insiders dumped the stock in February BEFORE dumping bad news onto investors.  shady move. the sec will be looking into that. Rich Schmidt dumped his stock and placed his efforts on expanding his turkey hunting farm rather than focusing on the ZOOM call he tanked last week.  Also Steve Burns owns 25% of the company which he can dump about 50% of on 10/1/21...so that is hanging over investors heads as well.

2) who are these ""several""  investors?  And why wait to leverage them?  if people are ready to invest let them invest while the government reviews their loan application.  sounds like they have investors just like they had binding purchase orders.

3) 600k in production per year is pure fiction

4) the hub motors have not been  satisfactory tested so zero maintenance for the first five years is an outlandish claim.  The endurance configuration has less than 50k miles of road testing.  And on a road test on 1/23/21 the test vehicle burst into flames.  you cant fix and safety test that in six months.  Is their intent to put an unsafe vehicle on the road?"
2021-06-22 06:06:08,stocks,"1) what ""bad news"" Are you (and the media) even talking about? are you talking about the fabricated Hindenburg report that has been proven false? The fire on the prototype that was a man made error (betas are now built by robots with less margins of error)? How would have insiders known about this ""bad news"" and how the media would have spun it?

2) the ATVM loan specifically says that it's designed to help companies who need it. If they announce they are viable for 1 or more year that becomes difficult to demonstrate 

3) look at how many Chevy Cruzes were built at that factory, Cobalts etc. Each year.. realistically they can easily make at least that many. That being said, the Endurance is much simpler to build with less moving parts than all those vehicles ever produced at that factory.

4) hub motors have been around for years, they've always been safe and reliability has also increased substantially in the last 10 years. If 1 hub motor fails the others can still function independently to be able to drive the vehicle (without getting towed) to get serviced. The vehicle is very safe. It's been crash and validated for various tests (example side impact, frontal crash) with 5 star crash testing. They are actually on track to being the safest truck ever tested. The truck fire has been debunked."
