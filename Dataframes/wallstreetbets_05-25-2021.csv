2021-05-25 19:43:45,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you for sure, there are 2 sides to the coin. There will be people who are totally fine grabbing popcorn and streaming the latest stuff. But there are also the people planning vacations. cruises, road trips, all kinds of stuff just to get back that pre-covid way of life. Nostalgia is a powerful drug and I think we're going to be very surprised with how quickly people return to the movies and other crowd events"
2021-05-25 19:49:39,wallstreetbets,No problem hun bye üòò
2021-05-25 19:50:18,wallstreetbets,Just because it‚Äôs up doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs stuck

2021-05-25 19:41:21,wallstreetbets,Why are you long on UVXY? Is that just a portfolio hedge? Because that will go the opposite of the rest more than likely.

2021-05-25 19:30:23,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I feel better.
2021-05-25 19:47:10,wallstreetbets,How is that going to work out with the split? Just curious because I have a few calls on the same date.
2021-05-25 19:54:48,wallstreetbets,You will end up with the same value for your options. Your contract number will decrease by the same ratio as the split (I think uvxy os doing a 1:10 reverse..) so if you had 200 contracts pre split like OP you will then have 20 contracts after the split and they will be at a new strike price 10x what they are now. The position value is still the same though.
2021-05-25 19:41:40,wallstreetbets,Thank you üíïüíï As always..

2021-05-25 19:50:40,wallstreetbets,"I work in the lubricants industry and we are seeing record high prices across the board and passing it onto our customers. For those who don't know, lubricants is used in practically every manufacturing industry in large quantities. With the cost of transportation, manufacturing cost, raw material cost going up across the board, every industry in the CPI basket is likely experience record high costs that continue to increase on a weekly basis. I would be very surprised if CPI does not hit record high in June."
2021-05-25 19:22:17,wallstreetbets,CPI is an average. Look at the median inflation for each of the specific basket of goods. I think you will find some supply chain disruptions are at the root of the high average and not across the board. Also look at the implicit price deflator if that isn‚Äôt moving at an alarming level that tells you the CPI is being over stated in some way
2021-05-25 19:09:29,wallstreetbets,Why not run away stocks and inflation?
2021-05-25 19:58:35,wallstreetbets,"It's also relative so even if we grew the same quantity from the prior month or year, the percent change might be lower. However, I think it'll be another record and the Fed will keep shouting ""transitory"" for the next decade until they're right."
2021-05-25 19:24:56,wallstreetbets,There will be some outliers but most stocks can't catch inflation in that case. See: Turkish stock market and inflation. Stock market SEEMS like it is runaway in local currency but actually lost 75% against dollar in 8 years.
2021-05-25 19:55:37,wallstreetbets,Right but that's against the dollar. If stocks run away they'll be priced in the us dollar

2021-05-25 18:17:47,wallstreetbets,What strike and date?  I am thinking the same as you since it went from 65 to 90 in a few days.
2021-05-25 19:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I agree.  That's why I'm long on a stock that provides Internet service to airplanes, but the ticker is a nono, on this sub due to market cap.  

Mom Dad and kids have to fly to grandma because it's been over a year since they visited.  

You think mom, dad, or kids are going to play cards like a ""normal"" family on the airplane?  No fucking way.  They'll be paying the Internet service fee so they don't have to look at each other and can enjoy their social media sites, netflix, etc..."
2021-05-25 18:55:22,wallstreetbets,"yeah agreed, don't fight the flow, and wsb isn't the flow (in case you missed the memo); besides for GME"
2021-05-25 19:44:06,wallstreetbets,Bought one last weekend at Gamestop for my daughter.
2021-05-25 19:14:01,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got an internal ‚Äústop loss‚Äù in mind. I‚Äôm not diamond handing this if the price keeps going north.
2021-05-25 18:09:33,wallstreetbets,Call to put spread is like 70 to 30 the call side.
2021-05-25 19:19:49,wallstreetbets,"I may be retarded, but I‚Äôm not stupid. It won‚Äôt do that anytime soon but I‚Äôve got target prices in mind for getting out if I need to."
2021-05-25 18:05:15,wallstreetbets,Not my only reason. I‚Äôm betting on a correction after this sudden rise in price the past few trading days.
2021-05-25 18:24:51,wallstreetbets,Are we still learning the difference between revenue and profit? Tesla‚Äôs revenue in 2020 was $31.5 billion.
2021-05-25 18:12:07,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has a lot more intrinsic value in its brand and its product. Roblox‚Äôs product can be replicated by a competitor.

Edit: for then record, I‚Äôm playing devil‚Äôs advocate for defending Tesla‚Äôs market cap. I think Tesla is extremely overpriced as well."
2021-05-25 17:52:31,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre borrowed shares. Short interest isn‚Äôt that high. Like 3.6 million available with no fee on Fidelity.
2021-05-25 19:50:51,wallstreetbets,"roblox doesn't make the games. it's a platform that allows other people to make their own games for free.

think of it like steam but all games use the same game engine and servers provided by them."
2021-05-25 17:57:47,wallstreetbets,Did you just assume my gender?
2021-05-25 18:18:52,wallstreetbets,"These are borrowed shares sold short, not puts."
2021-05-25 19:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Christ man watch a YouTube video or something, he's shorting the stock, borrowing shares, not buying puts."
2021-05-25 19:00:17,wallstreetbets,"Yup, always have to keep in mind that most people here are retards.

GME up 20% on no news: Buy now or miss the rocket ship.

RBLX up 20% on no news: This shit is overvalued. I‚Äôm buying puts."
2021-05-25 19:20:19,wallstreetbets,Fair enough and I hope it works out for you. Especially since I wrote some covered 95 c expiring Friday to keep reducing my core position share cost. I know kids that religiously spend their whole weekly allowance on some bullcrap kitty avatar dress on this site.
2021-05-25 19:41:31,wallstreetbets,Oops I meant profit. Just want to show how a company can be worth a lot just from potential.  Tesla reached a market cap of 800 billion at one point and can easily hit a trillion anytime now. Roblox has a ton of potential if it maintains as leader of future gaming or virtual experiences there will no ceiling with its evolution.
2021-05-25 18:15:43,wallstreetbets,Just like Facebook was replicated by google+
2021-05-25 19:16:30,wallstreetbets,Roblox brand has a pretty fucking firm grasp on the market. It is NOT going to be replaced anytime soon or anytime in the forseeable future. You may be right thats its currently overvalued but youre seriously mistaken about the power of their brand.

2021-05-25 18:41:02,wallstreetbets,No he doesnt
2021-05-25 18:00:41,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm glued to my portfolio like a hawk while this is going on.
2021-05-25 18:06:54,wallstreetbets,It was a joke.
2021-05-25 19:45:19,wallstreetbets,What was the news today
2021-05-25 19:07:14,wallstreetbets,"True, a better parallel would be YouTube.  That‚Äôs the thing about roblox they don‚Äôt create any of their own content.  Their users do.  The most popular content creator might change but it‚Äôs still housed in YouTube.     That‚Äôs what will give roblox its longevity"
2021-05-25 19:53:18,wallstreetbets,38 years old and I still play Madden on my playstation 4. Been playing playstation since I was 11 years old. The kids on Roblox are probably going to do the same and the games are probably going to evolve with their age.

2021-05-25 17:25:02,wallstreetbets,"One thing you haven't accounted for is GM's battery tech.  


Their development has been mostly in-house, yielding pretty successful efficiency numbers.

2021-05-25 17:35:50,wallstreetbets,The thing I don‚Äôt see in growth when it comes to the EV markets for these two is that they‚Äôll simply be replacing inventory. Take out 1 gas car and add 1 electric.
2021-05-25 17:41:22,wallstreetbets,I think EV is gonna be dominated more like by Volkswagen at least in europe

2021-05-25 17:55:28,wallstreetbets,These are the same clowns that tried to fight off the inevitable EV shift until they had their hands forced by the world. At least GM is smart enough to back Lordstown motors. I own a Ford and it fucking sucks. RIDE and GM for me.

2021-05-25 19:24:05,wallstreetbets,"Neither...

Ford is playing a losing game by only going with trucks. The infrastructure is not there yet for EVs for large hauling operations and none of which is technically possible without battery swapping stations, because no truck driver wants to sit and wait 8 hrs to charge.

The only game changer would be something nobody saw coming which would be moving towards a closed system gasoline ev hybrid. But I digress that‚Äôs too smart and doesn‚Äôt fit the narrative for carbon neutral living..."

2021-05-25 19:29:56,wallstreetbets,We'll see
2021-05-25 19:16:27,wallstreetbets,"This is the most underrated comment here. Its funny listening to WSB argue about EVs while having no real technical rationale behind their arguments. I have a family member that works at Monroe & Associates and has been featured in their videos. There is a reason Elon was willing to invite them to Texas to sit down with them for an interview. The engineers and mechanics can see through the bullshit- they tear down a lot of EVs and dissect everything.

Props to you good sir! Long live the Motor City."
2021-05-25 19:09:10,wallstreetbets,"There's plenty of market share to take from (eg) Toyota, who can't seem to get it together to make a good EV (though they made a good hybrid).

I bought a 2021 Bolt last year after many years of Toyota ownership.  I have a lot of respect for Toyota - my truck had > 200k miles on it with no signs of the engine quitting (though eventually everything else was falling apart).  But, I really like the Bolt and I'd never go back to a gas car now that I've tried electric.

I went long on GM about a week after getting the Bolt.  I like the... car."

- The culture has been shocked pretty badly as we now have a majority of active users *emulating* a culture they never took part in. What happens when the majority of users are emulating the culture in the face of those who helped build it? The emulation becomes the culture, and the original becomes a knock off.

2021-05-25 17:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Some people got tired of the hype and lost interest. GME was like taboo here so we all went to different subs (like you said) or we mostly lurked here and discussed other stocks. And yeah, the taboo bit was understandable to an extent. With people hyping dates and it not playing out, people getting impatient and paperhanding, they didn‚Äôt want to see a ‚Äúfailed‚Äù investment anymore. Plus it did kind of drown out the other stock DDs if you were too retarded to learn how to sort by flairs (which seems to be a common issue here). 

But it‚Äôs hard to want to participate when you‚Äôre discussing something you like, on a relevant post you like, and then the assholes come in to the post just to hate on you. No one made them go into the post except them, but the irrational anger was causing too much drama."

2021-05-25 17:07:43,wallstreetbets,FYI what this means is that from the recent spike the average GME holder is in tendietown!

2021-05-25 17:19:34,wallstreetbets,"Redfin's CEO had some interesting things to say about the housing market:

https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1397189637207121929.html

1 of 15: It has been hard to convey, through anecdotes or data, how bizarre the U.S. housing market has become. For example, a Bethesda, Maryland homebuyer working with @Redfin included in her written offer a pledge to name her first-born child after the seller. She lost.

2 of 15: There are now more Realtors than listings.

3 of 15: Inventory is down 37% year over year to a record low. The typical home sells in 17 days, a record low. Home prices are up a record amount, 24% year over year, to a record high. And still homes sell on average for 1.7% higher than the asking price, another record.

4 of 15: But in two of America‚Äôs largest cities, inventory has increased, in New York by 28%, in San Francisco by 77%. San Francisco hasn‚Äôt had an inventory increase this large since 2008. And still in both markets, prices are increasing.

5 of 15: In 2020, new-construction permits were *down* 13% in DC and New York, 40% in LA, 48% in Chicago, 50% in Seattle, 79% in San Francisco. Permits were *up* 25% in Miami, 56% in Vegas, 96% in Greenville, 122% in Detroit, 246% in Knoxville.

6 of 15: Lumber prices are up 300%.

7 of 15: In Redfin‚Äôs annual survey of nearly 2,000 homebuyers, 63% reported having bid on a home they hadn‚Äôt seen in person.
8 of 15: In an April survey of 600 Redfin.com users who had relocated in the past year, about two thirds of the people who moved got a house the same size or bigger, but about the same proportion, two thirds, spent the same or *less* on housing.

9 of 15: Even though most of the people who moved got a bigger home, 78% reported having the same or more disposable income after their move. Idaho home prices could triple and still seem affordable to a Californian.

10 of 15: For low-tax states, 4 people move in for every 1 who leaves. For Texas, this ratio is 5:1; for Florida, 7:1. Cites & states have no leverage to raise taxes, after many promised new money for social justice; the federal government will have to fund long-term investments.

11 of 15: This migration to lower-cost areas may lead to lower workforce participation. For many families @Redfin has relocated, the money saved on housing costs lets one parent stop working. A wave of Redfin customers are retiring early.

12 of 15: Lenders are calling employers to confirm that the homebuyer will have permission to work remotely when the pandemic ends. Rates are lower for loans on primary residences, and the lender also wants to make sure the borrower actually plans to work after getting the loan.

13 of 15: The average housing budget for out-of-towners moving to Nashville was $720K, ~50% higher than locals‚Äô $485K budget. It used to be coastal elites who worried that every adult in the family had to win a career lottery, just to afford a home. Now that feeling may spread.

14 of 15: it‚Äôs not just income that‚Äôs k-shaped, but mobility. 90% of people earning $100,000+ per year expect to be able to work virtually, compared to 10% of those earning $40,000 or less per year. The folks who need low-cost housing the most have the least flexibility to move.

15 of 15: an investor recently said, with an ancient touch of awe but also greed, that one source of America‚Äôs miraculous economic recovery was the bounty of ‚Äúthe land itself.‚Äù We have more room to grow than we ever imagined. We just have to make sure that benefits everyone."

2021-05-25 19:27:19,wallstreetbets,I am gonna give you all some solid DD.  CRMT.  They sell and finance used cars for rural people in the south and Midwest.  Do you know how good the used car market is?  It's fucking great.   The market cap of the company grew 100% last year during the pandemic after the initial crash.  They are 600% bigger than they were 5 years ago.  They are super profitable and have a PE of 14.5.  This stock is going gangbusters and yall need a ticket to ride.  Earnings was yesterday and they were expected to have 3 bucks in earnings per share.  They crushed it at 6.19 per share.  a total blowout.  This is a stock you want.  Forget growth stocks that promise huge returns in 20 years.  This one is offering huge returns now and has been for the past 5 years.

Then for the rest of the party you and your friends can only play 3 player death match.

Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant.

2021-05-25 18:24:30,wallstreetbets,"Still distraught from the wild bear attacks of this afternoon SPY can vividly remember being surrounded by the towering shadowy figures and their throbbing red bear cock. Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant. 

SPY senses she‚Äôs not out of harms way. She winced as JPOW leans in to her ear and whispers: ‚ÄúI put on my robe and wizard hat.‚Äù"

\#2, I remember reading this elsewhere, but I wonder if that's active realtors, or realtors in general (non-due paying)

Edit: Point #14 is very important as well. This is something I've been thinking a lot about, but I never thought about it from a mobility perspective. In particular for vaccinations, those who needed it most had the least access to pop-up clinics here in Canada. (For 1-2 weeks anyways)"

2021-05-25 16:47:40,wallstreetbets,Who's to say it's worth 200 bucks? Stocks been decoupled from fundamentals for quite some time now.
2021-05-25 19:27:40,wallstreetbets,I think somebody's upset they are missing out on the squeezes.
2021-05-25 19:36:07,wallstreetbets,"When the stocks are trading sideways, down, or slightly green, then yes.

Make your plays, make your money. It's the stock market, not a nanna nanna boo boo market."

2021-05-25 17:20:47,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs all a question of time scale. Realistically, our industrial reality is barely 250 years old. Around 3 generations. Not nearly enough to time to say whether or not it is sustainable.  What is clear is that in those 3 or so generations we have exhausted stores of resources that took thousands, if not millions of years to come into being.  Objectively, therefore, our behavior as a species is not sustainable.  If you reduce your time horizon to ‚Äúfuck it, the worst consequences won‚Äôt come in my lifetime‚Äù, as most are wont to do, then sure, things are just fine."

2021-05-25 16:56:35,wallstreetbets,Minimum I'd want to make if I was single in LA is about $50k. Honestly need more if you want to actually live comfortably and go do fun things and eat out and what not. Plenty of people do get by on much less

Pinned down by the alpha, he was ready to thrust into her as the group sneered and laughed. The alpha bear saw an entry point and began to drill his member into SPY. She closed her eyes and clenched her jaw hoping someone, anyone would help her find an exit strategy. Just as soon as the alpha entered his position he was met with resistance. With A flash of light and several yelps the bears dispersed and ran off into the woods. 

SPY opened her eyes and tried to focus them in the light to see her hero. JPOW takes his hand and gently brushes the market‚Äôs hair out of her eyes. She blushes. 

‚ÄúThank you for saving me from that terrible position. If he drilled another 7% I would never have been the same.‚Äù

JPOW looks deep into SPYs eyes. The energy around him shifts from a calming familiar friend to that of a sinister deviant.

I think there's inherent value when you multiply by the FOMO factor. It's why other meme stocks are decaying. They just aren't jazzy enough. They weren't shorted enough.

The fact remains that there is a cult of people who refuse to sell... and that portion of the float may be significant. 

Theres **always** money to be made in volatility. Smaller float, easier to move the price.

2021-05-25 16:20:46,wallstreetbets,Congratulation you ape!!!!
2021-05-25 15:59:57,wallstreetbets,just bought puts for the ride back to 12
2021-05-25 18:48:38,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-25 16:26:00,wallstreetbets,Works both ways.
2021-05-25 16:48:53,wallstreetbets,good for you. bag holding so others can take profit is not the way. because that‚Äôs what‚Äôll happen
2021-05-25 17:10:04,wallstreetbets,Yup. Finally unloaded my AMC for a good profit. Fuck the haters. Green is green.
2021-05-25 17:28:02,wallstreetbets,"So I'm looking at puts now and trying to determine how it works. If I bought 1 put contract, do I select the strike price of $16 which is what it's at now? It doesn't seem to make sense for this unless I'm doing the math wrong. Right now a $16 put for 6/18 expiry is $2.73 for a total cost of $273.66. So if the stock drops to $12, that's $12 x 100 = $1,200 but my put makes it worth $16 x 100 = $1,600. That's a +$400 difference, then I subtract the initial $273.66 investment which gives me a net profit of $126.34. That seems low. Am I doing this wrong? I am a retard after all. Should I be buying the strike at $12 instead of $16?"
2021-05-25 17:40:29,wallstreetbets,if you learn intrinsic and extrinsic values you‚Äôll see more than likely it‚Äôs more profitable to sell to close the puts rather than exercising the puts
2021-05-25 17:39:33,wallstreetbets,"if you exercise, yes. i‚Äôm not planning on exercising my puts if they go ITM"
2021-05-25 17:46:37,wallstreetbets,So I should buy the puts at a $12 strike or a $16 strike?
2021-05-25 17:48:57,wallstreetbets,"i did on the way up, because they‚Äôre cheap. i bought 5 expiring friday. amc doesn‚Äôt usually hold after these jumps. i could be wrong."
2021-05-25 17:50:03,wallstreetbets,holy fuck dude can you answer the question? $12 strike or $16 strike if buying the put now expecting it to go back to $12 in the next few weeks? You know what... never mind.
2021-05-25 17:50:44,wallstreetbets,"i‚Äôm not suggesting anything. i‚Äôm telling you what i did. which was $12 strike. sorry bud, i was driving. i didn‚Äôt see you mention 12 OR 16 strike, i only saw 12, so that‚Äôs what i was replying to"

2021-05-25 16:18:31,wallstreetbets,"It's could be US tech and the government wants to flex because the world has been destabilizing. They can say publicly that they don't know what the UAPs are, then privately tell combative nations that it's US tech and they need to behave. Or they won't flat out tell anyone and keep it for the next big conflict that happens.

I think the disclosure stuff has been happening because people that were inside of the government thought it was messed up that the tech wouldn't be shared to transform society and make things better. 

My guess is it's anti-gravity/magnetism paired with warp technology and powered by low energy nuclear reactions. Pretty sure our military and specifically the navy has been working on this tech for awhile. I saw some patent stuff that someone had posted at some point. 

Then again. I'm just some rando on the internet. What do I know?"
2021-05-25 15:49:31,wallstreetbets,"If Steven Greer can manage to get more interest in the Disclosure Project I don't think it's very dumb at all. The problem is a lot of the old school guys who were privileged enough to get this information are all dying out slowly. The way it works now is so over compartmentalized that no one really knows the full truth anymore, not like the old timers did.

Since we're just speculating here, I'd put my money into Northrup Grumman before anything else since they're pretty much the ones that got all that tech from the Roswell crash.  Philip Corso who was under Lt. Gen. Arthur Trudeau spoke about how the tech recovered paved the way for particle beams, fiber optics, lasers, integrated circuit, microprocessors, night vision and kevlar. 

There are only a handful of agencies/defense contractors that are involved in that stuff. Supposedly nothing even remotely interesting happens out at Area 51 anymore, all the good stuff was relocated out to Los Alamos and some other D.U.M.B's away from the eyes of everyone else. 

The government still believes that people aren't mentally capable of handling the truth that we're not alone in an infinitely vast universe. They think we're going to go into a panic like it's an Orson Wells radio show and we just can't process it. Little do they know a higher percentage of people believe other worlds exists aside from our own and with that comes other life. The government just can't undo all the lies they've spun because it requires coming outright and saying ""Hey, we lied about this."" They won't do that."

Vimeo could have a platform that's 10x better, but Youtube is just so fucking ubiquitous and already has a shitton of vidoes on it that businesses will just swallow what they get and work around it. If they start leaving and Vimeo gets traction, Youtube can simply relax and then people will come back to Youtube. 

I'm not saying it can't happen, but you absolutely need way more evidence for this."
2021-05-25 16:20:14,wallstreetbets,"I agree with the other commenters, I don't see YouTube and Vimeo as competitors. YouTube is more of a social platform where you can post garbage and comment and hold live stuff etc. Vimeo is more so used for creative content to showcase videography. Not saying they are exclusive but YouTube still has the edge cause they also have high quality creative content perhaps more and their platform gets tailored to your interests etc. But eitherway in the end, I'm gonna have to look at the fundamentals of Vimeo (better have consistent revenue yoy) or wait for it to get on a trend to see if it's worth buying ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è good luck op."
2021-05-25 13:32:15,wallstreetbets,Down only 6% now and we just got to the afternoon.
2021-05-25 17:17:38,wallstreetbets,"I wonder what sort of market share vimeo expects to gain from this and if it will be substantial. There are also other, albeit expensive competitors to vimeo that offer more website integration and analytics - such as vidyard, brightcove, etc.  For ecomm businesses that I've dealt with, they found that other video players and cloud services were preferable over vimeo because it integrated better with their shopping cart system and because of better analytics on the individual viewer.

If vimeo can figure that out and be cheaper then ill be convinced that they are the better service for business IMO.

However, I do like vimeo way better over youtube for businesses.  I enjoyed your thesis. If it gets to the 20-30 range ill pick up some shares."
2021-05-25 13:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Personally on the sentiment level I feel that businesses will not leave Youtube because of that. Youtube is a household name starting gen z. ""Google it"" and ""Youtube it"" is the everyday phrase when it comes to surfing online. At this point its not that the businesses will leave, but rather customer base will stay, and channels will go (or stay) on the platform where users are, because thats where they get their ad $ from."
2021-05-25 14:22:44,wallstreetbets,"I'm excited for both this DD and YouTube to get a haircut on it's users.

Though my Vimeo perception isn't great so I'm wondering they'll be able to overcome that."
2021-05-25 16:29:30,wallstreetbets,If there is anything that can beat YouTube or even come close to YouTube. It‚Äôs twitch. VMEO is not the name I would be interested in. There is a big chance for VMEO however to grow in this sector as YouTube cannot access all the countries yet. At least in terms of paying content creators.I don‚Äôt know if VMEO even pay their content creators or how they do it but it‚Äôs gotta be some good marketing and R&D before VMEO becomes 10% of what YouTube is rn.

2021-05-25 13:53:48,wallstreetbets,"So we're supposed to buy shares in a company that *doesn't* get advertising money?

How does that work?"
2021-05-25 15:18:25,wallstreetbets,"Vimeo is pure cancer garbage. I have no doubt that YT will soon realize what you posted here and will create something like a business package where in certain cases (be it embeded videos on business webpages or smtn) the ads won't be playing and that's it.
Investing in Vimeo is same as investing in stone tires - sure i guess, if you're a Flintstone, but you probably aren't and you probably should not invest in that garbage video platform"
2021-05-25 15:03:33,wallstreetbets,How much do businesses have to pay to circumvent the ads? Might be a decent money spinner for youtube

2021-05-25 17:36:04,wallstreetbets,"That's not it at all. OP's thesis is that businesses will leave YouTube and go to Vimeo, even if it means the business pays Vimeo, to avoid having ads on their content."
2021-05-25 14:40:14,wallstreetbets,Idk but they are already profitable so somebody is buying
2021-05-25 14:54:24,wallstreetbets,That site was awesome back in like 2008-2009 lmao.
2021-05-25 13:34:02,wallstreetbets,"YouTube will always have the best SEO, no doubt. But the SEO of an embedded video is less important than keeping competitors ads away from your site."
2021-05-25 18:57:54,wallstreetbets,"I have used vidyard before but our clients didn't like how expensive it was, especially now that Vimeo offers CTA endscreens. But you are right, vimeo could be better integrated. Hopefully through this IPO process they are encouraged to offer more integration options. I've only used brightcove for app streaming and I didn't work much with the integration, but I did work with their amazing analytics, another thing that Vimeo (and YouTube) could definitely improve upon"
2021-05-25 16:31:19,wallstreetbets,"The post is only about businesses using Vimeo over YouTube. Not people in the YPP program. Vimeo will never eclipse YouTube, I didn't make that argument"
2021-05-25 15:10:37,wallstreetbets,I'm gonna wait another week before placing a larger trade. The IPO was today so it's pretty volatile right now
2021-05-25 14:05:31,wallstreetbets,They are profitable and make their revenue outside of advertising through subscription based pricing for custom video features that my clients happen to like
2021-05-25 15:50:31,wallstreetbets,This is a good take. I wouldn't put it past YouTube to make them pay for something that used to be free

2021-05-25 14:48:33,wallstreetbets,"How profitable though? You did not speak of how profitable they were in your OP, which I think would have maybe helped you prove your point a little better."
2021-05-25 13:35:55,wallstreetbets,Don't big companies host their own videos on the cloud?
2021-05-25 19:11:20,wallstreetbets,"Yea. If vimeo can educate small business owners the perils of putting their product/service videos on youtube, they can def take some market share from youtube. Most small business don't understand that youtube is a social media site - ie - they should be creating more evergreen content that aims to educate and entertain while introducing your brand in a non-intrusive way.  IMO vimeo will never be a social platform."
2021-05-25 16:53:11,wallstreetbets,I got your point but I was trying to provide a perspective on how that reason alone is not key to investing on VMEO. Problems like the one you mentioned can be solved by changing couple lines of code by YouTube if it makes substantial change in their content creator numbers and they prolly already have metrics to track that.
2021-05-25 16:21:50,wallstreetbets,"And considering how ubiquitous YouTube is and how difficult the perceived shift to a new platform would be, i can easily see corporations just coughing up. So yeah as a user this fucking sucks as usual but it's good for them if indeed they do charge a nominal amount to get rid of adverts.."
2021-05-25 13:38:32,wallstreetbets,It depends on what you mean by the cloud there's going to have to be some service hosting the video content. for all of my clients it's hosted on either Vimeo or YouTube sometimes both.
2021-05-25 17:12:05,wallstreetbets,"YouTube could definitely walk back their changes. That doesn't happen too often but sure, it's possible I guess. But assuming they don't, then I can totally see Vimeo picking up thousands or millions of new subscribers which would certainly grow the company.

Even if the businesses stay on YouTube but only embed through Vimeo."
2021-05-25 13:42:30,wallstreetbets,"If amazon has a video enbedded in their website it will be hosted on amazon.  Same with other big companies.  Embedding youtube or vimeo videos for big companies is unprofessional.  They can have a youtube channel and repost videos to attract people off that platform but big companies eg. Amazon or other big retailers will host their own videos on cloud.  You host videos for your clients on Vimeo.  Are they national brands big companies like Coke, Pepsi, Lululemon etc?"
2021-05-25 13:50:30,wallstreetbets,"I work for a few national brands but probably none you've heard of. Along with many smaller businesses. The national ones are the ones using Vimeo now.

It's definitely worth looking around and seeing how often you come across an embedded video/ inspecting it to see where it's hosted"
2021-05-25 14:01:14,wallstreetbets,"So if hosting is their space, and most users go to Vimeo because it is embedded off another website, then they are not a competitor of YouTube.  The userbase and content creators make up YouTube.  

Vimeo is a video filehosting business it seems.  While YouTube is a video social media company.  Sort of like comparing Rackspace to Facebook."
2021-05-25 14:10:24,wallstreetbets,"They are not exactly like YT, but similar enough to be considered a competitor I think. They are the first result when searching ""YouTube alternatives"""
2021-05-25 14:15:24,wallstreetbets,That's like searching Android or iPhone alternatives and landing on Windows Phone...

2021-05-25 18:06:07,wallstreetbets,No it doesn‚Äôt. Especially otm calls with high iv. They will either wait for those calls to expire or wait for them to lose value over time and buy back later for cheap.

2021-05-25 19:56:02,wallstreetbets,"Risky dates no doubt, but I‚Äôm guessing we will see a move higher to 30-35 by 6/4. As far as the 5/28 one goes, not so sure. I don‚Äôt think the stock will drop much from here but it may trade sideways for a few days while last weeks buyers take profit. Time will tell."
2021-05-25 18:11:18,wallstreetbets,"And how do you suggest the price is going to go up if everyone buys calls? Nothing will happen. When you buy calls and not shares you expect others to do the work for you. If stock price goes up let‚Äôs say 100%, that‚Äôs all they get. You, however, would get a lot more. I find it unfair and we should not embrace it here."

Lumber is vital for most projects.

When framing, you could use metal 2x4s but you don‚Äôt want to frame a whole house out with them.

The biggest thing I‚Äôve seen is building decks, where as most people would use lumber, the alternatives such as azek, which is generally much more expensive, is now similarly priced.

If you want a good bet, I‚Äôd actually find a way to do long puts on lumber, once supply comes back in full
Swing, lumber is gonna drop. That‚Äôs the only reason why it‚Äôs down. Supply wasn‚Äôt matching demand. Covid messed up the supply chain."
2021-05-25 12:33:07,wallstreetbets,"There aren‚Äôt many ways to cut lumber usage without switching to metal-framed construction, or entirely concrete block walls(I have no idea what these would cost in relation to current lumber prices). All the stuff you mentioned other than floors: brick, stucco, hardi siding, vinyl. Are all exterior finish products. You still need to have the bones of the house to install those things. You still need to sheathe your exterior walls to put up any kind of siding(real wood siding is almost never used in residential construction anymore. Vinyl is cheaper/easier). In a lot of markets, the walls are sheathed with OSB which is an engineered wood product made from lumber, like plywood in a sense, but cheaper. Now that it‚Äôs skyrocketed people have started using the less popular but still structurally-sound foam board for exterior wall sheathing. You need some extra bracing and still need osb/plywood in certain areas, but the majority of the sheathing can be foam board, which actually insulates better than OSB/plywood, so will be better for energy efficiency in the long run. People just don‚Äôt like it because they don‚Äôt want to imagine their house is ‚Äúmade of foam‚Äù even though it‚Äôs just exterior sheathing, and is still certified structurally safe by engineers.

Wood flooring was already becoming increasingly more and more unpopular because it was already expensive, and high maintenance. They‚Äôve advanced the vinyl plank flooring products to the point that they are very durable, and look like real wood while being easier to maintain. And about the same cost as hardwood, maybe even a little cheaper now.

Edit: this is my experience on east coast USA, anyway"
2021-05-25 12:26:03,wallstreetbets,"Lumber is still cheaper than steel construction. And most of the materials related to home building are high as fuck right now. I‚Äôm seeing people are just carrying on around here. They or taste and wants won‚Äôt change, just the monthly payment."
2021-05-25 12:34:29,wallstreetbets,Lumber has elastic supply pool to a large extent. It‚Äôs pretty straightforward to increase lumber production. I expect supply to catch up soon
2021-05-25 13:28:59,wallstreetbets,Hempcrete it is the ultimate renewable resource!!!! It is carbon negative to grow and harvest and can Produce as much material in 1 acre in one year as lumber can produce off of 1 acre in 20 years
2021-05-25 12:36:26,wallstreetbets,Higher cost for housing and rent as a start. That's what's next.
2021-05-25 12:41:58,wallstreetbets,New construction techniques of the last 60 to 80 years suck the big D.  Wood or steel structure with fake facades of brick or whatever to make it look like an old house.  It's all fake and won't last the test of time.  I predict in the future most of these new homes will be torn down and rebuilt as it will be cheaper and faster to put new versus rehab.
2021-05-25 13:03:56,wallstreetbets,"Copper. From $50 a bundle to $120+.
Even if lumber goes back to normal level the rest of the materials will increase cost of construction. I doubt it will ever go down to precovid level.
But also pretty much every construction material is up 10-50%."

I think this will cause construction costs to skyrocket for general materials and will slow down wood usage pretty dramatically. 

I think there will be a small wood price dip which will cause another rush early summer and then the wood crash comes in August. 

Just my $.02"
2021-05-25 13:36:46,wallstreetbets,"I've heard the lumber spike is fake, they have trees and weren't heavily impacted by covid in Canada, so they're just holding back supply and jacking up prices to follow other commodities."

2021-05-25 19:17:15,wallstreetbets,I supply lumber to many people and some businesses. With the soaring prices people don't want to shop at retail stores anymore and are starting to buy from me because I can offer prices that are dirt cheap compared to the stores. This situation has provided many people in my area with a business opportunity all while helping others out. I am not sure what will happen when prices correct. I only know that as long as I can sell lumber cheaper than home depot I'm winning and where I live there is no shortage of wood.

While lumber prices are up now, and another material may be lower, having construction companies switch completely to another material will just drive up the cost of said material. Lumber prices have already started coming down, so this issue may be moot in 6 months. That being said, I‚Äôd personally love to see more recycled material being turned into studs and other structural components. Not sure the economic viability of this, but it‚Äôs what I think makes some sense to at least evaluate."
2021-05-25 12:30:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm an architect and I've seen first-hand the skyrocketing price of lumber in many project budgets. It's not just the exterior materials that are affected, since most structures are stick-framed out of wood, it is the framing itself that is usually carrying a high line item. Steel is much costlier and the only alternative right now is to use light gauge stick framing, which is traditionally 20-40% more expensive than wood framing."
2021-05-25 12:34:48,wallstreetbets,It wasn't just lumber. Building materials in general have moved in a similar pace. For now all it means is homes will become further out of reach for first time home buyers. Further justifying the high price tag of homes. But it may open up a opportunity for a sector disruptor.

2021-05-25 15:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Depends on local environment. In Mexico they are using recycled plastic bottled as insulation and plastic boards are making a turn on some house projects in the USA. It will create a new demand for recycled plastic along with some constructors using a ""we will cut down less trees hurr durr"" when they want to sell the idea to hippies and environmentalists which they will lap up.

That and a plastic house is cheaper, I want to make one for myself."
2021-05-25 15:33:33,wallstreetbets,All alternative materials stocks are already priced in
2021-05-25 16:44:27,wallstreetbets,The lumber shortage is a short term issue.  The industry expected covid to slow construction but it didn‚Äôt.  Three months from now lumber prices will return to normal.
2021-05-25 17:09:34,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much every building material is running higher.  There's a shortage on pretty much everything. 
I just replaced the roof on my house for 23k. 
Prior to all the increases, the bid was 16k. 
I had to have it done or risk further damage to the home. 
The ONLY thing I have done that seems to be running about the normal price is an aerobic septic system. That was 7k. Still a little higher, but not as bad as other jobs. 

I guess people could start converting concrete sewer tanks to studio apartments."

2021-05-25 19:56:54,wallstreetbets,"I buy construction materials for a living.   I spend about 15 million per year on pipe, insulation, bolts, rebar, concrete, and wire mesh.  I've been purchasing materials for various industries for 30 years.  I've never seen anything like this. None of the veterans in my field have seen anything like this.  All the materials are at record highs and the supply chain can't keep up.  Low interest rates are keeping mortgage payments low and many people saved downpayments during covid.  The ratio of payments to income still makes buying a home affordable at the current interest rates.  Right now I can't get enough materials to stay stocked up.  Then what happens when they pass the 1.7T infrastructure bill.  The supply chain is overheated but nobody I know knows when the train wreck will happen.  Many stock prices for these companies are double or triple where they were in March 2020."
2021-05-25 13:18:37,wallstreetbets,"well this has been covered pretty well by everyone else

people aren't going to make many structural changes to reduce demand in construction or increase supply by capital investment

therefore, the rate of new construction will simply need to come down. we are probably already peaking or peaked"
2021-05-25 13:23:23,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it. Trees aren't going to stop growing just cuz we aren't cutting them either. They are still there getting bigger and waiting for the loggers to clear them and for the yards to restock.

2021-05-25 17:19:20,wallstreetbets,"For the record, we engineers hate that foam sheathing. 

There are lots of alternatives but most of them are more expensive and require a change in the way people do business. SIPs, Thermasteel, CFMF, ICFs. Heck I've even done rammed earth and strawbale (crazy granolas!). Most turn out to be more cost than just throwing up sticks. Even expensive sticks. 

FWIW, I dabbled in options for the first time this spring - and made money on a Boise Cascade call. Felt like Jeff Bezos spending that $22 on really good box of wine. :-D"

2021-05-25 17:10:48,wallstreetbets,"And importantly, lumber has never been the issue.  The bottleneck was sawmills.  In fact lumber is cheap now."
2021-05-25 19:14:12,wallstreetbets,"Company sells Clayton homes among others.  Had to rewrite our entire module for updating prices in our sales application.  Price increases of 2% to as much as 10% are happening weekly now.  This has been going on for almost a year.  The old system was chewing up too much manpower and time to update, and was originally spec'd to handle updates bi-monthly.  It couldn't handle same-day updates that we are experiencing.

There has been no noticeable drop in sales, and last year was a record that more than doubled the previous years sales."
2021-05-25 12:35:15,wallstreetbets,"I would say no.

Tbh, many people have been cancelling jobs due to the price increase.

I‚Äôve had 20k jobs have to be repriced to 50k to make up the difference, and customers flat out tell
Me they can‚Äôt afford it, which I understand completely.

There‚Äôs demand for work to be done, but at this price point, not many residential work is willing to fork over the cash if they can wait it out."
2021-05-25 17:14:46,wallstreetbets,"You can. It's easy and the residential Code (in the US) has tables for it - you don't even need an engineer (my profession, btw).  The kicker is that *everything* has to be done differently with metal studs (Cold Formed Metal Framing, or CFMF). Some of the sizes are normal (3-5/8"" studs are standard, and while 5.5"" exist, 6"" is more common...bet a 6"" stud requires all 6"" window/door jambes to be packed an extra 1/2"" - which is added trim labor).  Although you can cut them with a chop saw witht he right blade,you go through blades faster.  You can't  nail them so you're using screw guns an crimpers. They have special bracing. And you need either armored cable or plastic grommets to run electrical. Plumbing is also a little more challenging. Even the drywallers have to switch screws. 

The metal floors tend to be noisier than lumber as well (they can  ""ring"" under footfalls unless they have heavier subfloor with thick topping). 

And the biggest issue is that in 18 months, after you've spent $40k per person on equipment,  training, call backs, and general learning curve fuckups, the price of lumber will go down and you'll have all the gear to build with a more expensive product than all your competitors. Without some cataclysmic event like a complete loss of timber products for the foreseeable future, it won't make financial sense."
2021-05-25 13:53:18,wallstreetbets,"Correct, but you‚Äôre forgetting one thing, most building use steel beams and concrete which has been reinforced with steel inside."
2021-05-25 18:10:36,wallstreetbets,"You're paying for totally different engineering, a structural engineer, machinery to lift the parts, then totally different workers and more expensive tools and time. 

At a certain point if the prices were competitive and you had the patience sure. But my guess is there's a pretty massive floor before you get to steel framing being cheaper. 

Also steel prices can rocket too. My best friend's home was originally steel framed, but after it rocketed the cost of the house went to like 5x, so they had to scrap the plans and also resubmit. 

Luckily his brother was the architect and he had all the time in the world to do the project. But for a lot of people just that would really kill their budget."
2021-05-25 17:32:45,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm just an estimator for residential construction. Used to sell lumber and building materials at my last job, now I help buy them(basically) üòÇ.

I have a retirement plan with my employer so I‚Äôm not really looking at the stock market as investment, mostly gambling. I have a lot of reading to do tho. Is there any  beginner-level reading on options trading you‚Äôd recommend?"
2021-05-25 19:03:54,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had several customers price compare metal studs, none of them went that way lol."

A couple years ago we made too many homes. Kinda crashed the market. Went from 20 houses a day to 14. Was a nice break. Got out of work at one everyday and still got paid for 40 hours. Nice.
2021-05-25 12:37:24,wallstreetbets,Shit...I knew I should have sold a few weeks ago. I'll have to hope for some VIX. Thanks for your input.

2021-05-25 18:11:25,wallstreetbets,"We did an interior of a basement with metal 2x4. We bought 3 blades and still needed more. It‚Äôs practical and can be done, but there‚Äôs a reason why it isn‚Äôt done.

2021-05-25 14:37:30,wallstreetbets,Markets are forward looking...even if investors think weed will be legalized in the next 5 years this shit will start popping. Probably due for a squeeze soon seeing as the May short interest will be updated and I expect it to be greater than 30%

Isomerized distillates are the future, most companies are building infrastructure for growing high quality flower, not bulk hemp biomass for isomerization. There are companies online selling pure delta8 THC (which is just as easy to make as delta9 from CBD) for under $3 a gram at a retail level. This shit is going to/already is shaking up the industry so much it‚Äôs not even funny. These companies are used to charging anywhere from 20-100 a gram for concentrates. It is the very least, very risky."

2021-05-25 16:09:32,wallstreetbets,Lol Tilray again? Come on dawg. We‚Äôve literally seen exactly how this plays out already.
2021-05-25 15:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Why? TLRY has had some major short squeezes in the past, the latest to $60 in February. 

It's now merged with APHA since then and will be the biggest cannabis company in the world. 

We are waiting on major US catalysts, descheduling, decriminalization, and legalization. Some progress towards any of those can create major short squeezes across all the major cannabis players.  

What facts do you need to know?"
2021-05-25 18:31:02,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats the caveat here. I think the reality is the Phillip Morris and RJ Reynolds have more access to a federally legal weed market than a large Canadian company. 

Does anyone below a border state drink Molson?"

2021-05-25 18:41:09,wallstreetbets,"Actually the only Canadian company who has a clear path to the United States is Canopy Growth, as they already have an agreement with an American MSO.  Tilray does not have any agreement with any American cannabis company, yes they own a craft beer company but that is not a cannabis company.  Tilray will no doubt merge or purchase a smaller MSO just like Canopy is going to do.  For these reason i am only invested in the BIG MSOs as they are going to have the possible biggest upside upon up listing."

They‚Äôre all small operations operating in a grey area of the law making delta 8 which is *technically* legal in most of the USA.

There‚Äôs just no way the other guys are going to be able to compete, unless the government/lobbyists step in and fuck things up.

>Tilray has no path in the USA

That is 100% false.

APHA's sweet water acquisition allows them entry into the US, now for growing they can acquire one or more of the countless MSOs if they want until full legalization occurs. 

Either way, all the other runs, to $300 and to $60 occurred with NO CATALYSTS. Those WILL come.

Perhaps you should look at Article VI, Clause 2 of the US Constitution. The Supremacy Clause rules all, unless it is an actual state prerogative. Regulation of drugs? Not a state-controlled issue normally. It‚Äôs federal. Again, the DOJ is allowing states to do it and it‚Äôs a clusterfuck. Federal legislation and regulation absolutely pre-empt that.

2021-05-25 17:29:04,wallstreetbets,SOXL is good but the semiconductor field has been volatile and makes it not very appealing to hold SOXL  for long. I sell my SOXL when it goes up and see signs of downward trend.

Its liquid just like any other etf. You're just 3x exposed to the underlying index, in this case some bank wank.

2021-05-25 15:18:38,wallstreetbets,"I was kinda thinking the same as the above guy. Repos are way up and I think some bank in Italy blew up this week. Archegos is scary, I think there's a lot of unstable leverage out there rn. Rising repos indicate that banks are losing trust in each other (IIRC). Might be a harbinger of things to come. Your trade tho, I'm sure you're way more on the banking industry current events than me. Good luck! You got big cahones to fuck with these 3x etfs"
2021-05-25 12:46:05,wallstreetbets,"Yep. The latest round of QE isn't working anymore, the liquidity the Fed is injecting from COVID bond purchases has nowhere to go, imho. Hence repo spike since last month. At best, the Fed will have to scale back, which helps my trade. At worst, it loses control of the rates and then we are all fucked, not just this trade.

Also as archigos capital went down GS and MS both didn‚Äôt give two shits about other banks and covered themselves early, so I kind of see them as being able to withstand issues earlier then others.

2021-05-25 14:47:39,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my UVXY calls sitting in gross contango.
2021-05-25 14:42:56,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs great!
2021-05-25 15:29:01,wallstreetbets,So I'm vested in TQQQ and I don't understand this. TQQQ has gained 1194% in 5 years while QQQ has gained 212.34%. What's the drawback?
2021-05-25 16:18:23,wallstreetbets,The delusion of the GME cult. Everything centres around GME. GME is my saviour. GME is my air and condom in the night.
2021-05-25 13:53:16,wallstreetbets,I thought they executed anyone on corruption charges they didnt like

2021-05-25 16:56:49,wallstreetbets,"Because FAS is exposed to the underlying index triply, including losses. You're not gaining anything % wise, you're just magnifying the returns by 3x. So if someone else would lose 1 dollar or gain one, you 3, but the % is linear. 

So rather than making 40% you gain 120%.

But if you were to lose 40%, you would lose like 95% or however that math works."
2021-05-25 16:18:59,wallstreetbets,FAS is the ticker for the triple leveraged version.
2021-05-25 18:33:20,wallstreetbets,There's your problem. Buying calls or puts on any daily 3x etf. They are guaranteed money losers in either direction.

2021-05-25 15:29:51,wallstreetbets,it not a bad choice when the market is melting up.
2021-05-25 15:45:01,wallstreetbets,"1) 3x up also means 3x down

2) any ETN offering leverage is just managing a futures portfolio on your behalf for a handsome fee. You are getting leverage in exchange for depreciation and roll yield. Leverage works, until it doesn't. Works in a 10 year bull market, will get decimated if the markets stagnate or decline. 

&#x200B;

If you have the capital, you might as well buy the NQ futures yourself and save on management fees."
2021-05-25 16:41:32,wallstreetbets,The whole GME cult is getting beyond ridiculous.
2021-05-25 16:30:05,wallstreetbets,They really believe that people who have been in this game for over 30-50 years are going to have a market wide meltdown because of one stock
2021-05-25 16:28:11,wallstreetbets,got banned for calling it a cult in GME
2021-05-25 14:12:35,wallstreetbets,"Correct. But they let all the small time local corruption slide, because bribery is culturally accepted there. It would be like Texas executing someone for having too many guns."
2021-05-25 17:17:58,wallstreetbets,The trick is to lower the price until someone says yes.
2021-05-25 17:39:09,wallstreetbets,How the hell DOES that math work? Honestly never thought about that side of it. I think for a 40% loss its like .60\*.60\*.60=.22 left from your investment = 78% loss. Could be wrong though
2021-05-25 18:39:45,wallstreetbets,Thank you kind stranger
2021-05-25 19:38:25,wallstreetbets,Then writing options is a guaranteed money printer?

>What could be ‚Äúthe biggest crash ever,‚Äù he argues, will hit by the end of June, if not sooner. It will be ‚Äúthe initiation of the next big economic downturn,‚Äù Dent predicts.  
>  
>‚ÄúFake earnings, fake GDP, fake interest rates and super-high valuations‚Äù make for an increasingly untenable situation, he warns. The expanding market bubble has been building since 2008. But the Federal Reserve keeps averting the next huge crisis by continuously ‚Äúprinting money,‚Äù declares the Harvard Business School MBA.

>His HSD Publishing, an independent research firm, generates monthly newsletters that he and Rodney Johnson, HSD president, each write.¬†

>In the interview, Dent delivers his prescription for investing amid the weakened economy and impending disaster, as he sees it: Zero in on long-term Treasurys.  
>  
>‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs better than sleeping with 30-year Treasury bonds,‚Äù he exults. They‚Äôll ‚Äúmagnify your money.‚Äù He then describes a portfolio allocation for the investor that‚Äôs ‚Äúwilling to take more risk.‚Äù As for the notion of high inflation, ‚Äúno way in hell,‚Äù he says.

Not sure what to feel about this, especially when there are lot of big players saying the same.

Open to discussion..

2021-05-25 12:09:27,wallstreetbets,"I equate Treasury bonds with cash.  
You can exchange them for cash.  
They make very little interest over time.  
It‚Äôs what banks use to get cash from the treasury when they need liquidity.

The Chinese government is one of the biggest holders of Treasury bonds.  
If Treasury bonds crash and the US government can no longer finance its‚Äô massive debt then China will be left holding the bag.

So why put your money into Treasury bonds if they are tied to cash? (which the government can dilute by printing more of it)

Both political parties have shown themselves to be fiscally irresponsible.  The national debt will no longer be able to be financed at some future date.  My take is that we are over-leveraged from a national debt perspective.  

I should probably buy precious metals and crypto.  The advantage of crypto over precious metals is portability.  

You may not be able to carry large amounts of gold over international borders.  You would be able to carry a USB key or a Sim card with your crypto key.  

Worst case scenario is the US economy collapses and we can no longer finance our national debt.  

If you needed to go bug out and live in another country (because of US inflation, taxation, economic collapse, political unrest, whatever) to weather that storm, crypto would be really useful.  

‚Ä¶ Assuming the US government won‚Äôt feel its sovereignty threatened by crypto ‚Ä¶ which it does since USD is tied to oil - petrodollar and some crypto will compete with USD as the international oil currency and outlaw it.  Sorry for the run on sentence.  Just brainstorming."

The main thing for me is my good performers are doing fine but all my red stocks are down like 30-45% (weed stocks) so I'm waiting for the things (that will crash eventually) to try and catch them on the way back up before they peak and crash again. 

But I'm not sure, they are such a small percentage of my portfolio. Any holders on WEED, TLRAY, HEXO? Do we expect +50% in the next 8 years?? Because that's the only way that those ones will be worth anything to hold. Otherwise I should just cut my losses and reinvest elsewhere."

2021-05-25 12:45:42,wallstreetbets,"> ""Biggest crash of 80% or 90% in early June"" 

Just to clarify, that means that a solid outgrown value company would give easily 50-60% of your investment as a dividend in the next year.

A company like AMD would trade at a single digit P/E ratio. Giving you at least a 10% pa profit completely without any future growth at all.

This would obviously be candy land for every investor but it's bullshit.

Fake earnings and fake GDP? He should actually give any proof or people should stop(or don't start? I don't know that guy) listen to that demagogue."

2021-05-25 18:11:49,wallstreetbets,If you think the markets having a 90% crash just buy 200-500 in recurring spy puts. That way you only loses 200-500 every few weeks instead of purging your account based on a broken clock.

There are some issues with the commodities prices rising here and there. But the world kind of accepted money printing. IMO we're looking at good years coming up. The next crisis won't be caused by the financial system or too high valuations but by global warming. That's the only possible external shock that could culminate in an unforeseen event. My guess is we have around 10-15 good years ahead then it all depends on what the weather does. Each crisis is unique, and calling another dot-com crash is plain dumb at this point.

What  will lose 90%? Apple, Amazon or Microsoft? Fuck me in that case most of this sub would be balls deep buying the dip. I've waited since 2008 for the March 2020 meltdown, can't wait for another shopping spree"

2021-05-25 12:46:04,wallstreetbets,"It really depends how you look at things. Some will say we've gone too high too fast, but I like to argue the converse. The S&P seen YoY seen returns of about 20%, well within the returns it usually sees when it doesn't fall into a bear market, which tends to be about 15-35%.

Another arguement often thrown around is how similar this looks to the dotcom bubble. The difference between the 2 is that, at the height of the dotcom bubble, the Nasdaq had a P/E of 200. Right now, that number sits at 40.

One of the final arguments I hear is that we seen a lot of money printed this year, and QE will have to stop. While there is an argument for out-of-the-ordinary inflation to be made, I don't see it. CPI numbers were carried by used car sales, that became evident when PPI numbers were released, and retail sales were dismal. The argument that the printing of money will lead to inflation has proven itself to be a weak one, as inflation depends more on money velocity. In a time where investing is far easier than it was 10 years ago, I think a lot of money printed is being sent into assets for peoples' futures. It's worth noting that QE was implemented following the 2008 financial crisis, and it led to the bull run that brought us to where we stand today."

I've watched over the past three months the walk in hiring wage go up $5/hr and they still have to limit hours due to not having enough employees.   Currently unemployment pays around $18/hr here with other states being 16-25/hr depending where you live.   As fast food chains raise their hiring pay rates they will have to also raise the wages of those already working there to a degree.

We've been in the same channel for 100yrs...just broke out to the top...the correction won't come until the Fed stops buying 
$120bn of bonds per month.  If the USA wants to hold onto reserve status, we can't devalue that USD forever.  So interest rates going to climb, valuations will go down.   How fast, how far, when that happens?   Henry Dean doesn't know.   Michael Burry doesn't know.

Every country on earth is devaluing during Covid...it's the only way the Fed gets away with it.  Eventually an economic winner of the Covid crisis emerges ..if it's China our pain will be the interest rate climb to stay relevent, and then the pain his the greater economy.  That doesn't start until the fed stops brrr...  

The setup we have today is the same as 1927-1929...if it plays out the same (which it probably won't) it could mean the same 90% off stock valuations and a 10yr depression to follow.  I believe history echoes, I don't believe anything was fixed from the 2008 crash, so yes I feel it will happen again.  Stock up  now...the party isn't over until the fed stop brr...don't play risky shit you can't lose, but don't miss out on the gains.  Then again this is WSB...fuck it YOLO apes!"

2021-05-25 12:51:51,wallstreetbets,actually the lower class generally gains the most from inflation (when wages rise with it) because their debts are now significantly easier to pay off
2021-05-25 17:19:11,wallstreetbets,">The next crash are we going to need 30 trillion? The one after that 60 trillion? Its not sustainable and the people that pay the highest cost are the middle class and the lower class.

Why do you think it's not sustainable? As long as inflation and interest rates are low, those debts can be serviced. The Dollar will continue to lose its value at 99.9...% but never reaches 0.

For the Dollar to collapse everybody in the world has to lose faith in the current system. So you will have to follow the cryptos crowds who believe the collapse of the fiat monetary system."

These things dont just happen in isolation and its not all just cause of some magical property of the currency. It is all because of broader things, like the absolute defeat of the labour movement, the advent of neoliberalism, and the increased monopolization of the economy. 
And the working class has always payed the highest cost (cause there is no such thing as ""middle class"", or at least mostly), its one of the ways the people up top make money"

Even if debts are supposedly easier to pay under inflation, unless the balance of the debt is consistently going up, the decrease cost of goods actually means deflation makes it easier to pay off debts. 

It‚Äôs the corporate and business debt that suffers during deflation and with a fiscal monetary policy that favors this debt economy, that‚Äôs the real reason for fear of deflation. How else will Gates afford another mega yacht?"

2021-05-25 17:07:29,wallstreetbets,"Two points. One is that governments usually don‚Äôt last for hundreds of years. In most cases that means whatever currency they used to have becomes worthless. In the case of the Soviet Union, the ruble didn‚Äôt become entirely worthless but it did drop 99.9%.

That country was a superpower. Being big and powerful doesn‚Äôt ensure longevity. The same thing could happen to the US.

The second point is that gold has lasted for 5000+ years as a unit of wealth. If the dollar is pegged to gold, the dollar‚Äôs only risk is the US govt collapsing. If the dollar is not pegged to gold, the dollar has an additional risk of having its value impacted by a huge number of other factors.

Over a long timeline, the likelihood of events causing significant impacts increases"
2021-05-25 19:36:54,wallstreetbets,"depends what you think targeted ads means.

&#x200B;

this scenario is most likely one of:

1) branded search terms or product terms (retail).  Companies buy these to make sure you dont go with a competitor.

2) bad retargeting with no churn mechanism (showing you an ad for something you just bought)

other scenarios too but it depends on what you are talking about buying.

2021-05-25 18:36:02,wallstreetbets,Not if robots and AI take over most jobs. Tech deflation and demographics are massive deflationary pressures.
2021-05-25 19:00:02,wallstreetbets,"That won‚Äôt change the deflationary outcome. You‚Äôre forgetting a few keys things. Yes as other comment mentions AI will continue to take jobs so the increased purchasing power may not even occur. But also,

A decreasing world population with increased purchasing power doesn‚Äôt change market saturation conditions. If there are less people, they will buy less of certain things. You CAN have too much stuff and while planned obsolescence has delayed some of that, push it too far and you forever lose a customer in the absence of monopolies.

The ONLY real solution would be to cut production and limit the product on the market. The side effect of doing that is you fire people. This leads to a deflationary spiral because if more people lose purchasing power, there‚Äôs even less money chasing product which deflates even more.

So simply put, I don‚Äôt think your thesis will hold up to depopulation. And modernization has actually led to less being needed anyways, with tech adding utility and making clutter more unnecessary.

Deflation is coming."
2021-05-25 15:00:33,wallstreetbets,"There will always be a lower class. So saying ""the lower class is still poor"" doesn't refute his argument. At the exact moment of the crash anybody who wasn't irresponsibly overleveraged got a huge boost to their ability to repay their debts while dodging the collapse in equity markets. If they then paid off their debts faster as a result and put their surplus into the markets they would enjoy major returns from the bull market of the last 10 years.

What he said was perfectly valid."
2021-05-25 14:32:08,wallstreetbets,"correction and crash are different. We've been in a correction for almost 3 months now, the scary part of a crash is that you don't really know when it's starting exactly"
2021-05-25 17:32:01,wallstreetbets,I didn‚Äôt know we created a law that defines a correction as 10%. So it can‚Äôt be a correction at 9%?  What about 9.9%?   SO CLOSE WE ALMOST CORRECTED.

In the first quarter, it sold 73,000 houses, while Zillow and Opendoor sold fewer than 5,000 combined. But eXp World reports a smaller revenue number because, for it, that metric doesn't represent the sales value of the houses. (Because of an accounting quirk, Opendoor and Zillow report all the houses sold as revenue to the company).""

Zillow currently has a market cap of 27b. While EXPI has a market cap of 4.22b at the time of this writing. While EXPI is doing 14.6 times the amount of selling that Zillow is it has a market cap that is 6.75 times less than Zillow. That means the EXPI could easily move up 6 times what it is trading at now.

28x6=$168 per share.

EXPI also just increased their share buyback program from 75m to 475m. Which means they could buy a ton of stock and are probably going to announce a share buyback. Sending the already 54% insider owned stock absolutely skyrocketing due to them not selling the stock and supply running short.

They also are expanding into other countries right now and are on pace to be the largest worldwide real estate company.

My price target for the next 4-7 weeks on EXPI is $60.

Note:
Currently holding 57 $45c 6/18. And buying more. Once get more capital."

It's a ""commission sharing"" based real estate network that involves the newest members doing the leg work and the earlier members profiting. Had a coworker that just left a cushy city job to join it. Its only a matter of time before it collapses. Youd be better off investing in CutCo. At least they've had their scheme for a lot longer."

They basically work for them and they get their clients from the higher ranking members then give a % for the referral.

2021-05-25 11:42:15,wallstreetbets,"Take a ride through r/antimlm. Lots of information on the company and their ""tactics."" I doubt Remax agents earn money when their new agents recruit other agents. My old coworker was telling me she had to put in a minimum of 10 leads a day (not sure if company wide or just a regional thing) and that was just for potential agents. The sales leads also went to every agent in the area which means there are no specific clients. If she put a lead in, they were given to more senior people rather than her taking the sale. The company focuses on a heavy recruitment strategy over an agent's personal sales and growth. A lot of agents are leaving because of it."

- Near all-time lows. I‚Äôm no lover of COIN, but I see recent lows as floors. 
- Crackdowns in China trading has limited available brokerages. Low supply on brokerages and high demand should help Coinbase out.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME is a rocket launch site >$190 (5-star set up) WSBrethren,

I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site. The only thing missing is volume.

I like the stock, but do your own due diligence. There is always uncertainty. Don't speculate with $ you can't afford to lose.

Update (7:45pm) -

Well, GME broke the hell out of its channel. Don't believe the reports talking about a squeeze. The squeeze has not squoze. You'll know it's squeezing when the price shoots up dramatically. And each squeeze makes the next one more likely. Don't expect a smooth ride but I don't see much resistance from here to $300.

2021-05-25 15:31:45,wallstreetbets,"...and we're back.

OP here from a beater account. Want to clarify something so there's no misunderstanding.

Reddit suspended my account, not WSB. Pretty problematic on Reddit's part, to say the least, considering how many billion dollar institutions are short. I appreciate WSB for allowing a legitimate post to stand. 

The mods here are just following the rules, so cut them some slack plz. If outside links were allowed then reddit would be filled with spam. 

Now that we're out of the channel I think GME has serious upside. I wouldn't expect an easy ride but the longs have the shorts where they want em. Do your own DD though.

The attention was spent, and if you didn't sell at that point you only lost. Now you're asking for more volume? From where? Its been coming from gme apes the entire time.

Good news is they already edited. Here is the post. 


>WSBrethren!

>I want to call attention to the fact that GME has been consolidating for 2 months and looks just about ready to launch. Check the chart below, courtesy of traderstewie. For months GME has been tightening and building higher lows on the daily and weekly. The key level to break out of the wedge is \~190 which we're pretty much exactly at now. Above $190 the path looks open to $300+.

>**What I'm saying my friends is that GME is starting to look like a rocket launch site.**

>The only thing missing is VOLUME. SPCE & TSLA look interesting but what we're seeing in GME is 5-star. Think maybe it's time we get the band back together.

>Not advice, I just like the stock. Do you?

I know diamonds are supposed to be the most valuable gem, but I beg to differ. When have you seen any one single stone worth $69,420,000? Even the hope diamond doesn't cost that much.

Edit: I stand corrected!
The Hope Diamond in the National Museum of Natural History
Weight	45.52 carats (9.104 g)
Cut by	Unknown.
Owner	United States
Estimated value	$200‚Äì$350 million USD

We know it can go well into the multiple thousands based on testimonies to Congress following the January spike.

But truth is that nobody knows for sure. Liquidity on this stock is insanely low. GameStop completed their multi-million share sell off to raise capital without it affecting the price much at all, and without anyone really knowing that it was happening. So, at this point, it can take off at any time, and when that happens and share recalls start going out, the price should really boom.

Plus, shareholders have been voting for a couple weeks now and the annual meeting is coming up. The company could announce a share recall before the meeting should far more votes come in than should be possible, or if any other fuckery is sniffed."

As isolated, yeah, you're ""analysis"" is correct.  It would be true OF ANY STOCK. Looking for a breakout because of a single resistance would be monolithically stupid. And, if that's all you see, don't make a move. But, if that's all you've seen, you're blind.

2021-05-25 16:25:50,wallstreetbets,Just up 23% in 1 month and they haven't even announced their new CEO yet. Look at the all-star lineup they hired so far this year.

**WE DON'T HAVE TO BUY, THE SHORTS DO**

Disclaimer: I am buying as well."
2021-05-25 13:57:22,wallstreetbets,"lol - <and the first idiots to come along miss the point> - Sit on your share as long as you like dude, it won't change value unless SOMEBODY is trading those shares.

Nobody buys and nobody sells - that market won't move. Get it?

First principles?VOLUME ?

Like wtf, just off the top of my head - why do you THINK 9 million degenerates joined WSB suddenly for some reason ... if you are able to think?

I guess you diamond handz DONT put your own shares out to graze for you, even though you are COVERED?"
2021-05-25 12:11:27,wallstreetbets,Lol 1k chump change. It hit 350 without any margin calls
2021-05-25 13:49:05,wallstreetbets,10 mil floor
2021-05-25 17:43:20,wallstreetbets,"$1k is realistically worst case scenario.

Even VW broke $1000 in '08 and that was nothing in comparison.

Law of supply and demand and this specific stock could mean during a margin call the price can theoretically go to infinity.

**THEY HAVE TO BUY, WE DONT HAVE TO SELL**

*An available float for funds to buy, really doesn't exist.*

But seriously how is anyone supposed to have an actual answer to your question.

Sell on the way down."
2021-05-25 13:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Nope.  Sitting back, relaxing, and waiting."
2021-05-25 17:57:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm chilling and buying more. Price is irrelevant (except for in the case how many shares you can buy) until the squeeze.

This thing could hit $40 and I'll happily load up.

When this squeezes it will $1000 bare minimum, even if they began covering at $40."

I‚Äôm not hating on it.  I could care less as there is a plethora of valuable DD elsewhere related to GME.  But the optics of ‚Äúpro-GME‚Äù posts getting dinged and dropped makes for a compelling case for mod-biases.  Just sayin."

2021-05-25 12:29:56,wallstreetbets,When it gets back to that make sure you keep holding because once we pass there then we are not coming back down. You held through the red so now hold through the green. When i started if i was in red for a while i used to sell it near enough as soon as it went green. Guess it was a psychological thing because i didn't think it was working. I could have made loads if i held back through the green.. then i met GME and i grew some big ass üíéü§≤s been up 26k and down -6k on this but i 1000% know this is the safest thing to put your money into.

I think it's safe to say that technicals do not matter, as much as fundamentals do not matter.

That being said, I'm always down to listen. What's your motivation to hold? Tell me how holding GME will change things?"

2021-05-25 13:29:16,wallstreetbets,‚Äúa few people are buying‚Äù and a 10% to 6% drop isn‚Äôt much. Fidelity users alone could hold the entire float if the average was 10 shares per person. Doesn‚Äôt hurt to own a few while still investing in whatever companies WSB favors. LOL at coin base btw (even tho i love their company)
2021-05-25 14:11:14,wallstreetbets,"you understand percentage doesn't matter as long as that percentage own the float right?

or that a platform like etoro grows in users all. the. time."
2021-05-25 14:27:45,wallstreetbets,"And what does that prove exactly? I'm trying to follow your logic, but not only do the numbers on a single platform make up only a small piece of the picture, a 4% (unsourced) drop isn't even very significant. 

As lazy as some of the apes are with their DD, this kind of shit is even lazier because it  it doesn't even make basic sense."

now if your users who own a stock drops from 11% to 6.5% its not 4%. its actually 40% pecent of a drop. this is how math works. its not weighed against the totality of users, but the size of the users in there.

maybe it doesnt make sense, because you dont understand extremely basic statistical math?"

2021-05-25 17:26:35,wallstreetbets,"i just don‚Äôt get it tho, the IPO was golden and the company had a ton of support. The market doesn‚Äôt make sense but then again we‚Äôre still barely coming out of COVID lol"

2021-05-25 18:24:41,wallstreetbets,That's not bad but I'm thinking the people that bought in high will be the first ones to sell once they make their money back and a nice profit. Once it dips again I might get back in but I'm not counting on it as other priorities come first and can't have my money sitting waiting for it to moon
2021-05-25 17:04:07,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you're smart enough to hold GME.

price is irrelevant until shorts fully cover. This means I would absolutely love another drop to $40 but there's no way we'd be given such another buying opportunity."

I've been digging deep into this thing for a while. It is apparent that early sells will not be enough to knock this out of orbit. The sheer magnitude of this entire situation is insane. 

>can't have my money sitting waiting for it to moon 

I want to add, avoid investing money that you don't want to lock away for at least 5 years. This shouldn't be money that you need.

All of my remaining investments have taken a back seat. They're not going to perform anywhere near as well as this short squeeze."

The sooner you realize that, the sooner you will come to your senses. Do you REALLY think they are worth $15B? In the company‚Äôs prime, they were only worth $9 billion. They literally posted the lowest holiday quarter profits since 2006. Lol

Buying the ring definitely sounds great too, I hope they love it. Love them to the moon and back like it's GME at the end of the squeeze.

This is my point and where I knew this conversation would end up. You guys always quote the DTCC and how they‚Äôll just liquidate all members until GMErs are paid. But when I press that theory with such a simple question, like ‚Äúwhy don‚Äôt they withdraw using the official withdrawal process‚Äù it becomes a shrug. For how important the DTCC liquidation is to you guys getting paid, I‚Äôm surprised nobody thinks through any of these basic questions."
2021-05-25 14:07:45,wallstreetbets,Did you follow major banks personnel changes prior to GME to know this is actually unusual?

My big losses are with $GME.  Bought in at $375 and again at $267.  At least I'm back over half.  

I don't know how you people deal with the stress of using margin, etc. to over leverage yourself.  I guess the money I'm using is not money I can afford to lose."

2021-05-25 16:33:52,wallstreetbets,Purchased BB and XL Fleet at the same time. Both have put a drag on m earnings.  Glad gme is picking up lack

2021-05-25 16:52:07,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I bought more BB last week and I don't even know why. Maybe it's that crayon lodged in my brain.

It really hasn't done anything for me.

2021-05-25 17:50:14,wallstreetbets,Most of the big losses lately is from yolo options on meme stocks even though every retarded ape shouted to buy shares

2021-05-25 16:46:40,wallstreetbets,BB is going to trade sideways for the rest of time with the occasional spike.
2021-05-25 18:08:45,wallstreetbets,"Holding @ 17, but I'll carry on indefinitely until death's door or moon."
2021-05-25 14:51:18,wallstreetbets,"When you see people posting gains about stocks they've diamond-handed for months, do you think they felt like they were winning and massively in the green the whole time?"
2021-05-25 15:16:48,wallstreetbets,The worst is that they make moves in industries that seem like great ideas and this will help the stock... then drops 5% after the announcement.

2021-05-25 14:50:20,wallstreetbets,Good thing I only bought 3 shares of BB.....
2021-05-25 15:09:23,wallstreetbets,This is it. Very frustrating even tho it has best fundamentals and most positive news of all the meme stocks
2021-05-25 10:52:18,wallstreetbets,It's just that there are bagholders all along the teens range that sell off as soon as they are green.
2021-05-25 13:40:34,wallstreetbets,"Indeed very frustrating. I'm holding about 1k shares @ 11.90USD and it is painful to watch AMC and GME movements, and BB doing sh\*t nothing even though good fundamentals. Guess until revenue doesn't show up, this will be stuck :("
2021-05-25 14:29:46,wallstreetbets,Just takes some time..
2021-05-25 14:36:05,wallstreetbets,I held GME out of spite untill I hit good profit. Just diamond hands. Even the bears don't expect that much lower.
2021-05-25 15:13:08,wallstreetbets,Same brah lol
2021-05-25 14:36:49,wallstreetbets,Not a loss if you don‚Äôt sell
2021-05-25 15:42:29,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm right there with ya, 18.10 for me."
2021-05-25 19:54:25,wallstreetbets,The next dip will be $7.65 Im basing that off of the progressive lows since January
2021-05-25 18:33:42,wallstreetbets,Make that bet recently? 100 percent of your portfolio?
2021-05-25 12:30:50,wallstreetbets,Good ape
2021-05-25 18:34:33,wallstreetbets,May I ask why? I‚Äôve been slowly buying on dips. Just trying to get enough to do CC while waiting for the news to get better. But 3k shares is a big bet.
2021-05-25 18:35:11,wallstreetbets,Like the stock that much? Why?
2021-05-25 11:00:55,wallstreetbets,Or your calls expire worthless at a loss...
2021-05-25 15:14:54,wallstreetbets,"Not as bad as you, but I got 1k shares @ $19. One day we'll be back."
2021-05-25 18:36:45,wallstreetbets,What strike do you sell at usually? And DTE? Thanks.
2021-05-25 15:09:50,wallstreetbets,Cost basis?
2021-05-25 15:10:41,wallstreetbets,Canon T3i or T5i Best bang for your buck
2021-05-25 16:05:46,wallstreetbets,BB = BlackBerry
2021-05-25 15:04:16,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm diamond handing cus i can afford a -50k loss but not too many ppl can. It‚Äôs only a small part of my portfolio. Even with all the good news it has not moved a beat in last 3 months. I just keep buying the dips in hopes of a buy out or bankruptcy ü§°
2021-05-25 19:42:09,wallstreetbets,It's like being pregnant. Always congratulations but never know how many times you got fucked
2021-05-25 19:18:57,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-05-25 18:43:58,wallstreetbets,"It makes no sense, it's the worst stock I've bought haha"
2021-05-25 14:56:31,wallstreetbets,"It's okay, BB. You go when you feel like it."
2021-05-25 17:50:39,wallstreetbets,FACTS. If you let options expire in the red it's just a tax deduction
2021-05-25 19:26:56,wallstreetbets,"April 29th 9.09 x 1200, it's my only stock"
2021-05-25 19:52:36,wallstreetbets,"I just feel they're slept on as well as most of the same sentiment around reddit.

They're completely reformed from their phone brand, and I use Cylance antivirus personally from BB.

But most of all, I feel they're going to dominate the one area I haven't seen anyone touch them on. And that's a secure communication to handle end to end communication. In a future where cars drive themselves, security for those cars will be serious business.

Also, I like to gamble"

2021-05-25 14:16:07,wallstreetbets,thats the most retarded 2nd grade way of thinking. he's not making 6k every 5 minutes.
2021-05-25 19:05:29,wallstreetbets,"Damn that‚Äôs rough. Hopefully it‚Äôs for a good career though! And you should consider at least a few small student loans, they‚Äôll help your credit."

2021-05-25 17:20:30,wallstreetbets,"If we're comparing this to a regular person, the same must remain true for the denominator:  you're risking an annual person's salary on that bet (A TSLA swing).  Walking away with a fraction of that salary as a prize is actually not great. 

OP is retarded, but it worked, so that's great. but statistics would suggest if he can't afford NOT lose that 50K bet he's gonna emotionally lose it in 8/10 of his next gambles. 

Playing red on roulette is actually a safer bet than TSLA weeklies, and would pay more than the $6k. 

Not knocking OP; I'd let him buy me a beer for his W. But all of my TSLA calls are LEAPS because if I want to gamble I give my dad a few beers and tell him I'm gay."

2021-05-25 13:15:28,wallstreetbets,185 isn't a great price to excercise being 5 dollars above market. You may as well wait for the 175 dip to bounce. You basically wasted a premium fee. Sell the contract. 6k is hardly a yolo in this sub. I think the rules were 10k and now doubled to 20k.

and pretending that FDs have a 100% hit rate is dumb af.

He took a 5% chance with a 3x payout. He'll be broke by next month. Been there done that. Use STD to make your trades.

My account isn't 100% GME, but my actual GME spreads are up 322% and 337%, plus they don't expire until 6/4 so I have some wiggle room AND can sell off the remaining extrinsic value to speculators.

My 6/18 spreads are up 208%. If I was interested in wasting money on FDs like this guy was, they'd be 600% or more. There's almost never a reason to do short term single legs unless you're purely trying to make a stupid risky vega play or there isn't enough OI/volume to support getting into a spread"
2021-05-25 13:27:29,wallstreetbets,Assuming that we follow the t+ 21 pattern and see nice upward pressure during after hours I'll most likely sell the $200 contracts tomorrow morning or afternoon since the day following t+21 is usually its highest following the cycle. Depending on the price action I may look to exercise the $185 contract.

2021-05-25 16:58:51,wallstreetbets,I understand the t+21 argument but where is the 21 being derived from? GME has spiked the last week of every month but what day that falls on seems to vary. I assume I'm missing something simple here.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Difference Between A Trading Structure And A Trading System When you are born, you are born into structure, literal and metaphorical. Your teachers, parents, boss; all teach you STRUCTURE. The difference between this norm you are used to and the MARKET is the market has NO structure.

you can legally yolo all your money into a horrible option, and you can become a homeless person or billionaire at any given time. What is the difference between these 2 groups, well to me it is structure.

&#x200B;

You may be saying, 'well I have my trading system so I am good right?', no - you are not. You are missing 50% of the equation. Hear me out:

&#x200B;

A trading STRUCTURE is what should house, or literally be the roof and foundation for your SYSTEM. Imagine a trading system being a furnace, it cannot keep you warm and safe without a roof, walls, and foundation. So, what is my structure and system; here ya go:

&#x200B;

Trading Structure (Literal Home):

**Foundation**: Risk Management - All decisions, all other elements, and all trades are GROUNDED in risk management. I get it, 'Apes Stick Together' or whatever, but I use stop losses - I enter every trade with a set loss and take profit. I do not get emotional, I have a plan, and each trade is a 3 reward to 1 risk setup at least for a small move.

**Walls**: I base my 4 balls of success on:

1. 3 Analysis: 
   1. **Fundamental Analysis** based on news, P/E Ratio, Floats, EPS, etc. 
   2. **Technical Analysis** based on charts, graphs, value. If you are one of those 'AsTrOlOgY fOr IdIoTs' people, fine but understand you are handicapping yourself due to your own ego.
   3. **Mental Analysis** based on confidence, execution, and planning.
2. **Macro Economic** moves like inflation rates, money supply, consumer confidence; and Indexes like S&P, Nasdaq, DOW30, Russell2000, etc. I also study the 11 sectors intently too.
3. **Trading Plan** that includes a stop loss, a loading or buying zone, a price target, and an exit strategy and entry strategy already planned.
4. **Goal Setting** for my 1 month, 6 month, 1 year, 5 year, etc.... and what each trade does to help these goals.

From there my '**ROOF**' or my added protection is consistency. I stick to these rules. Before every trade, I double check with my 'roof' that I am being consistent. When I am in a trade, I check to make sure I am being consistent. When I exit - guess what, I check I am being consistent.

There will be some nights we would all enjoy and actually benefit from not having a roof. Those 73 degree, sunny days come - and we may enjoy sleeping in a tent or even sleeping with the sound of toad ribbits and cricket songs, and we give that up. We do because there are also hurricane level monsoons and without a roof, your whole room will be ruined (blowing up your account).

&#x200B;

From there, you place your SYSTEM in this STRUCTURE. Scalping, great. Day trader, beautiful. Swing, long term, only ETF, dividends!? That is fine. Anytime frame, any short term goal, and account size; all of the things that make your TRADING EDGE or SYSTEM goes into the STRUCUTRE.

&#x200B;

Please have both. Please have rules. Please understand you are in a chaotic neutral system, with 0 rules, 0 guidance, 0 anything. You either create your own structure, or have none. You fail to plan, than you're planning to fail. Good luck."
2021-05-25 10:33:04,wallstreetbets,This is a casino loser.
2021-05-25 10:06:49,wallstreetbets,"Yep, this is great trading advice, and one that 99% of people here will not take. 

You have understand that a great amount of the WSB population is legit retarded, and they just see the stock market where you either YOLO your house and become a millionaire or lose it all and become a hooker at Wendys.

That‚Äôs why I go here every day: around 20% to short hype plays (made a shitton this way), about 1% to find legit early long plays (extremely hard), 29% for the memes, and 50% for the shadenfreude (or however it‚Äôs spelled) of seeing people lose a ton of money in a stupid way.

But yeah, I do the same as you: 1-2% risk every time, fundamental analysis (mainly discounted cash flow to find true value), technical analysis (keep it simple, levels of structure, EMA50, MACD, and not much more) and then I either short or long according to my 1 or 2% risk. If the trade goes south, I take my 1-2% loss. If it goes right, I take my 2-3% gain (I usually go for 1.5 R/R). 

That‚Äôs the efficient and boring way of doing it, but as I said, WSBers will definitely not do this ü§£"
2021-05-25 14:59:17,wallstreetbets,I wish I had 4 balls.

2021-05-25 13:50:14,wallstreetbets,"I am here for the picks and all I get is boomer metrics.   
Fundamental analysis is the religion of the stock market  
Technical analysis is the astrology  
Mental Analysis is the delusion  
Macroeconomics is the propaganda  
Trading plan is the bread  
Goals are the cope"

Maybe the opposite will happen and it'll hold and possibly rise(this is space and Stuff idk) it's alot lower that current to keep cost basis down. Would It be smart to do this??? I'm not going to bc I'm in GME rn but I'm trying to learn options"
2021-05-25 13:24:32,wallstreetbets,"It's because people like you are ridiculous.

Because 1% returns on $100 is barely enough for a stick of gum.

2021-05-25 10:10:46,wallstreetbets,Yep! It‚Äôs a truly hilarious sub tho. I always read it while having breakfast every day ü§£
2021-05-25 16:03:31,wallstreetbets,"I definitely don‚Äôt recommend options since they are more or less gambling. I have shorted SPCE with a wide stop loss (high volatility) to rebuy at around 20. I‚Äôve also bought a single lottery ticket Put for 3 bucks at a 19 strike price, expiring this Friday. Probably wont get there, but sometimes you can profit even if it isn‚Äôt ITM, just due to the possibility. 

But again, options is mostly burning your money, for WSB plays I think shorting is the best, you do have to have an appetite for wide swings and wide stop losses, cause these things move wildy sometimes. Also I wouldn‚Äôt short GME, not because I think it isn‚Äôt a shit stock (it is), but because the price swings are so ridiculous it tends to blow up any sensible stop loss. MVIS, EBON, etc, those I have repeatedly shorted."
2021-05-25 13:26:34,wallstreetbets,"Well... that‚Äôs the whole point lol. If you can‚Äôt even understand that trading is about consistent, small profits, then I have bad news for you: your brain is missing. Tough luck, try next time. Cheers."
2021-05-25 19:35:22,wallstreetbets,Puts are a much better way to bet on downside that shorting shares. But feel free to fuck around with infinite potential loss
2021-05-25 13:27:33,wallstreetbets,"That attitude is pathetic. 

2k-40k here, now I'm pulling 400 a week after tax in ""risk free"" income.

It took 3 months my way, it would take 5-10 years following your plan depending on your flipping timeframe. At a week 5 years, at a month, like 20 years.

Don't push your own inferiority and risk tolerance onto everyone else while acting superior. Just because you are willing to settle for less, doesn't mean you've somehow found the maximum consistent returns. You've only found the maximum returns for your skill and knowledge level. In turn, I'm sure they're are hedge funds that are destroying my returns as well (LTCM for example).

You and your ilk are incredibly irritating with your uniformed gatekeeping."
2021-05-25 13:34:29,wallstreetbets,"You seem EXTREMELY insecure dude. Like, you give me some really ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt talk to people‚Äù vibes.

What‚Äôs your risk? Positions? Strategy? It‚Äôs 100% impossible to go 2k-40k with a YOLO strategy unless with some dumb luck (and that doesn‚Äôt matter cause you will 100% lose it in a few months).

Risking 2% each trade with a high winrate gives you an insane ROI, much much more that you could ever make. So try again dude ü§£ jesus, the retardedness is real"

With this test launch being a success they will likely do their next launch in June and by then have the FAA certification. Next is Sir. Richard Branson‚Äôs flight hopefully in July (people are saying/hoping they will do it July 18, since that‚Äôs his bday and it‚Äôs two days before Blue Origin‚Äôs launch). Once these steps are done we are on our way to commercial operation. Also don‚Äôt forget this latest flight was revenue generating. And finally, Blue has bids of over 2M for their suborbital flight and SPCE is (or was) at 250k.  

So in short, tons of catalysts coming up so MOON here we come."

What they have done is quite simply amazing. It's something we as humans should be celebrating not what the hedge funds or the ""big boys"" are doing. Trying to discourse, discourage and just make virgin galactic look bad. I strongly believe space is the future, the final frontier, everything that could be done for our species to become interplanetary should be encouraged. So,

2021-05-25 09:44:44,wallstreetbets,"I won‚Äôt argue that we‚Äôre not experiencing some level of inflation, but I think the question is whether that inflation is transitory or the start of a longer term trend. Homes and commodities aside, core inflation is going up, but if you look at the report, the areas where we see the highest increases are plane tickets, rental cars, etc aka recovery businesses. As we consider a long term trend, the structural drivers of deflation (digital deflation, aging demographics/low birth rate) not only in the us, but globally remain intact. So, I think the squeezes will continue for the next 3-24 months in areas like semis, recovery products/services, commodities will continue, but don‚Äôt expect the long term picture to change."

2021-05-25 13:21:23,wallstreetbets,"The Fed is playing politics.  If they're saying there isn't any long-lasting price pressure, that likely means pricing pressure is far worse than it appears.  They're going to lie to the public, to keep people ignorant to what's coming."

2021-05-25 11:18:25,wallstreetbets,We are likely at much bigger risk of a liquidity trap and deflation than inflation. Sounds counter-intuitive when so much money has been printed.
2021-05-25 13:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes. 

Price pressure comes from input shortages, artificial monopolies, and too much money chasing too few goods (see real estate inventory issues).

In a post-Covid economy, material shortages will work themselves out, companies are hiring at higher starting wages with insignificant changes to prices, and developers can‚Äôt find enough employees for the next boom in developments (inventory). 

The Fed may also lower rates again as needed."

2021-05-25 10:01:48,wallstreetbets,Buying shares today. Will be looking at other options for end of July.
2021-05-25 19:26:55,wallstreetbets,Did the option price explode after the announcement?
2021-05-25 09:57:58,wallstreetbets,Lol 16 grand is more than what you need for a kitchen remodel.

2021-05-25 10:30:19,wallstreetbets,Crazy! Cost me about 11 grand with 20 feet of quartz counters. Was 7 years ago though.
2021-05-25 12:10:54,wallstreetbets,Tell me it can‚Äôt go tits up
2021-05-25 10:52:01,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah i did one about 10 years ago, and it was right at 15k so that's what i was looking for this time. Had two different contractors come look, and they both was in 30k price range.."
2021-05-25 12:32:12,wallstreetbets,To many positives the company can continue moving up with. For starters the FAA license that they're waiting on. Since they sent all the data from Saturdays flight to them it's only a matter of time. They will schedule another test in June with 4 passengers to test the cabin. In July they will be sending sir Richard Branson himself into space. Most likely the weekend of his birthday which is the 18th. So tits up is extremely unlikely...

2021-05-25 11:52:40,wallstreetbets,With the price of lumber going up so high guessing that's had some effects on price. The shitty part is the kitchen I'm looking to redo is very small i thought.
2021-05-25 19:06:14,wallstreetbets,I think by end of June you will see another test flight actually... July I'm thinking we're going to see Richard Branson fly to space

2021-05-25 10:33:37,wallstreetbets,Just did 10 minutes of research and determined this was a buy. Lots of things in motion with an average price target of $60.  Seems like a no brainer. I'll still wait for a dip because I'm cheap.
2021-05-25 11:02:03,wallstreetbets,Nio is the chosen juan and Jimbo is just another Mr. Smith
2021-05-25 08:51:10,wallstreetbets,When NIO hits $60 Cramer will use this post to fuel his next cocaine bender.

2021-05-25 10:44:14,wallstreetbets,"Why would anyone who knows how to breathe through their nose invest in this company? I mean, China is NEVER going to be the world's largest economy or EV market. The CCP doesn't appear to be playing favorites AT ALL because JAC motors isn't wholly owned by the CCP. Furthermore, JAC Motors and NIO DON'T have a JV-company that runs that the manufacturing operation that's basically 50/50 ownership. Finally, it's highly likely that Tesla, who is already established in China, is just going to corner that market without any interference from the CCP who firmly believes in less government regulation and free market principles.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Cramer is right. NIO is going to $0/share for all of the reasons above which depict an alternate reality"
2021-05-25 11:44:15,wallstreetbets,Cramer is part of the PSYOPs
2021-05-25 10:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Look into the owenership structure, you're being shafted if you buy this company as you don't acutally own what you think you own."

2021-05-25 08:44:13,wallstreetbets,Cramer spews shit like this all the time out of his upside down mouth. He gives advice to retail investors with zero DD done on the companies. After NIO goes to the moon I might start my own anti-cramer portfolio. I‚Äôve made a small fortune buying the stocks he tells his viewers to sell!
2021-05-25 11:52:44,wallstreetbets,One night i literally watched him shit on T only to praise it literally 12 hours later

2021-05-25 10:56:38,wallstreetbets,China's companies are blatantly stealing Tesla technology. Xpeng got the source code for the self-driving directly from a Tesla engineer. China doesn't have to hold titles for the largest economy or most EV cars produced. They will steal all the tech then license it out to other companies based in Europe or they will make all the parts and tech for other EV companies super cheap. The real goal of China is to control all the software that is in the EV cars. Then they can flip a switch one day that they control all the software on all the cars which in turn gives them all the power. The same argument is why they were rejected for 5G tech. Chinese companies are required to install hardware and software backdoors for the government.
2021-05-25 14:30:22,wallstreetbets,"This should be another variant of what one WSB member posted some time ago. It went something like....

Assume that you‚Äôre likely to make bad choices more than good ones. Take 30% of your money and invest it where you were itching to. Then take 70% and bet AGAINST it.

Sounds like good advice to me. Put 70% against what Cramer says and they‚Äôll probably be writing news articles about you next year."

2021-05-25 09:24:35,wallstreetbets,The lead clip should be Cramer telling everyone not to worry about Bear Stearns.
2021-05-25 09:44:17,wallstreetbets,I believe he told everyone to sell abbv back in august-ish before their dividend when they were at or below $80. I also believe he bought that stock on his non-profit‚Äôs portfolio right after. It jumped something like 30% in a couple weeks which is unheard of for a company that size.
2021-05-25 17:03:02,wallstreetbets,Or it will take long to make cause he‚Äôs been predicting for a looonnngg time.  Lol

2021-05-25 19:28:37,wallstreetbets,Someone actually went back and did the math. Investing when he said to was actually pretty profitable. I think his sell was less profitable. I don't remember I am high AF and smooth brain

>  
>Although the company has talked from time to time about building a factory, NIO doesn't currently own one. Its vehicles are manufactured in a factory belonging to Chinese state-owned automaker **Jianghuai Automobile Group** in the industrial city of Hefei, where NIO is headquartered.  
>  
>Under the new deal, the JAC factory will continue to build NIOs for another three years, through May of 2024. JAC also agreed to increase the manufacturing capacity of the factory to 240,000 NIO vehicles per year (or 20,000 per month). That will roughly double the production capacity available to NIO.  
>  
>NIO said in April that it had completed upgrades that will allow it to manufacture [up to 10,000 vehicles per month](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/08/why-nio-stock-is-higher-today/), though ongoing shortages of battery cells and semiconductors have so far [limited it to a lower output](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/04/30/after-a-good-first-quarter-nio-joins-the-ranks-of/).  
>  
>As with many deals involving Chinese automakers, the details of this arrangement are a bit complicated. While JAC owns the factory, it was designed and built specifically for NIO, and it's operated by a third company called Jianglai Advanced Manufacturing. Jianglai is a joint venture between NIO and JAC in which NIO holds a 49% stake.

2021-05-25 06:42:25,wallstreetbets,"Futures are pointing to a higher open again this morning, with tech leading the way again. Nasdaq up 0.5%. S&P 500 up 0.3%. Dow Industrials 0.2% higher. That‚Äôs as of 0630.

This follows a day of gains on Monday as the Nasdaq gained 1.4% and S&P 1%. 

Some talk this is due to ‚Äòinflation anxiety relief‚Äô after Fed speakers yesterday reiterated (again) they weren‚Äôt concerned about inflation. But not really seeing that. It may be much simpler. Listen to the podcast for my reasons why.

Today we have housing data and consumer confidence figures on deck. The Case-Schiller home price index is out first at 0900, with economists expected a 12% YoY increase, which would be the fourth straight month of double digit gains. (No inflation?)

New home sales for May are due at 1000, with the consensus estimate calling for 970k, a drop from last month‚Äôs 1,021k which was the highest we‚Äôve seen in years. If the actual number beats that you should see inflation concerns return to the fore.

Also at 1000: Consumer confidence for May is expected to come in at 119.2, a slight dip from April‚Äôs 121.7. We‚Äôve been shattering post-pandemic highs there for a couple of months so not sure why things would dip. Maybe inflation?"

Last week when it shot up  a little, I posted I bought 11 shares as a show of support for my brothers and sisters and didn‚Äôt care if it moonshot or crashed to $40 because the stonk and community has given much to me. I did put a limit order for 4 more shares rn at $201 in case it gets pushed down. 
This entire time you have been ostracized, demeaned, and shit on and it hurt me when others did that to you. And you remained steadfast and strong. Only the best and good luck to you all!

I bought GME 6/4 185p today, taking into consideration max pain theory for this week (170). Usually GME closed near max pain price on friday, so I have nice potential of return on this option if I sell at that time around this price (around 80%). In the same time I have submitted a stop buy order at 205 in case of a bullish breakout (with potential upside to 250+)  
 I believe in the stock, however I don't think that we are going anywhere before 9th of June which is annual meeting,share recount yada yada, and I want to accumulate more in lower price area."

# Does SelfWealth impose any restrictions on stocks such as GameStop (GME)?

* 25 days ago
* Updated

&#x200B;

In short, no.

SelfWealth members have been allowed to buy and sell GME as  well as others like AMC, throughout the entirety of 2021. This is in  stark comparison to other platforms that entirely halted the trading of  certain stocks.

"" there is one limitation in place though, which is a unit price limitation  on orders. **Currently, this sits at $3,000 per share.** At the writing of  this article, GME is priced at $168. Therefore, the limit is far from  any existing selling point. ""

my god..

and also they retain the voting rights?! i want out but i dont know who else allows buying of gme and amc... i had a stake account but they stopped letting people buy shares back in January and that's when i got into selfwealth and have been ever since but finding this out today is quiet frightening..

Please read the full statement from PhillipCapital (the partner that  enables US trading via SelfWealth) in regards to GME queries.

***The recent price action and  volatility due to a short squeeze in the stock of GameStop Corp (GME ‚Äì  NYSE) has resulted in some investors expecting a continuing rise in  price to levels that are unrealistic.¬† These high-priced sell limit  orders can result in stressing contra party risk limits that monitor  order values and could result in executing venues to start rejecting*** ***all*** ***orders if these limits are not closely monitored and efficiently managed. A Limit  Order price restriction on GME has therefore been implemented (current  Limit Order price restriction 3000) to curb orders being placed  excessively far from the current stock trading price to maintain the  health of the system. The price limit is not designed to stop trades  being executed in GME and our counterparty has thus far remained open  for trade throughout recent volatility allowing buy and sell orders to  be executed. This is in contrast to other providers which halted trade  completely. The counterparty is well aware of the heightened volatility  in GME and other similar stocks which have the potential to go parabolic  and therefore monitor the Limit Order price restriction intraday. In  the event that GME began to rise rapidly the Limit Order price  restriction would be raised in real-time to ensure that any order, that  may be executable at some point, be allowed onto the counterparty books.  The counterparty reserves the right to update its policy at any time to  maintain the health of the system.""***"

In your domestic account go to settings‚Ä¶

Under status centre on the right there should be a W-8 form request!!

If not‚Ä¶ 

On the same page in settings under the heading ‚ÄúService Request‚Äù click on ‚ÄúCreate a Request‚Äù

That‚Äôs should bring you to a search menu‚Ä¶

Type ‚ÄúW-8‚Äù and a drop down should appear with ‚ÄúW-8 Form‚Äù (chose this request if you wish to update your W8BEN for tax status on your international trading account) 

Then that should give you another drop down asking ‚ÄúWhich account account does this apply to?‚Äù  

Select the relevant a count (ensure that the account selected is your international account)

This should take you to the next step 1 of 3‚Ä¶ press continue

Then you should come to the next page which will take you to a security code request. Click get security code which will then take yoo to another page (You should receive a txt with code). Enter code

This takes you to step 2 of 3‚Ä¶. Click continue

This will take you to the next page which will state your request has been submitted and then ask you to fill out your W-8 tax form. Click complete W-8 tax form‚Ä¶

Proceed to answer all the relevant questions regarding your own specific tax information and personal info it needs and once this is complete it should be automatically sent through for approval.

I hope this is helpful and makes the process simple for any Aussies out there‚Ä¶ 

Please DM me if you have any other questions regarding the actual form and I will try talk you through it if you need but it should be pretty simple."

2021-05-25 06:32:42,wallstreetbets,"The ASX in general doesn't allow you put buy/sell orders way out of the current range of the current share price. Stopping people from fucking with market depth with bullshit orders that have no chance of executing is generally a good thing IMO.
The US markets don't seem to have a general ban on this activity though, so in this case it may be more that Phillip Securities who is SelfWealth's custodian of US securities probably wants to loan our shares out but if you are just trolling the market with an order that's extremely unlikely to execute (also given they don't allow US orders to go for more than a day and there's limits to how much a share price can rise in a day because of trading halt circuit breakers) then they can't loan. That's more of a them problem though.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Late Late Stage Capitalism Show with RUatrollorRUserious Feel free to rag on me.  I am not an economist.  I just like trying to sound like I'm smart.  That's S-mart, baby.  


Let's start out with the increase in the Overnight Reverse Repo market.  


**First, lets understand the repo market.**  


But, I'm going to define a term after having spent an hour reading and writing just a few paragraphs.¬† There is the ""Fed"", and there is the ""Fed+"".¬† The Fed is the Federal Reserve, the ""Fed+"" is what I'm referring to as the Federal reserve AND all the qualified banks that can enter into overnight purchase agreements.  


A repurchase agreement (repo) is one in which government securities (T-bills, bonds, bills and notes) are sold to another and are agreed to be repurchased by the seller later at a specified price.¬† Same thing with a reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo), just that the buyer/sellers are reversed.¬† In a repo, the Fed+ is buying securities from a seller in exchange for cash.¬† In a reverse repo, the Fed+ is selling securities for cash.¬†   


The effect is that in a repo agreement, cash is being injected into the market.¬† While in a reverse repo agreement, cash is being drained from the market.  


*(Does this matter since it's all overnight?¬† Good question.¬† I don't know yet.¬† Another question is does it matter whether it's the Fed or the Fed+ that enter into these agreements.¬† Another good question.¬† I don't know that either.)*  


How's it work?¬† The Fed sets the maximum rate it's willing to purchase/sell securities at, and since it's at auction, other qualified firms (the ""+"" in the Fed+) can bid to take the securities at different, possibly lower/higher rates, depending on whether they need additional reserves (securities), or cash based on their required holdings.  


In this case, the Fed is the buyer of last resort.¬† They set the max rate they'll buy at, and force the rest of the market to operate below whatever rate they've set.¬† This is one of the ways the Fed is able to set the interest rates at the short end of the yield curve.¬† *(Very interested how they set the rate for the 10-30 year, but that's going to wait til a later show).*  


**Why does this matter?**¬†   


On April 30, the Fed reduced the eligibility requirements to participate in the repo market as the Fed+ was responsible for $173B in reverse repo agreements.¬† And despite reducing the eligibility requirements, that amount has gone to $394B as of today.  
Does it matter?¬† I don't know, but here's a scary graph.¬† So, we should probably figure it out.

 

https://preview.redd.it/luy9t2zqn7171.png?width=620&format=png&auto=webp&s=8b35602faed727dc1cb4c6762eeb0c460a324993

While graphs like the one above can be scary, just because they are oddities, we need to determine if they actually have an effect on the markets.¬† Lots of odd things don't seem to have an effect on anything, even if we think it would have an effect on the markets.  


Some of the effects (I really think I've overused effect at this point) of this is that at auction, the Fed may start to raise the overnight funds rate.¬† Not significantly.¬† After all, the current rate is 0.06% rate, and Bloomberg is suggesting a 5 basis point increase.¬† So, from .06% to .11% on the overnight funds rate, and an increase from .1% to .15% on the interest on excess reserve rate.¬† Doesn't seem like much.¬† But, does it affect long term yields?  


**Does it affect Long Term Yields?**  


 I don't know.¬† I went down another rabbit hole.¬† 1) Are bond prices actually inverse to stock prices and 2) Which predicts which?¬† The giant bond market reacting before the stock market, or the more nimble stock market that can predict bond prices?  I wish I had Goldman's supercomputer right now.¬† Pretty sure they've got all of the iterations of it programmed.¬† Fuckers.  
Everything I see says that bond yields drop before the stock market drops, and recover quicker than the stock market does (if you want to buy the dip in the bond market, options baby).¬† It all comes down to the rate of change with the bond market.¬† After all, it's been dropping for more than 20 years.¬† And yes, the opposite seems to be true, but to a lesser extent.¬† When bond yields rise, there seems to be a delayed response in the stock market causing a drop, about 2 weeks.

  
So, in the short term, is a .05% (5 basis point) increase in bond yields significant?¬† A doubling, almost, in the short term rate, probably.¬† But, there will also probably be a delayed response in the stock market.¬† 

**Action Items:**  Look for some buried article on Marketwatch saying that the overnight rate in the repo market was increased by 5 basis points and the stock market rose to new highs.¬† Short the S&P there.  


Or you could just go to the source, nevermind, retail traders can't get any accurate, up to date, actionable market data.  You can go to the fed, but it's 3 days late.  [https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr](https://www.newyorkfed.org/markets/reference-rates/effr)

&#x200B;

**This week's things to watch for:**

  
Tomorrow we also get the results from the Richmond manufacturing index and Consumer confidence.¬† 

Last week, the Empire Index was up (barely) though the prices paid were higher (higher inflation).¬† The Philly index was down, and prices paid were at 40 year highs.¬† Tomorrow is Richmond.¬† Where the fuck is Richmond?  Thursday is unemployment claims, and Friday is another print of CPI.¬† But it's on a holiday weekend.¬† So responses should be muted.¬† If bad, look for a bloody Tuesday.¬† If good, fuck it, why not?  All time highs again.

2021-05-25 15:43:42,wallstreetbets,Spy is an etf that's 1 tenth the size of spx which is the index. So spy $418.5 = spx $4185. So if you are to ever buy 10 spy calls you are better off buying 1 spx. Also they are European options not American. Google that and 1256 contracts.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The PLUG Restatement: A Great Chance to Get Out **tl;dr: PLUG has rallied on relief from the completion of its restatement, but accounting red flags remain -- and the economics are as bad as ever.**

Hello degenerates, it's me, the biggest hydrogen bear this side of Ursa Major, back at you to discuss Plug Power's [belated 10-K filing](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000155837021007147/plug-20201231x10k.htm) for the year 2020 and its restated results for 2018 and 2019. For a little background: PLUG is a company with a [long and checkered history](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mmxbiy/plug_power_sell_the_dip/) which [relies on generous shareholders to fund its highly cash-burning business](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/n6qsqm/plug_the_cash_shredder/), had to amend the last two years' financial statements after their auditor found some issues. The 10-K was actually filed a little over a week ago, but they [claimed](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921064023/tm2115706d2_8k.htm) the first quarter results would follow by the 17th. They [missed that deadline](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001093691/000110465921069379/tm2116992d1_8k.htm), which is not something you love to see from a $15B public company.

The stock, however, is nearly 50% off its lows after a [""shroud of uncertainty""](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/plug-power-stock-soars-as-restatement-removes-overhang-of-uncertainty-11620996549) has been removed around the restatement. But what did we really learn from the restatement, and is PLUG still under a shroud?

The nitty-gritty of the restatement involves some boring accounting technicalities about which I will go into more detail below, but the first thing is to note is that PLUG will stress that the restatements ""were noncash and had no impact on our business operations or economics"" -- and you can check this, by confirming that the line on the cash flow statement for ""Increase (decrease) in cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash"" hasn't changed. But while you're looking at the reconciliation in the notes to the financial statements, you can see that the GAAP treatment of the cash flows has changed -- in 2019 and 2018, PLUG used about an extra $2.5M in cash, which it got from banks, essentially. Not a huge deal on the scale of the $155M it used in 2020, but certainly not a great look. 

So let's look at those reconciliations, and here you want to start with the income statement -- the biggest thing here is booking almost $40M of things like fuel costs and costs of providing maintenance over the last two years as R&D expenses to inflate their gross profit above zero in both years -- nevertheless even in the restatement PLUG managed a positive gross profit in 2019. Still, that $40M is nearly 10% of revenue over those two years, hardly a trivial mistake -- and they don't say much about how it happened.

The other big part of the restatement is most visible in the balance sheet reconciliation, and it moves a lot of fixed assets to right-of-use assets related to sale-leaseback transactions PLUG entered into. This doesn't affect much other than accounting, but it's illuminating. A leaseback works like this: Imagine you want to YOLO on some MSTR puts but you're low on cash. You open the Apple Pawnshop app and sell them your iPhone for cash -- but then you buy back the same iPhone on a payment plan. You've still got the right to use the same iPhone, but now you've got cash. The downside is, if your puts don't pay off, Apple is going to shut off your iPhone when you stop paying the bill, but that's a problem for future you. PLUG is in constant need of cash to fund its money-losing business, and when issuing stock isn't an option -- as it wasn't for most of 2018 and 2019, with the price around $2 a share -- they are pawning their metaphorical iPhones.

Just some updates from my last post, by the way: I calculate about negative $200M in 2020 free cash flow for PLUG, financed and then some by a spectacular $1.2B in stock sales, at an average price some 40% below the current market price. (It issued at an even more blistering pace -- albeit at considerably better prices -- in Q1.) Once again Walmart did not buy enough forklifts to vest more of their warrants, despite being ""in the money"" for all of Q42020. I would suggest that forklifts that PLUG literally can't pay Walmart to take are likely not very good products.

Finally, let's talk about whether the shroud of uncertainty is really gone from PLUG. The audit opinion has a lot of scary stuff about how PLUG ""has not maintained effective internal control over financial reporting"" but this is related to the restatement and not news. Nevertheless you don't really want your auditor saying things like that and it might make it harder to sell billions of dollars of equity in the future. (If I bought in the offering at $65 I would be considering a lawsuit -- and many people have gone ahead and filed.) The 10-K has one other big red flag, in ""Unresolved Staff Comments"":

> On December 16, 2020, the Company received a comment letter from the Staff of the SEC‚Äôs Division of Corporation Finance relating to its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2019 and Form 8-K filed with the SEC on November 9, 2020 regarding certain accounting and financial disclosure matters.  The process to resolve these comments with the SEC is continuing.

The SEC has some questions for PLUG about their accounting. Unfortunately the comment letter is not on EDGAR, so I don't know whether these questions are resolved by the change in accounting policies and restatement -- but there are certainly tricks that PLUG can play, for instance in lowballing maintenance cost estimates on uneconomical contracts. And it has incentives to play games; PLUG insiders have been selling stock like crazy for the past year. It might be wise to follow their lead."

As far as I can tell the long-term value of this business is zero; it will never pay a dividend or buy back stock from free cash flow.

What people aren't realizing is that RSUs converted today and all insiders automatically had a portion of their RSUs sold in order to cover the taxes. They was an automated event applied equally across the entire company including the c-suite and there was no option to prevent the sale and pay in cash.

The FUD from this misunderstanding means the stock is down due to other people's poor DD. The asymmetric upside means this is a buy.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Should you bet on PENN? I want to preface this by saying that I‚Äôm primarily a value investor (although many of my clients do own growth stocks) so my area of expertise isn‚Äôt necessarily on growth stocks like PENN. With that being said, I feel confident enough in my analysis of this company that I can determine a price target for them.

The fundamental reason investors purchase growth stocks is because of, well, growth. And while a companies growth in the past can‚Äôt necessarily predict that companies growth in the future, it can be a good indicator for what‚Äôs to come. So, let‚Äôs take a look at PENN‚Äôs growth. 

In 2015 Penn‚Äôs revenue was 3.03 Billion dollars. In 2016, their revenue grew by roughly 120 Million$ to 3.15. 2018 saw an even larger amount of growth, going up to 3.59 Billion dollars in revenue. In 2019, PENN‚Äôs revenue grew to 5.3 Billion (about 65% growth). It should be taken into account that 2019 was a big year for casino/gambling companies in general, but this is impressive nonetheless. A respectable argument could be made (based on revenue) to justify the 12.5 Billion dollars in market cap the company is currently worth, but other quantitative data tells a different story.

This is a company that has generated less than 100 million dollars in net income 4 out of the past 5 years. PENN‚Äôs debt to asset ratio of 80% isn‚Äôt terrible when compared to other gambling stocks, but contextually, generating 4 Billion dollars in profit next year (a very liberal estimate in my opinion) with the 12 Billion dollars this company currently has in debt is mediocre at best.

In my analysis of PENN I found one thing I really liked about the stock. It was one of the five stocks in its sector (out of roughly 40 companies we evaluated) with a positive ROE, which suggests that the company uses capital more efficiently than its competitors, which is very important for companies with low revenue. With that being said, I still think the stock is overvalued.

PENN‚Äôs partnership with Dave Portnoy and subsequent purchase of a large stake of Barstool Sports is most likely the root cause of such an unjustified market cap of 12.5 Billion, but the price point is just that; unjustified.

In my estimation, PENN will generate roughly 7-8.5 Billion YoY in revenue by 2025 and should be making about 350-450 Million in profit by then. I believe a market cap of around 8 Billion (a P/E ratio around 20 for a company that will still be growing) is fair for PENN. Fair value for these guys is around 65$, and my price target to buy is around 55$.

Thanks for reading this. If you liked my analysis and are curious about a company‚Äôs value, feel free to let me know."

2021-05-25 19:21:23,wallstreetbets,I think it's a bit high. I am holding long though and I am guessing we might have another correction soon. Just guessing.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$COMP is well priced. (Imo) Compass is trading at a market cap that is on the high end of their projected revenue this year. This indicates some good room to move upward. The reason the are trading around their own projected revenue is because they compensate their agents really well compared to their competitors and has lead to negative earnings. I am not very worried about this because that has been their growth strategy, and it has worked very well. The pace they are setting is impressive. Since the compensation has been their strategy, they have expressed plans to phase those costs down. The only area I am not confident about in compass is their consumer facing real estate app. I don‚Äôt think it holds up with Zillow. I know their software is great for their agents on the backend, but not into it as a consumer. Overall I like it as a long-term play. Their revenue growth over the next few years should drive it up nicely."
2021-05-25 02:42:33,wallstreetbets,"Looked at all of these. Z and OPEN are much better names. If you want to bet on RE tech, those 2 and maybe RFIN are the only plays worth making"
2021-05-25 15:12:11,wallstreetbets,"seems legit to me. Everyone likes talking about Zillow and Redfin which are great but they are not really tailored to the high end buyer. I feel like CompASS is really white collar and as RE tech keeps breaking upward, this seems like a name to watch cause the high end real estate tech market has not caught up yet and I think it will."

You can see I have 3 main positions, with the 5/28 24c bought during a dip as momentum play, and the other far OTM as long shots from the spare change I allocated. I'm treating those like lottery scratchers, if the price rockets it's a nice boost beyond what my main position is.

I‚Äôve been doing this for years, I know it sounds pretty crazy and most people think 10% a year is great but honestly butterfly spreads + knowing your bollinger bands, true range , all your indicators will make it happen for you. Not every trade will hit but if I average across my weekly, let‚Äôs say even this last month, each of the trades I did were well over 80% returns - I only will do 3 max a week."

2021-05-25 19:11:00,wallstreetbets,"Can you give an example of a butterfly spread you'd consider on tsla, given current market conditions?"
2021-05-24 20:44:24,wallstreetbets,"No spreads get bigger proffit than naked options if SP goes above/below both legs. 

Your 40% or 4k is not guaranteed.

Risk of losing the whole entry cost (capital) is still there if SP move against you and stays below both strikes. 

You are assuming that your short leg will be OTM and long leg will be ITM but is that guaranteed?"
2021-05-25 13:05:57,wallstreetbets,"Your profit is limited on spreads but your loss is also limited, compared to the option OP did if it went sour he‚Äôs out of all the money, spread covers you and still sets you up for nice profit, it‚Äôs the key to sustainable trading, out of all spreads I do my current average is around 60% per spread and these are just weekly ones"
2021-05-24 20:26:33,wallstreetbets,"Dude, OP, you‚Äôre getting absolutely roasted by downvotes. At what point do you just stop responding?"
2021-05-25 16:11:30,wallstreetbets,">**Your profit is limited on spreads but your loss is also limited,**

Your risk is never limited with any types of options, period. If you pay $100 premium for a naked call and it expires worthless you lose full $100

If you buy a call at $150 and sell a call at a higher strike for $50, your net debit is $100. If stock closes below both strikes then you lose full $100.

Now tell me how are you limiting the loss here by spread?

&#x200B;

>**I do my current average is around 60% per spread and these are just weekly ones**

You might get 60% average return weekly for a brief amount of time but it's not sustainable. I made 4000% on a week but I will not claim that I can do that in a consistent way for a long time. A 60% weekly return is basically

**(1.6)\^50 = 16,069,380,442% (considering there are 50 weeks of trading)**

That means if you invest $1 you will have 16 billion dollars by years end if you reinvest everything every week. Possible? NO.

Even if you do not reinvest the profit and use the same capital every week and withdraw all the profit, **that's still 3000% yearly return**. Again not possible.

Please think before making a claim what that claim actually means."

Now I understand what kind of idiot I have been commenting to. Do you understand mathematics? If you put $4K in a spread you can lose the whole $4K if stock price go below strike prices of both your short and long legs. Do you understand this simple point? I literally gave you an example!

# 5/25 Outlook

* 418-416 is new support
* We do have some resistance @ 420-420.76
* Bulls need to gap up
* Bears need to push down to test support ASAP. 
* The 420 call wall is still in play since we closed below
* If we can break 420.76 I believe we will see ATH but lets see!

2021-05-24 22:30:59,wallstreetbets,I think it is much better to anticipate a bit shorter time frame moves (3-4 months) than moves that far....
2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Using The Wheel on BNGO and retiring dividend investing I've decided to do away for the time being with dividend investing and decided to go all in on the Wheel strategy with BNGO. Last week I sold calls for the first time and I decided to go all in. I had about $2,780 invested in QYLD which gave me about $343 a year and $28.6 a month. I decided to retire this investment and use it to buy 500 shares of BNGO at about $5.54. I then sold 5 $6 June 18, covered calls for $245 premium which will cover my monthly hooker expense, for legal reasons that's a joke. Already I earned 70% of what QYLD would have payed me in a year.

 If my calls expire in the money then I'll make about a $300 profit for a total $545 profit in just one month. Then I'll just sell some cash covered puts then rinse and repeat. If the calls expire OTM then it's another monthly covered calls. I truly believe in BNGO which is why I have about 200 other calls on the side for the long term. 

Hopefully I can update in a month on the status and outcome of my current play. All I can say is that it literally can't go tits up."

2021-05-24 20:24:55,wallstreetbets,Ah the classic picking up pennies before a train strategy. Let's see how it fares

2021-05-24 20:17:25,wallstreetbets,LOL the last person that said that to me was about TSLA when it was $375 post-split. I got assigned TSLA shares at $375 and have now collected enough premium to pretty much offset my initial investment.
2021-05-25 03:02:58,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt get it (seriously) why it‚Äôs not a good strategy ?
2021-05-25 19:06:59,wallstreetbets,It's less risky than just buying and holding the stock tbh if the underlying goes to 0 both the boomer investor and wheeler are going to lose their ass. The wheeler is just lowering his cost basis at the cost of limiting his upside.
2021-05-25 02:52:32,wallstreetbets,Not for everyone.
2021-05-25 01:30:54,wallstreetbets,Do you have to write your own calls or do you just get a dividend from them?
2021-05-25 10:17:50,wallstreetbets,"Also.  The Q‚Äôs or Spy....for me is to volatile. 
Collecting most of my dividend and dollar cost averaging the rest of it is a smarter play for me. 
My initial investment has low risk. On an upswing I can always sell additional purchased shares for extra cash and start over from the amount I started with.  It‚Äôs my comfort level. Sharing this much is outside of my comfort level so I hope it helped some.  Those who disagree, I appreciate your opinion as well. Good luck to all."

2021-05-25 09:01:28,wallstreetbets,"1) He is trying to run a wheel on a $5 stock

2) He only has $2780 in capital

3) only 2 things can happen. He either eventually gets stuck with the stock that he will write calls on that will pay him 5 cents a month (stock tanks) or 2 the stock sky rockets it gets called away and he has to buy it back for 3X,4X or 5X his initial investment. If he had more capital in that situation he would write cash covered puts, unfortunately on a $5 stock if it doubles, he will again only make pennies to buy it back for the original $5.54 he paid for it."
2021-05-25 01:32:26,wallstreetbets,They write the calls. You get a monthly dividend.
2021-05-24 21:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Nah, buying TSLA at 375 was a financially sound decision. My cost average is lower than the all the hedge funds that had to buy TSLA after the S&P 500 inclusion."
2021-05-25 03:02:49,wallstreetbets,"> financially sound decision. My cost average is lower than the all the hedge funds that had to buy TSLA after the S&P 500 inclusion.

2021-05-25 15:35:56,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers sell stock they do not own. They borrow it from a broker who holds the equity in client‚Äôs margin accounts.  Each share sold short is supposed to be backed by that collateral.  However,
at times, brokers allow ‚Äúnaked shorts‚Äù.  These are stocks sold short without borrowed shares behind them.  In cases such as this, a bear raid can short more than the outstanding shares of a company. What was his name,‚ÄùEddie Gilbert‚Äù, the guy who was brought back in chains from Rio?  Vigilant WSB redditors and clever hedge fund managers watch for these situations and come in and buy the shares.  Giant short squeeze. ‚ÄúHe who sells what isn‚Äôt his‚Äôn, must pay up or go to prison.‚Äù  Brokerage firms have also gone bust over this.  It can even be done legally with tiny micro-caps.  I did it in the 1960‚Äôs with Red Lake Labs.  Bought the float at $40, the broker naked shorted to sell to me, couldn‚Äôt borrow the stock to cover, and I sold it back to him the next day at $60.  All or none, Fill or Kill.  Legal, but he was unhappy.  There used to be an uptick rule: no short sale until after an uptick sale.  They should revive it, but they won‚Äôt."

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Gates Foundation stock changes - Buy CPNG! The Gates Foundation sold Apple, which I find a bit weird, and they sold Twitter which I agree with. They bought a bunch of stock in a company called Coupang Inc (CPNG) - a South Korean company that focuses on e-commerce - home goods, food, etc. - looks a lot like Walmart in the U.S. 
Selling their Apple stock which has a .22 cent quarterly dividend (which paid the Foundation over $220,000 per quarter) to buy CPNG that has NO dividend at all sends off all kinds of BUY alarms in my book. CPNG closed up $2.49 today - $40.50 a share. I picked up shares early today. Keep your eyes on this one!"

I recommend AMD to my friends when it was $28 a share. I road it up to the mid 80‚Äôs and got out.

I suggested my friends were nuts if they didn‚Äôt buy as much Microsoft as they could when it dipped into the $150‚Äôs a few months back. Right now Microsoft is at $251.56. I double my money on this one.

I suggested LHX when it was bouncing up and down between $160 and $180. I originally bought LHX way back in 2001 when it was in the $30‚Äôs and bought a bunch more during the above $160 to $180 rut ride... Today it‚Äôs sitting at $216.45! 

Target is another that I picked up in the $130‚Äôs...

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CHWY - Earnings coming up - huge upside potential  

Chewy has been getting battered ever since it hit an all time high of $120 on 2/16/21. That's when there was a market wide correction which Chewy is still in and has actually decreased since the initial drop. Their current price has been fluctuating from just over to just under $70. As I write this it has jumped to $72. This gives Chewy a market cap of 7.1 Billion currently. This gives it a P/S ratio of almost exactly 1. As of their previous quarterlies, there annualized growth was 47% yoy and quarterly growth was 51% yoy. Last quarter was also the first quarter they showed a profit. I think this trend will continue and they have been consistently improving their margins. On their previous quarterlies, their annualized margin had increased 190 basis points yoy. If they can knock another 190 basis points from their margin, there would be an additional 133 million on their bottom line before considering new revenue.

In my opinion, the decline in stock price can only be the result of investors anticipating worsening earnings as the economy opens back up. Chewy was a great pandemic stock as it doesn't require going to the store. I don't believe this is going to be the case. Once people switch to automated deliveries, they don't go back; just ask Amazon. The pet sector in particular is a sector where people spend lots of money and don't like changing things up. I think there growth will hold steady or increase as word of mouth of their wonderful services continue to spready. We have been using Chewy for a few years and will never switch back.

Their next earnings are slated for 6/10/21 after market close.

I don't know if this next line is necessary or not but just to be safe....I'm not a professional financial advisor and this is not investment advice."
2021-05-24 20:43:16,wallstreetbets,"Well call me stupid (stupid) but another reason for the selling could have been profit taking after a run from 22 to 120 in about a year.   Only right for it to pause, correct and let it‚Äôs price and growth equalize.    This said it would seem like the company should have a bright future.  The trend of home buying leads to fur babies and folks like the convenience of automatic.   Hopefully we won‚Äôt hear about supply problems or costs they can‚Äôt pass on.  Hopefully the slide stops but it just seems like it will take another quarter to resume take off.   Either way I‚Äôve been in all the way from the start and ain‚Äôt getting out now."

2021-05-25 03:47:04,wallstreetbets,Proven growth stocks become value stocks though.  Keep that in mind when setting your price target.

2021-05-25 08:53:03,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely right, that why the 190 basis point increase in margin was my deciding factor.  They're obviously on top of it.

You can see there is a lot of patience and determination in what FED believes in and want to do. I will say load up calls and shares in tech for june.

But it's an entirely next level of retarded to see you had **2 more entire days** where you could have settled, sold at $285, and still walked away with $75k. 

What did the play end up being though, you might ask? Yup...somehow even more retarded than *that*...roll out and buy another month of time just to eventually end up selling at $160 for a measly $24k.

This means there's basically no point in having a banking relationship for most small merchants, and Square is aggressively coming after midmarket merchants too (restaurants, larger retailers). They'll have access to cheap capital to lend, and have insight into customers' cash flow to make more accurate and timely credit offers than the bank, and get paid directly from receipts.

2021-05-25 01:54:10,wallstreetbets,"A stout like Guinness has a creamier, longer lasting head than a canned   
lager beer. In addition, Guinness is less fizzy than a regular lager   
beer. Guinness is canned with a mixture of carbon dioxide and nitrogen.   
Nitrogen is not absorbed into the beer nearly as well as carbon dioxide,  
 so even though a can of Guinness may be at the same pressure as a can   
of lager, it contains less CO (and is therefore less fizzy) because the   
nitrogen makes up some of the pressure.

Because a beer like Guinness contains less dissolved CO2, if you poured it from a can with no widget, the head not be very thick because most of the CO2 would stay dissolved."

Right now intel is being squeezed up by news about the semiconductor relief/chip bill that is being passed this week. We're seeing a huge rise up from government due to us needing semiconductors that are produced locally rather then from foreign foundries.

This is a huge boon and is free cash to grow a line of business that only empowers the US and allows us to compete with China. INTEL is a computer heavyweight as is IBM, both have large research budgets and have been original in many lines of work in producing new innovations.

This is a blessing upon our country since it will allow us to have a large leap forward in tech, you can expect the next 5 years to get very crazy for everyone involved. VR and other technologies are being pushed infinitely closer due to all the progress we've made these past 5 years. Just image 5 more with compounded growth due to tech wars/competition, stimulus, and the amount of new jobs this will make for the US.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve analyzed the insider activity of all US public companies over the past month, and here are the companies whose employees are most actively buying new shares The point is that senior employees of public companies are required to make their transactions public. It seems to me that this is an important market indicator - if the CEO of a large company sells most of his stock or buys more, this indirectly determines the company's performance and the mood of employees. Of course, insider trading based on non-public information is illegal. However, when the company's employees buy or sell its shares in large quantities, it is completely legal and an important indicator of its affairs.

I‚Äôve been collecting information from Nasdaq and other official sources. Then I aggregated it by months and got two lists as a result - the first is the top 5 companies by insider buying activity and the second is Top 5 by Insider selling activity.

**So, top 5 companies by insider buying activity:**

**1.** [$ATSG](https://contora.ai/ticker/atsg) **(Air Transport Services Group)**

**2.** [$PZZA](https://contora.ai/ticker/pzza) **(Papa John's International Inc.)**

**3.** [$EXPI](https://contora.ai/ticker/expi) **(eXp World Holdings Inc.)**

**4.** [$PFSI](https://contora.ai/ticker/pfsi) **(PennyMac Financial Services Inc.)**

**5.** [$STLD](https://contora.ai/ticker/STLD) **(Steel Dynamics Inc.)**

The only one with acceptable Average Daily Volume is STLD.  I checked its minute chart, and towards Close it was a dive to the bottom from 62.21 to 62.

Big fuckin difference, ya know?"
2021-05-24 22:03:10,wallstreetbets,"I always hesitate when looking at those.

Many companies have their employees buying in, in 3 scenario:

1- It's a cycle thing : Every year the company will buy back a small portion of it's all shares for the purpose of cheaper participation model or stock options. Statistically some will take the deal and the insider ratio increases.

2- It's an employment thing: Some companies insist that new employees should be given a certain amount of shares to make them ""involved in the company"" and employment recently skyrocketed (that's a more long term thing but it's worth mentioning)

3- Company is going bankrupt and is trying to maintain its share price by moving Top-exec/major investor shares to the employees, allowing those execs to pull-out. (That also is not too likely because it implies that the CEO's shares were not declared as insider, but in cases of fraudulent sell-out, it's very much the case)"

Not sure where it's at on the 200 MA as my focus is on the 13,8,5 setup on the minute.  And when you focus on that, take a look at the huge move it made right at Close.  On both Price and Volume!  In fact when I look at that Close of 21.44 and the move it last made here after hours, of 21.70, it looks good.  So if it doesn't come out screaming it might very well take a dip and then take a move north.  Who knows though?  It all depends on who or whom are driving the volume.

2021-05-24 21:37:50,wallstreetbets,"Yea dude. Your math works out usually for reverse splits. 

Problem is you‚Äôre playing with a volatility option. Volatility options calls are more expensive than puts (just check your option chain) because they are there to mitigate tail risk (the risk of market crashing or aliens). The problem is you‚Äôre paying way OTM options where most of the value is coming from volatility or vega.

What happens after the reverse split is that all of a sudden you are not holding as many contracts. When that happens, the volatility of your position goes down (since you‚Äôre profiting 10x less from any market crashes). What happens usually at this point is that UVXY swan dives until it lands at a place right for its volatility. This will suck for you since the value of those options is like 90% made up of vega"
2021-05-25 15:34:24,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is a non-issue.  I just had some VXX calls that reverse split.  The bid/ask seemed a little worse, but I was none worse for it.  Of course, these were on heavily traded options, your results may vary.  You wouldn't have to buy as many options if you buy post-split, so if you're paying fees that is something to consider.  Also, if you're going to use options to leverage anyway, I would probably use VXX because its decay isn't as harsh as UVXY."
2021-05-24 21:07:12,wallstreetbets,"No, I'm not that retarded. I didn't know about the split. But it doesn't matter anyway, the options will split as well. I'm counting on a full wide market crash before 4th of July. I just spread out my calls just in case I'm early"

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TRQ and the Copper/Gold play Well, the commodity market has been on fire. The question is... is that gonna continue? 
While doing some research about potential stock picks, I stumbled upon this Canadian mining company, owned majoritarily by the giant Rio Tinto. 
$TRQ comes from far, once valued at more than $250, now it's just the tenth of that. They went through the cycle of mining, and exhauting ressources. Now (for the last 4 years or so) they began developing a mine in Mongolia called Oyu Tulgoi. According to surveys, this mine has a potential of delivering gold and copper for the next 30-50 years. $TRQ already invested 10 bil in the mine and they already started delivering on the promise . For the last year or so, they kept beating Bottom and top lines constantly.  The stock more than doubled since the beginning of the year, fundamentals are solid. Anyways. 
The stock lost like 20% since may 13th, but since then stabilized. According to my modest Google searches,  the reason are 2. 
1- They beat analyst consensus top and bottom line easily by a huge margin BUT they updated guidance to a little below what they said they would extract (delays in mine expansion and impact of Covid 19). ( Not such a big deal right? ) which takes us to point 2.
2- Negotiations with the Mongolian government over rewriting the contract.  The mongols want more from the mine (they own 34% of it already) . The first contract was signed with a different government,  since then, a number of politicians have been already accused of corruption over that. After revelations of those facts. Both entities agreed to rewrite the contract amicably after the Mongolian June elections.  
Conclusion:
- When you invest in overseas assets in countries where there is some political turmoil, you gotta be ready for some kind of political hurricane at some point.
- It is obvious that Oyu Tulgoi has a lot of potential, the question is, when will $TRQ and the government of Mongolia will find a common ground?
- will copper prices keep going up? I think big YES.
- is $TRQ now a good place to invest? I think yes. 
The government of Mongolia and Rio Tanto have no other choice than to find common ground. RT is already deep in, and the GOM does not have the infrastructure or the technical knowledge to expand the mine. The GOM cannot kick RT out without violating international laws and if the contract would be terminated,  the GOM has to buy the remaining 60ish percent of TRQ (they would be stuck with IPO overvaluation,  stock up, etc) 
I am long on TRQ ."

That being said, the unpredictable nature of earnings season often makes or breaks traders - many find that they‚Äôre one bad trade away from a complete blowout, so you always need to think about each trade critically. No shame in sitting it out altogether.

#The Spreadsheet

To aid us in planning our trades this week, [**I've compiled a spreadsheet consisting of all of the Historical Post Earnings Moves of EVERY stock reporting earnings this week**](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1gMemdx2iJkzSfoUg7o4YIUnnc4ftZfft-ZMAM315Xtw/edit?usp=sharing). Using this spreadsheet, we can determine which options to buy or sell to minimize risk and maximize probability for ANY given ticker. Obviously, past performance isn‚Äôt indicative of future success, but we can still use these numbers to gain a general idea of the expected earnings move of a given stock. Gone are the days of getting randomly blown out due to lack of information! If you‚Äôre struggling to find a given stock, click on the ticker symbol on the index page, it should hyperlink you straight to the table! If the above link isn‚Äôt working for you, refer to the link below!

&nbsp;

Please note that scraping and compiling this data took *hours*. If the sheet has helped you out in any way, please drop an upvote or a comment and peep my socials! It would mean alot to me. Most websites also require you to pay for this data, which I think is a load of shit.

#Interesting Observations and Sample Plays

Below I‚Äôve compiled some interesting observations which can further aid us in making trades this week, alongside some sample plays for those who are new to playing earnings and need some guidance. If I missed anything, feel free to bring it to my attention!

&nbsp;

- **All major Canadian Banks report this week**. Some names in the lineup include BMO, RY, TD, and CM. BMO reports first out of the four, so we can look at their earnings results and corresponding price movement to predict the movements of the following three banks. Similar to the American banks in Week 1, I'm expecting huge beats across the board, alongside some comfortable upwards movement.

&nbsp;

- **Those with OTC / TSE access should look to make a collateral play on the banks.** Again, similar to Week 1, you could've played XLF alongside the American banks and made a fat bag. Those looking to run that play back should look into **$ZEB** - The IV is low as hell, and it only holds Canadian banks. Options on it are dirt cheap, with an option less than 1% OTM going for a grand total of $0.10. Every percent this thing moves will give you a 3-bagger. Unfortunately, the ticker isn't liquid whatsoever, and the bid ask spread isn't too appealing. You're gonna be buying at the ask, and selling at the bid, so even if we get a nice move, we're still gonna get trashed by slippage. ITM options may be the way to play this one - I couldn't find a better ETF alternative, so this one is the best we got. This play is definitely one of the riskier ones.

&nbsp;

- **Piggybacking off the last point, liquidity is suspect this week**. Majority of the companies reporting have godawful options chains. If you think you see an awesome play, make sure you check the volume and open interests in the option chain before committing to it. You'll find that lots of the tickers this week lack any real liquidity on the options chain, so there's gonna be a fucking crater in the bid-ask spread. You're guaranteed to be buying at the ask and selling at the bid, and this huge spread adds additional risk that will balloon your losses and shrink your winners. 

&nbsp;

- **ZScaler options are inefficiently priced.** Historically, ZScaler moves roughly 15% post earnings, but the options chain is only pricing in a 5% move this time round. This gives us gambler a huge edge, since we won't get IV crushed as hard, and we can buy our options for cheap. There are lots of strategies you can run this week, but I'm personally going to opt for a long strangle or long iron condor if I can get good fills.

&nbsp;

Obviously, since I gave data on over 40 companies, there's plenty that I‚Äôve missed. Dive in, have a look around, and have some fun with it! Use the spreadsheet to aid you in picking the safest strikes, and get the best risk-reward possible. Feel free to share your findings too, I‚Äôd love to see what you guys come up with.

2021-05-25 03:29:30,wallstreetbets,Very modestly.
2021-05-24 20:05:58,wallstreetbets,Had 10/15 calls here a while back when it was searching for the bottom. I got out cause I got tired of getting trucked.
2021-05-25 10:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Ended up closing them first thing this morning and made abut $6K in total (not bad for a days work!). Looks like the stock is going back up now, so good I closed when I did (bid on the options is now 0.60 and had 100X that cost me 0.50 so profit now had I kept open would have only have been $1K)."
2021-05-25 00:17:50,wallstreetbets,"The fact is the current pricing was based on optimistic assumptions, just maybe not the most optimistic ones. The call did not really put out some unexpected positives to move the needle (they had good crash test results, but I think that is neutral to mildly positive info that won't move the needle much). It did add a clear negative such as rising costs, less cash at year end, and production targets being cut (if they can find funding it is a different story)

In any case, volume was very low (but price was down, so guessing it falls tomorrow, but I have no way to know) after hours so waiting for tomorrow open to see how this moves."
2021-05-24 21:06:21,wallstreetbets,Lol!  They literally said they need to raise capital for production.
2021-05-24 23:18:50,wallstreetbets,"I get your enthusiasm but you have to realize the larger market is less moved by emotion and by facts.

The company will always try to put a positive spin on things, such as their extensive going on about the crash test info (which is good but no one cares about the details, they just want to hear 5 star and maybe it will be even better than that...) which frankly an EV pickup truck not getting 5 stars would be much more surprising. Much more critically their insufficient capital to achieve their production targets and rising costs, are real concerns that might weigh on the stock heavily. To put it simply, the company is going to go bankrupt if they can't produce sufficient revenues or fundraise soon.

Steve Burns likes talking about Tesla, but I might remind you, Tesla did many rounds of fundraising in the stock market that were very dilutive to get to where they are (including being near bankruptcy in the M3 ramp). This is not a small thing to consider. LMC is a small company trying to get to volume production their first time (ignoring for the moment the issues with whether the in-wheel motor design makes sense or not) and if comparing to Tesla which was forgiven for doing that fundraising, not sure investors in LMC will be as tolerant.

The rest... They being the only game.. Well the Tesla CT has a 6 ft bed so is a large truck, has 250 miles range and costs $39,900 versus the Endurance costing $52,500... Oh, and the CT has a stainless steel body (no rust). Of course you can get the dual-motor CT for $49,900 that has 300 miles of range (50 more than Endurance). The dual-motor CT is hopefully aimed for production late 2021 (much like I will be surprised if the Endurance is sold this year, I would be a drop less surprised if the CT is sold this year).

The van, not happening for a while as LMC will not have the money without fundraising to touch that, until they can sell the Endurance in sufficient quantities. Beta and so on, is nice and all that, but not the same as production. Also while they have aced their crash tests (I am not surprised by that) we don't have anyone driving these things, testing them in any manner or whatnot. Rather we have a mostly useless SF250 result to go with (and mind you they drove 20 mph over 40 miles, when top competitors did that same section between 50-70 mph).

Regarding the down payments, they were very unclear what they meant. So no comment. The M&A is interesting but not sure anyone will buy them without being satisfied that in-wheel motors are a viable approach. This was not addressed at all. In fact they can't address the short-seller report! Does not sound good to me. Jagdeep Singh of QS had no trouble discussing Scorpion Capitals claims by comparison.

As to the Army looking at them... well NASA looked at Blue Origin and then went with SpaceX, which led to all sorts of suits and politicking by Jeff Bezos. The government will look at many options, does not mean that you are going to get anyplace (anyone recall the US Postal Service and Workhorse group... another company Steve Burns funded... if history repeats does not bode well for RIDE).

Bottom line, I did not see much positive in the report. It was not nearly as negative as I thought it could have gone, so will give them that, but the fact is they are looking down the barrel of bankruptcy if they have any trouble getting to production and can't raise funds.

No clue what this all means for my Puts tomorrow. Stock did not fall too bad in afterhours, but then volume was low so could be sellers were holding back. We find out tomorrow. The puts cost me about $0.50 each, and at $8.65 share price their intrinsic value is $0.35, so will see."

2021-05-24 22:13:59,wallstreetbets,"How? They need to raise more capital,Cutting production by half how is this not shitty"
2021-05-25 09:04:15,wallstreetbets,"I knew they were going cut guidance. It seems certain with spacs, rosy projections and all.

I'm buying more way otm calls at open.

The way I see it is heavy call skew, momentum picks up on upside, upside insurance is cheap.

I'm just betting on if the price gets to where the call skew is vol will increase and options gain value.

Maybe 20% shot for 20x gain."
2021-05-25 12:28:56,wallstreetbets,why would there be a squeeze?
2021-05-24 23:41:17,wallstreetbets,"Not cannabis company, just an anus company"
2021-05-25 10:34:09,wallstreetbets,"Can you give me your reason's for this? I'm bearish myself after reading the Hindenburg report but I'm looking for some confirmation bias. 

If they can actually get this thing to market before anyone else then I see them having a chance. The question is, are they close? I can ignore the falsified presales if they can start making some actual revenue."
2021-05-25 11:04:39,wallstreetbets,Congrats! That was really a solid move on your part. It feels so good when you hit one like that.
2021-05-24 21:25:01,wallstreetbets,"They also said without raising capital, they can make about 1000 vehicle by end of the year and they are going to mortgage the factory and the land getting money is no problem. Hindenburg research said productions were in 3 years. The correct answer is ""it is in 3 months. "" False claim false accusations. The bottom line is only electric pick up truck available in the market is Lordstown 2021"
2021-05-24 23:47:12,wallstreetbets,"In earning calls, there are a lot of caveat. But the bottomline is they proved Hindenburg research was wrong as they now 50 beta, not just ones they crasb tested

 Many other start up ev Companies have 5b market cap while Lordstown is only 1.6b when pre productions are in less then 2 months while ford is a year later, or more.

 Now they have about 30 thousand none binding contract which paid down payments.

Lordstown has 4 wheel drive 4 motors allwheelndrive 300-350mile range battery at 52k while similar truck with tsla will be 69000 with 3 motors and ford will be 80k with similar spec. 

I bought a lot short and long options at 7.50, but mostly after 06/25. We will see what happens. Sentiment will change in short term, but I have never been this bullish"
2021-05-24 22:32:21,wallstreetbets,"Because they're a startup. I think everyone, but maybe you, knew that some sort of future capital raise was highly probable. But it did come earlier than I expected. I listened to the entire earnings call and I'm still comfortable being long."
2021-05-25 10:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Never had much success buying otm. But if you're right, that'd be a great payout."
2021-05-25 12:37:32,wallstreetbets,Why not?
2021-05-24 21:46:58,wallstreetbets,"Literally the only thing LMC has going for it is hitting the market first. Ford, GM, Toyota is going to eat LMC's lunch. $RIDE better used to being #4 near last in the market."
2021-05-25 00:43:53,wallstreetbets,"""Lordstown has 4 wheel drive 4 motors allwheelndrive 300-350mile range battery at 52k while similar truck with tsla will be 69000 with 3 motors and ford will be 80k with similar spec.""

This is just wrong. Tesla will make a $40K version of the CT with 250 miles of range but one motor. The dual motor will cost $50K and has 300 miles of range (Endurance has 250). The tri-motor CT which costs $70K has a 500 miles of range.  You make an assumption that having 4 in-wheel motors is important, when in fact, based on something like the SF250, it was no benefit at all. A dual motor truck is all wheel drive, just not independent all wheel drive. If anything in a tough situation, the Endurance can only put out max 150 hp to a single wheel whereas the Tesla can transfer most of the 283 hp (assuming Model 3 motors) to a single wheel by simply applying the brake to the opposing wheel (they do this with the Model S). This assumption that 4 in wheel motors gives you better ability off road to move is simply an assumption that very likely does not hold up, hence this argument that 4 in-wheel motors is better than dual-motors is simply flawed."
2021-05-25 12:43:25,wallstreetbets,"well, because you would need a reason for there to be a squeeze. then a catalyst. then it actually happening. 

This is dumb. It's like saying ""I'm comfortable where I'm at. Best thing that could happen now is the Lakers ask me to play in the playoffs tonight."""
2021-05-24 22:47:26,wallstreetbets,">GM

Does anyone see the sheer irony here? This is fucking gold."
2021-05-24 22:08:46,wallstreetbets,"Lordstown bought Workhorse ev technology which developed for more than 25 years. Ford has 160billion debts and a lot of legacy costs while Lordstown has none. Whether you are GM or Ford, you are behind lordstown, and they do not have better technology other than their name. If it was gas car, I d be laughing, but ev market is totally brand new ball game for all exception to tsla"
2021-05-25 01:02:13,wallstreetbets,"This is a very old a tedious argument dismissed a month ago. Rivian already demonstrated range in sand, and based on Rivian range, endurance scored the 250:40 miles per charge ratio. Range is accurate, LMC over projected the ratio. 

In the SF250, the vehicle was modified with bigger wheels. Also, the wheel hubs rely on the software to perform. Since this was the first time they tested in those conditions with bigger wheels, energy consumption wasn't on par with what they projected. They can make tweaks in the software to improve performance and they'll need to rethink using those super wheels for next year.

The wheel tech being ‚Äòbetter‚Äô? Better is a word used by uneducated investors to be blunt. It provides lower maintenance costs because the problems that go wrong are easy to get at and the pieces that need replacing are less costly on average. 

No one is saying better, they are saying cheaper. Which is what fleets are after. There is also speculation that it may get better traction in pulling, but ‚Äòmost‚Äô of their purchasers are not interested in that. 

Also, having motors in all wheels make each one really independent one from the other. The power that you can apply directly to each wheel makes a good difference in performance. Tesla is abviously the leader, but the design is shit and we dont know when that will be built. German factory is dead fish and china is cracking down on tesla. Cyber truck just wont happen near term"
2021-05-25 13:00:30,wallstreetbets,"Isn't that what happened with GME? I thought the squeeze catalyst was more about investors wanting to stick it to shorts. The same could happen with $RIDE, although the short interest is no where near as high.

LMC as a startup needs more cash to survive and become viable. That's not unusual. I like what they're trying to accomplish, so I'll wait a month or two longer and see what they come up with for funding."
2021-05-24 23:23:01,wallstreetbets,"If you think GM isn't going to put out an electric Silvarado that will compete with LMC, I've got some bad news for you.

I know GM owns part of LMC, and thats a hedge. They aren't replacing their electric pick-up truck line with Endurance."
2021-05-24 23:05:08,wallstreetbets,Fords Ev isn't coming out until 05/2022 which most likely be delayed while GM will have their ev 2023. It's not Irony Gm is on the Ride Board and investor.... I feel Lordstown will get bought by GM. Lol
2021-05-24 23:45:04,wallstreetbets,"Who says the in-wheel motor is better tech? There is a good chance it is not a viable candidate for a reliable economical vehicle. It is a very unproven tech. The SF250 had them going 40 miles (versus 60 mile range they projected between charges) at 20 mph (when competitors averaged 50-70 mph over that stretch, based on publicly available GPS data).

Practically the parts saved by in-wheel motors vs mounted motors and it making it ""simpler"" is a pretty large overstatement. Getting  rid of a transmission, engine, and all the complex parts there is a huge deal, which is already accomplished. The main parts the in-wheel motor eliminates is the halfshafts and differential. I am very skeptical that it makes more sense to build multiple in-wheel motors vs one mounted one that connects to a diff which connects to the halfshafts which drive the wheels."
2021-05-25 02:24:53,wallstreetbets,"Whatever man. The number of flawed arguments you make are hard to keep up with. Just as to the Cybertruck, it will be built in Texas, not China or Germany. At least get your info straight."
2021-05-25 13:06:23,wallstreetbets,"> I thought the squeeze catalyst was more about investors wanting to stick it to shorts.

This is incorrect. If you are investing substantial amounts of money (to you) you should read more and understand what you are doing. Or not. Do whatever you want. Just my advice."
2021-05-25 02:28:24,wallstreetbets,if you don't think that GM at a minimum isn't waiting for a buy out opportunity for LMC I have some ocean front property in Arizona to sell
2021-05-24 23:25:21,wallstreetbets,You should listen to Warren Buffet and Charlie Munger talking about being on the board of some companies and how little input they had. These things are less important and relevant than some here like to make them out to be.
2021-05-24 23:10:12,wallstreetbets,"You know where Lordstown is building their trucks, right?"
2021-05-25 00:05:05,wallstreetbets,"That's false. It's true that they drove 40 miles, but 20mph is false and it was rough terrain that other cars get 3-5 mile per gallon. 

Main point of Lordstown motor is the first electric pick pu truck available in the US and only electric truck until ford come up with theirs but i dont see that coming soon.

Hub motors have been used widely and were successful in alpha stage and they are improving at beta stage and i dont see why it wont work. Getting rid of all moving parts are important and save a lot of production cost. 

Legacy car makers have a lot of baggage and dont know how to innovate. I hardly see ford or gm coming out with their evs"

That doesn't even make sense. What did I say that is even related to that?

Just because you ""follow the narrative"" on GME doesn't mean you understand the fundamentals. A squeeze doesn't happen because people want to stick it to shorts. If that was the case, a squeeze would happen every day"
2021-05-25 00:19:12,wallstreetbets,Fair enough.
2021-05-25 00:22:41,wallstreetbets,This is outstanding news for Lordstown Motors. Where do you think they'll source their batteries for the ~~GM~~ LM Endurance Truck?
2021-05-25 13:55:37,wallstreetbets,"No offense meant, we probably just have different investing philosophies.

We'll have to disagree on our views of GME. They didn't have, and still don't have any fundamentals to support even the current share price."

Investor Presentation: [https://investor.opendoor.com/static-files/e3df73ec-4145-41e2-ab32-7093b36cb296](https://investor.opendoor.com/static-files/e3df73ec-4145-41e2-ab32-7093b36cb296)

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?

On top of that, to keep the entry cost same as $29.5K you need to buy and short way more contracts than 1000 which means more gain will be lost in fee."

We are a major supplier for Boeing, Northrup, Lockheed, Raytheon, etc. This is a really bold play. There is such a huge potential for downside here.

Boeing doesn't make shit. All their assembly-level components are made by large companies like mine. The industry is having such a fucking hard time sourcing parts right now due to covid. Small machine shops are going under or are unable to ramp back up post-covid.

What this means for us is that we can't build a single, flight-critical component that needs to be on an airframe to fly because our supplier can no longer make a $20 shaft. 

So, we can't sell a $40,000 part because we can't get our hands on a $20 part. That also means Boeing can't sell a $450M plane because they can't get their hands on our $40,000 part. 

This is happening all over right now. Shit's fucked.

I genuinely think US manufacturing is going to be fucked for a while, once people get wind of how bad it is. Everyone is talking about the silicon shortage, but you can't find a fucking company to CNC and treat a shaft at scale right now.

I own a shitload of Boeing ATM, I'm trying to figure out what to do and when."

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"JEDI contract and why it's going to PLTR So for those of you who aren't nerds that pay attention to military procurement and DoD fuckery, you might've missed the fact that the DoD is considering shelving the entire 10-billion dollar JEDI contract for the simple fact that the bidders are having an all out legal battle to see who deserves the contract. 

Before I go any further, I will just say this: **I 100% believe that the DoD will be handing a large portion of the JEDI contract to PLTR for one reason or another**

So just a little primer on what the JEDI contract is:

- JEDI stands for **Joint Enterprise Defense Infrastructure**
- It's supposed to help streamline data sharing for the DoD, which allows for more robust data analysis

Here is the [actual page that the DoD has put up](https://www.cloud.mil/JEDI-Cloud/). There's a couple of things on the Cloud Features that seem almost tailor made for Palantir:

- Empowering the warfighter even when disconnected
   - [PLTR can maintain continuous delivery through Apollo](https://blog.palantir.com/a-sky-full-of-clouds-218b9db3f735), but also has a separate version of Apollo specifically geared towards asychronous delivery operating in disconnected networks
- All classification levels
   - PLTR is the only commercial company with IL-6 clearance. Azure and AWS are only at IL-5
- Support and training packages 
   - PLTR will literally install forward deployed engineers to help take care of this

Now, the only thing kind of standing in the way of PLTR getting the full contract is that Palantir doesn't do their own hardware. So Palantir can't provide the server racks necessary to hold all of the DoD's information. 

So I see the need for a separate vendor to provide the physical hardware needed to support JEDI, but it's almost a no brainer to have PLTR provide the software that will power JEDI for the following reasons:

PLTR is already [building the new version of DCGS-A for the army](https://www.datacenterdynamics.com/en/news/palantir-wins-800m-pentagon-battlefield-intelligence-contract/) and have expressed their desire to become [the central operating system for all US defense programs](https://www.c4isrnet.com/industry/2020/09/30/palantir-wants-to-be-the-central-operating-system-for-all-us-defense-programs/).

It would be a fairly natural next step for Palantir to take up a portion of the JEDI contract since they're already deeply integrated within the informationized warfare doctrine of the 21st century US military.

------------

Then there's also [this article](https://www.nextgov.com/it-modernization/2021/05/if-pentagon-drops-jedi-then-what/174093/)

> DOD officials themselves have emphasized the JEDI standstill hasn‚Äôt brought other cloud efforts to a halt. In a recent interview with Nextgov, DOD‚Äôs Deputy Chief Information Officer for the Information Enterprise Danielle Metz said the military services and the Defense Information Systems Agency are helping plug the general purpose cloud hole. 

So even if the JEDI contract itself completely falls through, the DoD is still 100% pursuing what the JEDI contract will accomplish. Within it, they also outlined the biggest issue facing the military:

> ‚ÄúWhile all of the different military services are building their own platforms, what we‚Äôre risking is just different stovepipes,‚Äù Cornillie, who recently wrote a report outlining what might happen if DOD cancels JEDI, said. ‚Äú**There still is no single enterprise cloud that can share information across all aspects of DOD.**‚Äù 

Gee, I wonder what company is really good about helping share information across different data silos without compromising security...

Finally:

> For his part, Rossino posits there may be a faster, more secure way to provide the cloud capabilities needed to support Pentagon priorities like artificial intelligence, multi-domain operations, and **Joint All-Domain Command and Control, or JADC2.**

Oh, and I wonder which company just won a contract to [develop JADC2 for an entire service branch](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210524005231/en/Palantir-and-Space-Force-Expand-Partnership)?

> Additionally, Palantir will support NORAD-NORTHCOM‚Äôs Joint All Domain Command and Control (JADC2) transformation, ingesting and modeling high-scale data to support comprehensive and collaborative operational planning and execution.

-------------

EDIT: 

JEDI was originally slated to cost 10 billion over 10 years just to get it all set up. In other words, 1 billion a year. PLTR's current income is at 1.1 billion for 2020. Getting this contract--or a contract similar to it--literally doubles PLTR's revenue stream. Since the DoD is moving forward with the new data infrastructure come hell or high water, and I fully expect PLTR to be the final vendor that they chose, it's not impossible for PLTR to literally *double* its revenue in the next 2 years *independent of new commercial contracts*. 

**PLTR $42 2023**"
2021-05-24 20:45:57,wallstreetbets,"PLTR hasn't yet been granted IL-6 tho bub.

2021-05-25 12:09:42,wallstreetbets,Palantir is essentially a services company with a machine learning product. They don't have an offering that matches anything in Jedi requirements. This is maybe the worst DD i've seen.

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I am financially ruined and my life is hell thanks to cockroach futures The year was 2019.  I was convinced that in two years at the latest we'd all be eating cockroaches.  They're a good source of protein, environmentally friendly, they're crunchy, you can make bread with them, and cockroaches are fuckin sturdy.  Nuclear war?  No problem.  The cockroaches give zero fucks.  It's a hedge against nuclear war.  Guns, ammo, and cockroaches are what you want to have when we devolve into mad max.

So I yolo'd my life savings into cockroach futures exp. last month, and until last month I was up 400% but I didn't fuckin sell.  My wife's boyfriend told me to, and I told him that I was a human being and had dignity.  That's not strictly true and my voice cracked a little when I said it, but I think it worked cause he left me alone.  

And then the fuckin cicadas came.  Not a problem, right?  That happens reliably on 17 year cycles, should be priced in.  Except that they came *early*.  Nobody's talking about this but everyone in the cockroach community knows.  The rats have been feasting on these things.  It only takes them three weeks to breed.  And since the rat population is already booming, you retards can do the math.  Oh christ, they're going to be everywhere.  I already see them lurking in the grass.  We're all going to die getting torn to shreds by an army of cicada-juiced rats.  

You know what else rats eat?  Cockroaches.  So absolutely nobody would buy my futures and I had to take delivery of literal tons of cockroaches.  My wife and my wife's boyfriend left me at this point because I had not a penny to my name.  And you'd think they'd deliver 'em dead, right?  Nope!  Now I have literal tons of cockroaches crawling around my house and as a bonus they're attracting more rats cause apparently I'm not the only one who thinks they're a good source of protein.  And now since I have no money to buy food, I've been reduced to hunting my own cockroaches to eat them and I have to compete with this dumb fuckin rats.  

Then my neighbors started to notice my little predicament and reported me to the authorities, so now my house has been condemned.  

tl;dr I'm broke, I'm starving, my house is gone, and I'm probably gonna get eaten by rats.  Never, ever buy cockroach futures."
2021-05-24 20:00:33,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so glad I picked up those $COCK puts a few weeks ago.

2021-05-25 10:19:21,wallstreetbets,"Here is the ultimate survival guide for you...

1) Rats are also source of protein. Some even taste good (I tried). BBQ rat or snake is awesome.  
2) Your neighbors and your wife's boyfriend are good sources of protein. Just remember to be a polite cannibal if you go that way. Learn what parts of the body you can eat and iform yourself about kuru disease.  
3) If it moves it can be eaten. Said that, eating dog liver will kill you due to vitamin A overdose.

Other than that... I  think that the only thing you need to survive is a BBQ, a knife and a fork. you don't even need to go shopping. I see it as absolute win."

One summer, we went for a visit and discovered the place had been infested with rats. They'd come on a fishing boat and gorged themselves on coconut. So how do you get rats off an island, hmm? My grandmother showed me. We buried an oil drum and hinged the lid. Then we wired coconut to the lid as bait, and the rats would come for the coconut, and...they would fall into the drum. And after a month, you've trapped all the rats. But what did you do then? Throw the drum into the ocean? Burn it? No. You just leave it. And they begin to get hungry, and one by one...they will start eating each other, until there are only two left. The two survivors.

And then what - do you kill them? No. You take them and release them into the trees. But now they don't eat coconut anymore. Now they only eat rat. You have changed their nature. The two survivors. This is what she made us.

Then the rats go to Scotland and it all goes a bit Home Alone."

Regarding the whole cricket I can say that it is a bit gross, just for the image of it.
It is crunchy and you definitely can feel the legs in your mouth.

The flour is flour, so same taste without legs.

Taste was not bad AT ALL. It tasted like roasted nuts and it is definitely enjoyable.

That sold me on the ""food for future"" thing they toss around.

If you can find them, and you feel you want to explore, try them. Worst thing it can happen, you spit it away."

if the car is anywhere from $60-90,000, and i‚Äôm losing between like 5-12% of the range that was advertised to me, then yeah, a compensation of $16,000 doesn‚Äôt seem ridiculous at all.

Why aren't you crying for FSD to be disabled until incidents drop? There are way more incidents of FSD and Autopilot ramming objects vs batteries exploding. Your strawman is adorbs tho.

2021-05-24 21:00:46,wallstreetbets,So it was 250 miles per charge for one of them and then down to 211 or something after the update. Generally throttled is different than further throttled.
2021-05-24 21:33:25,wallstreetbets,How does the work from Norway? How does Norway forcefully collect that? Does Tesla have than many assets in Norway that can be seized?

2021-05-25 03:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Tesla isn‚Äôt the powerhouse that GM or Ford are. I think sometimes people forget that Tesla‚Äôs stock is overvalued.

It‚Äôs how the corporate and political system have operated for years. Why do you think lobbyists exist? Do you think companies pay them to lobby for laws out the kindness of their heart? You think Ford or GM‚Äôs lobbyists are going to enact laws to help Elon? California is already trying to ban his cars.

2021-05-25 04:18:30,wallstreetbets,"They likely have some physical presence in Norway. Potentially some inventory, as they sell quite a few cars there. If they don't keep liquid bank assets in an Norwegian account and liquidating ownings would be the way to go, then probably seizing few brand new teslas and auctioning those off would be the easiest way for the gov. official in question to get the money.

People are too stupid to be trusted with stuff like this.  Given a choice people will always take the one that selfishly benefits them short term so how would any reasonable thing get done.  

With technology like this you just gotta trust them, which you kinda should have if you bought.  Not saying they didn't do something wrong at all.

2021-05-25 04:04:17,wallstreetbets,This is why I'm not on the consumer side here.  People like you calling it a *scam* when you are the reason they have to advertise like that.  If they advertised less storage people like you would buy the one that *claims* to have more despite the fact that they are the same.  If you do a little brain-using you can understand what you're buying without being at the mercy of advertisements.  Stupid people are exactly why advertisements are the way they are.

Looks like 217 is 86.8% of 250 (I believe this was the original range of the car he purchased maybe slightly higher) so Tesla is still well within the bounds of normal here.

>Breivik is being held in solitary confinement at Skien prison. He has access to three cells with ""video game consoles, a television, a DVD player, electronic typewriter, newspapers and exercise machines,"" according to The Associated Press.

>But as the Two-Way has reported, Breivik has long complained about his prison conditions, which have included ""daily physical searches."" He has also demanded access to ""adult"" video games rather than ""less interesting kids games."" 


The courts ruled in his favor that he was being treated inhumanely partially because he didn't have access to porno games but you're claiming he'll never be released by the courts from jail on parole?"
2021-05-25 12:50:31,wallstreetbets,"Because they get to help set the standards, Tesla will be forced to meet them. For instance Elon doesn‚Äôt like Lidar, calls it a crutch. You can bet your bottom dollar, autonomous vehicles will be mandated to include Lidar. I think you projected on me a moment ago. Big companies, use government to legislate small companies out of business. Sometimes big companies unify against an emerging market, even if it solves a problem. For example the vaping industry, has all but been decimated by big pharma and big tobacco. It‚Äôs a product with promising results on health, especially those with COPD and such. The Royal College of Physicians tested vaping vs  traditional tobacco and found it 98% safer than traditional tobacco. You don‚Äôt hear that kind of story here in the US though, do you?  That is crony capitalism... It stifles solutions and picks the winners. Capitalism let‚Äôs people decide by voting with their wallet. This government stomps that out before it can happen, because Corporate entities stand to lose billions. Same thing with the oil industry. You don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs been other solutions to gas? Most have never seen the light of day. Interesting fact: The inventor of FM radio killed him self due to suppression of his invention. Why, they couldn‚Äôt have that come out and be stuck with shelves full of am radios. Oh, I remember a time when I thought the world was all gumdrops and lollipops."
2021-05-25 09:00:03,wallstreetbets,"Adult video games meaning AAA games made for adults, not pornography. 

He will never be released for parole. His condition in prison and the terms of his release are independent topics.

Although he might not deserve video games and exercise machines, I believe that discriminating against certain inmates is wrong no matter the crime. If the Norwegian penitentiary board decides that all inmates should have access to the newest PlayStation console, then he should have the same access.

I‚Äôm sure most of the Norwegian population would like to lock him in a hole and forget about him, and I can‚Äôt blame them. The problem with doing that is that it would open up for the possibility for future mistreatment of inmates, which would overall increase both recidivism and crime rates. 

In a weird way, upholding Breivik‚Äôs rights is the same as upholding all citizens‚Äô rights."
2021-05-24 20:56:57,wallstreetbets,"Oooh a whole 77 people.  Like Americans care about lives anyway.  How about you worry about the $40k gun deaths/year instead of a few people once in a blue moon.

If Elon can find a better tech than Lidar then lobby to make it that way (oh wait, he is pretty poor). He already said another non lidar tech was a ""fool's errand."" Just because Papa Elon doesn't wike sumthing doesn't mean he gets to tantwum like he did with the Covid violations. 

I can't speak to your vaping claims cause it's a young tech and still needs long term studying. Which I believe the studies also said too.

Obvs not every hot girl abuses their sexualness. But if you do, its easy to see why theyre entitled bc thats how most horny dudes treated them their whole life (ie full of attention and thinking they‚Äôre perfect) and if theyve been successful at leveraging their hotness to their advantage in their formative years, why wouldnt they use it when theyre older?"

2021-05-25 13:43:22,wallstreetbets,"Basically Virgin Galactic got WAY over heated in January and February and then the stock dropped hard because of insider sell offs (Richard Branson sold about 5% of his stake, Chamath sold all of his and Cathie Wood sold most of the ARKK stake), dropping the stock hard, there were also rumors that the test flight scheduled for May would be delayed or cancelled, starting to push SPCE towards Nikola status. This successful test flight was significant for a few reasons

&#x200B;

1. It was the first flight from the new Spaceport America in Las Cruces, NM
2. It was the first flight with a paying customer (not a person, but some [NASA](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/05/22/virgin-galactic-completes-third-spaceflight-of-vss-unity.html) testing equipment)
3. They promised a test flight in May AND DELIVERED
4. It proved that they can fly (first flight in 2 years) with the new VSS Unity
5. The CEO then announced 3 more flights this summer
   1. Another test flight (in 2-3 weeks)
   2. Next [Sir Richard Branson](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2021/05/22/richard-branson-virgin-galactic-space-flight/) himself will be onboard
   3. The Italian Air Force is sending some future astronauts up for a training/joy ride

Basically the flight moved SPCE from a theoretical/speculative stock towards (Although not all the way) to become an operational company with cash flow. If these three flight work...2022 will see at least 200 flights scheduled and [celebrity](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesasquith/2020/02/26/tourists-in-space-justin-bieber-and-leonardo-dicaprio-have-already-purchased-tickets-as-demand-skyrockets/?sh=67f8f0b241a9) clients to include Leo DiCaprio and Justin Biebers"

2021-05-25 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD: Uber/Postmates is a disaster Postmates completely changed their app, deleted thousands upon thousands of restaurants from their customer's menus and serial-customers (folks who order 2-3+ times a week) have been cut off from being able to order for tens-hundreds of thousands of people.  Their app does not direct users to switch to Uber eats (as Postmates is almost completely defunct) and their support staff were not trained on how to support Postmates, so they are giving negative interactions every time a user requests help (eg. Here's how you fix it in the Uber app!)  


There's at least one month of completely lost revenue for a large portion of the assumed captured monthly recurring revenue that Postmates would have added to the books for Ubereats.  Instead, the only uplift they'll get is people starting to use the Uber Eats app.

However, this revenue will not be recaptured as they also changed the distance algorithm to be more resitrictive, so rural Americans (who Postmates had manually tweaked some of the routes for) will no longer, by and large, be able to order from anywhere near as many restaurants as they used to.

I suspect that even with more people travelling, this (in combination with additional regulation) will actually push Uber into a red quarter.  Also, any competing app that recaptures this revenue (Doordash/Grubhub/PizzaHut/Dominoes) will likely get an uplift as the negative support effect will drive people to other apps, and likely to just call the Chinese or pizza places in their rural town that deliver first party.

2021-05-24 21:58:00,wallstreetbets,Prayer
2021-05-24 21:10:55,wallstreetbets,It looks like the fed is using the reverse repo market to remove excess cash from the system. I‚Äôd probably see that as a mechanism that will prevent inflation.
2021-05-25 06:13:21,wallstreetbets,Too bad I don‚Äôt have debt
2021-05-25 02:50:13,wallstreetbets,"Does this have anything to do with it?  Can Hedge Funds like Melvin/Citadel Pledge Junk Assets to a dealer bank or a company like Palafox and then Palafox, with a contract from like an insurance company (that tends to have a lot of treasuries), borrow those Treasuries from the Insurance company and then Palafox transforms those Junk Assets into treasuries for Melvin/Citadel using collateral transformation?  Can those same assets or treasuries also be rehypothecated as well?  Can this be done multiple times?   Is this a major liability issue for Palafox and Dealer Banks?  Doesn‚Äôt the original issuer at some point what their treasuries back?  Are many players going to the repo market to buy treasuries to pay back what they owe creating this situation?"
2021-05-25 12:14:46,wallstreetbets,Banks have too much money.  And nowhere to put it.
2021-05-25 04:13:35,wallstreetbets,"The Fed doesn't print Treasuries, the Treasury does. And they can only do so when Congress allows. That's the debt ceiling argument that pops up now and then.

But the Fed already has gobs of Tresuries, and can seel lots of those, for some time to come, Indeed, that's how they will likely intervene to halt inflation before it gets out of control.

The big question is, will the Fed return to its mandated duty to defend the value of the currency, or will it obey Wall Street, and keep the money flowing?  


The answer to this question will determine what we degenerates do for our FDs, calls, or puts?"
2021-05-24 21:06:19,wallstreetbets,How are we fucked? It looks like they‚Äôve developed a limitless method to absorb excess liquidity? Wouldn‚Äôt that prevent excess inflation?
2021-05-24 23:17:29,wallstreetbets,They have zero choice but permit the inflation for a while and slowly reduce the printing. Holders of cash and bonds will eat the pain. People on SS and other fixed incomes tied to the under-reported CPI will also eat their share of the shitwich Take out as much cheap debt as you can and buy real assets.
2021-05-24 21:32:04,wallstreetbets,so put the fed.

Don‚Äôt quote me on this but at 25-30ish/bbl, Canadian oil companies find themselves in a position that the can afford to go ahead w new construction projects. Anything lower, and they‚Äôll operate plants at a lower production rate to just keep the lights on. Good to look into their methods of moving product, if it‚Äôs mostly by truck/pipeline, it‚Äôs a less favourable investment, because of getting cucked by fuel shortage and or pipelines shit down. A company that ships largely via rail, is going to be a better bet, because no matter what, they‚Äôre going to have one of 3 options of moving product out."

2021-05-25 01:14:39,wallstreetbets,"This is a speculative and high growth stock. If this were me... I'd sell before it's too late and lock in those gains.  IV will come down, once the hype dries up too."

2021-05-24 21:56:23,wallstreetbets,Really like the way that sounds!
2021-05-25 08:52:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but i don't think the hype is going to die yet.. They will announce the next flight soon. They will also get their license they're looking for from the FAA, and then they will be sending Richard Branson into space. All this will be happening by July"
2021-05-25 06:04:01,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you need to learn what you're doing.
2021-05-24 20:18:54,wallstreetbets,"Anything could happen, but i find it really hard to believe it'll be going down. We'll see an uptrend this week, and next week when it starts to flatten out virgin will announce their next test flight sending it higher. Then the next test flight happens mid June, and in July Richard will fly his flight. Sending virgin galactic into triple digits.... There is a way for it to go down, but it's gonna take something bad happening to one of their tests."
2021-05-25 09:57:12,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. July. Your playing with options, not shares. From here till July, your premiums will collapse. I'm not saying don't go long on SPCE. But atleast close these ones and roll out the dates to give yourself more time. Lock in some gains, get some shares, and get further out dated calls. Play it smart."
2021-05-25 07:46:26,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why I asked, that‚Äôs how you learn buddy."
2021-05-24 23:33:28,wallstreetbets,Probably get some upgrades this week as well... that always helps.
2021-05-25 10:03:07,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking of closing the options out a week before they expire. So June 4th expiration I'm selling this Friday, and turning that profit into shares."
2021-05-25 11:12:39,wallstreetbets,"Stocks are not meant to buy and sell everyday. Also this is space exploration. This is a long term investment. Unless something really big fails miserably, then you bail maybe. I've held my stocks since last Nov and been down thousands. With space there's no end, they just wanna keep going and keep advancing. Best advice, buy more when you can afford it."
2021-05-25 10:10:37,wallstreetbets,"I mean... They are your options do what you want with them. 

For me, this is how I would look at it... For the one with the smallest strike, I am expect a 10% jump in price just to break even at expiration. None of the options are in the money yet. And nothing new will come out this week from them that will cause or justify the stock to keep climbing after it rose 50%+, and already has an oversold RSI. 

On each passing day, theta will eat up higher and higher, eventually wiping out all those ""gains"" you got in premiums. Unless you are deep in the money, and expect to exercise the options. I wouldn't hold. Lock in gains, and roll out in expiration dates. 

But.. again, it's yours options, do what you think is best üòÅ"
2021-05-25 06:01:32,wallstreetbets,Why would you cash out on space. It's not gonna end. and no offense why would anyone trust the advice of cash out by a stranger.
2021-05-24 21:33:33,wallstreetbets,So do you typically sell to close the contract or are you exercising it and therefor having to buy the 100 shares before selling them?
2021-05-24 21:55:31,wallstreetbets,Selling to close the contract would be the ideal way. I don't or have i ever had the money in the account to cover buying the contract shares outright.
2021-05-24 21:58:37,wallstreetbets,"Got it, I was coming to the same conclusion. Plus, does it really take up to 3 days? What if the stock goes down during that time?"

With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote."

2021-05-24 20:17:43,wallstreetbets,I have been averaging down for past few weeks. Currently at $8.86 2500 shares. Hoping to add another 5k this week if I see another drop.
2021-05-24 21:35:00,wallstreetbets,Just dont put a call price because it makes it harder for the price to rise and for us to game squeeze it. Only do calls when your ready to sell

2021-05-25 03:15:02,wallstreetbets,"Yup. The longer WSB talks about BABA the longer I don't buy.

2021-05-25 11:57:49,wallstreetbets,Just because I'm bullish on BABA doesn't mean I can't be bullish on INTC.
2021-05-25 16:43:38,wallstreetbets,"What's the thesis behind INTC being a good investment now? Just as an inverse to WSB? I'm no expert but I sold them a couple years ago as I saw the writing on the wall. They keep  failing and have lost their once sizable fab lead. I'd love to hear a valid argument behind owning them aside from the ""construction crane indicator"". Unless of course you have some backtested results using that indicator :) Then I'd like to subscribe to your newsletter."
2021-05-25 11:54:59,wallstreetbets,What?  Those companies are not Alibaba. They are mid cap companies with much smaller or no earnings where the market got ahead of itself and the price dropped because yields have risen. Alibaba is a giant. And you could argue that fear over chinese policy is pretty much priced in already
2021-05-24 20:51:23,wallstreetbets,What's a DCF? A Dollar Cost Faverage?
2021-05-24 21:17:45,wallstreetbets,"You might satisfy these folk by flipping it around -- find an interest rate that turns the cash flow into the current share price, then talk about the spread over whatever bond yields you care to look at. Of course, a sky-high price target is more punchy (and more actionable) than a dumb-looking discount rate, though, so it makes plenty of sense your way around."

2021-05-24 20:35:23,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this timely piece of information. I only get my DD from this bunch of autists in here nowadays so I was getting a little worried on what to do.
2021-05-25 01:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Inflation isn‚Äôt rising prices, rising prices are a symptom of ‚Äúinflation‚Äù of the money supply."
2021-05-25 07:29:23,wallstreetbets,"This is just not good DD. I am not an inflation non believer but the CPI includes some misleading info. 

Last year at this time oil was negative, oil/natural gas influence the CPI with heating and gasoline prices and compared to last year when it was basically free it‚Äôs inflated a fuck load. It also includes used cars which drove it the most. Used cars prices are supply issues not inflation issues. Semi conductor manufacturing requires you to predict demand 2 years out. Seriously they employ people to do this because they have to. everyone thought the pandemic would last and there wouldn‚Äôt be demand. The bean counters were wrong and now everyone is experiencing the supply crunch."
2021-05-25 08:52:46,wallstreetbets,"Inflation did not cause the bear market. The Federal Reserve hiking rates did. Look at the ten year yield in the 80's it was near 15% at one point. People could get better return in bonds and savings then so they stayed out of stocks.

[https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart](https://www.macrotrends.net/2016/10-year-treasury-bond-rate-yield-chart)

In 1979, President Jimmy Carter had appointed Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve. With inflation running double digits the Federal Reserve under Volker raised the federal funds rate from 11.2% to 20% by June of 1981.The intent was to break the inflationary spiral within the United States. But raising the federal funds rate also made it more difficult to borrow money. This helped cause the 1980-1982 recession and a national unemployment rate of over 10%. As a result, the Bear Market of 1982 could be called Volker's Bear.

&#x200B;

As long as inflation continues it will be stock market positive. If the fed hikes rates then that will be bad for stocks. Keep your eye on the 10 year yield."
2021-05-25 00:27:15,wallstreetbets,government don't care about your leverage
2021-05-24 23:07:23,wallstreetbets,"I agree. The Fed literally can‚Äôt raise rates or everything collapses. There‚Äôs too much debt combined with high equity and housing prices. 

We have no choice but to eat some big inflation for a while until debt levels are inflated away. The poor will get their $15/hr might even be $20 in a few years but they‚Äôll spend it all on increased groceries, rent, gasoline and car prices."

2021-05-25 09:42:55,wallstreetbets,"I pretty much agree yet I doubt the Fed can increase interest rates much like they did in the early 80's.  With $30T visible debt and a 10% interest rate, the interest of $3T would bankrupt the government very fast.  If the fed wants to fight inflation they can remove a lot of cash (taper) from the system.  They might be able to do it without letting interest rates rise much.  This would signal the end of the bull market.  

In the end they have two choices: let inflation run wild or crush the markets.  Your opinion is inflation would be good for the markets indefinitely.  Not sure.  But I do believe that rampant inflation will cause a mad dash into precious metals and make them the next bubble."

2021-05-25 13:16:14,wallstreetbets,"There is a third option, which Fed has discussed, which is Government eliminating supply side shortages that are leading inflation. EX eliminating trumps lumber tariffs to lower housing/construction prices. Considering a lot of industries are still feeling the hit from COVID, gov has a lot of places to work on"
2021-05-24 20:53:29,wallstreetbets,One of us! One of us!
2021-05-24 23:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Agree there‚Äôs no way out but inflation. 

Inflation eat the middle class for lunch. The poor will see rising wages to combat rising prices but most middle and upper middle class jobs don‚Äôt have labor shortages thus won‚Äôt see upward wage pressure. The middle class typically doesn‚Äôt have enough exposure to investments that will make up their lost ground via wages.

The best bet now is mortgage your house to the hilt at 2.5% or less and invest in inflation assets. That‚Äôs literally free money at far below the rate of inflation."
2021-05-25 08:14:28,wallstreetbets,"Believing that GME will cause ""trillions in lost wealth"" and ""deflation"" is like breaking into Capitol Hill and thinking you can change the outcome of the election.  Good luck!"
2021-05-24 22:36:30,wallstreetbets,"Good point.  One day one of the drug dealer's clients knocked on the door and had a gun.  He knew the dealer kept his cash in a portable safe and demanded the safe.  The dealer picked up the safe, ran through the apartment and dove, safe first, through the front window.   He landed on the porch, picked up the safe and started running down the street.  The guy with the gun chased him but gave up.  I gave an eviction notice to the drug dealer and he was outraged that I would evict him given he was the victim.  What a mess.  I'll stick with rentals only in good areas."
2021-05-25 13:36:21,wallstreetbets,You have a good point.  Yet I also wonder how much of the inflation we are seeing is simply a loss of confidence in the dollar because the government is printing it into oblivion with no end in sight. The US dollar index dropped into the 80's again and appears to be headed lower.  That's highly inflationary regardless of supply chain issues.
2021-05-25 08:15:42,wallstreetbets,"???

Care to explain....this sub for months has been talking something akin to a 2008 style crash. A 2008 style crash will cause prices for pretty much everything to fall through the floor due to lost demand."

I'm long IPOE/SOFI too via warrants but would sat SOFI is EXPENSIVE today. At current stock price, after merger and total shares outstanding, it has a marketcap of $16 BILLION with ONLY $600M in revenue. This leads to a very high p/s. Doesn't mean SOFI can't grow into it but wouldn't say SOFI is a screaming buy here either but more of a long term play."

I only mention GME because it was a highly publicized recent squeeze event and AMC holders are also waiting for a squeeze so a comparison can be made. 

It would seem, for no rational reason, that as crazy as the GME squeeze was, AMC holders think there are going to see squeeze multiples that would dwarf even that improbable event. And that's with 9X the shares and far fewer shorts to squeeze.

I have no skin in the game and if you can send it to $1000 I'd be the first one to say congratulations!"

2021-05-24 20:27:18,wallstreetbets,Uhh thats just like.... a matter of record dude. Every time the price starts to rise they juice another 50mil shares. Thats why the market cap is 6bil even though each share is 14 bucks. The highest the market cap ever was prior to now was 4 bil in 2016ish.....
2021-05-25 07:15:58,wallstreetbets,I mean some people who are involved can't afford to spend $150-$180 for 1 share of GME so would like to still like to make money so they buy full shares of AMC at $12-$13 rather. I'd prefer full shares over fractional too. Not sure what's hard to understand about that?
2021-05-25 01:51:43,wallstreetbets,You need to learn what shares outstanding are before you fuck with any of this dude.
2021-05-24 22:06:29,wallstreetbets,"Market cap is irrelevant during any squeeze. VW became the highest valued company in the world very briefly during its squeeze. What matters is float, the amount shorted, and who owns how much of it."

Been helping the squeeze selling her shares....however she has been trying to exit Amc for a while. Now it‚Äôs possible the momentum should continue given many things out of our control start happening....The price can rise to ridiculous levels if people hold and they need our shares to close positions, however I‚Äôve lost all faith in market and regulators. Hedge funds are making a lot of money shorting and tanking the market, hard to say when but ide guess it could take a while still. I think we understand to position SHFs are in and the fact they attempted to bankrupt the companies by printing disgusting amounts of naked shorts for the home run. However they failed so we can all see how this plays out. I‚Äôm long Amc n Gme and everything else is bullshit at this point. Crash is coming. Puts on our futures and this shitty rigged market."
2021-05-25 11:42:34,wallstreetbets,The part where you claim to not be able to afford fractional shares.
2021-05-24 23:41:14,wallstreetbets,"VW became the highest valued company with a 2X (+/-) squeeze - depending on the starting point of where you'd call the squeeze to have started.

I don't know what your price target is for AMC but some are calling for $500 to $1000 -- a 36X to 71X squeeze. Yeah, market cap does kinda matter when you're talking about absurdity.

BTW, you don't get a squeeze without short investors to squeeze. AMC's with latest issuance has about 495M shs with a short interest of 88M shs or 18% as reported on most financial sites. Nice size but not the 100% short or more WSBers are talking about. The massive short positions discussed have yet to be proven. If you have evidence of this 100%, 200% or more short position - post your evidence with a link."
2021-05-24 20:55:36,wallstreetbets,"Well I agree with most of that, after the last debacle with amc and gme.... it became pretty obvious the market is a joke. It just feels like they are slowly stealing money at this point.... not everyone can win."
2021-05-24 21:35:34,wallstreetbets,"Sure? They can have all the time they want issuing shares and taking on loans to survive until theatres reopen.

But then what? Diluted shares with depressed earnings due to a much lower debt/EBITA for years to come for shareholders."
2021-05-25 13:43:52,wallstreetbets,"Apparently you missed further up in the thread that I personally hold BOTH stocks. I'm not claiming I cannot afford fractional shares. üôÑ
Moving right along...some/most people prefer FULL SHARES of stock and what they can afford."
2021-05-25 01:50:52,wallstreetbets,You all desperately need to learn what shares outstanding are.
2021-05-25 00:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Right, and VW was only shorted about 20% of their float IIRC. They also got put on notice by Porsche. My PT for AMC is somewhere between $50-$100 IF it squeezes. I only have a few hundred shares from some $3c options I bought in early Jan.

My long play is GME, with most of my damage coming in the $20-$40 range between November and now. my ACB is about $60 overall from options I exercised throughout.  I've done my own math, read through tons of DD. Shorts haven't covered on GME, and that's my play. As always, DYOR. I've been following the GME saga since July(ish) of last year."

2021-05-25 01:38:33,wallstreetbets,"I THINK NOT ... respectfully I have to disagree, not just because it was my investment decision.  However, you do not have the benefit of knowing my risk tolerance or portfolio exposure on this single position. 

I performed really well in the market over the last 14 months, went all cash in early March 2020 (didn‚Äôt have the balls to short the market), but I was able to effectively swing trade my ass off on a dozen fave stocks (Tesla, Beyond Meat, Snapchat, Hertz, all the airlines & cruise-ships and Virgin Galactic) so Virgin had been good to me.  When it started falling off its peak into the low 50‚Äôs I picked up some again and that started the process of averaging down.  Am I active trading this stock because I‚Äôm in love with their management and fundamentals... no.  I trade this stock because it‚Äôs an exciting category with few competitors, and it‚Äôs price moves frequently enough to have an opportunity for massive gains.  I‚Äôm not my parents holding a bunch of stable blue chips clipping dividend coupons for a return that‚Äôs on par with the S&P.  My goal is to see at least 300% annual returns and so long as these guys do not kill a crew, their stock is going to soar.  

Let‚Äôs face it, everyone wants to go space ... so is there anything more fitting for this forum than sending SPCE to the moon with a squeeze on the shorts?"

Also, if you'd stayed a female in the womb, without becoming a male, the corresponding homologous tissue,  that became both halves of your bifurcated scrotum, would indeed be separate as the two, clearly distinct, labia majora.
Also, in hermaphroditic and pseudo-hermaphroditic humans, that appear more feminine at first inspection, usually have testicles, i.e. unspecified gonads or pre-testicles if you will, growing in their labia majora. 
So, in an esoteric sense, you are right and everyone else is wrong."

The mill is not the start of the supply line.  It starts with the trees and those who cut them down.
2021-05-25 00:51:07,wallstreetbets,"Yes, the ones were we think the stock will go up"
2021-05-25 16:49:38,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre working too. The trees are there too. But they haven‚Äôt increased. If those stay flat in supply flow and demand increases then the ratio still increases for supply/demand. You don‚Äôt need supply to decrease for the ratio to change. Supply can go up and demand increase more and the ratio is still higher for demand.

I don't really use that type of trading indicator to dictate my trades- haven't found it useful. I play bottoms- try to find something beaten up, when it shouldn't be. Suggest you value the company yourself (any company you want to buy) and figure out the possible downside if you're worried."

2021-05-25 11:05:08,wallstreetbets,"i am holding LTMAQ since july 2020. What equity investors might be not seeing is that LTMAQ is under chapter 11 and its bonds are in default, still the sr unsec ones are trading around 95% of par. So, the laws in Chile and in the whole Latin America is way different that US bankruptcy laws. Last week I saw one news comparing LATAM Airlines situation as the new HERTZ where equity jumped from 1 to 6 usd once they restructured the company. The price action can be similar but the reasons will be different. There is now way that shareholders will loose its company to unsecured creditors, not in any Emerging Market country. So, if bonds are trading close to 100% of its par, why the equity is still between 25 - 30% of pre covid levels? Probably they will swap this debt into some convertible bond which in the end you might get diluted as an equity holder, but still I would assume at least 5 usd for this stock even in the event of a dilution, because we will be talking about a leader company in the region well positioned for the recovery and free of debt. BTW the borrowing fee of the stock is at 34% at IBKR and increasing. We also might see a nice short squeeze on the name."

2021-05-25 04:48:29,wallstreetbets,"Why are you entering this now and calling for a summer crash?

Most crashes happen around October and SPY recently bounced back from a couple of panic sales, just coasted past 420.

With theta decay and good technicals on SPY I'd probably wait and make a similar play in line with next months Fed comments and PMI data and use futures and signals of potential market panic to decide when to hit the button.

If there's any drivers for a possible dump you'll know about it a day before so just buy an itm put the day before and see where it goes. If the data is good you can buy it back for virtually no loss and try again next fed talk/pmi.

2021-05-25 06:20:38,wallstreetbets,"One major reason I'm not worried about inflation or overheating.


Look at the policies since 2008, they strangle the banks and the the economy in favor of government and now they send extra transfer payments to keep people out of the labor force.

I know this will not create sustainable growth or inflation because we've been watching it for over a decade."
2021-05-25 07:50:04,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Japan has tried this for 30 years and their millennial cohort is much worse off for it. 

Also, if you look at market volatility pre and post 2008, it never recovered. Just another confirmation that money/ideas are not churning through our economy."

With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote."

2021-05-24 23:24:02,wallstreetbets,"They are not a practical tool for beating the market.  It is just a tool to trade in and out of a particular stock.  


Charts are just one trading tool.  You have to take a holistic approach.  Understand what the overall trend is for the day, the week and month.   In most cases a particularly stock is not going to pull away from the overall market trend.  Chating Analytics lets you see what is in front of you, but your own internal emotional state can and may lead you to ignore the analytics."

2021-05-25 14:25:59,wallstreetbets,"Hindenburg is full of shit just like citadel.

They made so much money dumping it from 9.67 to barely breathing in the $4-5 range back in December/January.

These guys don‚Äôt even have to be right, they just have to shift sentiment.

Nikola was ripe with fraud and they made a killing shorting it.

Microvision is not a fraud and has built an Intellectual Property Portfolio consisting of decades worth of patents formulating economic moats around laser scanning technology.

The sector is saturated but it‚Äôs not hard to sift through bullshit and pick winners. Difference is some stocks get shorted as the market corrects the value of crap companies, while some stocks get shorted to enable the whales to have a cheaper entry.

I am not a financial advisor this is not financial advice

I did well enough with the calls expiring this week that I feel comfortable holding without feeling anxious about volatility. I'm ready to make some more moves if there is a major overcorrection tomorrow too. I'll see you on the fucking moon my guy!"
2021-05-25 19:15:00,wallstreetbets,"1000%

Volume wasn't anything crazy, and some of those sell walls were pretty intimidating throughout the day. Honestly can't believe we broke through as high as we did.

Your remaining calls are in good shape, and depending on how things go, no reason you can't CAD or push things out further. It's going to go up.

Just keep your wits about you, limit the emotion, and you'll (we'll) be just fine.

2021-05-25 04:31:49,wallstreetbets,"2023 is well within the timeline for the online platform, i'd expect a GME in house platform before then but you'll be looking at the moon, just a poor reflection of the rising Sun of a proper worldwide P2P online staples (food, drink, clothing, shelter & energy/telecommunications) doorstop delivery market with instore only inflation proof currency (G's) & an SMS forms system to give online access to areas with no internet. 

The hyperinflation in the US has already started & every G bought to keep peoples savings value & ensure access to staples puts the value of GME up by the same amount, no more Gold (Capital) ball drop free trade deficit induced busts to free up homes from out of work Red (Populist) homeowners, GameStop.

3 supply side shocks; announce, launch, flee to G's & then a final economic atomic because we are so done with Blue (Capitalists) owning the mechanism of Capitalism itself & abusing it to 'leverage' Gold (Capital) from the wage sl@ve Black (Nationalist) renters who actually produce. Labour scarcity from economic progression is necessary for species survival because it induces capital labour substitution development, when they raise 'rents' & staples prices in line with wage growth they doom humanity to a high labour low capital developing nation wage sl@ve Hell just waiting for the next dinosaur meteor.

 GME is a brand & that brand deserves a platform of equal size & matching the ambition of its shareholders, one that we were working on before Blues pulled the swarm in with a Gold ball drop & tried to leave them holding the bag or trick them into silver to eat them with a supply side shock. No one deserves this more than the deathgrippers who lost hope but kept faith with each other & we will be counting on their shares to take the brand from Blue (Capitalist) control when the time comes so buy a Golden ticket & enjoy the nominal price ride, we got the real price.

2021-05-24 23:02:24,wallstreetbets,"No, you are incorrect. They are bleeding everyday they don‚Äôt cover forcing their liquidity to go down. Hence bleed them out.

Diversification makes it impossible for you to become wealthy, which is what we are all doing here. We are not setting up retirement accounts. Young people investing for the future should not be worried about diversification.

2021-05-24 20:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Nearly 14 million shares of the Las Cruces, New Mexico-based company were sold short over the past 30 days, meaning the stock‚Äôs Monday surge after a test flight has dealt short-sellers millions of dollars in losses, data compiled by financial analytics company S3 Partners show. With short interest sitting at $949 million, more than a fifth of shares available for trading are sold short and that could prompt bears to cover their bets, S3 Partners said.

That increase in short selling has already resulted in mark-to-market losses of $427 million for bears this year -- with $366 million of those losses occurring over the last eight days, Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of predictive analytics at S3 Partners, wrote in a report Monday. With short bets against the company getting more crowded and as losses increase, the company appears to be ripe for a short squeeze, he wrote."

2021-05-25 10:13:44,wallstreetbets,"% wise that is true, but from a fundamental standpoint it isn't true. Because a guy with 10 mil can actually afford to lose a lot more of his 10 mil and still have a lot to live his life. If a guy with 10 mil loses 90%, he still has an entire 1 mil which is a lot of money. Whereas a guy with $100K loses 90%, that 90% meant a lot more to him because now he's only left with 10k"
2021-05-25 12:31:24,wallstreetbets,I'd say PUT when it pops the historic highs or CALL when it's pushing  weekly lows on avg weekly range.  You cant just pick a direction with no confirmation.  You will get chopped up.

However, whether you like him or not, Buffett has stayed very anti-derivatives (options) since the beginning of his career. The only exception he makes in options is OCCASIONALLY a call option. Most of the time though, they (Berkshire) pre-arrange share purchases at discounts off market since they usually buy up majority stakes in companies. They also tend to hold their stake for 1+ year and add/subtract portions of their stake over time."

2021-05-25 02:40:06,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry dj, but kooky is right on this one.  Market makers hedge based on the delta of the call option.  The closer it gets to the strike price, the more shares they purchase to hedge their position.  They don't purchase all the shares at once upon a call being exercised, they already have them by the time it reaches the strike.  Just Google ""delta hedging"""
2021-05-25 08:12:35,wallstreetbets,"What do you think is the ratio of delta hedging, per option contract exchanged? Your specific example only applies if the broker doesn‚Äôt own the shares; then hedges his position by purchasing the shares close to expiration. Most option contracts are not naked. It would take a huge push of circumstances to 1. Deplete all available shares to option out 2. Push it into a naked situation 3. Keep pushing deep into naked % 4. All hedges purchasing at the same time, to finally ‚Äúrealize the GME delta squeeze‚Äù that everybody dreams off. I.e. a pipe dream and won‚Äôt happen with UWMC... so yes purchasing and pushing a boatload of option calls can in certain circumstances influence the SP if you insist. It‚Äôs not the rule it‚Äôs something that sometimes can happen. Ok I was wrong if you focus on the exception, and if it makes kookie happy.

Everything drops after earnings though so take this with a grain of salt. 60%of the time this strategy works every time.

2021-05-25 16:54:33,wallstreetbets,"I know nothing about nothing and honestly like the company, but here's my question. Is the reason some expect the share price to drop significantly upon lock-up expiration that 8,912,631 shares can be exercised at $2.22/share and anotehr 711,180 shares can be exercised at $5.29/share? I realize that's only \~21% of the total shares oustanding, but isn't it also \~$559,455,700 if the stock price sits at $32? And even $20/share could be a hefty profit for one exercising those options. I guess one thing I don't really know is who owns the shares? I'd guess the majority are executives, but given they appear to be starting and ESPP, is it fair to assume a decent number are lowly peons like myself who may grealy appreciate a nice near-term bump in their net worth? I'm sure I'm making lots of errors here and all, so feel free to correct me as deserved, and thank you."
2021-05-25 17:00:14,wallstreetbets,It's probably venture capital. The lockup period expiring could help explain the short interest. We could see share dilution after it's over on June 7th
2021-05-25 16:59:47,wallstreetbets,"I'm getting an education, too. So the float is small now because of the lock-up period. But the moment that expires, wouldn't the short interest as percent of float plummet, and short sellers would easily be able to cover with the potential influx of shares? I realize that depends on whether or not shareholders dump their shares when the lockup period expires, but is that part of the bet short sellers are making?"
2021-05-25 17:31:52,wallstreetbets,"You are correct. Short sales as a percentage of total float is only around 6-7%. So in reality, this stock isn't really shorted too much at all. At the end of the day, I'm not too concerned about what the short percentage might be. I'm primarily focused on the strength of PUBM financial condition. For the motivation of the short sellers, there's a lot of speculation about the future of the digital ad market with the coming privacy changes, but management seems to have a good handle on it. It blows my mind why retail investors get the idea that they know the digital ad market better than an entire management team running a billion dollar+ adtech company, but to each their own of course. Short sellers probably sold short due to IDFA changes in iOS, chrome cookie change, bloated valuation , and the lockup period expiration. The short borrow rate has been ticking higher though, so they are definitely being aggressive with their short sales. At the end of the day, what I see is a highly profitable company, growing at a nice rate, a strong management team, and a growth industry. Good long term hold in my book, but you are rolling the dice as even Google will admit that no one really knows what will happen when the third party cookie goes away. Lots and lots and lots more I could say about it."

2021-05-24 21:26:59,wallstreetbets,"Gunny was hard on me is not what I was referring to.

It can range from any event that was traumatic, from crimes that where committed against, such as rape / assault / battery; to workplace accidents caused by or witnessed by. Then to further cause stress 'Gunny' handles the situation incorrectly. 

I can go on a rant on the downward spiral that active duty /vets go through after that; but hopefully this helps you understand PTSD a bit more.

2021-05-25 19:02:15,wallstreetbets,My 1yr PT is $42 based on expected sales of zynrelef. $PCRX has a market cap of ~3B with <500M in annual sales of exparel. $HRTX market cap is ~1.5B. Expect zynrelef to take most of exparels market in addition to the generic local anesthetic market. Easily 500M to 1B in annual sales. Most institutions have rejected exparel from formulary do to lack of benefit over standard of care. The data for zynrelef is much stronger and will be adopted at institutions who rejected exparel and replace exparel in those that use it. (From discussions with local and regional formulary review groups.) With expected EU partner in q1 22 and EU sales this is a Billion $ drug. Biopharm sector average price 5 to 10x sales. 5b-10b ($55-$111) per share. My $42 (3.7B market cap) target is based on 100M in cinvanti sales in addition to 300 to 500M in zynrelef with room to grow. I would expect buy out to be in the 5-7B range $50-$70 per share.

2021-05-25 18:42:12,wallstreetbets,"not only little kids. the game is 15 years old it has an entire teenager/adult generation. our own close knit communities, traders ect. roblox is way bigger than a 'kids game'. just that majority of players are little kids"
2021-05-25 18:44:49,wallstreetbets,"if you want an either more rewarding investment, you should look into roblox and limiteds. basically limited items that only increase in price. we had a massive  increase in price in the last year. if you had an item valued at say 100k it'd be like 300k right now. 1k robux = around 5 dollars. black markets also make a ton of cash. youre gonna have to learn everything however. and it requires quite alot of knowledge to safely do stuff like this."
