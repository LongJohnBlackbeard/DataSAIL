We are all happy."

2021-06-04 19:52:13,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
2021-06-04 19:23:44,wallstreetbets,It's attached in the post -- took screen shots of the 100 extra call options purchased today around $16.50 - $17.00 each -- u/Memetron9000 please confirm you can see those screen shots.
2021-06-04 19:52:47,wallstreetbets,my wife is a nymphomaniac and im a virgin

2021-06-04 19:27:34,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
2021-06-04 19:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Going to be a long for me, pocketed this at 5% of portfolio"
2021-06-04 19:27:47,wallstreetbets,"I bought the dip today, forget a short squeeze this is a good entry even for longs 🙂📈"
2021-06-04 19:32:50,wallstreetbets,Thank you ! I sold my 3 month bag at the high yesterday and bought another 1000shares on the low . I can’t wait for Monday !
2021-06-04 19:50:20,wallstreetbets,"Definitely ripe for a short squeeze but also a great all around company poised to lead last mile delivery. Some fun facts: 
250mil cash on hand /  actual POs for over 8000 c-series trucks worth over $600mil, including 950 trucks from ups / owns patent for truck launched delivery drones / over 2000 test deliveries with drones performed with ups last year and drone at faa now for final approval / institutions including Blackrock and Vanguard own over 70mil shares - and all that is just scratching the surface. People will learn about this company because of the short interest and buzz, but this stock also makes for a great long term buy and hold for all the reasons mentioned and more"
2021-06-04 19:30:44,wallstreetbets,"Showing 47,543,140 out of 123,260,319 shares short for me. Not quite 50% but sure is high enough."
2021-06-04 19:28:46,wallstreetbets,"The problem is their production, they can’t make the vans fast enough. They need a partner or larger plant.  Quality product, construction and proprietary software. IKEA uses some trucks and that is an amazing forward looking company. If we drive the stock higher (like AMC) they could leverage expansion or partner. With such a small float this would be a huge gamma squeeze. Let’s give it to them Apes! 🦍"
2021-06-04 19:22:02,wallstreetbets,10/15/21 calls at 50 strike. Done.  🚀 🐴 ⏰.
2021-06-04 19:31:22,wallstreetbets,Would selling a kidney be enough to YOLO on this ass soon to be stallion?
2021-06-04 19:48:05,wallstreetbets,I really don’t understand why WSB is ignoring this.  It literally is the recipe for a perfect short squeeze.  More than GME and amc. This has massive potential and I’m really scratching my head at why they aren’t on this.
2021-06-04 19:22:36,wallstreetbets,Bought an October call on Thursday and ready for that squeeze to begin. Keep holding the AMC line too!!!
2021-06-04 19:34:02,wallstreetbets,Not far fetched I’d say
2021-06-04 19:51:02,wallstreetbets,There was one report on TD Ameritrade and it doesn't make the fundamentals look very pretty for this to be a long...
2021-06-04 19:34:27,wallstreetbets,https://imgur.com/gallery/sXTS3HP good sir.
2021-06-04 19:31:31,wallstreetbets,The do own 10% of Lordstown and they have a giant facility.
2021-06-04 19:33:44,wallstreetbets,Correct 8600 back orders.. However they just announced a partnership with Morgan Olson subsidiary in last earnings call. We know very little about it
2021-06-04 19:47:56,wallstreetbets,"Production is the issue... and stop with the “they own 10%, blah blah blah”...  even with it they will have production issues... even if they somehow win a contract they will never be able to produce"
2021-06-04 19:26:21,wallstreetbets,"Right on. Seems like the perfect formula, but what do I know."
2021-06-04 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,Never has a better idea been thunk of

What it really said was that it is at the *fund raising stage* to begin conception of 6G research will look like.

2021-06-04 17:52:34,wallstreetbets,Picked up some puts the last couple days. A lot are gonna be left holding the bag. Theaters having been declining way before the government forced lockdown.
2021-06-04 17:49:26,wallstreetbets,100% shocked it went above 30 imo. Let the down voting begin
2021-06-04 17:54:11,wallstreetbets,"Bought puts that expire next Friday, expecting a bloodbath on Monday. AMC is absurdly priced with no fairytale re-branding strategy like GME."
2021-06-04 17:56:27,wallstreetbets,They will hate you for this
2021-06-04 17:52:30,wallstreetbets,Probably deserves to be down there but then again I don't see it dropping continuously past $20ish. These meme stocks always seem to rebound at some point. Maybe sell a put at $20 and it should bounce back to $30 then fall again and then trade sideways.
2021-06-04 19:03:27,wallstreetbets,Sold all my $8 shares for $53. Will buy more at $20 no doubt

2021-06-04 17:50:22,wallstreetbets,I’ve got 10 puts for $25 on June 25th. it’ll absolutely snapback in the weeks to come.

If you’re eager to publicly humiliate yourself and self flagellate because you yolo’d and fomo’d  then congratulations you’re not alone. The smart money was in this a while back. The only way to make money on this trade now is to hope that somewhere out there is someone even dumber than you. There well may be. But most likely if you’re ‘thinking about’ buying AMC now your brain has almost no wrinkles at all. 

So hurry up and get on the list to proclaim your gullibility and greed. The rest of us apes are bored and just need someone to pick on because we’re feeling stupid ourselves for not buying calls last month."

2021-06-04 18:17:57,wallstreetbets,Millions of puts are already ordered.  Now I wonder if the price will fall fast enough to be profitable.
2021-06-04 18:11:20,wallstreetbets,"AMC is not GME, AA keep diluting shareholders and he's a boomer more than likely at the end of his career who thought he'd have it on easy street till retirement. Unfortunately for him apes got in the way. Ryan Cohen (Papa Cohen) on the other hand is early 30s has a few billion dollars to play with, is hungry and looking for his next big play to make a name for him self in the world of billionaires. Go with the winning horse guys...it's kind of a no brainer."
2021-06-04 18:29:34,wallstreetbets,"20 is beyond generous, massive dilution, increased debt and still losing money.  The last time AMC was consistently in the 20s was 2017.  

Pre pandemic it was 8-9 bucks.

This chain was struggling for years and they haven't changed anything that is going to fix that.  They still go for long term leases on their theaters, so it forces them to keep non profitable locations open, in order to minimize losses, and they don't end up owning anything."

2021-06-04 19:12:53,wallstreetbets,If it gets to $20 I will probably take a stab at a long swing back up to $40. I'm not advising you or anyone to do anything. Just telling you what I'm doing and why I'm doing it.
2021-06-04 18:19:38,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget, when the first round of GME drop, it attracted a swarm of short sellers.

Retail investors aren’t the only game in town.  Whales are taking advantage of this turbulence to vanquish other firms."
2021-06-04 18:07:42,wallstreetbets,Prob Bc ceo doesn’t keep trying to sell more shares
2021-06-04 18:05:40,wallstreetbets,I have no explanation for how GME is still $250. But there will be many trading and finance books written about it. I do not understand it at all. Totally blown away by it. Who knows maybe AMC will do the same. There are some things in life that remain a mystery to me. The GME price action is definitely on of them.
2021-06-04 18:53:43,wallstreetbets,"Because GME doesn’t have nearly as many outstanding shares out and they don’t continue to make new share offerings and when they did make an offering it was to retail investors, so the shares were purchased and held. AMC has an extremely high number of outstanding shares and they are not even offering them all to retail investors. If you read their latest filing called a prospectus you’ll see that AMC can actually use the offered shares to short themselves, which means the board and CEO don’t even think their share price is legitimate or sustainable. They’re gonna make money shorting themselves."
2021-06-04 17:54:09,wallstreetbets,"Shorts don't need to cover when price goes down. Why cover at profit when you can make even more profit. Just wait it out. Duhh.

Do you sell when you made money when you know the stock will inevitably crash at some point? No. You just hold a bit more. Fees are near non-existent anyways with all these meme stocks currently for some reason (maybe cause brokerages don't want margin calls)."
2021-06-04 19:37:06,wallstreetbets,"lol he's not hurtful, he's telling facts"

2021-06-04 18:06:20,wallstreetbets,Def not trying to be hurtful. Just calling it like I see it. But who knows maybe I'm wrong. The squeeze on GME took me very much by surprise.
2021-06-04 19:15:50,wallstreetbets,I guess we'll see. I don't get every trade correct by any means. But I'm in the trade to make money not lose money and so far feeling good about the decision.
2021-06-04 18:23:31,wallstreetbets,"Rebound clown?

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^MVIS ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^Call"
2021-06-04 18:38:43,wallstreetbets,No one has any idea who’s covered what. Crap shoot. It can do anything. I don’t have skin in AMC but I hope you all get rich.
2021-06-04 18:56:10,wallstreetbets,">I was always thinking it was worth $30 on its own once everything came back

Shares been diluted so many times that $1 last year is different from $1 today. Considering pre-pandemic AMC was $6.55, AMC with dilution even after getting out of debt will probably be worth much less than $30.

If the reasoning is 'potential streaming service', that's AMCX, not AMC."
2021-06-04 19:13:54,wallstreetbets,I'm not hating on it at all or the people that want to own it. Just taking trades as they are presented to me. If it hits $20 I will probably long it there.
2021-06-04 18:50:21,wallstreetbets,Theres a reason for that. We’re adding to our short positions. ha
2021-06-04 19:05:15,wallstreetbets,Mate they aren’t going to have the exact same trend...
2021-06-04 19:18:22,wallstreetbets,hahaha best comment I had to award you for it. lol.
2021-06-04 19:19:07,wallstreetbets,I came to a group of traders and explained what I'm doing and why. Long or short it doesn't matter. I take trades that I think are good r/R. Nothing more.
2021-06-04 18:53:09,wallstreetbets,80% of amc stock ia held by individual retail investors. What whale are you waiting for? This isn’t gamestop.
2021-06-04 18:52:53,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, GME did fall all the way back to $40. The OP didn’t say it would stay down forever just that it’s entered a bearish trend."
2021-06-04 18:02:23,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t you say the same about GameStop? But that shot up to close to 600
2021-06-04 18:02:07,wallstreetbets,"Yup, and the CEOs innovative plan to chart a new profitable future for the company was to keep giving himself bonuses and dilute the stock. It's a piggy bank, not a company with a future."
2021-06-04 17:58:17,wallstreetbets,lol no one is this sub seems to realize that. I’ve been saying this for a while. No one wants to listen

2021-06-04 17:51:12,wallstreetbets,Everybody outside the cult is shocked at that.

2021-06-04 18:30:30,wallstreetbets,The question is: will you be man enough to come here next Friday and apologize if you are wrong?
2021-06-04 19:20:43,wallstreetbets,Weeklies with IV at 350% is a very aggressive play. I'm not sure what award to give you. But you deserve one.
2021-06-04 18:31:33,wallstreetbets,"Hopefully it goes down as fast as it went up, iv crush is a bitch."
2021-06-04 17:56:57,wallstreetbets,I was honestly considering taking a long at $20. We'll see what the situation looks like next week. Selling a $20 put if you own the shares already is probably a good idea since the IV is crazy high.
2021-06-04 17:54:18,wallstreetbets,You’ll have to let us know how much you lose
2021-06-04 18:53:45,wallstreetbets,200 $10 puts for 6/25. 👌🏻

2021-06-04 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think we’re at a point where all bets are off because of the internet. Gone are the days of the ivory tower and hoarding of knowledge. Gone are the days of being safe, saving money and investing in “good” companies. The average people obtained some of the power of the exclusive, elite entities and they’re using it. It’s these apps and free trading commission."
2021-06-04 18:11:18,wallstreetbets,"It's still $250 because all the misinformation about ""the shorts covered way back in January"" is bullshit. Everyone knows they doubled down on the shorts and now they got caught with their peepee's out. We can hold longer for cheaper than they can. THAT is why it's still 250. Cuz the failed attempts to scare people out. It has nothing at all to do with fundamentals of the company or the CEO and everything to do with a fuckered up corrupt system that's being exposed. 

All we wanna do is make the richies bleed and make a little crumb money while we can. Nothing wrong with that."
2021-06-04 18:09:24,wallstreetbets,I think it's because people have faith in the company after all the changes they made that retailers want to give the company a chance to come back before the target value take a true shape.
2021-06-04 18:19:54,wallstreetbets,"It’s a ponzi play. Dummies being followed by the chronically smooth brained. They buy, paper hand a loss, give in again to fomo and lose more. Like the seasons it’s a cycle."
2021-06-04 17:58:55,wallstreetbets,I think the naked/synthetic shares cause the issue and when finally uncovered drive the price very high for a few weeks. Too much fuckery abound with how many have been created. At any rate I’m tripling my investment at this projection. It’s a managed event until they know how many synthetics are out there

2021-06-04 18:59:27,wallstreetbets,I’m shocked that this sub decided to actually pick a fucking stock for once. Everyone was all over the place. I’m glad there was a squeeze. Just sad to see all the people that are holding the bag thinking it’ll go back up to 72 again.
2021-06-04 17:52:23,wallstreetbets,I 100% understand what’s going on.. that why I said I was shocked but you’re retarded and eat crayons and don’t read. Just go back to your 🦍 and 🚀 and hope for the best.

2021-06-04 18:08:12,wallstreetbets,You mean sell a put if I **don't** own the shares already?

2021-06-04 19:02:45,wallstreetbets,I’m not worried about it. It’s just sad. Purely sad to watch people throw their savings away. I got out mid 40’s and don’t regret it cause it was profit. Was holding since 10. Saw 400% gain in 3 months. I’m fine. Just sad to see the people that think a yolo is 300 bucks when it’s at 40 a share thinking they’ll make money.

2021-06-04 19:11:30,wallstreetbets,Or they both covered and re shorted the new peaks creating higher resistance and a possible recoup of losses - only in GME there were synthetic shares cause of interest being greater than the float...  we won’t know WHAT has happened until quarterly reports or whatever

2021-06-04 19:00:41,wallstreetbets,"Despite your condescending response, you're right I confused synthetic shares and naked short selling. 

Either way they literally questioned if there were naked shorts and then proceeded to describe the process of how a naked short is created."
2021-06-04 19:13:55,wallstreetbets,"I incorrectly used the term synthetic shares when I meant naked. 

However, we don't know who and who isn't covering before the shares are lent out again. If the shares aren't confirmed to actually exist first, it's a naked short."

If these dumb fucks don’t realize that the price was 9 a share and drove it to 70 a share in a matter of a day and don’t think that was a squeeze. Y’all have fun loosing it all cause they don’t know when to leave and make money"
2021-06-04 19:10:25,wallstreetbets,"A share can be short sold and then short sold again before the first short seller covers. That is perfectly legal and not a naked short.

Eta...somebody started this nonsense about having a shareholder vote to recall shares (which can't be done), and a lot of other people have been piling onto the idea with misinformed comments about synthetic shares and naked shorts. While it has been entertaining to watch at times, it is also frustrating to watch so many people get hyped way up over misinformation about things about which they have no knowledge while pretending to be informed activists."
2021-06-04 19:04:58,wallstreetbets,His response wasn’t even condescending... I think it was just a little hard for you to admit you were wrong.

2021-06-04 19:07:15,wallstreetbets,My guess is your not seeing correctly because if it’s enough to make you sad and emotional then obviously you’re triggered or in your feelings about it but yea to each their own 🤷🏽‍♂️
2021-06-04 18:21:57,wallstreetbets,Or losing money to be fair.😂
2021-06-04 18:01:16,wallstreetbets,Tldr AMC to the moon🤌🏼
2021-06-04 18:11:04,wallstreetbets,You’re talking to the wrong crowd. There are the same people who think GME hasn’t had a squeeze yet and $400 was the actual fair market price.
2021-06-04 18:14:25,wallstreetbets,No use arguing with any ape that got a sub $10k portfolio
2021-06-04 18:29:57,wallstreetbets,I was trying to explain this to someone I work with that owns shares when it was trading in the low 60's. I was like dude you already won. The squeeze happened. Literally the biggest gain of any stock this year. At these prices if you don't take your money than new shorts will take it because opening a short when it is already trading at 60+ dollars is way more appealing then holding a short that you opened at 15 and now are fucked on. So many people think it is the same Shorts holding these positions. It's not and in theory they have to cover eventually too but you can never squeeze something to infinity unless you literally hold all the shares and call back any of the Short positions that are out there.
2021-06-04 19:15:31,wallstreetbets,"If the second person hasn't confirmed that the share exists, it's a naked short."
2021-06-04 19:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Two things here...

1. I dont know what your definition of condescending is but someone who assumes that I get all of my information from google/reddit/blogs(who reads these)/YouTube videos because I incorrectly used a term is delivering an insult. That addition to their message, just like your response to me now were unnecessary. 

2. I admitted I was wrong in the same sentence I called their response condescending. How is that hard to do?"
2021-06-04 19:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Nope, not at all. A naked short is created when the short seller short sells a share he never borrowed (or at least arranged to borrow) in the first place. But, a share can borrowed/lent and short sold multiple times in succession without the preceeding short being covered first."
2021-06-04 19:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Further to my point...i challenge you to find any regulatory definition of a naked short that supports what you are saying.

I can save you some time. You will not find it."
2021-06-04 19:24:57,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for clarifying that. Truly, bevszue you're right.

What we do have in this case whether individuals want to believe it or not are institutions selling shares that they neither own nor are they borrowing."
2021-06-04 19:26:00,wallstreetbets,Have any proof?
2021-06-04 19:30:53,wallstreetbets,"Come on, are you really asking me to prove to you that hedge funds are naked shorting stocks? You and I both know that it would be beyond stupid for HFs to make that information publicly available. Why would they?

That doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s not happening. However, it’s no secret that naked short selling has been used to completely drive companies into the ground and bankrupt them. 

We’ll see what comes out of the shareholder votes for GME on 6/9, ok? We can pick up the conversation then."
2021-06-04 19:36:55,wallstreetbets,"For the record, there are certain forms of naked shorting that are legal...for example, brokers can sell a share they don't have to keep market liquidity going. But, yeah...just because something illegal and nefarious could happen in theory doesn't mean it is, and without proof of something happening, i don't jump to conclusions that it is."
2021-06-04 19:40:15,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I read that on investopedia too, friend.

To counter your point just because there isn’t visible proof of something happening doesn’t mean that it isn’t. Naked short sellers are going to do everything they can to cover their illegal behaviors. 

People are making a bet here based on history and research. Let’s just see if it works out."

2021-06-04 17:52:40,wallstreetbets,This is a fair critique. I live in a fairly rural area with wide open roads. I truly tried to never do anything stupid to put anybody else’s life at risk other than my own. I’m a piece of shit but try not to be at other’s expense.
2021-06-04 17:54:44,wallstreetbets,"I should also add that no other people/vehicles were involved in that crash. It was just me, the open road (and trees), and half a brain."

2021-06-04 19:51:00,wallstreetbets,Somehow I had the foresight to avoid that (probably because of how much international news I consumed at the time) but had pretty much no foresight in any other area of my existence on this earth.

2021-06-04 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,The Fed was set up for continuous inflation.  The country can literally NEVER pay off it’s debt.
2021-06-04 18:30:26,wallstreetbets,"Fed will keep bond yields lower than inflation so that they do not get bankrupt. Higher inflation, higher goods prices, more earnings from taxes."
2021-06-04 18:45:32,wallstreetbets,"The treasury will not default on its obligations. Instead, the interest payment portion of the federal budget will increase, presumably while discretionary and non-discretionary continues to increase (because balancing budgets is difficult, particularly when one party refuses to consider tax increases and when social security and defense cuts would also be needed). So deficit spending would increase, even if the non interest payment portions of the budget were stabilized or cut. 

So more money in the financial system, which means inflation. 

The much less probable scenario is that eventually no one wants to buy new treasury issues. That would be a...problem."
2021-06-04 18:30:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry... why would Treasury default??? They would just print more money.  Our debt is in dollars... not Euros, Yen, Pounds, or Renembi"
2021-06-04 17:35:06,wallstreetbets,This is nonsense. You don't even understand modern monetary policy
2021-06-04 18:33:40,wallstreetbets,"You are clueless my friend. 

1. We can’t go bankrupt. That’s not a thing when you can print more money to cover debt denominated in your own currency. 

2. Hyperinflation can cause some in the public to go bankrupt, but most lacking real assets instead find themselves bartering or begging, depending how long hyperinflation lasts. 

Hyperinflation does, however, cause wealth to redistribute from savers/lenders to borrowers... a few may go bankrupt from this...it largely serves to widen inequality and redistribute wealth away from lenders to borrowers to real asset owners. Those without real assets... could go hungry, but if they could borrow, depending on the terms, they might still end up ahead.... though realistically they would have to barter/beg rather than pay in currency

Tl;dr ranches, farms, tree stands, fishing vessels and fishing rights are hedge against hyperinflation, as are foreign currency baskets and some stocks and some commodities. A dirty peg would be real estate"
2021-06-04 18:05:44,wallstreetbets,Just buy in the money put spreads on tlt
2021-06-04 17:30:31,wallstreetbets,"Ya a short position is perfect if you can get the timing right. But just like Burry you have to be ready to bleed until it hits. No one gets the timing perfect.

Maybe it crashes next month, maybe 12 months, maybe 5 years.

I’m buying physical gold and silver instead. That way I can hedge the imminent crash without having to get the timing right and without getting margin called.

Shorting may be more profitable but it can also clean your clock. I’ll stick with assets that perform well through a crash / hyperinflation / stagflation environment without having to get the timing perfect."
2021-06-04 17:37:10,wallstreetbets,This inflation is transitory 🌈🐻
2021-06-04 17:31:44,wallstreetbets,You’re correct. The Fed will choose option 2 most likely. This is why a Central Bank Digital Currency will emerge… rocky times ahead for sure.
2021-06-04 18:41:56,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry, but A: I can find absolutely zero record that Burry is betting the bond market will collapse.

B: this shows complete ignorance of how the government works. 

Currently the percent of the budget going to debt service is about 9%, which has stayed stable through the last year and a half due to us borrowing on basically 0%. That borrowing (the stimulus+infrastructure if it gets passed) will keep it’s low interest rates, and there zero indication that any government would borrow loads of money in one time projects like that during high interest rates.

Basically the treasury would have to raise interest rates to something like 35% to cause any level of government collapse.

The treasury is at literally zero risk of default.

Also there’s zero indication hyper inflation would ever happen, we *might* have 3% inflation this year, and *maybe* 3% inflation next year. Not even the most hawkish economists sincerely believe that what, new bridges will make the dollar worthless?"

2021-06-04 17:54:29,wallstreetbets,"Well you've also got to factor in China and Russia. A geopolitical expert was forecasting a couple years back at a conference that China was reroute to total collapse. So now that covid has screwed the world over and ironically with China least impacted then it has leveled the playing field economically. Now, China would love to see the dollar plummet especially since they hold most of the mined things out there...REEs in particular along with much if the medicine production. You've got Russia checking us more from a security standpoint to see what they can hack...and again hoping the dollar tumbles. Both are precious metal heavy. So we managed to get energy independent which was a major play in the world and saved us there, but now will the ridiculous fed spending and being too afraid politically to raise rates then something has gotta give. Rates shouldve gone up earlier in year...now it is past the tipping point. And the markets are moving up on better news and up on bad news...it's all set to fall a LOT...and I'm sure the shorts are positioning for it by helping to prop it up farther. The market is coming down this year and silver is skyrocketing this year for several reasons other than mentioned."

2021-06-04 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,I think shorting the dollar is a better trade or just borrow USD and invest into EM. Or just get out of USD into any other currency lol. I was thinking about it when USD/GBP was 1.21 or something a few months ago and now it's 1.4. I should've done some more research into UK cyclicals but was too lazy. Honestly should've just found a UK ETF or just put into a blue chip.

2021-06-04 18:51:44,wallstreetbets,"The issue I have with this whole inflation debate is that it's being blown way out of proportion, in comparison to the reality. CPI numbers were driven by used car sales, and to date, there haven't been any big numbers popping out to look scary. The YoY wage increase was only 2%, despite the layoffs that were seen following covid. These increases have tended to stick around 3%, so to see them fall sub par could imply that inflation is actually moving slower than expected, as companies evidently may not have the funds to support that wage increase. Just my 2c on the issue, but IMO, SPY puts are not the play right now, since for hedge funds, there isn't really anything worth being scared about.

Usually, but not always, we need a big catalyst to set things off. For 2000, that was news of Japan officially entering a recession, in 2008, it was reports of a decline in home sales and durable goods orders, stoking growth fears, for 2020, it was the fear that covid would have a bigger impact than previously thought."

2021-06-04 18:16:12,wallstreetbets,What tools? The tool they can use (which they actually just seem to have started doing today) is temporarily lowering yields by lowering the interest on bonds.

2021-06-04 18:15:07,wallstreetbets,The market did not go into recession when they raised rates. At the end of 2018 it sold off around 18%. This was like end of December. Then it came roaring back in 2019. a recession is two quarters of negative gdp growth it has nothing to do with How deep the market sells off.

If you were an idiot and had variable interest rate loans you could end up cash flow negative... but very few folks have variable debt here.... outside of credit card debt which is not secured... so sure. If you suck at negotiating credit card debit bankruptcy awaits... but there are ways to work things out without needing to go bankrupt

But again, variable rate debt is idiotic especially at this point. We’re past the bottom. If you have variable and don’t cover to fixed at this point you’re an idiot"
2021-06-04 18:03:45,wallstreetbets,The oldest trade always sees a profit increase during economic crisis's. Are there any publicly traded houses of ill repute?
2021-06-04 18:00:37,wallstreetbets,That shiny metal is a physical item that can be used to purchase those things. Can’t say the same for stocks.
2021-06-04 19:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Again, I refer you to actual examples of true hyperinflation in the past. Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Germany. Gold indeed went nuts. It is a legitimate hedge in the face of a true currency crisis. Food also went nuts. Housing not so much. When everybody is worried about their next meal it tends to eclipse all other types of spending. What good is making zillions of USD if they are effectively worth nothing? Not saying this will happen anytime soon, but it WILL happen. The trajectory of the USD is very clearly down toward zero. Someday it will get there like every other fiat currency before it."

2021-06-04 18:42:12,wallstreetbets,Delicious stimmy checks tho
2021-06-04 19:29:51,wallstreetbets,"I don't think most people understand the difference between ""inflation"" and ""hyperinflation"". It is not a matter of degree --- they are fundamentally different things. Not all ""hard assets"" scale with hyperinflation. Generally things like food and medicine do. Property does not. ""Leverage"" is not really relevant here. 

I stand by my statement. Printing more dollars does not create wealth overall. It can redistribute wealth, but the simple act of printing currency is not in itself economically productive. No real proof is needed as the truth of this should be obvious."
2021-06-04 18:22:58,wallstreetbets,"If they hadn’t reversed the hikes, it would’ve been a recession. Obviously a recession doesn’t last a couple days. The market fell more than it did the day the housing bubble popped, and the fed had to reverse the hikes the day after"
2021-06-04 18:20:54,wallstreetbets,"Wait, are you seriously implying the historic crash wasn’t due to the interest rate hike? Then why did the fed instantly reverse the hike? Why did they have to do massive QE to fix what they started? Even mainstream economists acknowledged the raise in rates as the primary factor. I mean it’s kinda obvious. 

Do you believe in the MMT religion, or?"
2021-06-04 18:18:16,wallstreetbets,"The FED can’t afford to raise rates, as the current economy is dependant on exponential amounts of debt to fund the old debt. The US can only just barely pay back bond holders as it is with interest near 0."
2021-06-04 18:30:44,wallstreetbets,If there isn’t there should be.
2021-06-04 18:30:03,wallstreetbets,Dunno. Antique stock certificates from long ago are collectible now. Back in the day when wsb was a western union service I yolo’d everything on a company run by a guy named Nicola Tesla. My loss porn was epic.

2021-06-04 18:34:58,wallstreetbets,"Because you clearly only read the news you like, have it with facts, rates were last increased in December 2018. The rate that the FED decided to cut in March 2020 was a response to the economic impact of covid. From Dec 2018 until march 2020 the rates were dropping, they just did a higher cut than before. But i guess you still live in 2018 and listen to funny stories than actual facts."

2021-06-04 17:48:31,wallstreetbets,"It’s only a loss if you sell. Yeah I wish I’d taken my 50% profit at 20 and I sure as hell wish I hadn’t bought a few more shares at 17 raising my average cost from 13.09 to 14.14, but I still think we’re going over 20 eventually.

2021-06-04 18:50:32,wallstreetbets,"With no analytical skill or DD worth mentioning, I’ve been treating it as a baby AMC- I thought 30 should have been easy and 40-50 wasn’t out of the question. I bought in at 13 and set my sell for 26. After what happened I’m a little tempted to tone down those hopes, but I do think apes are going to take another run at it. I also think this might be the one where we’re finally catching organized push back from short sellers trying to prove they can stop us by just doubling down as many times as it takes- and they just might succeed because WSB’s newfound fame and many new members do fundamentally change what this place is and how it acts- FUD could work with enough dissension in our ranks and enough green troops in our army (and from what I’m about to say, I guess I’m partially part of the problem- not as prone to back down as some but also not ready to YOLO it all and hold no matter what; I do want the money)- so on the next run I’m probably going to sell around 19, wait for the dip, and rebuy as it’s heading up again, and based on the highs and lows I’ll decide whether they’re going to successfully keep this one down or whether it’ll be as big of a disaster for the shorts as AMC- if they fight back hard enough and keep losing anyway I’ll stop thinking in terms of AMC and start thinking in terms of GME- in which case I’d sell just enough to get my original investment out and diamond hand the rest to 100s or to ruin."

Everyone then goes haw haw at BB bagholders at BB's new price of $50 that retraced back from $80 and everyone forgets the ""bagholders"" at $18 who are now your wives boyfriends.

2021-06-04 16:59:35,wallstreetbets,"BB pulling back was almost a given since it smashed through key resistance areas throughout the week with ease. A period of consolidation and pullback was expected, no? Considering it opened last week around $11. I think people pointing out the volume is generally down today is notable, but could be indicative lots of people who bought in earlier are holding. Don’t know, am smooth brain newbie, just shooting breeze and hope all apes have a good weekend."

I honestly am beginning to dislike them more than the hedgefunds, unless of course they are the hedgefunds."

2021-06-04 16:07:59,wallstreetbets,since this entire GME situation started in January there’s been an increasingly common rhetoric on here that if your stock isn’t up 50000% in a day your stock is dead lol
2021-06-04 16:16:27,wallstreetbets,"Moving CLNE AH. Just picked up another 5,000 shares. I'm ready for Monday!!"
2021-06-04 16:17:08,wallstreetbets,Holding any kind of meme stock over the weekend would give me profound anxiety. But you're all used to this aren't you.

2021-06-04 19:07:44,wallstreetbets,"In fairness, the January retardation is kinda forgivable since the high was on day 1. But in this one, everybody had the chance to make money since the rally lasted 3 or 4 days. But the greed though... Personally, I bought the 14c when the stock was 12. Sold for a 100% profit. Should I have held for 2,000% profit? Maybe. But in the end, there will be more losers than winners, just like in January, so I am ok."
2021-06-04 16:12:47,wallstreetbets,Next week let’s close amc $100+ double every week 🦍

2021-06-04 19:16:14,wallstreetbets,"I said it back in January and I'll fuckin say it again:

I'm holding BB til Christmas. Almost wish I could hide the ticker til then. EVs will boom, government security concerns will boom, and with those comes BB.

This isn't a squeeze, this isn't a failing company meme, this is and always has been a long play.

101 @9.17 not selling a single one."
2021-06-04 16:24:31,wallstreetbets,monday I gonna buy another 2000 BB stocks
2021-06-04 17:41:42,wallstreetbets,"Honestly not even sure this is the end for BB. 
AMC probably, but BB got a Big Butt"
2021-06-04 17:47:19,wallstreetbets,"#If you want to make money follow these rules 

1. Don’t get emotionally attached to any stock. Like your wife she doesn’t love you back.

2. Take profits, you might sell early but profits are profits.

3. This is not a team sport. Follow the money but get out with profits. It’s you versus the market. Nobody here is your friend. They will happily sell you a call at the very top.

4. If it looks like the trade you made is going south, just take the loss and move on. Nobody is right all the time. 

5. All the mods are gay. If they invite you round to their house on a weekend do not go. I made that mistake twice but it will not happen a third time."
2021-06-04 17:53:17,wallstreetbets,Lmaooo AMC exec sold 10k shares at $58. The execs are using some of y’all like a fucking ATM 😂
2021-06-04 17:56:24,wallstreetbets,I rather be a bag holder in BB then AMC one has potential to be the greatest cyber security company in the world and the other will probably go out of business in 10 years the choice is yours 🦍🦍🦍🍇

2021-06-04 16:23:43,wallstreetbets,"I’ve decided to go full BB and PLTR ape this month. BB is no where NEAR done. It’s just getting start. 

PLTR got amazing news as well. Invested $230 million in Babylons Health SPAC merger to go public. A great long term partnership will begin. Great things are going to come out of that. They are investing in billionaire tech company’s like Google and Intel. The CEO knows what the future holds for the company.

This month is going to be fun you apes. 👐💎 

Don’t let today get to you that much. We have the weekend now. Let’s all get high, have a drink, have happy thoughts, and be prepared for anything on Monday. 👐💎

Cheers. 🍸🍻

EDIT: Anyone curious on my PLTR and BB postions, for PLTR, I decided to switch my TSLA calls to PLTR and I averaged my calls WAY down. I have 27$ calls that were .34, now .21, and I have 35$ 6-25 calls that were .31, now .17 

I honestly think that was a good thing to do and I am looking forward to Monday. 

For BB, I got insanely lucky with 6-18 43$ calls at .14 a piece and they are worth .66 at 13.68 share price before close. My BB calls have gone parabolic, but I’m holding. I have faith. We have BB earnings on the 23rd THIS month, and I read up that the actually did well. 

I seriously can’t wait. 👐💎🍻"

2021-06-04 17:18:26,wallstreetbets,"AMC monkeys:  Hegies will continue to manipulate.  This slow bleeding after hopeful gains is all mind game tactics they play and use to convince you to sell.  The selling pressure is high - hence all the negative media articles and bashers you see.  They do this because there has been a massive inflow of new investors into AMC.  They are doing everything they can to shake them out of the tree, just like they did back in January / February / March. Hold and buy more!"

2021-06-04 19:23:56,wallstreetbets,I hope you learned your lesson everyone who downvoted me for saying the market would correct after multiple days of rocket launches. I'm as anti-🌈🐻 as anybody but it's just a fact that you don't have consecutive days of 30-100% gains without a hard correction at some point. Always have an exit strategy and use stop limits to protect your savings.

2021-06-04 16:57:59,wallstreetbets,"For all the people who are asking should you sell. Think about it like this, 90% of the stocks I've purchased in my time in the stock market have come back to my original cost basis after I sold for a loss.

This does not mean this will happen all the time and you need to take into consideration what were the circumstances when you purchased. If you purchased at the ATH during a squeeze, it is doubtful you will get out with any profit.

My main point for this post is to say, if you need the money sell, but if not, you can try holding as I've held for months until stocks have become profitable.

EDIT: Hell, I bought RBLX at IPO and rode that thing down to $60 for it to eventually become profitable around $71, then look where it is now."

BB has better underlying fundamentals than AMC. So it’s a meme stock I’m comfortable holding.

Before they knew it they were over run. Some fled (to another sub) some joined for the fear that their families wouldn't survive was too great. 

Where is WSB now that the apes have taken gates?

2021-06-04 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,People. We’ve all been fucked by believing what we were doing was actually making a difference. Education. Recycling. Scientology. Buying meme stocks. Eventually we all learn that no one is watching out for us. What we do doesn’t change the machine. All our moves are priced in. They are 12 steps ahead of our every move and profit of of every step we take. The game is rigged bc they make the rules (ie: see rh vs. gme) I may sound defeated because I am. But it hurts me to see people so passionate about something that is so controlled by someone else. Just be careful people. Sell for profit when you can. Don’t chase and never over extend yourself. FOMO and YOLO get tossed around here but for some they are real. That can lead to ROPE and that is no joke. Downvote if you want but please be careful. It’s a game until it’s not.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the price of **102.59** which gives us a total value of:

2021-06-04 19:37:07,wallstreetbets,Don't watch it AH. It moves on very low volume. The fact that it moves on low volume is kinda the point. It doesn't take a lot of buying to move the price up during the day either.

If we can learn to cut our losses quicker and thus hold lighter bags, we'll have less random ticker noise and more capital to throw at that one big play. But this won't happen on any consistent basis. WSB is the same as any other generation of market investors, except we have this incredible way to communicate like never before.

While we are talking about things not possible, maybe we can figure out a way to consistently break the HFT algos with our massive volume."

They are adding new sites every day, even in the cities that you mentioned. They want to expand coverage to every reach of the US just like they did for 4G, which requires many more sites and time.  

Of course they want to roll them out in big cities first because more customer means more money, but looking ahead 10 years, they want to have 5G in rural areas as well."

If the ladder is true, than Ericsson equipment is powering google-fi as well. If it's cheap and works well for you, than great!"

Show me any mention where it says what Nokia is providing. Trust the dude on the internet or not, but I have not seen Nokia propose on any new cell site in the past 5 years.

&#x200B;

EDIT: NOKIA is on every single site but working in conjunction with ERICSSON. Two different aspects of a cell site to accomplish the same goal."
2021-06-04 16:21:16,wallstreetbets,"That article fails to mention what Nokia is providing for T-Mobile. Check this out, pulled directly from that same article: ""It’s been widely speculated that Nokia lost a $6.6 billion 5G contract with Verizon last year when the U.S. carrier instead chose Samsung."". Verizon is not using Nokia for good reasons. and I have not seen any NOKIA on any cell site. Why would I lie?"

2021-06-04 16:29:20,wallstreetbets,"> Nokia today announced a continuation of its long standing T-Mobile partnership with a five-year deal. T-Mobile will utilize Nokia’s AirScale Radio platform to deploy an Ultra Capacity 5G layer with 2.5GHz Massive MIMO technology, shifting the Un-carrier customer experience into overdrive. Under the new agreement, Nokia will continue to expand T-Mobile’s extended range (low-band) 5G coverage. Both the extended range and Ultra Capacity enhancements will augment user experience and network capacity by leveraging T-Mobile’s multi-layer spectrum strategy.

> To support the Un-carrier’s supercharged 5G network, Nokia will supply its market-leading AirScale radio access solutions – including macro and small cells across low, mid-band and mmWave spectrum. Massive MIMO, a key 5G technology, will allow T-Mobile’s 2.5GHz mid-band spectrum to be utilized to its full potential.  Massive MIMO will boost network performance to its customers in the form of higher speeds and lower latency, further assisting T-Mobile’s home internet strategy. All of these enhanced user experiences are built upon T-Mobile’s nationwide 5G standalone network. As part of the deal, Nokia will also enable T-Mobile to upgrade its mid-band LTE network to 5G and continue to expand their extended range (low-band) 5G network.

CLNE is undervalued currently absolutely no brainer move here"

EV for delivery vehicles is just not feasible right now.

A fleet of trucks can NOT sit there for hours to recharge, and having to spend the juice to haul the HEAVY BATTERY PACKS, on top of the cargo.  

Hydrogen doesn’t have the infrastructure.  CLNE made the smart decision to build filling stations RIGHT NEXT to Amazon warehouses.  

Also, it’s much easier AND cheaper to adopt current gas engines to run natural gas...can’t say that about hydrogen nor ev.

Whether you are in it for short term swing or long term hold...it’s hard to go wrong...especially at this pps.

2021-06-04 17:40:24,wallstreetbets,"I am balls deep in CLNE. The fundamentals are good, it's a fitting play for the current political and social climate, right into the country's re-opening/infrastructure rebuild. As an energy stock it's isolated from all the international crude fuckery and big oil drama - for which I have an XLE position to take in the ass thank you very much.

RNG is pretty much the only viable green energy source for certain sectors like industrial and logistics. I don't see hydrogen ever takes off given all the technical and infrastructure challenges. Batteries are fine for consumer vehicles but not this. Plus the vast majority of world battery production will go to all the electric cars anyways.

Diesel and drilled natural gas are under immense political, social and regulatory pressure globally. But roads still need to be built, goods need to be transported. RNG is the only game in town. CLNE is really a great long term value play."

Now:

PMCC:  5C (Jan 22) and 10C (7/16).

CPS: -9 / +7 (6/18) for a whopping 80 in premium. 

If it moons, I win and close all positions for much profit. If it doesn't moon my short call will minimize my credit spread loss and I can sell more covered calls.

Community is a generic word for people in a forum with the same interests - for example trading or investing. Isn’t it?
Some people here bash each other - some mods here ban if you use the word „we“ and some ban if you don’t use the word „we“.
Very interesting. 🤷‍♂️
In fact: it’s your money, you have to decide on your own which investment you do prefer.
But there is no reason for a user to fight against another one. Let everybody do his thing. Everybody wants to reach a personal goal in live. If there is a question and someone with knowledge helps the other one, they act „together“ - with help, they help together. But everyone trades for his own."
2021-06-04 15:23:46,wallstreetbets,True if everyone who got into bb went into amc we would’ve been 100+ buy now
2021-06-04 19:21:44,wallstreetbets,How about BB? Is not that high after today and is the most popular in this subreddit right now. I feel if we all jump right now it would be a good run. The problem is getting everyone onboard haha.

2021-06-04 18:26:43,wallstreetbets,"I was already somewhat in, but I went all in on AMC today. All in for me is only like $3k, but still. We'll see if I'm a dumb ape or a lucky ape!"

2021-06-04 18:29:11,wallstreetbets,"Instead of diamond handing it, wouldn’t it have been better to sell when the stock was going up and bought during a dip instead?"
2021-06-04 15:36:23,wallstreetbets,this
2021-06-04 18:49:28,wallstreetbets,"Listen to this guy right here! He knows his shit, started posting 7 hours ago!"

2021-06-04 16:59:51,wallstreetbets,Lol so the stock up 50% over the last month is “dead” and is worth more than all other stocks listed combined lol ok. People are just able to afford BB

2021-06-04 15:28:46,wallstreetbets,Whoa whoa make room for my boy CLNE
2021-06-04 16:24:08,wallstreetbets,BB
2021-06-04 17:59:03,wallstreetbets,It happened just as I sold and rolled into BB. You're welcome 😂
2021-06-04 16:33:55,wallstreetbets,SNDL TO THE MOOOOON
2021-06-04 16:34:09,wallstreetbets,I'm here for you
2021-06-04 16:33:37,wallstreetbets,SNDL TO THE MOOOOON
2021-06-04 18:23:12,wallstreetbets,My goal is to make money...
2021-06-04 16:28:40,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-04 15:32:56,wallstreetbets,It would be wiser to move in to a cheaper stock to move more volume.
2021-06-04 19:08:49,wallstreetbets,Yeah and then most of those people would lose money when the smart ones start dumping
2021-06-04 16:04:38,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-04 19:15:18,wallstreetbets,not when the AMC CEO is trying to eat your tendies
2021-06-04 18:03:42,wallstreetbets,True but I have a conspiracy theory on BB is being pushed by hedge funds. Found some generic accounts all made within 115-140 days all pushing BB. That was the time frame Hedgefunds started creating accounts and when wsb had mod issues. I really think BB is a trap. Just a conspiracy at the moment but trying to dig deeper.
2021-06-04 16:29:01,wallstreetbets,"NOK is garbage

WKHS instead"
2021-06-04 19:33:41,wallstreetbets,How in the world would GME not be included?
2021-06-04 17:24:49,wallstreetbets,What did you use to drug your feet? Asking for a friend...

2021-06-04 16:42:35,wallstreetbets,"And this still would be cheap. I thought about 200$ would be fair. Well, look at apple, amazon, microsoft and so on. Each with over 1000 billion market cap. And with inflation they’ll increase. Look at the market cap of BB (even if it was 50$ a share) - it’s a joke. We talk about THE security provider of EV, space vehicles, medical devices and so on. It’s like iOS/android for the whole industry.
TSLA gained long time before selling any car and it gained and gained.
Spacex and NASA use QNX and nobody talkes about it. If even elon musk trusts it, it can’t be so bad. A rocket is more complex than a car.

*only my opinion, not a financial advise"
2021-06-04 17:59:01,wallstreetbets,CLNE is under $10

2021-06-04 17:47:16,wallstreetbets,Or maybe NOK ?
2021-06-04 18:53:54,wallstreetbets,BB still has decent fundamentals and is in a progressive industry. They're next earning report should be interesting

2021-06-04 16:08:16,wallstreetbets,Well day is over but probably doing to jump on CLNE on Monday seems like a good prospect.

2021-06-04 16:31:54,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is about a gamma squeeze, not short squeeze. It has a fixed date and price. Do you have the date and price of the WKHS squeeze? People are still holding GME, do you think everyone will jump from GME and AMC over to WKHS and squeeze it as well? They are going to be holding AMC for months.

CLNE is 6/18, get your dirty dick beaters all over it and toss the spunk into WKHS after if you still want."

2021-06-04 17:48:20,wallstreetbets,This is respectable
2021-06-04 16:48:39,wallstreetbets,I hate you and all your gains. grats
2021-06-04 16:54:54,wallstreetbets,"I doubled down on $NVDA shares on earnings day when the stock was red despite only good news.

I kinda wish I had bought calls instead of shares but I'm still super happy with the gains"

2021-06-04 16:56:04,wallstreetbets,A win is a win my man. Any green is better than red
2021-06-04 15:23:31,wallstreetbets,Not in my story! Haha
2021-06-04 19:52:42,wallstreetbets,Are you describing me as a person or my NVDA play? Applies to both
2021-06-04 15:21:48,wallstreetbets,Nope. All out of the money or at the money when purchased. Mostly ATM except for the LEAPs
2021-06-04 19:51:41,wallstreetbets,"There will be gut wrenching dips, without a doubt, but longterm this stock is up and to the right. Multiple is sky high, but earnings growth is the key to look at with NVDA. If the ARM acquisition actually goes thru (I’m skeptical) this thing will skyrocket"
2021-06-04 17:19:35,wallstreetbets,"yessir, can't complain about 619->703 in less than a week"
2021-06-04 18:59:13,wallstreetbets,"Except, if it is blood."
2021-06-04 15:26:41,wallstreetbets,"So some were pre ER? Looking at the ones that cost 2K+

But whatever - seriously, excellent trades here. Not just profit wise but spacing out strikes/dates as the momentum took hold, and sitting tight while it all played out. This should be in some kind of WSB textbook."
2021-06-04 15:30:47,wallstreetbets,I believe they were all pre ER except the 640
2021-06-04 15:33:29,wallstreetbets,"The IV crush and limp movement post ER had to be a tough hold, but after last Friday you knew it was back on. I pulled down some good $ (for me) off NVDA this week too. Love to see someone put some real $ behind it."

2021-06-04 15:17:55,wallstreetbets,Why do you think I’m buying calls for workhorse
2021-06-04 16:08:55,wallstreetbets,Truth!
2021-06-04 15:38:30,wallstreetbets,I would say the AMC people are crying more
2021-06-04 17:34:46,wallstreetbets,"No, we do what we did with AMC. We got majority, we hold. We don't sell AMC. We liquidate other assets for the next company we decide to gain majority. Focus our efforts and don't dilute our collective buying power. We just need to agree because we are basically working like a co op. We all got skin in it."
2021-06-04 15:31:58,wallstreetbets,So you can be more poor and dumb

2021-06-04 15:23:55,wallstreetbets,Are you a bot? 99% of your comments are this exact thing.

2021-06-04 15:02:56,wallstreetbets,"If the price doesn’t seem to go up in the short term, BB still has great potential in the next couple of years"
2021-06-04 15:06:15,wallstreetbets,Relax and dont panic. I'm 4K down. Have faith and keep BBing
2021-06-04 15:27:58,wallstreetbets,"Hey, just stay calm and hold. Next week it should be jumping up a good bit"
2021-06-04 16:02:02,wallstreetbets,"Average down, buy at a discount!"
2021-06-04 15:50:17,wallstreetbets,You gotta keep in mind that there are a lot of people who bought a while back in the first jump and are wanting to now offload that. If people keep buying it'll go up next week for sure once those bag holders are all done selling.
2021-06-04 16:45:35,wallstreetbets,Your app is broken. Just uninstall it for a couple of weeks while they upgrade.

2021-06-04 15:09:37,wallstreetbets,Enbridge (ENB) is the best play on this in my opinion. Up 16% ytd. Plus 7.2% dividend. Great stock.

2021-06-04 15:16:34,wallstreetbets,CLNE is the way
2021-06-04 16:04:44,wallstreetbets, CLNE 💎🚀
2021-06-04 16:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Also consistent dividend growth, y.o.y"
2021-06-04 15:12:19,wallstreetbets,Personally the small caps are supplying my meme stock yolos. Made a fortune off Nuvista (208% ytd) sold a little bit and dumped into meme stocks
2021-06-04 15:37:12,wallstreetbets,clne might actually maga lil bit.
2021-06-04 14:39:39,wallstreetbets,"When did you buy and at what price, that doesn't sound right lol"
2021-06-04 14:48:23,wallstreetbets,It only listed June 3
2021-06-04 15:01:29,wallstreetbets,"TC, u nut bought LUCKIN coffee! that company is as good as Martin Shkreli!"
2021-06-04 14:56:49,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-04 14:49:40,wallstreetbets,"Go away. No one, literally less than no one, cares."
2021-06-04 14:44:57,wallstreetbets,He mustve transferred brokerages because it's not showing a cost basis at all. Which also means the % is false because it's factoring the % as if the stock was free
2021-06-04 15:03:04,wallstreetbets,"MRK spun off a few branches and IPs into a different company and called it OGN. 

That's why it suddenly appeared in my brokerage today. I got it for free or for pennies so that's why the gains are so massive. I bought MRK because it bought out another company I held ticker: PAND. I used the funds from that to buy MRK."
2021-06-04 15:40:38,wallstreetbets,Bruh. That's just my IRA/trade account. My main  account has like +$15K in Luckin at around $3-4. It was the easiest pickup. Wish I had the balls to go all in on call options when it was $1-2.
2021-06-04 15:00:56,wallstreetbets,Salty boi
2021-06-04 14:51:09,wallstreetbets,I think it’s listing the stock under the covers as like .01 or something to prevent dividing by zero.
2021-06-04 15:07:21,wallstreetbets,"About what? Their 10 shares not possibly making 170,000% profit? So salty.

It's also not nearly enough to be posted as a gain."
2021-06-04 15:34:21,wallstreetbets,"... its 170,000% GAIN"
2021-06-04 16:18:41,wallstreetbets,"First off, gain is profit. They are litetally synonyms.

Second gain submissions require gains of 25k on stocks."
2021-06-04 17:29:57,wallstreetbets,If you wrote yesterday why are you posting it again today? Give me the TL;DR on what dramatic change happened
2021-06-04 15:31:17,wallstreetbets,Been in CRSR since day 1. Its clearly being manipulated in my own retarded opinion. Someone does not want us to see what's behind the $35 door. Lets open it. not advice do your own dd
2021-06-04 15:06:52,wallstreetbets,CRSR has been sideways for a long time. Company fundamentals are solid and it’s definitely solid long. Doesn’t seem to be the buying pressure on it. Will see where it’s at on 18/6!
2021-06-04 17:28:17,wallstreetbets,Been following CRSR stock for a few months now and I can confidently say this is going to be a huge play. What you are implying is very likely imho
2021-06-04 14:50:40,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I's got two of the $50 8/20 calls as well. Bought 'em yesterday at .39."
2021-06-04 15:34:37,wallstreetbets,I keep buying shares on discount. Always tempted to sell when it's up +1 or +2 but I don't want to miss the time where it actually breaks the pattern.
2021-06-04 15:14:58,wallstreetbets,"Just posted that I would love to see what full blown retail / ape madness would do to this stock, I don't have any shares but it's so blatant the nonsense that is pulled with this shit lmao, the chart is theta gangs wet dream"
2021-06-04 18:03:01,wallstreetbets,Come save me at $37!
2021-06-04 14:46:00,wallstreetbets,8/20 Calls lets gooo 🚀
2021-06-04 15:50:12,wallstreetbets,In CRSR since the Q1 earnings.
2021-06-04 18:48:54,wallstreetbets,I'm holding CRSR out of pure spite right now
2021-06-04 16:03:04,wallstreetbets,Very tempted to buy some calls few months out since it’s such a low price
2021-06-04 15:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Wish it had better option chains , selling covered calls can be a hassle"
2021-06-04 17:59:18,wallstreetbets,"Couldn’t have said it better myself… huge opportunity here. This stock has it all… the manipulation, the fundamentals, and the technicals to make a big break."
2021-06-04 15:01:24,wallstreetbets,Bought 250k worth of shares a week ago. It will explode soon
2021-06-04 15:17:44,wallstreetbets,I.m in this for almost 6 months and its going sideways... For a company with good financials it is dooing poorly i have 100 shares @36 but feels like a waste of time past months
2021-06-04 15:33:11,wallstreetbets,I am in 7/16 35c. Hope it goes to the moon.
2021-06-04 17:00:32,wallstreetbets,"I made money on July 35cs today. Traded sideways or down all day but still managed to make a profit as value increased due to IV.

Didn't want to hold them over the weekend on margin so I sold at close, but I still have my shares."
2021-06-04 14:50:15,wallstreetbets,Every stock someone posts about here is “the most undervalued & manipulated company” 🤣
2021-06-04 19:21:49,wallstreetbets,Lol u only have 10 shares
2021-06-04 18:14:36,wallstreetbets,Dramatic volume increase today on big price drop. Every time it hits 35 it always drops sharply. 4 months in a row now but much more dramatic volume today.
2021-06-04 17:57:05,wallstreetbets,The price manipulation hit a new level of obvious it should stay. They updated it with today’s price action
2021-06-04 15:42:39,wallstreetbets,"Retard together stronk❗❗❗ 35 is just the beginning  


🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-04 16:03:40,wallstreetbets,"Question, I want to get into options but I’m scared because from what I understood buying calls meant you’d have to buy like 100 shares. When you say you bought 2 calls at $50 does that mean your maximum risk would be $100(plus whatever the premium is to buy them)?"
2021-06-04 16:48:41,wallstreetbets,Buy calls. I’ve noticed that it goes in a same pattern
2021-06-04 15:19:48,wallstreetbets,"Kind of crazy its been so ignored...popular gaming company with rockstar financials getting played like a fiddle by hedge fund bears. /r/crsr has been tracking the bullshit for months.   


If theres ever a David v Goliath case this is it"
2021-06-04 16:31:38,wallstreetbets,Why this doesn't have weeklies?
2021-06-04 15:26:39,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-06-04 17:56:41,wallstreetbets,Does it make sense to buy calls on Monday since the  dropped
2021-06-04 14:51:48,wallstreetbets,Check the financials then look at the chart.
2021-06-04 14:53:13,wallstreetbets,"This place should be renamed ""wallstreetsqueeze"".

Edit: Even though I came in during the gme craze, there were still decent and varied DD around. Now it's just, ""This is shorted! Squeeze!"", like it's some lemonade stand ran by down syndrome adults."
2021-06-04 18:01:00,wallstreetbets,You have no clue what you are talking about.
2021-06-04 16:10:37,wallstreetbets,"No, it's the right to buy. Selling puts obligates you to buy shares if they expire itm"
2021-06-04 18:29:16,wallstreetbets,"Option buyers have the option to buy or sell at the strike.

Option sellers have the obligation to buy or sell shares at the strike.

Your own risk to buying a call is the premium. That's all you can lose. Most people buy contracts and wait for the price to go up, then sell them. There's no need to buy shares."
2021-06-04 16:40:18,wallstreetbets,"exactly. I have only one leap currently, but I've just been swinging long calls each time it hits $31 and then ride it back to $35. If there was one stock to focus the collective retail madness of WSB to fuck over hedge funds, CRSR absolutely fits the bill."
2021-06-04 15:28:33,wallstreetbets,Dont be salty lol
2021-06-04 14:52:48,wallstreetbets,Nah I’m good lol. Best of luck ya retard may the tendie man bless you
2021-06-04 18:23:53,wallstreetbets,"I swear to god ""short squeeze"" is the most annoying and overused fucking buzzword since ""Socialism"""

2021-06-04 15:31:49,wallstreetbets,"Why would I be salty when I bought 5 million worth of shares in CRSR? We’re in this together with your $250k shares and this fagguette’s awesome dd, ape strong"
2021-06-04 14:56:42,wallstreetbets,"Is that like the tooth fairy, but they take options instead of teeth?"
2021-06-04 19:53:30,wallstreetbets,That's funny
2021-06-04 15:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Bought another 100 today.  Averaged down to $8 from $11.40, now Im averaging up. 🦧👍"

2021-06-04 15:04:03,wallstreetbets,Haha same here. Got 10 contracts for October

2021-06-04 18:57:02,wallstreetbets,"That makes sense, thank you for the clarification"
2021-06-04 17:38:50,wallstreetbets,"I can say, right off, that nothing will come off that shareholder lawsuit. The bar is so so high, and it was reasonable for him to forecast normal steel prices as opposed to the insanity here. 

For them to win a court would have to find they didn't act in good faith, and they exercised a level of care and judgement that a reasonably prudent person wouldn't have used, nor they they act with the reasonable belief that the director or board was acting in the best interests of the corporation. 

Again, it's frivolous, and it has no merit. But shareholders just love to throw them around."
2021-06-04 14:37:30,wallstreetbets,"I yolod 1400 on WKHS 6/4 calls earlier this week, it instantly went up like $1000 then dove to a pile of shit."
2021-06-04 14:45:17,wallstreetbets,U know the people in this sub are dumb af when they are tripping about robin hood more than op putting his whole portfolio in a dumb ass stock.
2021-06-04 14:57:49,wallstreetbets,Start buying weed with the remaining monies and try to make it back. Not financial advice.
2021-06-04 15:55:37,wallstreetbets,You're joking right? If you're being serious I would strongly advise against this type of degen gambling.
2021-06-04 14:36:39,wallstreetbets,You’re still using RobinHood??😰
2021-06-04 14:39:32,wallstreetbets,"Stop using Robinhood bruv. But gl on TLRY. My wife, my bruv, and myself have position"
2021-06-04 14:36:29,wallstreetbets,why so confident in this xannabis stoxk
2021-06-04 17:56:53,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know what you are doing gambling all your money away. With careful planning, frequent contributions and disciplined investing you can grow to hundreds of thousands of dollars in a few years. 

There is no future in this if you are throwing all your money and see what sticks."
2021-06-04 14:52:51,wallstreetbets,If you did it earlier this week there’s no way you weren’t up 500-1000% yesterday?
2021-06-04 16:48:08,wallstreetbets,imagine yolo'ing everything into a weed stock no one has ever heard of and then doubling down when it goes to shit. OP you gotta learn to cut your losses sometimes
2021-06-04 14:49:16,wallstreetbets,I took some shares. Now im smoking the shit out of it to give their next earnings report a boost
2021-06-04 14:37:18,wallstreetbets,Cause weed funni 🤣🤣🤣🤣
2021-06-04 14:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Shit I had it messed up, I bought them yesterday in the middle of the spike. Caught the tail end of the boost up then it crashed"
2021-06-04 17:35:22,wallstreetbets,Cringe boomer
2021-06-04 14:39:09,wallstreetbets,"Eh im serious, are they expanding. ? Or what i dont see much hype.on it as of now ! but ill maybe buy 1 share and see"
2021-06-04 16:46:40,wallstreetbets,thats called fomo'ing and its the best way to lose all your money
2021-06-04 17:41:17,wallstreetbets,imagine buying into tesla at $877 lmao
2021-06-04 14:40:07,wallstreetbets,"It would be a good play if the cannabis market expands into the eastern coast. Until then, a gamble is a gamble"
2021-06-04 14:41:39,wallstreetbets,"No, its just one of the few weed stocks on robinhood. Its Canadian too. Its like when mindmed went public, they used mushrooms or some shit. Its all just Distraction from real expanding companies Like Gamestop."
2021-06-04 17:09:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah I learned a lot of lessons this week. Most notably that losing money is way worse than not gaining money. I got emotional yesterday watching my whole portfolio sit there doing nothing and let myself make a call I knew was bad. Shit happens and I am still in the game. Hopefully next week will be kinder to what I'm holding.
2021-06-04 17:42:04,wallstreetbets,Imagine NOT buying into Tesla at $877
2021-06-04 14:53:02,wallstreetbets,"Yes, exactly like the overblown massively expanding company GameStop."
2021-06-04 17:28:45,wallstreetbets,"yeah, knowing when to take your profits is one of the hardest parts! you'd think doubling your money would be good enough but if you sit on WSB you start listening to these delusional people who think (for example) GME will go to 69k per share and shit. or even 1k"
2021-06-04 17:53:28,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I’m imagining that, now what? Should I cry about not having -$250 per share?"
2021-06-04 17:53:10,wallstreetbets,"seriously hilarious man, you should make a post of that. youd get a lot of karma because thats literally one of the worst calls ive ever seen on here lmao"
2021-06-04 17:43:28,wallstreetbets,Are they genuinely serious about that? Do market caps mean nothing to them?
2021-06-04 17:54:50,wallstreetbets,Holy shit take a joke my guy
2021-06-04 17:56:09,wallstreetbets,Definitely don’t ever go into comedy my guy
2021-06-04 17:47:07,wallstreetbets,"it blows my fucking mind how many honestly do believe that. im sure its perpetuated by greasers who want to be the lesser fool and make everyone else hold the bag, but its wild that so many people seriously think that has a basis in reality"
2021-06-04 18:00:07,wallstreetbets,"? uhh what lol that wasnt a joke, im serious. youre the one thats hilarious, and showing that price entry would for real get a lot of upvotes. you seem to be having trouble following a simple conversation.. definitely dont go into day trading tho lol whew"
2021-06-04 18:01:31,wallstreetbets,"I really hoped it was a joke but I think (especially the younger ones) are so uneducated on this stuff that they don't understand. I shouldn't judge too hard, I've made enough of my own mistakes though."
2021-06-04 18:12:37,wallstreetbets,Man you really know how to kill the vibe around here
2021-06-04 18:21:54,wallstreetbets,aww guess you didnt expect to expose yourself as a complete smooth brain when you posted your little comment huh? ok i promise not to make you any more butt hurt if you tell me what price you panic sold at
2021-06-04 18:24:31,wallstreetbets,I’ve been buying Tesla for years lmfao you’re the smooth brain for thinking I went all in at $877 so calm yourself buddy
2021-06-04 18:30:56,wallstreetbets,lol suuuuure.. you just felt like averaging up as much as physically possible then eh? genius! weird that you posted about holding the bag at $877 ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm) ill TRY to calm down but no promises! shit is hilarious
2021-06-04 18:34:36,wallstreetbets,Ever heard of a scheduled recurring investment? Lmfao now pls don’t reply to this I’m so bored of this conversation
2021-06-04 19:08:40,wallstreetbets,Lol you really should be a comedian if you think I’m taking stock advice from Mr. 877
2021-06-04 19:59:11,wallstreetbets,"This was fun. 

A guy came to r/Wallstreetbets and is arguing with someone about giving legitimate stock advice.

I have to say I took a break from this sub for awhile after the GME run sucked the fun out of it...sure is nice to see I came back to a whole new world of entertainment with someone like you making a parody of yourself. 

I expect Sunday you're going to walk into a church and discuss the benifits of premarital sex, probably be equally confused about the luke warm reception you get there."
2021-06-04 14:38:46,wallstreetbets,I like that MVIS waited for my options to expire and for me to sell out to move on to BB to do a run up.
2021-06-04 15:47:34,wallstreetbets,Wtf is OP trying to hide from us?
2021-06-04 18:17:53,wallstreetbets,Posabit systems
2021-06-04 14:55:24,wallstreetbets,The whale is in... Let's run it.
2021-06-04 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,Mvis short selling has been restricted by Jefferies as of yesterday.
2021-06-04 14:36:22,wallstreetbets,Bought July 2 $18’s yesterday and sold them today
2021-06-04 14:37:59,wallstreetbets,Hell no I didn't sell. Target is $25 for the day.
2021-06-04 15:10:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah this hurts.   Still faithful.  I'm already this deep.    Good news is if whale buys in I have shit tons of calls that should cause some intense Gamma.
2021-06-04 15:11:04,wallstreetbets,Same brother shorts power is almost to strong .... would own a lambo if i join the shorts... ill die poor fighting ... us two musketeers besides if we do t give shorts our  tendies  how they gonna eat?
2021-06-04 15:13:24,wallstreetbets,It's about rage in here.
2021-06-04 15:14:12,wallstreetbets,My brain hurts
2021-06-04 14:46:16,wallstreetbets,Well.  I have hope a whale comes in and saves me because I'm holding out. It feels right.
2021-06-04 14:31:01,wallstreetbets,Nope.  I’m not
2021-06-04 14:59:08,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding on for months and was starting to think it was a loss but today saved my ass - out at a profit and staying the fuck away from this one.
2021-06-04 14:37:18,wallstreetbets,Did you sell? I really hope you sold at the top.
2021-06-04 15:57:47,wallstreetbets,+1 for using a proper trading platform. Best of luck 🐂
2021-06-04 15:11:40,wallstreetbets,It looks like it's happening
2021-06-04 15:15:14,wallstreetbets,Shit my soul hurts.     Something about diamond handing 0DTE calls with my entire portfolio felt right today
2021-06-04 15:13:09,wallstreetbets,Haha now get back in here for the sale out date ........ zzzzz.......zzzzzzz........zzzzzz.......buy more for the shorts need tendies!!!!!!!!!!!!!
2021-06-04 14:38:19,wallstreetbets,No sir
2021-06-04 17:47:51,wallstreetbets,what was the end result? i see most of your calls ended in the money
2021-06-04 14:39:46,wallstreetbets,So from this screenshot you are down how much potential profit currently? Between 2-3k?
2021-06-04 18:07:39,wallstreetbets,So...   I would have made out like a bandit. But at some point TDA sold my contracts. Well before I would have sold them.  Cost me about $10k at least
2021-06-04 14:41:23,wallstreetbets,My portfolio was up to 90k at the peak. Currently sitting at $35k.
2021-06-04 19:18:59,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the lesson anyway!
2021-06-04 14:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Ouch. Profit is profit though, so can't dwell. Good luck and don't let time decay kill too much more profit!"
2021-06-04 17:32:29,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it went from 4 to 5 since March-ish, so it's a 25% gain. It's not moon, but it's nothing to sneeze at either."
2021-06-04 14:32:45,wallstreetbets,Stop trying to make Fetch happen. It’s not gonna happen.
2021-06-04 16:29:24,wallstreetbets,Why are you so salty about NOK?
2021-06-04 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,Nok for me
2021-06-04 18:14:07,wallstreetbets,Check out Jan. 2022 and Jan. 2023 calls open interest.  Smart money would disagree with you.
2021-06-04 15:03:14,wallstreetbets,Made 500$ on a day trade. And own a few leaps so nok has done me solid
2021-06-04 14:50:01,wallstreetbets,"So anything not a squeeze of a dying business isn’t a “play” got it.

God I hate making easy money of non plays"
2021-06-04 17:18:50,wallstreetbets,Your not mentioning that the US has basically banned all the main (Chinese) 5G competition
2021-06-04 17:30:25,wallstreetbets,NOK is up over 40% YTD. You literally have zero clue as to what you’re talking about. Distracting from the “real plays”? Sounds like you’re a bag holder on meme stocks.
2021-06-04 17:25:47,wallstreetbets,Nokia to the 🌑
2021-06-04 16:09:23,wallstreetbets,I have never lost money on NOK. Can’t say the say the same for the other meme stocks trading at 5x their fair value that you for some reason think are a better buy
2021-06-04 19:09:12,wallstreetbets,It jumped like 10% after its quarterly. I'm up like 25% overall on it. Plus it does have the potential to rocket.  I also don't see it going tits up anytime soon.
2021-06-04 15:06:15,wallstreetbets,"Easily a 10 to 12$ stock down the road ! They have a lot of contracts in place, it will take time but it’s definitely undervalued at 5.50$"
2021-06-04 16:01:36,wallstreetbets,"I mean if you bought back in January or March and held, that's a nice 35-45% gain. Not much by WSB standards of course, but nothing to sneeze at. Not one I'd get into today though."
2021-06-04 18:19:52,wallstreetbets,So... NOK to the moon?
2021-06-04 14:31:04,wallstreetbets,It’s a safe play compared to all the yolos. You have a low chance of losing money.
2021-06-04 17:43:50,wallstreetbets,"I just made a 300% profit on my calls and it’s up 26% this year but go off. 

(And by “go off” I mean stop making investment decisions based on short squeeze fantasies you little weirdo)"
2021-06-04 19:48:25,wallstreetbets,I’m up 170% since April on nok options. Speak for yourself.
2021-06-04 18:05:55,wallstreetbets,Sold 10 calls for Jan 2022 for a nice profit last week. 💰⬆️
2021-06-04 15:54:25,wallstreetbets,i got some 6 and 7 dollar calls hoping the apes here and get me some tendies. heck yeak NOK smoothbrains
2021-06-04 15:52:45,wallstreetbets,"This article just came out today

https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/topstocks/nokia-stock-is-finally-getting-the-5g-wings-it-has-been-waiting-for/ar-AAKHspC"
2021-06-04 16:13:19,wallstreetbets,A month back most people said it would stay at $4 permanently.
2021-06-04 14:37:13,wallstreetbets,NOK rules
2021-06-04 14:52:43,wallstreetbets,I own NOK but it's definitely a non mover. It shouldn't even be mentioned with the other meme stocks. One its not a pile of crap like the others and two it has next to zero chance to moon. I wish things were different but you would be lucky if this just keeps up with the index.
2021-06-04 14:46:09,wallstreetbets,It will definitely be a while for nok.
2021-06-04 14:31:30,wallstreetbets,YES these bag holders are just pissed they fucked up
2021-06-04 15:10:30,wallstreetbets,Apes & stock market irrational. Expect the unexpected.
2021-06-04 18:31:14,wallstreetbets,"How about you make the case for the stonks you want people to buy instead of bitching about NOK?

Let the market decide, rather than trying to work the refs."
2021-06-04 14:35:21,wallstreetbets,"Sound like a bag holder or someone sold at a loss, or fommed last time around. I Agree it is not a squeeze play, but there are some gains to be made by the end of the year."
2021-06-04 15:59:10,wallstreetbets,It costs nothing to hold nok... it also cost nothing to avoid buying nok. Choose wisely
2021-06-04 14:39:31,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 17:37:47,wallstreetbets,You meme it's NOK gonna do anything...
2021-06-04 15:12:36,wallstreetbets,Same for BB.
2021-06-04 14:34:50,wallstreetbets,People who bought it are posting NOK so it looks popular. That stock is kinda duuduu. BB and AMC all da way!
2021-06-04 18:45:03,wallstreetbets,$BB WILL HAPPEN THO
2021-06-04 14:57:23,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 15:58:12,wallstreetbets,AMC is a whole different story😎
2021-06-04 17:41:06,wallstreetbets,"agreed, just look how many shares there are its insane"
2021-06-04 18:25:35,wallstreetbets,But what about $COK?
2021-06-04 14:39:44,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget, its a Nordic company. No share buybacks, no dividends. CEO would much rather hire more employees/juice up the pension than boost investor return."
2021-06-04 15:17:31,wallstreetbets,I just don't like the stock. The executives scream toxic dinosaurs to me.
2021-06-04 16:03:53,wallstreetbets,same song over at Blackberry
2021-06-04 19:53:21,wallstreetbets,"NOK bag holders keep trying to offload their bags on the new peasants.

NOK is dead and will stay dead. Dont fall for this literal meme stock"
2021-06-04 14:39:12,wallstreetbets,Squeeze wkhs instead
2021-06-04 19:17:28,wallstreetbets,40% YTD. Nasdaq is at gains of 7.19% YTD. CLOV is at -46.33% YTD. Apparently people on this sub are only allowed to like the stocks and plays OP likes. What a prick.
2021-06-04 16:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Get in loser, we're going gambling."
2021-06-04 16:33:40,wallstreetbets,"I’m not. Actually, I made $40,000 on NOK in one day during the first great meme stock rising. But it wasn’t because NOK was great, it’s because the IV is so ridiculous low on its options that a big jump can make a lot of money for options holders even if the underlying asset barely moves. But that only benefits a very few lucky people like myself at the time. And the people that are claiming it’s going to moon are ridiculous. It’s not an investment, it’s not going to moon, the only way to make money off NOO is off lucky short-dated options, otherwise NOK is just a checking account to hold your money in that doesn’t provide interest."
2021-06-04 15:10:00,wallstreetbets,My Nokia options for 5$ sept calls were up 170% Nothing wrong with that !
2021-06-04 16:39:11,wallstreetbets,*barren wuffet has entered the chat*
2021-06-04 17:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, idiots acting like every meme stock that they bandwagon on is going to be a short squeeze even if it’s barely shorted."
2021-06-04 15:54:01,wallstreetbets,What market cap do you think NOK can achieve?
2021-06-04 17:33:45,wallstreetbets,Woah! 40% YTD! That’s so much! Oh wait this was trading for $6.60 a share in 2019. And 5.50 a share in 2011. This is a horrible stock and cherry picking timeframes doesn’t change that 🤡
2021-06-04 16:52:36,wallstreetbets,never made any money of NOK either did ya? and people like meme stocks because they can yolo 10k and turn it into 200k by making a DD and getting people like you to fomo buy in on the day that its already run up
2021-06-04 18:02:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I got in at 3.93 in March.  Wasn't expecting a Moonshot but felt it was undervalued.   Looking good so far."
2021-06-04 16:55:08,wallstreetbets,damn yeah or you couldve bought any of the meme stocks at that time and made 2000% gains
2021-06-04 14:31:30,wallstreetbets,And little chance of making anything. Outside of the dividend. Might as well buy a bond.
2021-06-04 17:47:34,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 16:52:54,wallstreetbets,Same and those 7$c are already in the green! Or should I say finally lol
2021-06-04 16:14:10,wallstreetbets,And in fall of 2011 people said Nokia would rebound from $5.50/share but here we are
2021-06-04 16:40:30,wallstreetbets,NOK is for the cousin fucking hillbillies that are entertained by the likes of paper Dave and miscellaneous podcast drama
2021-06-04 17:34:07,wallstreetbets,NOK is up 40% YTD. Nasdaq is up 7.19% YTD. I guess that’s “barely keeping up.”
2021-06-04 16:27:22,wallstreetbets,This week was a great opportunity to sell OTM CC.
2021-06-04 14:51:08,wallstreetbets,"there is no bag holders, it hasnt gotten anywhere to where you would be holding a huge loss"
2021-06-04 16:53:36,wallstreetbets,how could you have a bag when its traded sideways for 10 years
2021-06-04 15:59:56,wallstreetbets,It also gains nothing holding NOK
2021-06-04 15:00:18,wallstreetbets,"I think OP doesn’t mean this. NOK makes sense with the fundamentals. 

But I think some people here are posting threads on NOK thinking that they can get some action like GME in Jan or AMC now. 

Problem is, OP is right. NOK is hard to move. No volatility, low short interest, huge market cap and all these things."
2021-06-04 15:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Translation: “I got stuck holding the wrong bag, please come pick me up!”"
2021-06-04 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, great technicals. Like trading sideways for 10 years"
2021-06-04 14:36:19,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. At least pick something exciting. Its 10 year stock chart is a flat line sideways. I like AMC, BB, and CLOV."
2021-06-04 18:20:13,wallstreetbets,"Dang, more bags to add to my collection. So no lambo?"
2021-06-04 15:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. And the people who say “NOK is an investment!!!1” yeah, how’s that 10 year return of -1.83% treating you. Ridiculous"
2021-06-04 17:44:05,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy’s..."
2021-06-04 16:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Fair opinion! You see: stocks go up, down or move sideways. What’s the big deal? Do I go about doing a “*it’s not going to do anything”* post on WSB for every stock that doesn’t move to my liking?

📢 let me ask you: are you going to eat crayons 🖍 and post it on WSB if NOK indeed does moon gradually?"
2021-06-04 19:35:59,wallstreetbets,"Did the same. Bought ridiculously cheap options at around 0.20 , October calls, am in the money now plus have a healthy return"
2021-06-04 17:34:59,wallstreetbets,"Considering 500$ is 10% of my portfolio, I’d say a broke warren buffet for sure"
2021-06-04 19:23:51,wallstreetbets,BB has the biggest schism between people who think its a meme stock about to moon and people who actually believe in the business.
2021-06-04 19:28:05,wallstreetbets,"I'm loaded up on $BB (190 @$15.42) and the idiots talking about a short squeeze being imminent are annoying as fuck. Fucking chill, it's a long term play, it's not going to squeeze and certainly not next week."
2021-06-04 19:22:26,wallstreetbets,Boomers don’t understand speculation. They think they should all just follow warren buffets advice. Which is fine if you live to a hundred and don’t want to spend.
2021-06-04 14:32:02,wallstreetbets,Well it’s a good chance for most of the ppl here to learn fundamentals. Nok is the beginners stock.
2021-06-04 18:22:30,wallstreetbets,Did you own some shares back then?
2021-06-04 18:29:58,wallstreetbets,WSB likes to allow the perfect to become the enemy of the good.
2021-06-04 17:34:00,wallstreetbets,Did this and made a couple hundred
2021-06-04 14:52:39,wallstreetbets,Gacts
2021-06-04 17:43:03,wallstreetbets,"it spiked a few months back as it got thrown in the mix with the actual meme stocks. easy to imagine a flurry of people buying at 6,7,8 and now regretting.."
2021-06-04 16:05:10,wallstreetbets,Oh I agree completely I'm heavy in BB AMC weed stocks with some AMD and random bs too
2021-06-04 15:13:18,wallstreetbets,"I think everyone is obsessed with becoming the next roaring kitty (deepfvalue) and are just looking for the next get rich quick stock. The whole meme stock thing has turned the stock market into a casino for people with stimulus checks lol. This won’t last forever. Nokia is an awesome long term play. Are you gonna get rich tomorrow? No! Next year? Hell no. But long after the GME/AMC/Meme stock hype you’ll be in good position to benefit from an actually invest not a gamble. 

Might as well take $1000 and put it on red."
2021-06-04 14:41:11,wallstreetbets,Lol AMC and GME are bankrupt companies that were on a downtrend even before the pandemic lol anything has better technicals than those two haha. It’s okay to admit your gambling
2021-06-04 14:42:45,wallstreetbets,But boy oh boy those 1% annual gainz
2021-06-04 17:46:08,wallstreetbets,"Since when are 20-40% gains frowned upon?

Oh. Since January 29th, 2021."
2021-06-04 17:41:50,wallstreetbets,"Just out of curiosity, why not GME? 

Like if you’re going for short squeezes, why not the one with the largest shorts compared to free float? Why not the one that has a future beyond a squeeze? 

I was on board with the post about nok right up until you said bb and clov were the alternatives lol."

2021-06-04 14:53:23,wallstreetbets,"Ehm GME has no debt at all and They present good news for the company every month, sure it was a meme stock in January but it’s serious business going on there now. As for amc they have a 5 billion debt and no plan to save them atm 😸"
2021-06-04 14:49:25,wallstreetbets,Can’t argue with you on that one haha 1% is not dick hardening. Like these meme stocks are totally get it.

2021-06-04 15:10:32,wallstreetbets,"GME is closing stores everywhere. Or Atleast was before the Reddit meme shit. You have to remember that GmE business model sucks, pair that with the fact that they rip off gamers, have horrible work/life balance and a lot of their employees hate working there you can see why this company even if debt free is a joke. Unless they do something with that cash flow and re invent their business model I don’t see GME doing anything. The price is high cause of Reddit and literally nothing else. Have people made money? Of course! But don’t think for a sec it was cause of good investment or an acumen for this stuff lol it was luck and it can’t stay up forever. 

AMC is legit a shit show…so many people are going to be left holding a bag it’s not even funny."

2021-06-04 19:32:32,wallstreetbets,I took a break from eating bananas and throwing shit at people and was able to get in at $19.84/share average currently.  Good effort getting your average cost all the way up to $15.11 but you'll need to try harder to run with the big bois. 💎✋🚀   PS I'm digging the 100% portfolio diversity.
2021-06-04 14:36:59,wallstreetbets,Should have take gains on the ride up....Good luck.

2021-06-04 18:00:36,wallstreetbets,Make sure you sell soon and then buy around 20 again

2021-06-04 18:09:17,wallstreetbets,I’m starting to think Robinhood is paying the mods because most posts show screenshots of RH and they’re deleting and downvoting comments that explain how STUPID it is to stay in RH. You literally don’t own your shares.

2021-06-04 14:42:35,wallstreetbets,This is the problem. Can’t buy puts bc once it’s a meme the iv is too high. Have to sell short so it’s risky since most wsb strategies are long the stock

2021-06-04 17:45:26,wallstreetbets,"That's not entirely correct.

The coin flip is a perfectly objective binary outcome. You flip the coin, it lands on one or the other. Zero room for interpretation, so very easy to be consistent if you are basing your trading decisions off them. 

The opposite of a coin flip creates a tear in the space time continuum, which sets up a massive gravitational implosion, swallowing all matter and light until a new black hole has formed."

2021-06-04 14:17:49,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain this to me. I got puts on a stock when it was at $15, it dropped to $14.5 on the same day(today), yet the put I got is worth less and I somehow lost money. Is it the time decay?, bc the put expires on 7/16 so is the time decay that large???"
2021-06-04 14:22:12,wallstreetbets,✋
2021-06-04 14:29:38,wallstreetbets,My sept calls are still down 13% today.  $33.89 strike...
2021-06-04 14:41:35,wallstreetbets,"lolol what these screen shots don't show is the spread on these leaps. the unrealized p/l may be great, but let's see if it actually gets filled... and at what price."
2021-06-04 15:47:20,wallstreetbets,Have 400 shares and covered calls that expired otm today. Not sure what to do now.. but I like the stock 🚀
2021-06-04 16:13:55,wallstreetbets,Yeah. What’s your take on next week? I see a pull back then lift off but hopefully just lift off
2021-06-04 16:26:43,wallstreetbets,I should be.....only got a measly bunch of shares like grandad told me
2021-06-04 14:23:54,wallstreetbets,"u/sixplaysforadollar teach meh ur ways. How did you know to buy those calls. Im desperate, been trading for a year on my own and im giving up."
2021-06-04 15:41:29,wallstreetbets,I am holding shares!
2021-06-04 14:37:12,wallstreetbets,Probably a drop in implied volatility. If the IV was 400 when you got in and dropped to 100 now that would crush the price.
2021-06-04 14:40:44,wallstreetbets,IV crush
2021-06-04 15:29:40,wallstreetbets,"IV since it's further out, though theta accelerates the closer you are to strike"
2021-06-04 14:40:18,wallstreetbets,"Puts and calls are speculations on future share prices. If the underlying stock moves a lil up or down the options doesn't need to do the same. Unless the patern continues. But hell what do i know, just a europoor, never bought a option. 

Have a nice day, and hold strong to your $GME"
2021-06-04 14:26:01,wallstreetbets,"It was blind luck. Rkt was super low like two weeks ago so I bought 10 $20C for 6/18. Then it trended up towards 21 and I read a bunch about how it could explode. So naturally I was greedy and wanted to hold for it but sold for the profit and moved on. 



Truly luck"

You really need to start selling covered calls on those share when the price and IV spikes. Sell way OTM weekly when it spikes. You can make a lot of money just selling $30-35 calls and then buying back.

I've been doing this. It's easy money. Sold 6/11 $30 covered calls yesterday and re bought them today when it tanked. Rinse and repeat"

&#x200B;

* David Abrams bought 22 million shares at around $4.95 of ET last year during the depth of the crisis. Still holding them. Also, about 2.5% of David Tepper's Appaloosa portfolio is in ET (\~$175 mil)

* Reopening and Oil & Gas Boom cycle - we are likely at the start of a bull cycle for oil and gas (check WTI prices as well) [https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/07/oil--gas-boom-2021-strong-prices-record-revenues-another-big-merger/?sh=1edf2a3062fd](https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2021/05/07/oil--gas-boom-2021-strong-prices-record-revenues-another-big-merger/?sh=1edf2a3062fd)
* Percent held by insiders: +17.90% (management has a skin in the game besides their jobs)
* Hard Asset and great protection against inflation

I am long since January... both commons and options in my small portfolio. It has been great! This is not an investment advice. Do your own research and good luck."
2021-06-04 13:54:34,wallstreetbets,Been a holder for a while
2021-06-04 14:02:05,wallstreetbets,I love ET purchased some back in March agree it’s an excellent hold
2021-06-04 13:50:13,wallstreetbets,Forgot to add.. originally got in last year because Bill Perkins (famous energy trader - writer of Die With Zero published some of his positions on Twitter last year and was super long ET). I just try to follow the smart people

2021-06-04 14:14:51,wallstreetbets,It would be great if it cooled off for a minute so others can get the dip.
2021-06-04 14:47:55,wallstreetbets,fair enough. will probably see a small pull back at some point but it dipped for a year. still not at pre pandemic levels and now has a bigger portfolio and with oil prices higher increased margin and partners who are capable of making their payments

2021-06-04 14:08:56,wallstreetbets,"Why is increasing the free float a positive thing for the price? Surely increasing the supply with  no increase in demand won’t be good, if you think the price is low at a float of 7% which is low, surely that’s because there isn’t the demand to push the price up on them limited shares available

You do state that you think this demand will come, but what’s the catalyst? Joining the s&p 500? I’m not saying your wrong of course, I like the stock in itself, I just don’t see the reasoning for expecting an explosive increase"

2021-06-04 13:47:16,wallstreetbets,I want whatever he is on.
2021-06-04 15:22:27,wallstreetbets,All right. I picked up another 100 shares. Holding with 750.
2021-06-04 14:02:21,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is so primed for a massive short squeeze though. Lower float Higher short interest, fat dividend. It’s literally the best stock I can find."
2021-06-04 15:39:47,wallstreetbets,"This just brings back memories of the time that UWMC was due to get added to the Russell 2000, and then it never happened."
2021-06-04 15:59:37,wallstreetbets,Im confused here isn't the float the available stock not purchased. You implied it was the total number that could be traded period which is it the amount available to purchase or the amount total that can be traded. Wait let me answer that you can tellme if I'm wrong. Float is the amount available to trade shares outstanding is the amount all ready in trade. I believe the part about 10% float for the 500 though
2021-06-04 13:50:51,wallstreetbets,">When you’re a billionaire, typically you don’t really care about money anymore you care about people and your business

2021-06-04 13:56:23,wallstreetbets,That's a hefty PT. I have a small position in this but a much larger position in UWMC as it will be taking market share from them and has more potential for growth plus dividend.
2021-06-04 13:46:33,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤦‍♂️ this sub is funnier than I thought it would be

Just saying"
2021-06-04 19:03:23,wallstreetbets,Great DD. I bought more calls last week. I think I’ll invest in leaps. I believe the market will eventually recognise RKT value. $80 PT sounds about right. I think leaps are the right play here.
2021-06-04 18:20:01,wallstreetbets,"Nice bit of DD, let's go RKT."

2021-06-04 18:19:34,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck
2021-06-04 14:53:28,wallstreetbets,Investors like to hold more of a stake and they can’t if there aren’t many shares available. sp500 has those rules for that reason. I’m sure institutions want to invest more but there aren’t that many shares to accumulate at the moment. I’m sure there’s more to it
2021-06-04 17:36:37,wallstreetbets,S&P500. But I think the general consensus is that more float means more institutional interest. All of this creates a snowball effect for the SP and the fact that RKT is a company that's raking in fucking boat loads of money.

2021-06-04 15:47:19,wallstreetbets,"In your opinion how is UWMC more valuable than RKT? IMO RKT makes a shit ton of cash, has multiple means of income. Is constantly adding new revenue streams, is MORE than just a mortgage company. Last but not least, absolutely destroying the market share."
2021-06-04 17:42:36,wallstreetbets,"RKT is insanely profitable, you don't have to look very far to see that lol."
2021-06-04 14:55:07,wallstreetbets,I put the edit up because I was getting the comments
2021-06-04 19:49:07,wallstreetbets,Did you mean crushing one per minute?
2021-06-04 16:45:32,wallstreetbets,"There is still shares for them to buy currently if they wanted them, they would just push the price up in the process, if this isn’t happening currently then I don’t see why there would suddenly be demand when they increase the float"
2021-06-04 16:08:27,wallstreetbets,The last line in edit 2 is really all you needed to say hahaha
2021-06-04 14:34:54,wallstreetbets,RKT is trash compared to UWMC. UWMC is buying $300M worth of stock and pays a 5% dividend it’s not even a debate which stock can move more with volume.
2021-06-04 14:33:33,wallstreetbets,You’re too small. Go away. This is for real investors.
2021-06-04 19:21:20,wallstreetbets,Did it get added to this list under consideration?
2021-06-04 18:02:11,wallstreetbets,it's like the dude just typed out his train of thought
2021-06-04 16:50:03,wallstreetbets,Well it would definitely be more attractive of a stock because it would be harder to manipulate. The worst thing happening to the stock is people selling out from PTSD of constant fake outs. Also institutions don’t know the owner so him having that much control takes more trust which Wall Street doesn’t have time for. These are just guesses...main benefit is possible PE ratio upgrades. It would be very off for there to be a company in the S&P 500 with the similar market cap to that of Palantir who isn’t profitable yet
2021-06-04 17:12:21,wallstreetbets,"and yet theyre under previous ATL with a divi and a buy back.

no tricks left in the bag. mortgages only.

rkt outperforming them by over 20% relative to both IPO pricing."
2021-06-04 14:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Let’s see how long that lasts. My mortgage is actually serviced by UWM because I have a friend who worked for them in the past and did him a favor. I completely regret it, but in any case I might just go in forbearance  to mess up the balance sheet. I will literally be that petty because that’s how much I hate the company and it’s piggy backing big mouth CEO. Every little bit counts. Also, You clearly don’t look at the fundamentals and you are in a short squeeze play, this is not a short squeeze post however I do believe there is still short squeeze potential to an extent. If you think you are taking marketshare from RKT that’s hilarious because they just started wholesale so the only thing to take was that of your company. And even if somehow they were to take market share (in wholesale because that’s all ya got), they just made millions on a trial period for their new auto site and also rocket homes is up 300% as well so in reality UWM isn’t even a thought in there mind. The market has a way of telling the truth so time will tell I’ll leave it at that."
2021-06-04 18:56:53,wallstreetbets,there are also etf's  that track the S&P and when a new company is added I believe they add that to their portfolio.

Regardless if it doesn’t pop it seems like a good investment because of what they make.  It’s future tech and they are probably shorted because they aren’t being banked on to succeed.  But if enough people start to notice how shorted it is this could be another meme stonk.

TLDR; I like the stock."

2021-06-04 14:29:57,wallstreetbets,"Think of the future possibilities. When RNG starts finding more applications (cargo ships, fleet vehicles, microgrids and power generation $BE). 

The investments in infrastructure at the cost of earnings has been genius by their management."
2021-06-04 14:50:10,wallstreetbets,in for 100 shares at $9.40.... time for some crayon soup

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕"
2021-06-04 15:28:43,wallstreetbets,In with 8K shares. Solid investment with huge upside and squeeze potential!
2021-06-04 15:50:04,wallstreetbets,"Monday morning should see some nice price action to the upside. 

Also, remember that while the GS play is the lottery, shares should be sitting at a minimum of $13.49 due to the AMZN deal. Realistically the fair value of the share price is roughly double give or take from where it is now."
2021-06-04 16:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes. Also, 8M shares were shorted yesterday. They will be covering next week so we will get nice price action from that.

1,000 shares

33 x 6/18 $9csp

12 x 1/22 $10c

Will add more next week. Remember you gotta buy shares to get the price to move. Calls won't do shit alone. Need volume too."
2021-06-04 14:38:13,wallstreetbets,In with my meagre 20 shares but let’s goooooo 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-04 15:17:53,wallstreetbets,I've bought so many bottoms on this ticker that I might actually be gay
2021-06-04 17:13:18,wallstreetbets,"every time i free up more capital, i'll keep reinvesting it into CLNE shares, until the price hits $13. then it's time to wait. hoping to take some BB profits next week to dump here. careful about making this seem like a PnD though - personally i like the stock + what they stand for, and would like to be a shareholder, potentially long-term - even if it g-squeezes I'll probably buy back in after taking profits"

2021-06-04 15:43:47,wallstreetbets,5k shares. Let’s keep this going!!!
2021-06-04 15:47:40,wallstreetbets,This stock has to be artificially suppressed by MM. very similar price action as RKT gamma squeeze
2021-06-04 16:36:41,wallstreetbets,"In with 1k shares, 9.45 cost average. I believe in the play and fundamentals of the company, and btw they are not losing money, they spend alot of their past profit for future betterment and positioning in the RNG fuels sector, quarterly misses and losses are irrelevant if they use what they have made in the past and what they currently have available to better position themselves in future RNG stations and the industry. The only question people that doubt the play need to ask themselves is if they believe in RNG as a viable alt fuel? Yes? Then CLNE is in a good spot to profit from that. No? Then find another sector, industry, and ticker you have faith in and move on. Don't just beat down this play because you don't believe in it or lost money on it, go find another.... Anyways even if CLNE goes down a bit (which i don't believe is going to happen, considering it's been beat to piss already) before gapping back up to 15-20ish range in the long run I really don't give a fuck. In it for the long haul regardless. CLNE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌝🌝🌝🌝🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"

2021-06-04 15:40:33,wallstreetbets,I picked up more today & am at 110 shares now. And 6/18 option calls this morning. But Why is $13 the magic number to get this to rocket? I think I missed that part.

2021-06-04 19:03:41,wallstreetbets,"In case some of you read, I encourage you to check out their last earnings transcripts (just google - freely available), and get an idea of their business. It's solid shit in a sector that has a lot of companies that are running on dubious speculation. The gamma play is here because it's been beaten down to oblivion along with the entire sector (anything remotely alt energy sounding has eerily similar graphs), but it's absolutely a value play as well at these levels."
2021-06-04 19:34:39,wallstreetbets,595 at 9.51 hope this gets me some tendies

2021-06-04 15:49:03,wallstreetbets,5% a day is absolutely not a moderate gain lmao those are huge fucking gains for a stock. People who have only watched shit like GME/AMC have an incredibly twisted view of how stocks generally move.
2021-06-04 12:48:12,wallstreetbets,Just bought 70 shares............of AMC. SORRY
2021-06-04 12:45:40,wallstreetbets,[deleted]

2021-06-04 14:39:47,wallstreetbets,Was in for 100... then 200... soon it'll be 300.
2021-06-04 16:44:36,wallstreetbets,"I did 1k today at 9.45 cost average, not too worried about it. If worse comes to worst I'm in it for awhile longer. I don't see the stock getting beat anymore then it has already in the past couple months, and I think RNG fuels as a carbon neutral alternative fuel is a good investment. So fuck it 😂"
2021-06-04 14:43:31,wallstreetbets,"This guy fucks. 

Position: 500 shares"
2021-06-04 14:42:58,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-06-04 13:55:48,wallstreetbets,You have your phone upside down. It's been catering all day. Not gonna be a 5% gain but soon might be in the red today.
2021-06-04 12:54:50,wallstreetbets,Yes sir i'm adding shares on dips. Calls are just a few lotto's
2021-06-04 15:58:44,wallstreetbets,"YES, Shares or shares + calls.  Calls only doesn't move the price.

""Fundamentals support a floor of 13.49.

That's what $AMZN is paying for shares. After they give the company a billion and a half dollars in fuel purchases."""
2021-06-04 13:50:38,wallstreetbets,SHARES ARE KEY. Sure buy some lotto calls but BUY MORE SHARES
2021-06-04 19:34:09,wallstreetbets,As hard as it’s being pushed I wouldn’t be shocked if the rug pull came. This is a lot of coverage in two days. Oddly concerning
2021-06-04 13:45:38,wallstreetbets,"Same, just added 200 more at $9.27"
2021-06-04 13:49:06,wallstreetbets,YES just bought more and will continue to add
2021-06-04 15:24:32,wallstreetbets,If thos works out profits are going to set up a BE position.
2021-06-04 13:03:38,wallstreetbets,Cow farts are the best kind of farts
2021-06-04 15:28:11,wallstreetbets,"Yeah spread the word in the daily chat, link this post, keep talking"
2021-06-04 13:07:46,wallstreetbets,The methane produced by cow farts is the fuel that explosively combusts to get the CLNE rocket occupied by the diamond-handed apes to the moon in 6 days or less
2021-06-04 13:18:03,wallstreetbets,"Shares really are the way to go, long or short term. Just a good company"
2021-06-04 14:13:22,wallstreetbets,The irony of that last part of the comment based on the source of the energy they're selling 😂
2021-06-04 14:41:37,wallstreetbets,"There is huge volume/open interest on $13 june 18th calls. If it hits $13 before June 18th, large amounts of contracts will be in the money and market makers will have to buy furiously to hedge their net short positions"

2021-06-04 19:27:40,wallstreetbets,Calls don't push price action!
2021-06-04 15:41:25,wallstreetbets,"There is huge volume/open interest on $13 june 18th calls. If it hits $13 before June 18th, large amounts of contracts will be in the money and market makers will have to buy furiously to hedge their net short positions"
2021-06-04 17:35:32,wallstreetbets,My spidey sense is tingling on this one. It did for GME too back in december when I bought sub-20's.
2021-06-04 18:33:31,wallstreetbets,buy shares my friend. We need to buy shares to get price movement on this one
2021-06-04 12:46:30,wallstreetbets,"yes but if you look at things on average, we're not that far off"
2021-06-04 13:28:20,wallstreetbets,You guys got me hyped. I commit to buying as many additional shares as this entire post gets upvotes.

2021-06-04 14:03:17,wallstreetbets,"PYR is a great company with a diversified product offering. This new contract is huge and will attract the attention of other mining competitors.

Been holding my shares since 6.70 from many months ago and took the nosedive with the shorts. In for the long term and adding more shares soon. Also invested in their sister company HPQ."
2021-06-04 12:36:07,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but this DD is incomplete.
You are talking about torches division and you do not refer to nanopowder production.
The potential is huge! And the fundamental are strong.
Fortunately this stock has not taken the interest of the market yet"
2021-06-04 17:44:25,wallstreetbets,I like the stock.. I have been buying it here and there over the last 6 months.  I have 1000 shares and buying more

2021-06-04 12:38:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m typing on mobile and got lazy haha. And that’s true! The nanopowder could end up being their biggest product. From what I understand though, right now they’re more centered around their industrial torches as their primary revenue stream. Which is still cool because, as my DD points out, that’s multiple revenue streams!"
2021-06-04 12:54:31,wallstreetbets,Ha! I wish. 300@6.66

The analysts say PT of 30, I don’t listen to analysts, but that tells me there’s a generally positive sentiment, and all things considered it looks to me like a decent swing position. Thanks for this Little piece of DD sir."
2021-06-04 12:50:43,wallstreetbets,Someone covered VZIO about a month ago I think around $25ish with a nice DD like this one. And it’s went down. When lambo?

2021-06-04 12:26:23,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 12:39:06,wallstreetbets,I have owned like 3 Vizio started with the first model they released in the USA.  ( 31 in LCD) I now have the 75 in OLED smart tv and beside needing to be restarted from time to time. Guess is not enough RAM... They are bullet proof. I still use the 31 as a computer monitor. I think the issue is more where they are sold... I'm sorry but some Walmart employees don't exactly have the most gentle nuance touch when it comes to stocking the store... not the company or the hardware being the issue
2021-06-04 12:44:22,wallstreetbets,"I've been waiting for my VZIO shared to take off. Its an award winning company and solid brand. I've had a Vizio TV and soundbar for 6 years now and both are still working as they should. From what I've been told, the Walmart Vizio are made of cheaper components compared to the Best Buy Vizio. They also have different ""series"" of tech. The M series is definitely not the same as the P series. Im willing to bet most people that have issues with Vizio have the low end TV. I like the stock and the company"
2021-06-04 13:22:23,wallstreetbets,"I’ve always looked at Vizio as a lower tiered “value” brand (and I know I’m not the only one). Not saying the stock won’t move, but I’m not a fan of the product - especially when I can spend a little more for a Sony or Samsung."
2021-06-04 14:43:36,wallstreetbets,NOPE Carlotz next multibagger $Lotz 🚀
2021-06-04 15:35:02,wallstreetbets,Get your canoo ready for tendieland!💪🐮

2021-06-04 13:39:28,wallstreetbets,"Think you got your DD mixed up. BB is the next 10 bagger. It's all good though retard, tighten the helmet strap."
2021-06-04 12:31:45,wallstreetbets,"If Vizio had at least one good product, maybe. But instead they suck at everything. Buy this if you want some sexy loss porn!!!"
2021-06-04 12:29:53,wallstreetbets,Got any Z Pack?
2021-06-04 12:36:42,wallstreetbets,we ALL know...been there...done that

2021-06-04 12:43:49,wallstreetbets,Thanks for looking this over my man
2021-06-04 12:34:40,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had several vizio TVs. Never had any hardware go bad. Still have one. It’s a few years old and still kicking. I dunno. Just my 0.02
I find people have so many different experiences with tech items, it’s a hard thing to gauge."
2021-06-04 12:35:19,wallstreetbets,I've had a few Vizio TV's and never had these issues.  I found them to be good values.
2021-06-04 12:29:07,wallstreetbets,"They're definitely on the cheaper end, so more market exposure. Anytime you walk into Costco or Walmart, it's the first TV in front of you"
2021-06-04 12:45:30,wallstreetbets,"Literally just did this with a brand new Vizio my parents bought - I spent a day debugging it and realized the only remedy was a Samsung. They haven’t had issues
Since."
2021-06-04 12:40:09,wallstreetbets,"Buying a Vizio from Best Buy vs Walmart is actually different. The Walmart ""brand"" does have cheaper components. I bought mine from BB 6 years ago along with a Vizio soundbar and they're both still kicking ass."
2021-06-04 12:35:13,wallstreetbets,Have you ever tried their sound bars? Pretty solid
2021-06-04 12:32:23,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 12:46:22,wallstreetbets,...or the free Smartcast streaming service they provide
2021-06-04 13:11:15,wallstreetbets,"I have a Vizio 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos sound bar. It was only like $250 dollars or something. It's an amazing value for the quality, and this was like 2 years ago when Dolby Atmos was first getting big."
2021-06-04 12:34:37,wallstreetbets,"I personally have one I bought a few years ago, which still looks and works great. Still the #2 best selling TV brand in the US"
2021-06-04 12:06:38,wallstreetbets,"Ehm, you dont know that around 160 million shares became 3,7 billion shares in a rescue plan? Norwegian wont Moon. Think about the market value with 3,7 billion shares. Do research before you advise."
2021-06-04 12:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Each time someone says: It can't go any lower, I keep my hands off it"
2021-06-04 12:05:06,wallstreetbets,Ticker symbol?
2021-06-04 12:33:25,wallstreetbets,This stock was ~ $1800 in 2018... It was kicked from the moon

2021-06-04 12:06:54,wallstreetbets,10% of their previous valuation is definitely within reach

2021-06-04 18:03:31,wallstreetbets,"I just have to get this off my chest for everyone on here.
Price action of the equity aside. Forget the moon, 100k forget all of that for just 1 second.
Let’s think about it, how many business have been destroyed by high value powerful hedge funds manipulating failing businesses value and accelerating loss. 
Mothers, fathers and children of poor to lower middle class Americans forced out of their job sooner than they would have been if a business deteriorated naturally.
Honestly F these sick naked short, power manipulation cowards. 
They are cowards.

I still made 3x what I put in. After GME I became too cautious, I've started selling as soon as I hit 2x or even 3x profit because of I didn't,  I'd know I'd ""lose it"" when the stocks crashes.   Slow and steady wins the race."

2021-06-04 18:48:11,wallstreetbets,How do you get a trading ban?
2021-06-04 18:48:36,wallstreetbets,"So I got flagged and was unable to day trade after the limit. 

To get around it I usually purchase something at big loss the day before and sell it the next day to avoid the penalty. 

You can also sell first and still buy without activating the day trade rule.  

So for example Sundial drops 15% in one day, I'd try to buy it at the low and flip it for 5% usually at opening the next day. Rinse repeat. 

After losing 60% on gamestop this has helped me almost get back positive and should be green after the next couple weeks. 

Then again,  if I just held gamestop I'd be positive anyway...... but it didn't happen lol"

Do some research, make smart informed moves. Don’t buy options with less than 30-60 days until expiration, ITM is best. And don’t fuck with meme stocks, especially if that’s what you lost on. 

Chasing that loss is a good way to lose the other 2/3rds.

This is all coming from a guy who was just down 60% on cash and almost at break even again."

2021-06-04 16:26:38,wallstreetbets,I was at like 80% plus loss on GameStop but since I had already seen the bottom I might as well stick around and see the top.
2021-06-04 17:07:34,wallstreetbets,I’m at 90%  loss but I split up my yearly scheduled investing in quarters instead of monthly deposits because I knew I was a smooth brain but man am I fucking retarded. Making the quarterly deposit in 3 weeks to Buy puts and calls still currently all in calls and puts with my 10% left hoping for a winner to keep me in the game till then we will see come Monday 🙏

2021-06-04 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,"See, I don't get why can't they just make a sell option unavailable when you're at your limit, but that's good to know"
2021-06-04 17:02:00,wallstreetbets,What about the guy looking for a new broker in the few commentes above why do they need to change since they should be forgiven under this right?

2021-06-04 17:35:55,wallstreetbets,It's after you get marked pattern on your fourth
2021-06-04 18:06:51,wallstreetbets,"Yeah after the fourth, I had to manually turn off PDT protection in the settings because it gave me a warning when trying to complete the fourth day trade."
2021-06-04 17:23:25,wallstreetbets,So you have a source for the Cash account part? I was told that it didn't really make a difference.
2021-06-04 17:11:07,wallstreetbets,Silent P?
2021-06-04 16:43:50,wallstreetbets,"I know it's a common Reddit add here in Canada.  But I literally started day trading with 1$ on wealthsimple.  It was hard because they don't list pennystocks.  But I had some fun, was up to 5$ before I lost it all on I think cematrix corp.

Then I put in a grand and doubled it, then lost it all too.

Now I own xeqt"
2021-06-04 17:08:49,wallstreetbets,"That's not why, they don't want people trading on margin and going into debt and having nothing to cover it."
2021-06-04 17:26:13,wallstreetbets,More like because of people losing money in the market and then suing the brokerage and complaining to the SEC that they should have been protected against loss.
2021-06-04 17:09:53,wallstreetbets,"They don't want people trading on margin, going into debt and being bag holders so the institution has to cover them."

2021-06-04 15:36:02,wallstreetbets,It's okay I lost 2/3 of my account when gme crashed now I'm break even and still negative on every investment but $MO and even then only 2/3 are profiting and it's not even much.
2021-06-04 18:47:00,wallstreetbets,"Psh. Those are rookie numbers. 

I lost 50% of my account just yesterday yoloing it all on Moderna calls near the top. Wiped out a month of consistent small gains."
2021-06-04 18:03:39,wallstreetbets,Are you paper trading live or back testing historical?
2021-06-04 15:35:09,wallstreetbets,"No shit, why would anyone practice something before doing it for real? It’s just money! They will print more."
2021-06-04 15:45:32,wallstreetbets,paper trading is when I give your mom two ciggies for a bj.
2021-06-04 16:36:33,wallstreetbets,"Paper trading is where you do something like download the Ameritrade Desktop App, put it into Paper Trading mode, where you aren't using real money and then you test to see what happens when you do what you might do for real.  


It uses up to the minute, live data. It's a good self-training tool."
2021-06-04 18:07:47,wallstreetbets,"I guess when I suggest paper trading and back testing I'm only really thinking in the context of scalping and short timeframe strategies really. If you're doing that you don't usually have enough time to go through the emotions of a paper handed moment, you're just stopped the fuck out if the trade isn't going your way. Suddenly you're just dealing with a ""bad"" thing that happened to you, instead of one that is happening to you presently."

2021-06-04 12:20:41,wallstreetbets,"It’s not entirely, it’ll flag you as a day trader. You just need equity of 25k in the account to be able to trade. You’re also still able to trade in type 1 (cash)."

2021-06-04 12:34:18,wallstreetbets,"So one would have to buy and sell the same stock in a single day to count once, then would have to do that 3 more times over 5 business days to get yanked by PDT rules?"
2021-06-04 13:38:11,wallstreetbets,You get 3 intraday open/close in 5 business days.
2021-06-04 15:36:38,wallstreetbets,"Just putting this out there:

When you get marked as a pattern day trader or whatever, the buy restriction doesn't usually kick in until the close of the day, so you can just buy and sell like a madman for the rest of the day.

Or at least that was my experience 2 days ago."

2021-06-04 16:29:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah I looked at the put options and AMC would have to go down to like $10 per share to break even. I was like... that's not gonna happen
2021-06-04 18:19:53,wallstreetbets,"It took me a while to realize just how effectively that stuff is already priced in. It’s obvious when you think about it from certain perspectives, we all practically know it will go down at some point for some amount of time at least. Try to make money off of something everybody knows will happen is typically a bad idea in this kinda context (unless you have the funds to just dominate or corner it)

Took me a while to realize how options can be so hard to make money off of in some situations. Like it’s better to just take that cash to a blackjack table at a certain point imo. But I haven’t met many people that have learned options without taking some dumb Ls too"
2021-06-04 14:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I bought a put yesterday around that time and was up 50% in just a few mins. But had no day trades left so here I am at -90% 😀"
2021-06-04 13:41:04,wallstreetbets,"I understand that, the 930-1000 dip/surge has been something else the last few days. I was trying to catch it on a call 😂"
2021-06-04 17:39:23,wallstreetbets,Genius.
2021-06-04 17:38:35,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not about trading on a platform, it's about you as trader, trading under FINRA rules. You're the same person no matter which platform you use to trade. This is why, no.

That said, the requirement is for brokerages to keep track, and I don't know how much they talk to each other. There isn't a central system of PDTs. So goto a new brokerage and open account, day trade. Should work. This is why, yes.

If you need an analogy, it's the same as murdering someone in California, and then going to New York, and thinking, well, you didn't commit the crime there so you can't goto jail."

2021-06-04 16:23:24,wallstreetbets,Oh really???
2021-06-04 16:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Google PDT. 4 trades in a week using a margin account designates you a PDT and you must hold $25k in your account.

2021-06-04 16:17:25,wallstreetbets,"Pattern Day Trader rule: you can’t day trade in a cash account, if you make 3 or more day trades in a 5 day period you can get cut off from using money you make from pending sales in trades you make while that money is clearing during the T+2 period"
2021-06-04 19:51:04,wallstreetbets,">PDT. 4

What Is a Pattern Day Trader (PDT)?  
A pattern day trader (PDT) is a regulatory designation for those traders or investors that execute four or more day trades over the span of five business days using a margin account. The number of day trades must constitute more than 6% of the margin account's total trade activity during that five-day window.  
  
If this occurs, the trader's account will be flagged as a PDT by their broker. The PDT designation places certain restrictions on further trading; this designation is put in place to discourage investors from trading excessively."
2021-06-04 16:55:16,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street basically doesn't like newbies who make too much money.  So if you have 3 successive successful trades,  you get banned as they think you have found a loophole so they ban you."
2021-06-04 16:35:28,wallstreetbets,They don't waive PDT flags at all at fidelity.. they told me I have to deposit 25k or go 60 days with no day trades for the first one to be removed.
2021-06-04 17:32:19,wallstreetbets,You should keep 1$ in there and day trade penny stocks just to keep getting banned. See if you can get some type of record!
2021-06-04 18:12:01,wallstreetbets,"Call up your brokerage firm, find out the rules, as for clarification on rare or unusual circumstances, make them happen."
2021-06-04 17:10:01,wallstreetbets,They’re probably using a super shitty broker so that’s on them. I have no idea why anyone uses RH or any of these other discount broker apps when all the retail brokers went to $0 commission. If you can’t afford >.75 option contract fee for a far superior trading platform then you probably shouldn’t be trading options at all anyway because you clearly can’t afford the risk involved.
2021-06-04 17:36:54,wallstreetbets,"Reg T. It's a matter of semantics, but cash accounts using unsettled funds is called freeriding rather than pattern day trading. It results in the same 90 day ban. You can theoretically make as many day trades as you want so long as you aren't using unsettled funds."
2021-06-04 17:27:35,wallstreetbets,Just look up the pattern day trade rule and freeriding
2021-06-04 18:17:26,wallstreetbets,Etrade let's me buy with unsettled funds it's only when I sell what I purchased before the money is settled that they get upset. Did it once so far and nothing happened

If you have 25k in your account your are exempt from the PDT limit of 4 trades per week... right??"
2021-06-04 16:42:26,wallstreetbets,25k in liquid cash or in total assets?
2021-06-04 18:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Does not have to be a margin account (for RH anyway), even if it is a cash account you get 4 trades and a 90day lock"
2021-06-04 17:17:11,wallstreetbets,Does it have to be cash sitting there? Can it be cash used as collateral for selling puts? Or is it the value of your assets?
2021-06-04 17:33:44,wallstreetbets,But I am in Pacific Daylight Time. I cannot trade any other way until late October (or November)
2021-06-04 17:35:03,wallstreetbets,So in a cash account you can say trade or what it still seems sketchy to me
2021-06-04 18:12:41,wallstreetbets,"4 trades of the same ticker symbol, right?"
2021-06-04 18:49:47,wallstreetbets,If your cash balance goes under 25k in the US you can’t day trade.

2021-06-04 16:37:31,wallstreetbets,It's the other way around. You can day trade all you want on a cash account because you are always trading with settled funds. PDT rule only applies to margin account.
2021-06-04 16:33:14,wallstreetbets,This only counts for margin trades correct? If I’m trading w my own money I can trade all i want right? That’s how I’ve understood PDT
2021-06-04 17:45:25,wallstreetbets,"Schwab will lock your account for 90 days without any kind of forgiveness.  Happened to me during the weed stock boom around 10 years back.  

I called them and “I didn’t know that, why does your software let me do something illegal?”  was not a valid excuse.  Had my account locked while it went from ~$20,000, to ~$140,000, back down to about $1700...

I technically could have sold still, but their mobile app was effed and made it seem like I couldn’t.  I was young dumb and trendy, didn’t realize the website sucks but generally works.  Also couldn’t set trailing stops without using their streetsmart edge desktop app."

2021-06-04 14:47:19,wallstreetbets,Your imaginary scenario makes zero fucking sense. PDT bans prevent you from buying. Nothing stopping him from selling those options.

2021-06-04 13:04:02,wallstreetbets,"You should keep in mind the difference between a stock with a low cap and a stock that's legitimately cheap. 
Just cause the dollar amount on a stock is low doesn't make it cheap.

A company that's burning through cash trading at $5 would not be cheap compared to a profitable company trading at $10 if everything else is equal.

Invest in good companies and you'll be good."
2021-06-04 13:35:43,wallstreetbets,"I can't blame you for spending your time learning. What WSB is doing has nothing to do with fundamentals. Given the company's financials, AMC is not worth it's current share price. This is all about trying to game the system, especially against institutional investors, but eventually this pseudo-Ponzi scheme is going to leave the later investors high and dry. If you are just getting your feet wet with investing, looking for quality companies that are trading at a good price makes more sense than trying to guess when to jump onboard and then off with a meme stock."

2021-06-04 18:36:24,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood was down for MULTIPLE STRAIGHT DAYS during some of the busiest and most volatile trading days in the past decade. Not even ""we turned the buy button off"" but straight-up you could not buy, sell, or even get quotes. Meanwhile the SP500 was -10% before lunch, and any positions you were holding completely BTFO. It's a garbage platform and there aren't really any compelling reasons to keep using it in the year 2021."

I am a licensed broker so I won’t steer you anywhere specifically but at the current industry rates you can pick any of the big names and get better executions, account support, platform performance, etc. There’s just no reason to use a service like RH with all the other choices out there."

2021-06-04 15:46:47,wallstreetbets,What options did you buy that you are down 21k?
2021-06-04 18:08:32,wallstreetbets,Yes.  I had a few good plays I made upwards of 85% gain on with options.  Had it all pulled out from underneath me.  Now Im down on original capital.  Very humbling.

2021-06-04 14:36:51,wallstreetbets,I said the same thing. I've held bags and lost money when I could have sold at a gain (sometimes a massive gain) because of this stupid fucking rule. It's basically only protected me from making money.
2021-06-04 16:37:04,wallstreetbets,"Ironically, all the retarda in here are posting massive % loss numbers when day trading while saying they don't need protected. This is why they make us wear helmets, cause of you fucks."

2021-06-04 16:54:52,wallstreetbets,"You probably have an instant settlement account, which is like margin but only getting to 2nd base. Margin leverage is the full ass-fucking."
2021-06-04 16:54:32,wallstreetbets,"It's not really a debate. You have unlimited day trades on a cash account on any broker. The issue is you would have to wait a few days for the funds to settle from each trade before you can use them - which would make day trading almost impossible, unless you're using very little capitol for each trade relative to your account size.

If you had 25k on a cash account you would still have to wait for funds to settle.. you having 25k on margin allows you unlimited day trades + access to the funds immediately after you close a trade.

Unless I'm wrong idk? Just not sure of any brokers that do this differently"

2021-06-04 14:11:03,wallstreetbets,Something else was going on here then. PDT rules absolutely do not apply to cash accounts. Talking to your broker to confirm account type could be helpful. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern_day_trader

2021-06-04 15:01:54,wallstreetbets,Robinhood accounts are on margin by default. When you deposit money you can instantly use that money without waiting for your cash to settle. You can turn your account into a cash only but I think you gotta call em up to get it swapped unless they changed things up.

2021-06-04 17:12:28,wallstreetbets,"I think as long as it meets the SEC regulation of min 25k cash, a brokerage can step-up their own requirements however they see fit.

It seems that a brokerage would want day traders to have margin accounts, specifically because of the amount of time it takes for them to clear a trade. Stocks bought on margin, essentially belong to them too and can be sold or lent to other clients immediately, rather than waiting on a clearinghouse."
2021-06-04 18:20:46,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you have to wait for funds to settle in a cash account. It's a cash trade so the broker just assumes it will settle. My ""cash available for trade"" jumps up immediately after making a sale in Fidelity, and I did not activate margin for my account.

2021-06-04 15:53:54,wallstreetbets,Were the options set to expire today?
2021-06-04 15:24:10,wallstreetbets,"You guys eat them, I just stuff em where the sun don’t  shine."
2021-06-04 15:45:22,wallstreetbets,"Nah freeze them, last longer than any regular popsicle."
2021-06-04 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,See if your wife’s boyfriend can slip you some cash.  If not just steal it from his wallet while he’s in pound town.
2021-06-04 15:42:27,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah, he was very freaked out, he called my dad, ""hey i just messed up real bad! i screwed up and got locked out, what do i do?! i'm going to lose my ass, those calls expire tomorrow!"" even when he put the money in, it didn't unlock him till the next day, so he was still freaking out for awile after."
2021-06-04 16:15:40,wallstreetbets,I believe RH defaults to a margin account. Many people aren't aware of this.
2021-06-04 17:51:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but with a Cash account unless you have funds cleared and available,  you can't day trade because of the 2-3 days for the trade to settle.  So while it's different,  it's functionally the same to most people."
2021-06-04 15:37:44,wallstreetbets,"Well you just have to stop paying for robinhood gold to do that, but you also lose the level2 market data and the instant settlement, which kind of defeats the purpose of day trading."
2021-06-04 16:00:08,wallstreetbets,So does using the instant deposit feature. I checked my account statement and thought it was odd my account was listed as a margin account because I don’t use margin plus had less than the 2k in there at the time which I thought was a requirement for a margin account.
2021-06-04 15:01:06,wallstreetbets,Now you tell us. Robinhood just banned me tradeing less than 2 grand. Like I'm make a fortune. Maybe they should look at how much I lost just today. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)
2021-06-04 15:46:12,wallstreetbets,"To be clear, trading on unsettled cash is fine if you are just buying with cash from something you just sold.  Read up on good faith violations if you are daytrading off margin.

Generally the issue is when you sell something, buy with unsettled cash, then sell again before the cash from the original sale settles."
2021-06-04 18:00:48,wallstreetbets,IT'S MY MONEY AND I WANT IT NOW
2021-06-04 19:01:58,wallstreetbets,I do the same with leveraged shorted funds like SQQQ. I just hold my phone upside down.
2021-06-04 18:42:52,wallstreetbets,[for the curious](https://www.investor.gov/introduction-investing/investing-basics/glossary/pattern-day-trader)
2021-06-04 18:54:03,wallstreetbets,"I think its dependent upon how long you hold the position.. If you buy and sell within the same day you would have to wait for the funds to settle, because the funds from the purchase havent settled yet. If you hold for a few days then it will have settled by then so the money will be available to you after you sell. 

at least thats my understanding of it, I could be wrong"
2021-06-04 16:27:28,wallstreetbets,Get the pigtail special
2021-06-04 15:55:23,wallstreetbets,"No next Friday, should be alright if some we get some additional volume. Worst part is I made huge gains the last 2-3 weeks from yolo options and then I yoloed those gains and poof. IV crushed me and theta is gonna murder me worse next week. Just praying it hits $70 or higher to break even"
2021-06-04 15:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Just downgrading to gold isn't enough you have to specifically disable instant settlement separately, but yeah disabling instant settlement essentially defeats the purpose of day trading as you said."
2021-06-04 15:11:10,wallstreetbets,Is your account instant or gold? And all of us told you all to stay away from Robinghood tbh. If your account isn't a cash only account on Robinhood you are subject to the PDT rule. Read my clicky for more information. If you are gold or instant your account is basically a margin acc and if you deposit x money and use said instant deposit to buy gme and it gets super volatile they technically can margin call you and make you sell at a loss potentially
2021-06-04 15:47:23,wallstreetbets,Yes that was never an issue but using unsettled funds is.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"We need to be going up, BB! "

2021-06-04 15:24:34,wallstreetbets,"I'm still up 30%, but was hoping to sell when it doubled. Is it going to make a comeback today?"

2021-06-04 15:33:42,wallstreetbets,bought some BB from last year to early this year. still holding!
2021-06-04 15:37:25,wallstreetbets,I’m wondering if I should still hold BB and sell calls.   Premium going to be juicy next week as well ?
2021-06-04 15:53:33,wallstreetbets,I may or may not have been one of those short people.

2021-06-04 18:16:07,wallstreetbets,I bought in on Wednesday morning expecting it to go up the rest of the week but am now at a 12% loss. Hopefully reinforcements arrive Monday and we can launch BB successfully.
2021-06-04 18:18:25,wallstreetbets,9 shares at 11 cuz I'm poor but nice price

2021-06-04 18:23:14,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget to grab some dip when the store opens on Monday.

2021-06-04 19:46:22,wallstreetbets,Look at the trading volume of all these meme stocks! They’re desperate! I’m in BB and SNDL. Going to sell some stocks to add to my positions!
2021-06-04 12:27:07,wallstreetbets,does anybody know exactly why they are buying BB? y’all fucked the entire movement up for AMC and i’m mad disappointed
2021-06-04 15:33:21,wallstreetbets,It's almost as if BB isn't the play.

2021-06-04 12:55:39,wallstreetbets,Probably needed to have like 3 or four more ppl buying.  Get on it!
2021-06-04 12:35:58,wallstreetbets,"I get the 💎🙌 memes. Heck, I’m still sitting on GME waiting for the 🚀🌕, but I’ve also learned from some glaringly obvious greed mistakes owning GME. Take gains off the table so you’re playing with house money. I took my 100% gains off the table and bought more sub 15. Sure this is a casino, but who the hell puts it all on black at the roulette table and lets it ride until they lose? Take gains then buy the dip with winnings. 

Not financial advice. Just an idiot that doesn’t mind seeing green in his account every once in a while."

2021-06-04 14:13:59,wallstreetbets,"This is the way.

But honestly, being here will teach you the value of holding -90% until it’s +69420%"
2021-06-04 16:34:44,wallstreetbets,Best way to learn is with a small amount so no worries. Options Profit Calculator is a good place to visualize where you’ll make your money back. Remember with options the enemy is mainly “Theta” or time decay occurring. So each day we don’t moon is also bad
2021-06-04 19:31:46,wallstreetbets,"+5 $21C 9/17 for me, down almost $900 so far, but I’m confident it’ll be back up in the green well before expiration.

2021-06-04 18:04:16,wallstreetbets,Don’t feel bad. I bought at $22.89
2021-06-04 18:04:12,wallstreetbets,I know how you feel 🙄
2021-06-04 18:15:44,wallstreetbets,I'm down double what I was up yesterday. All I can do is laugh about it because it's money I'd otherwise do something more retarded with.
2021-06-04 18:52:54,wallstreetbets,Damn you!  I only got in at 16.40...you lucky bastard!
2021-06-04 12:37:00,wallstreetbets,"We'll see, but I like to see"
2021-06-04 12:40:37,wallstreetbets,that's what everyone yesterday was saying about BB today
2021-06-04 15:38:07,wallstreetbets,"$1.37 cash in my trades account so I'm in as much as I can be. Your friend, the monke."

2021-06-04 18:39:22,wallstreetbets,"You'll pay the bills. the lull wont last.

Early next week watch the buy galore barge in."
2021-06-04 18:27:02,wallstreetbets,"Depends on if that's money you can afford to lose.

It's common for stocks, especially memes, to drop on Fridays and go up on Mondays. But that's not any kind of guarantee.

If you lose $1000, would your reaction be ""fuck, that sucks"" or ""oh fuck, I fucked up""? That's the real deciding factor."
2021-06-04 14:16:18,wallstreetbets,Rent? What a waste.
2021-06-04 18:33:51,wallstreetbets,Correct! Buy'em and keep 'til it rockets.

2021-06-04 13:58:17,wallstreetbets,Ill take 1% over -10% lol. And its gotta start with 1 before going to 2 and to 100.
2021-06-04 12:26:30,wallstreetbets,I got the 10 06/18 I feel yah lez go!
2021-06-04 17:13:21,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't touch it. When AMC broke, so did all the squeeze plays. Meme stocks trade together due to the algorithms and it can be quite a while before they pop off again. If it finds a new floor it might be worth looking into, since GME and AMC exploded once again after finding a new floor due to the shorting that made them crash hard. Most of the subs try to make people bagholders imo, similar to youtube comments and StockTwits it mostly attracts perma-bulls and you would think stocks rise every fucking day."

2021-06-04 15:46:42,wallstreetbets,Im only up 15k on bb as I bought on 6 dolla and sold at 20 coz someone here said that was the price target then I bought again on the way down and now im keeping it untill 30+
2021-06-04 12:37:50,wallstreetbets,"All good. I did that with AMC I took my investment back and I’m holding the line and only putting up gains for the stocks now. So I’m safe at least from total annihilation. I obviously want to stick it to the Wall Street turds but to continue doing that, you need to cash out at some point and buy some dips."
2021-06-04 12:43:45,wallstreetbets,Thats all good until it doesnt dip anymore and you lose money by buying back.
2021-06-04 19:20:32,wallstreetbets,"So all in on black. Win once. Pocket. Then full press all in on black until lose everything. Rebuy and repeat. 

Got it"
2021-06-04 13:20:28,wallstreetbets,🙌🏻
2021-06-04 12:30:50,wallstreetbets,Still holding strong on both it’s just hovering. I’ll take that over a hard crash. People buy up as soon as they sell so we’re at least maintaining.
2021-06-04 19:47:55,wallstreetbets,Holder like Eric
2021-06-04 15:01:28,wallstreetbets,🙌🏻
2021-06-04 19:53:43,wallstreetbets,I bought more today. Next week looks to be a good week but they keep cheating us. We would be qt or close to 200 by now.
2021-06-04 12:28:02,wallstreetbets,I didn’t tell them to buy. I have “friends” “people” “family” buying on their own volition. You clearly can’t read efficiently and have nothing valuable to contribute. ✌🏻

No, but in all seriousness. I just assumed by the recommendations and what I’m seeing it would continue small gains at least. I’m still riding dirty with BB."
2021-06-04 16:33:57,wallstreetbets,Should I extend it to Monday?
2021-06-04 19:51:46,wallstreetbets,Do I have to carry this bet over to Monday?

2021-06-04 19:49:22,wallstreetbets,I have a diverse portfolio and I have been in BlackBerry since it was RIMM. I’m not a bot I just believe this is big institutions scaring retail investors so they can load up before it takes off
2021-06-04 18:22:10,wallstreetbets,Thank you for this advice!  Checking it out right now.
2021-06-04 17:18:00,wallstreetbets,Dont forget in the case of meme stocks you gotta worry about iv too
2021-06-04 14:38:45,wallstreetbets,Hold and buy the dip or diamond hands to the moon

2021-06-04 19:30:03,wallstreetbets,It’s weird seeing good advice on here
2021-06-04 14:33:17,wallstreetbets,Paper hands put rent money into stocks.
2021-06-04 13:40:38,wallstreetbets,Dropping all of the paper hands who are shyting themselves off a short term loss.  Losers.  Good for BB!
2021-06-04 16:15:01,wallstreetbets,Smart person right here. Similar-ish to AMC last Friday
2021-06-04 17:30:29,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I already bought BB should I just sell? Wish I saw your reply before I purchased
2021-06-04 14:20:45,wallstreetbets,Chill out Jeff Bezos
2021-06-04 15:39:38,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, guess I was expecting a pop."
2021-06-04 12:42:12,wallstreetbets,i just put my money where my mouth is and bought a shit ton of BB puts
2021-06-04 16:08:35,wallstreetbets,Me too
2021-06-04 13:58:46,wallstreetbets,True YOLO is betting on green.
2021-06-04 13:41:09,wallstreetbets,"I don't play much roulette, but isn't an opposite color in your quadrant just a push?  Three $10 bets, you win one that pays 2-1 and lose the other two..."
2021-06-04 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,"Key part for you was getting in at least part of your position at 6. That’s much different from some of the folks jumping in close to 20. I completely agree that this is going to go up eventually, which is why I bought back in with house money at 14-15. People legit thought weekly 30c were a solid bet when it spiked to 20 though. The only reason to make that trade is greed. Those are the types my suggestion is for."
2021-06-04 18:21:42,wallstreetbets,"Wish I'd bought a while back, but I bought at 16 when it dipped, and plan to hold. If there's a surge, great. If not, I think BB will go up in the long term. Trying to time the bottom of the dip is a recipe for disaster."
2021-06-04 19:00:57,wallstreetbets,Nice play man. Better to profit instead of bag hold
2021-06-04 15:14:53,wallstreetbets,"You're safe from inhalation, but are you safe from annihilation?"
2021-06-04 12:50:44,wallstreetbets,"Key point though is to not let FOMO drive you to buy back at absurd levels. I made just over 100% selling AMC weekly covered calls for the last few months. They triggered last week and  sure it stung a little but I already made money back and they triggered at a 60% gain. Did I get a little trigger finger itch to buy back in? Yes. Did I pull it? Hell no, that ties back into the obvious greed lessons learned mentioned from GME. 

I did get lucky and rolled those gains into BB to add to my position on a dip. Hence when BB shot up to 20 I took winnings off the table. Had it continued to accelerate upward I wouldn’t have bought back in either."
2021-06-04 12:39:06,wallstreetbets,"Ahh I see, never been to a casino before eh?"
2021-06-04 15:34:55,wallstreetbets,Did edit your square meat post to this?! Lmaooo savitarr suck my nuts

 Actually at 10 stocks now, just cause my monkey brain likes the bigger number"
2021-06-04 13:02:52,wallstreetbets,"Hell, I bought 100@$19 this is the way! Feeling a bit of FOMO bite but I’m not worried. I can hold this for years"

2021-06-04 14:35:26,wallstreetbets,"$2,300* Godspeed"
2021-06-04 13:48:48,wallstreetbets,"I had this other stock (LEV) and it went down 20% the week after i bought it. I was like ""fuuuuck"" but didnt sell. Today im up 15%."
2021-06-04 15:02:20,wallstreetbets,They will buy back in at $24 and drive the price up for us
2021-06-04 13:45:42,wallstreetbets,"Exactly what I think lol, without them the stock will go up next week for sure"
2021-06-04 17:19:11,wallstreetbets,nobody should be surprised a meme stock drops on a friday. Smart money doesn’t want to hold something that volatile through the weekend when they can dump with whatever profits and check sentiment monday.
2021-06-04 17:57:32,wallstreetbets,"I don't want to give financial advice. Do you believe the stock will rise then hold if you think it will fall then sell. Sometimes it pays off to hold a position, sometimes it doesn't and the money is better spent elsewhere. If you don't believe in the company I find it almost impossible to hold the stock when it falls in value below my entry price. But I learned that the hard way."
2021-06-04 14:24:56,wallstreetbets,I think you mean homeless Joe Beezoff thank you very much
2021-06-04 16:15:46,wallstreetbets,That will be Tuesday most likely :)

2021-06-04 17:03:10,wallstreetbets,All in on 23
2021-06-04 14:09:16,wallstreetbets,Yes lol
2021-06-04 14:49:20,wallstreetbets,"You break even. Now if you get quadrant *and* color, you make money. It's slow, but you lose money slower and have a better chance to gain."
2021-06-04 18:53:43,wallstreetbets,"WSB has been saying its going to go up eventually for over 12 months now.

BB and NOK barely seem to move. I'm genuinely surprised BB has even jumped what it did this past week so it's no surprise it's on its way down.

For most people they've been holding for months and will have taken the gains from $5 - $6 offerings whilst they could.

BB wad a great alternative back in Jan for people who missed the GME train."
2021-06-04 15:36:50,wallstreetbets,Haha 😳 Thank you!
2021-06-04 14:01:13,wallstreetbets,"I bought BB at 11. FOMO’d back at 19. 

Point is, skushi is right on. Do what their saying."
2021-06-04 14:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Another mistake is not going all in from the start (of what you want to bet in total). So in other words, feeling your way through and buying a little to have skin in the game and see what happens to maybe buy more later is the best way erode your gains. 

If you’re betting 10k this year on this shit, fucking buy 10k at whatever seems like a possible temporary bottom to you and sell at some arbitrary number. Rinse and repeat. It’s a more safe way to make a shit ton of money even if you miss the rocket ride."
2021-06-04 18:24:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I made some money on AMC, sold at over 60, bought back in at 50.  Think I might have fucked up, but the worst case scenario is that I lost my gains."
2021-06-04 19:51:50,wallstreetbets,I wish I had sold my gains on AMC on Th. I held thinking it would get higher yesterday. Now holding till next week and thrn I will. Hope it pays off.
2021-06-04 12:40:37,wallstreetbets,Me retard. Me no casino. Me only know buy and hold and me lost sell buttons 🙌💎🚀
2021-06-04 15:39:13,wallstreetbets,Thought I’d throw you a compliment at the end there.
2021-06-04 15:25:02,wallstreetbets,More shares ==> more profit 🙏
2021-06-04 16:04:48,wallstreetbets,200@17€ - no worries either
2021-06-04 18:25:24,wallstreetbets,It happens to the best of us

2021-06-04 14:50:47,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't, he just wants others to buy in so he can get out. He is probably down a lot. That's why people tell others to diamond hands. Cuz if you sell you make them lose more"
2021-06-04 13:25:57,wallstreetbets,Solidarity 😎
2021-06-04 14:47:05,wallstreetbets,Niiiiice!
2021-06-04 18:14:46,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low. I wish I were their broker."
2021-06-04 16:24:24,wallstreetbets,Right on...I’ll be holding regardless.
2021-06-04 17:24:18,wallstreetbets,That's my bitch #23red
2021-06-04 19:44:00,wallstreetbets,"i was holidng AMC for months until it spiked up. BB should be no different just takes people to give a shit about the stock. NOK is so diluted, every ape should be 10k shares min."
2021-06-04 17:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, from the outset I lhave money set aside if I need to average down. Don't need it and gain? Great. Need it? Doesn't cost more than you already allocated."
2021-06-04 15:50:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud

2021-06-04 18:21:00,wallstreetbets,Oh look. It's down in the aftermarket
2021-06-04 18:26:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes? That was obvious, it wasn’t coming back on a Friday."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMCarmy DD, Round II. BUY THE DIP! # Why buy AMC?

That’s a good question. Let’s answer it.

# _____________________________________________________________________

1.) COVID vaccine rollout is almost over, and almost everybody in the United States who wanted a vaccine has gotten one. [63% of all U.S. adults have received at least one vaccine, deaths and case numbers are bearish](https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#datatracker-home)

2.) **All** [**AMC**](https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/ct-ent-movie-theaters-reopening-0123-2021) **theatres** [**are open**](https://www.amctheatres.com/amc-safe-and-clean#locations) with social distancing and mask measures in place. The food services and concessions are back as well.

3.) **Consumers have a sentimental connection to movies. They will come back**. People are starved for the outside world and will come out in massive hordes to watch movies. People will go out and see movies, take their kids, go on dates, etc. Nothing can replicate the experience of a giant screen and surround audio. I’ve already seen 5 movies at AMC since getting my first vaccine.

4.) This major influx of blue balled movie goers will cause a major boost in 2021. Then we will see a continuation of the year over year growth we have been seeing since 2012.

5.) The AMC business model is working. The revenue has steadily increased since 2012 year over year. [**In 2012, they made $811 million. In 2019, they made $5.47 billion.**](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206959/revenue-of-amc-theatres/) There has been a steady rise. **THEY ARE NOT IN DECLINE.**

6.) I understand they have many loans, but it is something that can be paid off in a few months with fundraising, and increased profits in 2021.

7.) They will not go bankrupt. They have made it through this pandemic, and the light at the end of the tunnel is near.

8.) It’s extremely cheap right now because everybody is shorting, and there’s a pandemic. Corona is only temporary. Everybody thought GameStop was going to go under, until we showed them. Remember that.

9.) If there is interest or heightened trading in the stock, AMC can dilute shares and sell them to help finance operations, grow the business, and pay debt, using runway from stock sales. AMC just did this yesterday, and they can do it again if needed. Adam Aron is capitalizing on the situation to secure the long-term future of his company, and management is making the right decisions. **Dilution is not a bad thing.**

10.) Not only has bankruptcy been averted for AMC, but [**they also raised $587 million yesterday**. They can now start growing their company and eliminating burdens.](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/03/amc-says-it-has-already-completed-share-offering-raises-587-million.html) Most of this new liquidity comes from issuing new shares, as described in 9. They are also planning to do debt/equity swaps, so those who take out debt can hold shares in the company, and AMC won't get fucked over by high loan payments.

11.) [AMC is about 20% shorted](https://www.wsj.com/market-data/quotes/AMC)**, there is still good potential to cause a squeeze**. However, there are still many more reasons to invest in AMC beyond a simple short squeeze.

12.) AMC does very well when it is not pandemic. $5.4 billion in revenue last year, and there will be many movies, as well as many moviegoers that come out after the pandemic. Especially with major franchise movies, which have been delayed. This year is going to be [""the best year for movie releases in a long time""](https://time.com/6047564/summer-movies-2021/), with big releases like *F9*, *Shang-Chi & The Legend of the 10 Rings*, *Black Widow*, *Nobody*, *A Quiet Place 2*, *Suicide Squad*, *Space Jam: A New Legacy*, *Cruella*, *Free Guy*, *Jungle Cruise*, *In The Heights*, and even more after summer. Both movies set to release in 2021 and 2020 are now releasing at the same time, so in one year there will be x2 as many movies to watch.

13.) AMC is dipping right now... these are discounted prices. **If you are going to buy, do it now**. A price point this cheap will never come again.

14.) GME hit $300 on a fucking squeeze. With strong fundamentals behind it as well, $AMC deserves a it's fair valuation. It's $AMC's turn.

15.) AMC has actually made money in [6/10 past years](https://www.statista.com/statistics/206962/net-income-of-amc-theatres/), in 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, & 2018. [**AMC has also increased gross profits year over year, from 2,004,200 in 2016, to 3,493,200.**](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/amc)

*(The rest of these bullet points are just jokes, so feel free to skip if you want.)*

16.) Without AMC there’s no place to spend my AMC points, and there better be a place for me to spend those points because I invested my entire life savings into those damn AMC stubs.

17.) Going to the movies was my childhood. We must save my childhood. DO NOT LET AMC DIE. Save AMC.

18.) You can take ur wife and her bf to the movies when this is over.

19.) The AMC food court literally sells tendies. (But we should call AMC tendies popcorns instead.)

20.) **STONKS only go up.**

21.) you guys are all retard who cannot think for themselves and will do whatever is echoed in this fucking internet cave.

#22.) free popcorn

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

TL;DR : CEO is raising money to secure the long-term future of AMC. They can finance operations, grow their business, & eliminate existing burdens. Vaccine rollout is advanced, and recovery is coming now. **People are returning to movies**. About 20% of shares are shorted, so we can potentially trigger a squeeze.

Pandemic recovery & squeeze combo.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

**Buy AMC. Or don’t. Your choice.**

**If you’re with us, let's save the movies. I hope you like popcorn. Get on the rocket, because you're going to the moon.**

**If you don’t, then bye bye, I wish you the best.**

""The sun is shining on AMC."" - [Adam Aron](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210125005273/en/AMC-Raises-917-Million-of-Fresh-Investment-Capital-Since-Mid-December-of-2020)

Markets are open right now and **$AMC is bullish as ever.** let’s end the week strong.

2021-06-04 16:19:01,wallstreetbets,Freshly squeezed.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Velodyne Lidar - looking out the window and finding new ways in addition to short squeezing meme stocks to make WSB greater! I have been thinking ""what if we start blowing up companies that have very good chances of being incredible investments on their own. PPL would stop paperhanding cause they would know they are doing a good long term investment.""
We can do something good for this world by investing into companies with innovative technology. We can fuel the coming of future tech!

Interested? Hear me out:

Here's an innovative technology company that the stock market analysts consider a good investment for at least the next 12 months. Velodyne Lidar, with a ticker symbol VLDR, which is listed on NASDAQ.

Velodyne Lidar Inc provides smart, powerful lidar solutions for autonomous vehicles, driver assistance, delivery solutions, robotics, navigation, mapping, and more. Lidar, which stands for “light detection and ranging”, is a technological method used to measure the distance of an object on the earth's surface. This technology is being used in the development of autonomous vehicles (AV). Velodyne is a leader in intellectual property for lidar technologies, with a vast portfolio of patents and more being added all the time. Velodyne's current market cap is $1.92 billion. Velodyne stock has declined more than 40% year-to-date, due to the general market movement since late February and also due to some corporate governance-related issues. However, there have been some positive developments in the company in recent weeks. Earlier this month, Velodyne signed a multi-year agreement with a Russian company *** (i can only post with this censored idk) Systems, which integrates laser equipment for mobile and air applications. 

Velodyne also appears to be aiming for the mass market with new sensors that are cheap enough. The company recently unveiled a new sensor called H800, which can see up to 200 meters and can apparently be mass-produced for as little as $500. 

Analysts at Bank of America think that Velodyne is lagging behind their competitor in lidar space, Luminar, in multi-year contracts for automotive/ADAS/AV series production. Velodyne's growing contracts are in areas outside of the auto space, which concerns the firm. In their Q1 2021 earnings report, Velodyne managed to beat revenue estimates but fell short on reported earnings per share. They reported adjusted earnings per share of -$0.14, which is less than the analysts' consensus estimate of -$0.12. They reported revenue of $17.7 million beating the analysts' expectations of $14.9 million. Velodyne had $350.3 million in cash and short-term investments on its balance sheet at the end of 2020, during this quarter they have increased the said amount to $383.6 million. 

Velodyne had 29 total active multi-year agreements as of May 1 and expects the number will reach 34 by the end of 2021. Analysts from Goldman Sachs target a price of $13.00 per share in the next 12 months with a BUY position. Moreover, analysts at Citigroup also have a BUY position for VLDR with a price target as high as $31.00 per share. Out of 8 analysts, 4 have given it a BUY rating, 3 a HOLD rating, and 1 a SELL rating. The stock sits at $10.12 per share at the moment, which is below the IPO price. Based on analysts' ratings, the forecasted average price of Velodyne's stock in the next 12 months is $20.33, meaning the analysts expect this stock to double in this period of time. The lowest expected price for the stock is $13 while the highest predicted price is $32. 

In short VLDR has been blowing up the past few days and it has a similar chart to meme stocks without even getting meme attention. It's also a really good investment according to experts. What's holding us back? We're not buying options, we simply buy the stock itself! Autonomous driving has so much potential and it's simple to understand that right?"
2021-06-04 13:27:07,wallstreetbets,No way. $MVIS has way more potential. Better board. Technology ready now after years in the making. Also tech is in MSFT halolens which secured 22 Billion Army contract.
2021-06-04 11:26:58,wallstreetbets,"Nah, Velodyne is under investigation for fraud.

IMHO Luminar($LAZR) is the best LiDAR pick. OP’s thoughts?"
2021-06-04 11:27:12,wallstreetbets,Man I’ve been bagholding this stock since $30. Pls fly again
2021-06-04 11:24:11,wallstreetbets,This could be the way.
2021-06-04 12:05:43,wallstreetbets,"OUST is also a good buy. Not as many hype partners, but a value play"
2021-06-04 12:44:53,wallstreetbets,"Im in an holding the Lidar Tech is not only for cars it also fits for military, Transport and boats."
2021-06-04 13:14:06,wallstreetbets,"Ford had a partnership with VLDR and they broke it off with them. Enter at your own risk.

LAZR and MVIS are probably more likely to succeed here. LAZR is much more established with a lot of good partnerships, but MVIS may have a better LIDAR (not verified yet, so riskier and caught up with meme stuff)."
2021-06-04 15:09:26,wallstreetbets,Lazr is backed by the genius CEO. Look him up on Google.
2021-06-04 15:07:54,wallstreetbets,Lazr is much better with the CEO and its technology. This CEO is brilliant.
2021-06-04 11:28:05,wallstreetbets,I never read anything about fraud? Can you show me your source
2021-06-04 11:30:35,wallstreetbets,I bought in pretty low and there is just so much potential I don't see any things that speak against it
2021-06-04 13:15:13,wallstreetbets,Gonna put in a grand i think

2021-06-04 11:32:17,wallstreetbets,Yep that’s why I ain’t selling anytime soon
2021-06-04 11:32:26,wallstreetbets,bro it's from march and the deadline was may this doesn't affect the company anymore and as far as i know they got nothing on the company
2021-06-04 11:34:00,wallstreetbets,"No, deadline to **register** is may. Trial should be sometime soon.

Even then, $LAZR has more deals signed and a larger order book."
2021-06-04 11:41:32,wallstreetbets,"I guess you have a point here I never read this article before my bad...
however did this make VLDR less interesting? LAZR and VLDR are both interesting I just favor VLDR that's it
The lawsuit obviously didn't affect them as much since they still have a solid foundation"
2021-06-04 11:45:22,wallstreetbets,"$LAZR has deals with Intel, Volvo, Nvidia, SAIC, & more. I think they’re the more competitive choice tbh."
2021-06-04 11:53:50,wallstreetbets,"Oh VLDR has endless partners too and especially those that focus on AI and then there are the auto companies. Just to mention a few: Mercedes, Hyundai, Google, Ford used to not anymore 
I mean VLDR is like the flagship of lidar tech"
2021-06-04 12:25:05,wallstreetbets,"Luminar has also recruited TSLA & INTL Execs., & did research with Toyota, and is testing autodrive features for Audi & the entire VW group, for 2021 launch."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Gotta take risks if I wanna get lucky 
2021-06-04 11:22:49,wallstreetbets,Anyone care to share their past experiences similar to what $BB is going through now to give the panickers a little perspective?
2021-06-04 11:23:09,wallstreetbets,I think this is when you take risks too far
2021-06-04 11:20:40,wallstreetbets,....but why the $43 calls?
2021-06-04 11:26:39,wallstreetbets,"This is one of the worst plays I've ever seen on this sub, like it's not even funny bad, just downright moronic."
2021-06-04 11:22:48,wallstreetbets,“Lucky” that’s your issue
2021-06-04 11:33:10,wallstreetbets,I agree...Stupid...  But imagine if it were to get to $50?  I'd love it...  I have a couple $13 calls after selling a bunch for a nice profit...  I hope you win pal.  Good luck.  But that is gambling....pure and simple...lol
2021-06-04 14:22:34,wallstreetbets,There’s no way this a bad move you guys clearly don’t know how options work u don’t have to hold your contract till it expires worthless you can sell for profits even if the price doesn’t reach $43 just with a little spike the contract price rises and u can sell
2021-06-04 11:30:59,wallstreetbets,"BB isn’t going to go up with options, your not helping yourself"
2021-06-04 11:23:22,wallstreetbets,Might as well just burn your money. Tf is wrong with you
2021-06-04 11:23:10,wallstreetbets,Where is today's $BB volume?
2021-06-04 11:34:56,wallstreetbets,I hope these print for you my dude. Too risky for my bananas.
2021-06-04 13:21:04,wallstreetbets,"AMC was at $12 two weeks ago.  It is at $51 right now.  This actually has a chance of expiring in the money, and you get to enjoy the ride all the way into the money.  I also have 6/18 $43 calls just for fun."
2021-06-04 11:31:29,wallstreetbets,Rip

I'm perfectly happy to hold this stock for a long long time. In hindsight I should have taken profit and reinvested on the drop, but hindsight is 20/20. Can't always make perfect trades. 

The fundemantals of BB are strong, and their finances are improving year after year (continuing to pay off debt, and are on an upward trend). It's currently undervalued compared to other companies that are in the same software space blackberry is, the stock has just been bogged down by its name & history.

Forget the potential ""short squeeze"" or the ""meme stock"" identifier on blackberry, just consider it a real, long term investment. They're turning a corner and  eventually its true value will be realized and the stock will be fine."
2021-06-04 19:30:12,wallstreetbets,"If you bought shares, you shouldn’t panic. The price isn’t going to drop and stay down... usually.

If you spent 100k in $40 calls expiring in two weeks.. god bless your risk tolerance."

2021-06-04 15:52:36,wallstreetbets,"Bro idk how to find it but someone bought DIS calls at like $270 2 months to expiration and dropped (I hope i'm remembering correctly) $100k and held those mfers to expiration.  Like a 99.7% loss.

I'll never forget that.

2021-06-04 17:30:39,wallstreetbets,Right? $20 strike is like $1 more. If bb gaps to $43 by June 18th OP would still lose 100% but if he just payed one more dollar to buy $20 strike he'd have $230.

2021-06-04 17:28:39,wallstreetbets,My bro don't buy that far out of the money. IV and theta crush is less the more in the money you buy. $43 strike will lose 90% of value in a week where $20 will lose 50% in the se time. Use waffles.finance so you can see how your option price will change.
2021-06-04 17:26:25,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're right, it was just hyperbole. However, it's still an awfully risky play."

2021-06-04 11:30:46,wallstreetbets,Well you're absolutely trouncing my portfolio if that's true so I guess fair play.
2021-06-04 14:21:05,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you sell? If you don't have a plan you're gonna get ruined. If you DO have a plan and your plan doesn't include selling at 1500% gains you need a new plan.
2021-06-04 12:15:31,wallstreetbets,If expiration wasn't June 18th maybe
2021-06-04 12:15:33,wallstreetbets,"Because this option says I lose all my money if the stock doesn't rise 300% in the next 2 weeks.

I will definitely send you $100 if it hits that. Thanks for the love, good luck out there"
2021-06-04 12:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much.

But I don't hold options until they expire. You can sell them at anytime.

So my strategy is usually to wait for a spike that brings the price of my options up, sell my options to someone else, and then exit.

You don't have to hold options till they expire, I think a lot of people don't think about that.

But also, I've made thousands and lost thousands, so it is definitely a risky strategy, and most people don't recommend it"
2021-06-04 14:19:52,wallstreetbets,You're 100% correct. BB lost steam and will fall back to below 10. Their revenue blows and is years away from improving. No one on this sub is gonna hold for more than 2 months let alone five years.

2021-06-04 18:31:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol okay, and now it's gone because you don't have a plan. 500% is easy on a small trade one time. Now you need to replicate for a lifetime until you can settle into boomer etfs and dividends. That's what I mean, if any trade is at 15x and you've not captured profits on a massive run up, thinking it will go up forever, then you're not going make money long term."

But does SpaceX legitimatly offer advertising services? It did launching that Tesla into space. Yet Tesla is also owned by Elon.

If AMCs, Gamestops and Blackberrys CEO decide to pay for their Company Logo to be painted on the side of the rocket as an advertising stunt would SpaceX do it? Would Elon charge a hefty sum?  Is that sum even in said companies advertising budget? One can only speculate."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I worked in the Investor Relation department at CLNE. I am going all in!! Let's do this baby! Back when I was a shithead college kid looking for my first job, I met the CEO of Clean Energy Fuels. I was an Oil/Gas Major and looking to crack in the industry. Mr. Littlefair, the CEO, was an all-time cool guy. After our conversation, he introduced me to their CFO at the time, Rick Wheeler, and said ""Rick, this kid is smitten to get into the industry."" It was so smooth.

They offered me a job on the spot, and it was the best working experience I have had to date. I couldn't imagine if I would have been in the IR department the last two days watching this stock bubble up on WSB. I moved 99.98% of my Robinhood portfolio to CLNE this morning.

Let's get it you apes. This company is nowhere near the size of the typical meme targets and has a decent short interest. We can really make this go to the moon.

If anyone has any questions about Clean Energy, the company, the management team, etc. Please AMA. Because I worked under the Head of IR, I sat on the C-Suite floor with the Chairman, CEO, CFO, COO, Head of Strategy and BD, and Chief of Counsel. I sat in on the earnings calls with analysts, prepared their 10k's, etc,

&#x200B;

I LOVE CLNE!!! So do past presidents!

And love you Mr. Littelfair, I will always be indebted for you giving me my first shot ! He has the biggest balls of any CEO  I have ever met.

Amazon signed a huge deal for Clean Energy to supply this fuel. The deal also allows warrants for Amazon to purchase 20% of CLNE at a price of 13.49/each. This is contingent on purchasing additional fuel with CLNE so they vest as in various tranches, up to $500 million.

2021-06-04 16:35:28,wallstreetbets,"Except that it’s not. You don’t need to call it green hydrogen, it’s just hydrogen. 

Electrification has its use cases, 100%. Commuter vehicles and last mile deliveries, possibly public transport depending on location but that’s about where that ends. It also conveniently ignores the fact that electrified vehicles are also inherently dirty due to manufacturing, waste, actually charging them (which is still done by fossils.) 

Hydrogen, at best, is 10 years away. And that’s from it being a feasible technology to actually be used in transportation. What about infrastructure? Decades away from meeting scale. 

RNG is here now, and is the alternative to long haul transportation. especially when the only feasible alternative is diesel. Yes, more facilities need to be built out but the infrastructure and technology is already there on scale. 

The energy reallocation cannot be a one trick pony. Electrification will not solve every problem our transportation has. It will solve some, and RNG will fill in the gaps where electrifying is unfeasible. You can’t just slap thousands of lbs worth of batteries on long haulers and expect it to work, let alone be economical. 

The “EV everything” is a great slogan and receives great marketing, but it’s actually useless when you try applying it to the actual problems that need solutions."

2021-06-04 12:39:53,wallstreetbets,Renewable Natural Gas is not a fossil fuel.  They harvest the Methane off of cow manure and landfill sites.  They convert this methane into a natural gas product to be used as a fuel in the trucking industry.  By reducing the methane released into the environment and then converting it to a low emissions fuel the whole process has a negative impact on carbon emissions.  It’s a win win.

2021-06-04 17:01:36,wallstreetbets,"I have as well, I actually took my drivers exam in a hydrogen Honda (insight? Can’t remember). 

You’re specifically referring to green hydrogen for a reason. I’m going out on a limb and guessing you’re stuck on that because a majority of hydrogen fuel today is manufactured as a byproduct of either refining natural gas or by manufacturing coal. 

Which is funny because if RNG is going to lead to its own extinction, then it sure doesn’t help hydrogen fuel by doing so as it directly produces hydrogen fuel as a byproduct. 

The green hydrogen you’re so stuck on that would be produced by solar+wind would require such an immense amount of both that I’m curious as to how you expect to achieve the fuels required for our transport industry, and at the same time power the entire electrical grid given that both technologies are geographically limited? 

Take solar. In NYC to install a run-of-the-mill solar setup on a townhome ranged anywhere from 80k-145k depending on the contractor. The panels would’ve lasted MAYBE 15 years given our lovely weather, and would’ve generated enough electricity to offset running a kitchen 2x a day for 3months of the year. 

Federal regulations are at what, 80,000lbs load limits for long haulers? Explain to me how adding at minimum 10,000lbs of batteries to these trucks is supposed to be the future of transportation? You want to cut down 1/8 the max capacity per vehicle to achieve some make believe electric trucking future? Where’s the missing capacity being made up? Who’s paying for it? 

You’re also conveniently ignoring the catch-22 that by trying to electrify the industry, you must increase the raw inputs to achieve it. I’m assuming strip mining battery components is a clean business now is it? Strip mining components for solar and turbines is clean as well, given how much more solar+wind would be needed to achieve hydrogen production that is truly “green”? 

If batteries were made by squeezing papaya peels together I’d say have at and I’d agree with you. I’d also be balls deep in papaya contracts. But the reality is just slightly different."

A similarly-used gas, coal gas, was a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide, and was made by heating coal with steam under pressure. Today it is mostly used to create synthetic liquid fuels."

Then the bit about construction costs as if alternatives could be built without resources and ignoring the rapidly improving ability to recycle batteries. The idea of 10,000 pound batteries must be based on Li-ion, Mg-S, or other low-power density batteries, look to halides for having both high energy and power densities."

2021-06-04 19:53:21,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t trying to come off as dishonest. I agree with you, solar farms in sunny desert areas are a good and efficient use of the technology. The biggest issue there tends to lie with the politics in actually using enough of the land and investing the capital needed to scale these from the small setups that currently exist into what is needed on a large scale to supply power to enough households/commercial/industrial buildings nationwide. I also tend to have the same issue with the lack of nuclear in this country. The solutions we have right now are inefficient and there doesn’t seem to be any will to make the changes on the industrial scales needed to make this work. 

I was also merely giving an example, and it was more so maybe a misinterpretation on my end. Solar works great in the southwest, but not so great in the northeast. I’m frustrated with this non-stop agenda that green energy futures must somehow incorporate solar roofs on every house in America, when the reality is if there were enough solar farms properly set up, not a single roof would need actual panels. (Let’s ignore storage issues of excess energies, as that’s a whole other discussion that I don’t believe has a solution given current tech)

Alternatives ie. RNG will need resources to continue expanding, but the base is already there.  The infrastructure is already there to go cross country long haul on the technology. Electric isn’t. The alternative is doing nothing (continue with diesel) while waiting for electric to become feasible. 

If we’re talking about SS halide batteries, they’re still quite a ways away (if they can iron out the kinks and make the economies of scale work better than what’s on the market today.) there’s batteries with higher power densities, but they’re also heavier. The big issue with weight on long hauls is that unless federal regulations increase the weight limit (doubtful) you’re taking away capacity no matter which battery set up you go with. Whether it’s 10,000lbs, or 8,000lbs, that is still incredibly expensive per load in that industry. RNG requires no extra weight on the other hand, and the existing Diesel engines can be easily converted (often times for free by the same companies supplying RNG). There’s also California basically mandating the switch to RNG from diesel for its trucking, so the rest of the country won’t really have a choice."
2021-06-04 14:46:29,wallstreetbets,I am educated sir I can see now you’re referring to calling me names which means we’ve reached the pinnacle of this conversation. Name-calling generally starts when the fax don’t support your inclination. Natural gas mined out of the ground is a byproduct of crude oil. Cow farts is methane. Burning either one creates CO2.

2021-06-04 12:03:03,wallstreetbets,NOK has the biggest market cap but lowest short % of all meme stocks.  GME & AMC have the highest short % with the highest market caps; slightly lower than NOKs cap.  BBBY has the highest short percentage but the lowest market cap.  TLDR: GME & AMC are the best plays right now.
2021-06-04 12:50:35,wallstreetbets,NOK is a grandad stock. I come to the casino for high stakes loss porn - or Lambos. I never understood why apes are interested in this long term dog. Melvin trotted this out as a GME distraction and for whatever reason it worked.
2021-06-04 11:12:55,wallstreetbets,"It sure is Titanic, and we all know what happened with that......"
2021-06-04 13:02:24,wallstreetbets,"I’ll say what I said in a different thread.

I firmly believe NOK will not make any serious price jump. I worked for them for 7 years and counting. They’ve had 5G for years, even before we had the software to support it."
2021-06-04 14:18:13,wallstreetbets,NOK has no short float. Like literally a percent or less. Nobody can seem to explain why this stock is going to “rocket” when there’s no fuel. People keep bringing up 5G... 5G has existed for YEARS now. It’s not like this is some super new thing. The contracts have already been awarded.
2021-06-04 11:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone explain the play behind NOK, it a short squeeze?"
2021-06-04 15:56:28,wallstreetbets,It’s cap is too big. But pussy stonk VIVE has just 20 million market cap
2021-06-04 11:41:12,wallstreetbets,No bitches allowed in this casino!
2021-06-04 11:43:05,wallstreetbets,My balls are in at just over $6 and would also like to see NOK break 6... not that I would sell at that number - I’ve held long enough to stick around for the ride to the moon .
2021-06-04 11:14:27,wallstreetbets,Billions and billions and billions
2021-06-04 11:24:40,wallstreetbets,"Actually, it’s 5.6 Billion 

https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=Nok&submit=Short+Quote™

And that hasn’t stopped it from going up 15% in the last month."
2021-06-04 11:22:35,wallstreetbets,So cash your fuckin Wendys check and buy a few shares. If youre worries about losing stay out of the casino.
2021-06-04 15:52:01,wallstreetbets,"I looked at their timeline and it's pretty much flat across the board for years. This was my first buy, and I sold today and moved it over to CLNE."
2021-06-04 14:07:06,wallstreetbets,How old are you if you've worked for them a long time ago? Lol
2021-06-04 11:24:21,wallstreetbets,"With a float that size its a value buy for people buying in. I got in at the 3$ range with calls at 4.5, 5, and 5.5 for next year. Nok is a roast, it cooks slow."
2021-06-04 11:30:36,wallstreetbets,The play is stay far far away lol
2021-06-04 17:38:24,wallstreetbets,bitches get stitches!
2021-06-04 12:04:36,wallstreetbets,"Definitely not going anywhere @ $6, it feels like that’s a major resistance barrier..I really just want to see this thing pop"
2021-06-04 11:16:00,wallstreetbets,Billyuns*
2021-06-04 16:12:52,wallstreetbets,Yup not what people wanna hear but there’s better plays out there!
2021-06-04 14:14:23,wallstreetbets,I said I’ve been working for them for 7 years? I don’t know if I understand your question. Also it’s not uncommon for older people to be on Reddit lol
2021-06-04 11:30:00,wallstreetbets,So u see the price being about what a year from now?
2021-06-04 11:31:13,wallstreetbets,Bc it might be the target of short attacks again?
2021-06-04 14:22:33,wallstreetbets,"$6 or so. Maybe reaching 10 by 2023 if it keeps climbing, theres gonna be heavy reaiatance the entire way up. The only positive is that it moves so slow that its building support pretty much every ten cents."
2021-06-04 11:36:35,wallstreetbets,"No, OP’s reasons for a pop in price are very weak. It’d be a travesty if ANY company didn’t outperform 2020 this year. Also, all meme stocks are up. NOK happens to be straggling along on the coattails of the other meme stocks. If you were already in as a bagholder and got closer to break even this week, then selling this week was the play."
2021-06-04 15:12:00,wallstreetbets,Heavy resistance because of shorting?
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is LEV poised to squeeze? SI really high apparently. First time poster here. Apparently the short interest on LEV is really high 87%? as of now. I am no expert and don't know where to verify, so can anyone savy take a look at this stock?!

They are currently building EV trucks in Quebec, Canada.

I've seen their trucks being prepared in a shop for a local Zoo as safari buses.

2021-06-04 11:00:12,wallstreetbets,"Where do you see 87% short interest?
According to marketwatch, they have 5m shares short interest (as of last month) with a float of 188m. Seems more like 2-3% SI.
I have some shares of it, but its no short squeeze candidate by any means"
2021-06-04 11:01:25,wallstreetbets,Don’t see it either LOL
2021-06-04 11:15:07,wallstreetbets,Why is the price as high as it is
2021-06-04 11:00:46,wallstreetbets,This isn’t CLNE
2021-06-04 11:08:33,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for clarifying. It's been hyped by some users on the yahoo board.... So this means those people on the yahoo board are really just spitting numbers up...

It's really missleading retards like me..."

I'm here for the 🚀🚀🚀 and refusing to leave til I'm golden."
2021-06-04 11:49:39,wallstreetbets,"Keep holding peeps, BB got shorted a ton yesterday. Need to keep buying SHARES and not contracts. Once it breaks past $16 or so (maybe $18 and holds above), those shorts are going to be screweddddd. Stick it to those A-hole BB shorters lol"

2021-06-04 11:00:13,wallstreetbets,Call expires today
2021-06-04 14:58:58,wallstreetbets, The fact you don’t even know how options work yet you probably invested ££ in the stock market. Very ape.

2021-06-04 11:04:30,wallstreetbets,why are BB people allowed to spam here?
2021-06-04 10:59:52,wallstreetbets,Hahah he deserved it
2021-06-04 16:51:18,wallstreetbets,And AMC is to take your attention away from GME🤦🏽‍♂️
2021-06-04 18:09:41,wallstreetbets,He definitely bought those today they haven't been that low all week unless he bought them last week.

2021-06-04 11:04:03,wallstreetbets,I'm betting a rally back to 16 by end of day MINIMUM with a bang next week.
2021-06-04 11:06:13,wallstreetbets,Because they fear AMC and GME. Also if you can’t afford $50 per share I get it. Go for CLNE and CLOV. This is just like fucking Silver all over again.
2021-06-04 12:34:53,wallstreetbets,I've asked so many of them to show their positions and they don't. BB is a sham which I admittedly fell for until I started looking into the people recommending it.
2021-06-04 11:01:55,wallstreetbets,It’s sad because they think they are so right and they are splintering away from us. I guess they don’t care that Hedges can’t borrow from shorts and that investment banks are banning shorting AMC but are still allowing BB to be shorted. They literally got out right before the Gamma squeeze. Fucking tards
2021-06-04 11:43:11,wallstreetbets,They're a magic tool to make money disappear into thin air 💸

2021-06-04 11:07:42,wallstreetbets,"its just the hedge funds shorting more when we hit a breakout point, causing us to panic sell. If no one sold the next time that happened thats all we need for a breakout"
2021-06-04 11:13:11,wallstreetbets,"kinda seems like an unrealistic number. not that I would know, i’m super new to this, just genuinely curious about learning more. but the way it’s going up and down over the past few days"
2021-06-04 11:07:41,wallstreetbets,I’m heavily invested in BB but I strongly doubt.
2021-06-04 12:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Same, bought in at $12, so still in the green. Tho looks like everyone sold by now. Who knows by next week. Trusting WSB daily discussion is such a retard move"

2021-06-04 15:53:40,wallstreetbets,"The way was to sell covered calls at $40 yesterday when the IV spiked to the moon.

I did it and netted a quick 70% return on the calls then bought them back today and then turned around and bought a LOT of cheap calls because the paperhands were scared.

Now I get to ride back up and the calls are all free rolling and I still have the 2000 shares.

IV low = buy options if you have the balls"

I’m a little nervous being down about $30k right now, but I really like the company. They’re so smart, BB shorted 10% of their own shares, at the high. They’re also working on some new software and a phone, with lots of cash and low debt. 

For better or for worse, BB has been moving in lockstep with AMC for months; but especially this week. All 3 seem to have found some support Friday. BB has a falling wedge pattern going on. Also both have a Descending triangle on 1hr, which is usually bearish; but last time BB turned a Desc tri into a bull flag and jumped, from $13. So fingers crossed it repeats next week."

2021-06-04 14:50:56,wallstreetbets,"The reason is because all these cheap fuckers saw how Cheap BB was comparatively.

This is EXACTLY why AMC overtook GME. GME is too expensive. Then AMC became too expensive. So now BB.

People doing this are NOT here for the squeeze. They are here to get Theirs and leave. This actually makes the squeeze very hard to happen. 

What these dummies forgot, was that AMC is what’s Leading the pack. If AMC goes down, ALL of the other memes go down. If AMC goes up, ALL of the memes go up.

Without AMC keeping a gust of wind in its sails to keep it going, you can 100% expect all other memes to fail. This is why BB got ruined."

2021-06-04 14:44:47,wallstreetbets,"Mass buying OTM calls is how you get a gamma squeeze, which increases the price inevitably because of delta hedging. The problem isn't ppl didn't buy enough shares, it's because ppl didn't buy enough OTM calls, you can see the Bid vs Ask percentages and the Ask is losing which is not a good sign if you're looking for a gamma squeeze."
2021-06-04 15:22:26,wallstreetbets,"It actually is and even more so the past couple days.  Your comment gives me confidence that bb is gonna moon.  Jan 28 created account that randomly sifts through bb threads to insult.  Good for you buddy.

2021-06-04 16:22:22,wallstreetbets,"My guess is that less than 5% of us take the next step into selling covered calls.

It opens up a whole new world and gives you more tools to succeed.

What is even more sad is people do not realize when they FOMO into an option position with a sky high IV that it is VERY difficult and rare for the value to continue to skyrocket. 

If they FOMO into a stock they can recover but they FOMO into a high IV call position and even if the stock rises a bit the IV crush slaughters them and they have no idea what happened and feel cheated.

They were not cheated they simply failed to put in the time to understand what they are buying.

The IV dropped and the price dropped low enough on the CLNE calls today so I jumped it. The low price along with the IV that had died down allows me to enter that position with little risk and a LOT of upside potential. I could be wrong about the position 4 out of 5 times and still easily double my money, that is what people need to invest in."
2021-06-04 14:11:03,wallstreetbets,You will likely be at a loss on the 6/4 but I'm mildly hopeful for you on the 6/18.

Was going to make the same post for those buying into BB

I did 2k shares at $16 and sold 20 $40 calls and netted the 4 grand.

I am happy to sell at $40 and happy to get paid 4k to hold the shares.

Of course I might be wrong (: better you do your own research and make a decision. Look at few DDs made here yesterday and two days ago."
2021-06-04 13:38:24,wallstreetbets,"The gamma squeeze happens if the stock hits $13 by June 18th. Literally open up any options trading thing and look at the open interest for $13 strike June 18th calls. There's almost 30k open interest on that. It was 18k just 2 days ago. If this thing puts those calls ITM, its gonna gamma squeeze so hard. This isn't a short squeeze so short numbers have nothing to do with it. As for the fundamentals, look up NrdRage's DD on this stock. Its fundamental value should be like $15 at least right now. Its both a value and squeeze play by those standards."
2021-06-04 13:08:18,wallstreetbets,Gamma squeeze is not a short squeeze... this has nothing to do with short interest and everything to do with options.
2021-06-04 13:29:48,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no… this is a legitimate gamma squeeze opportunity. All the other meme stock “squeezes” were simply short squeezes. This is also not a dying movie theater or video game retailer.

2021-06-04 12:29:26,wallstreetbets,"Really? Look at the income and revenue of AMC last year,  it declined 90% or more. Now they are at thier all time high. Additionally they do not have strong fundamentals.

CLNE have made many PRs and not only with Amazon, BP, Total etc. Check their website. People are expecting future for it although it is not profitable at the moment, but it will be in the future."

2021-06-04 12:49:37,wallstreetbets,0% of what you said has anything to do with a squeeze.

2021-06-04 13:11:12,wallstreetbets,"You really need to learn and understand what makes a gamma squeeze. There are at most 20,000 OI contracts between here and $13 and I’ll bet they are at least 50% hedged already. So maybe 1 million shares need to be purchased and the float is 150 million. Math hurts."
2021-06-04 16:20:54,wallstreetbets,"There’s 22k so that’d be 2.2 mil, plus the 3 mil @ $13, so 3.4% of 145 mil float. F."

Once the hedges give up on trying to keep the price below $50.. the stock should easily push towards $55 - $60, that puts the $70 strikes in play before today’s end...  $65 will be today’s sweet spot.. as the price approaches $65 shorts will start closing positions to limit losses.

2021-06-04 18:50:01,wallstreetbets,No it’s not. Have an exit strategy and know exactly what you are willing to risk (aka lose)... these are technical and momentum trades. There is a strategy and traders are taking calculated risk with these trades. Don’t spread yourself too thin. Pick a couple of stocks and study how they move. When you get comfortable set an entry price and an exit price... no one every guesses the top or the bottom correctly... most of all if you want to take a long position then you really need to understand the fundamentals and understand that there is no guarantee of what the future stock price may be... apes are not financial advisors.. most are people that understand math.. and calculated risk... most important.. leave your emotions at coat check.. these rides are wild.. cause anxiety.. and if you are smart you’ll make some money if you can be disciplined... this is not financial advice
2021-06-04 18:52:45,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the not financial advice. My mistake was that I had the thought of ""I can afford my engine if I sell this now, but let's see what happens tomorrow!"" and then it dipped pretty bad.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$SOFI is the most anti-Robin Hood play a retard could make today. SOFI is down below its market debut and it's a pretty great long term investment. Once their bank charter is approved they will essentially be the 21st century version of Chase. Full blown app banking made for the average retard. They have super solid financials that are going to go up over the next few quarters. Not only that, but they own Galileo which is what a lot of fintech companies use to conduct their business. [https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818874/000110465921069505/tm2116935d1\_425.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001818874/000110465921069505/tm2116935d1_425.htm)

The biggest reason WSB should care though is that they are the anti-robin hood play. Robin Hood is expected to go public soon at an estimated valuation $40 billion which would translate into $40-$50 a share when the RH IPO. If Robin Hood makes all that money, they could easily just buy SOFI out and then rule the fintech sphere. They would be unstoppable for the next 20 years. Only thing is SOFI makes more money per quarter than RH. SOFI is also trading well below RH's valuation despite having better quarterly financials than RH. SOFI is just straight up worth more money that it's currently trading at. No worries about short squeezes, just drop your money in, wait 6 months to a year and it'll double!

Speaking of Short squeezes though, it's current short float is at 39%. [https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sofi](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=sofi) The only problem with the short squeeze play with SOFI is the PIPE investors are probably a fair share of that short float and will just use their incoming shares (sometime around late june/early July) to cover their positions. There's still a chance for a short squeeze, but all of WSB would have to invest today for it to happen.

TLDR: Buying SOFI stock now is the best bet to make sure RH never takes over the fintech sphere. Also, it'll probably double your money in a year."

Projected revenue of nearly 1b for 2021 and great YoY growth. Also EBITDA positive recently, it’s quite rare to find a good growth company with a real product, revenue and being EBITDA positive."

NOTE: FDA has not approved the 180 day device yet, so when approval comes the price can be pushed much higher!

Study results:

* Overall mean absolute relative difference (MARD) against reference value was 9.1% for the primary sensor over 49,000 paired points and 8.5% for the SBA sensor over 12,000 paired points.
* The percent sensor readings within 20 mg/dL or 20% of reference values (20/20% agreement rate) were as follows:
   * Across the full 40-400 mg/dL range, the agreement rate was 92.9% for the primary sensor and 93.9% for the SBA sensor.
   * In the hypoglycemic ranges of 40-60 mg/dL and 61-80 mg/dL, the agreement rates were 89.4% and 92.2% for the primary sensor and 96.5% and 96.8% for the SBA sensor, respectively.
* Confirmed hypoglycemic alert detection rate was 93% for primary sensor and 94% for the SBA sensor.
* There were no related serious adverse events, all sensors were removed during the initial removal procedure and 1.1% of patients had a mild infection at the procedure site.

“We are very pleased with the results of the PROMISE Study which demonstrate an excellent safety and accuracy profile for the 180-day sensor. This study was initiated December 2018 and we’re very grateful to the tireless Clinical Investigators and the devoted study subjects for participating in this important clinical trial,” said Tim Goodnow, PhD, President and CEO of Senseonics. “As we await hearing from the US and European regulatory agencies concerning our pre-market submissions of data from both the primary and the SBA sensors, we are pleased to continue to offer the Eversense CGM systems in both the US and Europe with our commercialization partner, Ascensia Diabetes Care.”

I was there back in November of 2020 for my birthday and there was a little life left but I think with the changes to restrictions and people wanting desperately to go and do the things they couldn’t for almost two years Vegas will come roaring back. 

Are casino stocks poised for a breakout as more restrictions are lifted? MGM has been on a steady climb over the last year. Cesar’s and Wynn resorts have also performed well. Opened up some MGM options contracts with an August expiry. What do you all think, is it breakout time?"

Red Rocks Resorts.

Listen to their earnings call from May. Everything about it is bullish as fuck.

They used q1 2019 for guidance - instead of going for a quick, easy comparison to be like ""look at how much better we're doing from 2020 (when everything was closed!)"" They used metrics from a fully functioning economy...

And beat earnings nearly 5x what was expected.

They posted that during the pandemic they were the only Vegas chain to reduce debt, as opposed to taking it on...

And even more big dick? They paid less in taxes and used that money to buy back shares. While that share buy back is done now, that's inclusive of some healthy company financials.

Volume is cut in half daily, and it's fluctuations are all market driven. 

I fully expect this stock to hit $60 before the economy shits itself."

Just buy PENN.

Same with DKNG.

LVS is my all-time favorite casino stock BUT they have sold all their Las Vegas casinos and are focusing 100% on china. Also Sheldon died, even if that means they might go online (which is very good). I do not know if they will bring back their dividends (Sheldon ☠️), so.. I don’t know about LVS.

New average price, factoring in premium if BB is under $20 on 6/11 = $14.84. 

Am I doing this right mom?"
2021-06-04 11:33:46,wallstreetbets,You just learned why you buy stocks and not options.

2021-06-04 11:04:21,wallstreetbets,good luck bro. if BB reaches $30 by your expiry date I'll suck my own dick. I do think it is going to reach $60+++ but it will takes weeks maybe a couple of months. Everyone is too focused on AMC right now.

2021-06-04 13:49:38,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck would you buy an option that far out of the money with that premium???

2021-06-04 17:09:48,wallstreetbets,"I've been bag holding 600 since 20.70, and was able to sell 6 covered calls yesterday for $5. I actually like bb longterm, so I won't be sad if it cools off till end of next week. $3k in sweet tendies and I get to keep the stock is a win in my book!"
2021-06-04 17:11:47,wallstreetbets,"IMO it's just the inverse beta of most meme stocks  that led to the slow-declines today. I think general market fud shot these guys up this week, but for some reason investor confidence was a bit stronger today. no idea what'll happen next week"

2021-06-04 17:47:16,wallstreetbets,What’s the delta on those?
2021-06-04 17:50:07,wallstreetbets,Assuming your delta is .5 BB would need to go up 6.5-8 dollars to break even. But your delta is probably lower.  Are you planning on rolling them out a week?
2021-06-04 17:54:22,wallstreetbets,Big oof

2021-06-04 19:36:02,wallstreetbets,I love it when all of WSB is bullish on a stock one day and then the next day people are posting pics of loss porn.

2021-06-04 15:34:25,wallstreetbets,what's the play here? shares or call options?
2021-06-04 15:43:10,wallstreetbets,Nope. BB was a bust today 💩 More talk. No action.

2021-06-04 10:47:43,wallstreetbets,"Keep holding m8. Im tryin my best to buy more and hold the line. Just dont sel your position, or you literally might be the sell that drops the price one cent, which causes mass panic and leaves all of WSB broke."

2021-06-04 12:00:50,wallstreetbets,Literally cannot go tits up.
2021-06-04 18:08:13,wallstreetbets,What makes you say this ?
2021-06-04 10:46:50,wallstreetbets,"Way more likely people will say “now that we are at 10, is it possible to recover my money at 15..."
2021-06-04 12:29:02,wallstreetbets,I got 500 shares at 12.50.  Sitting in the rocket picking my nose until it takes off.  Wont paper hand it this time like I did with AMC (14.25 sold at 12.50).  Take me to the moon please.
2021-06-04 13:59:43,wallstreetbets,But that happened two days ago. It's over
2021-06-04 18:02:28,wallstreetbets,I’m at $17.29... trying to average cost down until you apes can come pick me up
2021-06-04 12:21:10,wallstreetbets,You forgot a couple of these!!!! 00
2021-06-04 13:15:16,wallstreetbets,The show must go on!!!
2021-06-04 17:49:48,wallstreetbets,These sells are just stock transfers from paper hands to diamonds hand. This is good.
2021-06-04 17:19:21,wallstreetbets,72 shares @ $14.03. I’m right there with you!
2021-06-04 16:21:17,wallstreetbets,Honestly it would be smart to sell with a profit now and then just buy even more shares with the additional profit.
2021-06-04 12:02:49,wallstreetbets,Your future self will thank you
2021-06-04 10:41:43,wallstreetbets,didn't use my paycheck but doubled down on $BB

2021-06-04 14:09:18,wallstreetbets,So thats why it dipped![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|disapproval)
2021-06-04 11:05:42,wallstreetbets,"Just added another 100 myself, up to 500 plus 10 contracts"
2021-06-04 19:50:28,wallstreetbets,1000 share gang 😎 don’t care I lost 3k in a single minute the pay out will be worth it
2021-06-04 13:42:22,wallstreetbets,That's if they exercise the contract. They bought this hoping to bank on the premium itself but they bought at the peak. You can profit off the premium without hitting break even price.
2021-06-04 10:34:11,wallstreetbets,"\*THROWS BANANA\*

OOOOOOOH OOH AH AH"
2021-06-04 10:38:09,wallstreetbets,"Enroute, some of us are just even smoother brains then some other apes on here who use investment apps that have trade windows; because we like the stock."
2021-06-04 10:50:35,wallstreetbets,"I'm in the same boat with my 6/04c $20, with a near 100% loss. About $10k."
2021-06-04 12:03:43,wallstreetbets,"New here as well, hope we both make some money! I’m afraid this is my new addiction 😂"
2021-06-04 12:59:44,wallstreetbets,Me toooo but will hold
2021-06-04 18:03:26,wallstreetbets,We’re all losing our ass. Im down 20% but planning to buy more and average down.
2021-06-04 15:13:26,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, I see this shit and I don't get it"
2021-06-04 10:55:12,wallstreetbets,Base from my experience. Just stick to shares. Options make my portfolio red
2021-06-04 11:53:02,wallstreetbets,"OP bought 7 contracts at 5.80$ premium an option. One contract holds 100 options so op bought the right to buy 700 shares at 24$ until expiration on 6/11. Also OP is a true degenerate for buying options 1 week short of expiration at this prenium. His breakeven is 29.80 (24$ strike price + 5.80 prenium), so once BB hits 29.80 OP would make 100% return on investment for every 5.80 BB goes over 29.80. The higher the premium the less gains you can make and the less worth it gets to take the risk as you lose your investment if expir comes and you never broke even. Basically if everything works perfectly OP will make like 100 to 300% gains, if it goes expectedly he will lose everything. Completely different story if you buy your calls before everything is overhyped af. I got my Juli 15C at 95 Cents so for every 95 cent BB rises over 15.95 i make 100% return on investment if I were to exercise my calls (buy the shares at strike price). You can also sell your contracts to make money on expectations (15C are worth 4.50 even tough BB is not at 19.50)."
2021-06-04 12:04:38,wallstreetbets,I’m in the same boat. A little intimidated to get into options
2021-06-04 12:34:59,wallstreetbets,I put in 60$ I don't know anything about this shit either. Just kinda waiting to see what happens.
2021-06-04 11:34:48,wallstreetbets,They're options that expire in a week lmao
2021-06-04 10:55:04,wallstreetbets,"100% this. I didn't keep AMC or GME because I didn't think the fundamentals were there for another squeeze, but it's clear that as long as reddit and WSB and meme stocks stay in the media, people will keep buying them. And even if they don't -- it's Blackberry. The fundamentals are good whether it goes to $25 next week, next month, or next year."
2021-06-04 12:12:43,wallstreetbets,"yes and no. you should stick with stocks if you have a) no clue about options, just like OP or if you are B) late to the party, just like OP.
If you get on the boat early with some contracts you will multibag on a level impossible with stocks. If you get on late you will however most likely lose everything."
2021-06-04 14:20:22,wallstreetbets,Remindme! 7 days

2021-06-04 13:11:17,wallstreetbets,This is accurate. WSB too divided at the moment across 3+ different stocks. Let's move on from AMC and hit BB! We need to adapt!
2021-06-04 11:22:32,wallstreetbets,"Suite yourself. amc at 55 before average volume reached. Gonna be a good run for amc today. I've got shares of BB, but until this amc run is over bb isn't moving much. So might as well join us"

I'm waiting for BB to hit $30 before pulling the trigger. Buy high!"

2021-06-04 12:00:08,wallstreetbets,Ty!!!!
2021-06-04 14:16:33,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion, but options are crazy once a meme stock has caught on and gotten this volatile. The premiums go way up. If you like the stock I'd just buy the stock at this point. Then use the time to learn about options and try to get in on the next one before volatility is fully bonkers.

Not financial advice, I am an idiot."
2021-06-04 12:35:52,wallstreetbets,Ditto! I figured a $50 risk here would be better than wasting it on booze or eating out.
2021-06-04 11:59:50,wallstreetbets,Just further evidence that 99% of the people here have no idea what they are talking about.

2021-06-04 10:44:43,wallstreetbets,"Fucking Cowen downgraded WKHS today, most likely to protect his short position in light of yesterday’s move. Straight up crooks, they can broadcast this over the media to shake the masses of their shares."
2021-06-04 10:31:17,wallstreetbets,WKHS was 3rd most searched stock yesterday. AMC and F were 1 & 2. Take em all to the Moon 🚀🚀🚀
2021-06-04 10:35:16,wallstreetbets,im there with you.  Their Horsefly patent is going to make them so much money
2021-06-04 10:39:05,wallstreetbets,Let’s go 🦍

2021-06-04 10:31:44,wallstreetbets,RIP
2021-06-04 10:25:09,wallstreetbets,WKHS is never squeezing. It's a POS scam company that deserves to fall. Get in on the next real squeeze which is CLNE
2021-06-04 10:45:20,wallstreetbets,My 6/4 calls are dead bruh
2021-06-04 12:59:34,wallstreetbets,"I just read about stock timing. Monday’s are down. Thursday’s are the most down. Friday’s generally are the most up, in the last hour. The first hour of trading is the most volatile. Midday is the most stable."
2021-06-04 11:34:18,wallstreetbets,Holding
2021-06-04 15:26:20,wallstreetbets,Canoo to tendieland!💪🐮
2021-06-04 18:25:20,wallstreetbets,The play is still good for Monday
2021-06-04 10:37:42,wallstreetbets,Glad to see WKHS losses. Get in on a decent company like CLNE not this garbage scam company

2021-06-04 10:29:37,wallstreetbets,"i sold all my wkhs rn to put into BB. I suggest you do the same, no point bagholding this one the fundamentals of the company are sht."

2021-06-04 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,I'm holding out a tiny amount of hope for a late day turn around that let's me recover a small amount of my loss.

2021-06-04 10:43:37,wallstreetbets,Ignore the losers with $20 in AMC crying because you didn't hold. They'll never see six figures. LOL
2021-06-04 10:33:24,wallstreetbets,"Mate, AMC what itself when they decided to sell more. I was in AMC but moved into BB, that's where the money is and they're actually progressing technology, it's not just a meme stock"
2021-06-04 17:38:13,wallstreetbets,Leave
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,New YOLO position for $GE not weekly but a few weeks out. $14c for 6/18. No this is not advice and no I don’t know what I am doing. 
2021-06-04 10:04:27,wallstreetbets,Ill go buy a refrigerator just for you
2021-06-04 10:03:58,wallstreetbets,"You may not know what you are doing, but you do know how to make a great yolo post!"
2021-06-04 12:21:09,wallstreetbets,I have a question for selling a covered call. If you wanted to sell a covered call couldn't you set the price outside a real possibility  of ending in the money. And  IF( BIG IF ) someone bought the contract couldn't you just keep taking the premiums over and over in this case? I know its unlikely someone would buy something like this but im just trying to understand how it works.

2021-06-04 10:36:38,wallstreetbets,Used my entire paycheck this morning with $BB under $15 📈🔥📈🔥
2021-06-04 10:32:21,wallstreetbets,What’s the delta on that
2021-06-04 13:10:08,wallstreetbets,I like refrigerators and airplanes.  I got calls at $0.32.
2021-06-04 13:18:46,wallstreetbets,Good luck...$GE caused my rectal prolapse.
2021-06-04 14:08:34,wallstreetbets,Ge actually doesn't make appliances anymore. They sold that part of the company. You should buy an mri machine instead.
2021-06-04 10:14:32,wallstreetbets,Lmfao very good wow I had a hearty laugh first time in a long time
2021-06-04 13:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Correct but with a stock like GE, the further OTM the lower the premium. You may get like $2 per contract but that's better than nothing."
2021-06-04 10:15:48,wallstreetbets,Not advice. Seriously not a game.
2021-06-04 10:43:27,wallstreetbets,I’m sorry?
2021-06-04 10:35:19,wallstreetbets,Gamma and delta both at about .46
2021-06-04 14:10:08,wallstreetbets,Nice. I like great erections.
2021-06-04 14:11:32,wallstreetbets,"Ok, ill just buy a ton of lightbulbs."
2021-06-04 15:38:45,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the confirmation
2021-06-04 14:11:19,wallstreetbets,Yeah don’t sell OTM options on $GE IV is dog shit so premiums are dog shit.
2021-06-04 10:16:37,wallstreetbets,I independently bought some of these calls last night
2021-06-04 11:04:10,wallstreetbets,Tendies are imminent 📈📈 This is the way
2021-06-04 14:12:58,wallstreetbets,Those are gone too. They're more into healthcare tech and jet engines now. You could buy a wind turbine to help out.
2021-06-04 15:38:36,wallstreetbets,Yea my question was more about option trading in general not just $GE
2021-06-04 10:17:55,wallstreetbets,Ok cool. Well I feel bad. Because I scalped calls and already down 5% you must be hurting.
2021-06-04 12:24:01,wallstreetbets,im about to be a XXX holder myself @ under $14
2021-06-04 14:13:42,wallstreetbets,"Ok fine, ill just lease a god damn jet from them!"
2021-06-04 10:34:40,wallstreetbets,Hey we have a few weeks Lol
2021-06-04 10:37:15,wallstreetbets,"True but I never buy options on a strong point in a break out. Break out could lead to $16, but I needed a good retrace/weak point for my entry to make it worth while."
2021-06-04 12:50:15,wallstreetbets,You’re over my head now. I need to learn :3
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I’ll hold the bags for CLNE 
2021-06-04 10:19:59,wallstreetbets,"This is a great long term play, but a possible insane short term play."
2021-06-04 10:23:25,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is diamond, no worries"
2021-06-04 10:23:41,wallstreetbets,I have joined your bag holding gamma squeeze army

2021-06-04 10:24:19,wallstreetbets,Don’t even sweat it. You bought shares. Gonna be gooooood
2021-06-04 10:00:28,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands to the moonnn!!! People in the future going to be asking how you bought it so cheap.
2021-06-04 10:21:23,wallstreetbets,This guy fawks.
2021-06-04 10:37:31,wallstreetbets,"Nah bro, those shares are nice and cheap. CLNE will continue moving, it's just a matter of when.

The options are a bit sketch though although they touched $1.00 like 10 minutes ago so you could have got out for close to B/E although it might continue to run. We shall see"
2021-06-04 09:59:56,wallstreetbets,Half tempted to open a few cc’s with these premiums
2021-06-04 10:14:00,wallstreetbets,Where do you people get so much money
2021-06-04 10:57:39,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel any better.... 2k shs @ $11 reporting here.... =)

2021-06-04 10:15:34,wallstreetbets,Remember that the date you're supposed to look at is 6/18 not 4/18!
2021-06-04 11:04:06,wallstreetbets,"I bought 10 just now in your spirit. I won't screenshot but trust me, brother. It is all I can do."

2021-06-04 13:08:21,wallstreetbets,"In in, CLNE is going to the moon by the 18th!  


I love CLNE. I love the earth!"

2021-06-04 11:56:04,wallstreetbets,Shares are a good play on this stock regardless
2021-06-04 13:08:07,wallstreetbets,"I actually think this will blow up.. for some odd reason. The technicals make zero sense and should retrace big time, but i just don't think it wants to lol"

2021-06-04 10:00:03,wallstreetbets,"I feel you bro. I bought at $1.75, litterally the top like a fucking retard.

Hopefully I can average down."
2021-06-04 12:43:38,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is actually a great buy.  Completely undervalued at the moment, even despite the recent rise.  This due to its pivot to renewable natural gas, which is net carbon NEGATIVE.  Meaning it's GOOD for the environment, and currently being incentivized by CA.  Check out this great analysis: https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/up-3.5x-in-the-last-year-is-the-rally-in-clean-energy-fuels-stock-justified-2021-06-03

2021-06-04 10:01:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m out. It’s been fun trying to chase the dream of escaping poverty but once again I’ve been fucked and jumped in too late on account of several trading platforms holding my money that I could have invested at the start of the run. 

Later, apes ✌️"
2021-06-04 13:54:28,wallstreetbets,"dude, that diversity is not good"
2021-06-04 14:21:08,wallstreetbets,Have fun
2021-06-04 16:11:23,wallstreetbets,"I looked into this with the recent hype. Declining revenues for last 3 years, all time high in 2009 or something...how are you guys not getting taken for a ride by some hedge fund again?"
2021-06-04 15:27:44,wallstreetbets,Fuk CLNE
2021-06-04 10:19:16,wallstreetbets,im selling my WKHS and RIDE to buy CLNE. wooden ape rocket go brrr
2021-06-04 10:53:41,wallstreetbets,"based on current contracts this stock is worth around $13.50. An obvious buy. Amazon connections should give it some blue sky value too

The pseudo gamma squeeze if it goes above $13 by the 18th is just icing on the cake

CLNE is not a pump and dump. this is a legit company that has been building infrastructure and making deals for years, yet is undervalued in its market space."
2021-06-04 15:27:31,wallstreetbets,🍆
2021-06-04 10:22:07,wallstreetbets,"I have a job, and don't waste it.  thats the main secret.  live below your means."

2021-06-04 19:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Don't waste money on eating outs (once in a while fancy treat for the family is ok, but daily pizza is not !), fancy cars, and other stuffs that you do not need. Buy fewer good stuffs that last instead of many cheap stuffs that you have to replace often. When appropriate, buy used instead of new (cars for example) assuming that you know what you're doing. Think of everything in term of Cost of ownership instead of monthly payments. Instead of that $1000 to upgrade to the next iphone, buy Apple shares..."
2021-06-04 15:31:50,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot of shit going right for this company right now it’s an easy sell as of today.
2021-06-04 17:34:16,wallstreetbets,Always hard to tell but yesterday alone 8 M shares got shorted which is about twice the usual daily volume.
2021-06-04 13:47:47,wallstreetbets,More like the streets at this rate
2021-06-04 09:59:47,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down just now. But easy, yes lmao"
2021-06-04 10:03:47,wallstreetbets,what makes you think the CLNE run is over?
2021-06-04 10:51:12,wallstreetbets,CLNE about to meme and take off though. Not a good idea to get out on it right now. Have to go with the tide
2021-06-04 13:56:08,wallstreetbets,YOLO
2021-06-04 17:19:31,wallstreetbets,You make money by speculating the future. And CLNE appears to have bottomed out with good news for growth
2021-06-04 16:13:32,wallstreetbets,I’m making a quick buck (hopefully)
2021-06-04 10:52:23,wallstreetbets,Wise choice
2021-06-04 11:51:58,wallstreetbets,What do you mean by pseudo? Just curious! I'm also in with shares and calls.
2021-06-04 12:44:19,wallstreetbets,Agree with you completely.  Currently undervalued.
2021-06-04 10:33:53,wallstreetbets,Someday i hope to get there. Or get filthy rich
2021-06-04 10:07:59,wallstreetbets,Talking about the stocks at large. Even good investments with strong fundamentals don’t climb worth shit
2021-06-04 10:54:36,wallstreetbets,"I hope you get blessed with many tendies on your bet. With my dumb fucking luck it’ll tank once I buy, so. 

Good luck!"

2021-06-04 10:42:06,wallstreetbets,"Good luck.  Don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose, and don't buy lottery tickets."

2021-06-04 10:36:50,wallstreetbets,BUT I WANT PROFITS NOW
2021-06-04 14:08:41,wallstreetbets,"Always happy to help.  Living below your means is the real key, so that you can free up money to invest/gamble/whatever.  Sure, I could buy a $1000 iPhone, but I buy a $150 Android phone instead.  You know what?  They both get the job done for me equally the same.  Don't get me started on cars, man it's expensive to drive around, period.  But it gets alot less expensive if you drive an old, but reliable car."

Read about how rising cost of labor is affecting markets. Read about rising cost of goods and services. Then read about the companies, their services, their stock trend. Then read about trend analysis and patterns. Then read about the global economy and how it’s affected by the geopolitical struggles. Once you read all that. Read about options and shares. Then take that knowledge and don’t use it and blindly do random shit. Not advice don’t do that."
2021-06-04 10:42:26,wallstreetbets,"Legitimate advice, learn what the Greeks are for options, what they do, and how they affect price. Learn about IV and theta decay. 

As a young retard, I bought puts on a stock that was flying. Figured it had to come down some time. Well it did, and I still lost money. I thought it was as simple as, puts=you make money if it goes down. I ignored IV, and even though the stock tumbled, I was still down 40% on my puts even though I bought them at the top. 

Hope this helps"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why TLRY Price Action Yesterday Made Me Buy More Yesterday may have been a more nerve racking time with TLRY after expecting a huge run up for most people, as we expected TLRY to moon.

Here is an explanation for the movement from yesterday.

&#x200B;

Starting out with the first 15 min of the day, we hit our first target of 22.05 which was a big resistance level according to the volume profile. 

After fighting to continue upward, TLRY responds with heading down to 19.10 to fill the gap from premarket. 

&#x200B;

This movement from TLRY then caused somewhat of a panic to its holders due to a three-point drop, which ended with forming a flag until after hours. 

This is the best set up we could have gotten for continuation.

&#x200B;

Relative Volume was up 3.60.. 84 mil volume yesterday, 25 mil volume on average.

We have filled the gap with volume coming in. The ideal play for today is to shoot past the 22 resistance level and head for the next target at 24.42

&#x200B;

Hold strong and have patience!

2021-06-04 11:03:00,wallstreetbets,This is Ironic on several levels. I honestly think he's going to leave shareholders holding the bag. I mean right off the bat he took a huge bonus when AMC almost went bk. In comparison RC didn't even take a salary and neither did any of his new hires.....
2021-06-04 08:56:28,wallstreetbets,AMC is easily a 1k stock as more ppl now realize its non existent potential 🚀 💎 🙌🏼
2021-06-04 08:53:23,wallstreetbets,A description by him would have sufficed.

I didn't see a financial model that would lead to profit anytime soon. How am I going wrong? What am I being blonde to or blinded by? Can someone please guide me why these stocks are hot?  Is all the money being made is just from betting against the shorts placed by hedge funds? How can I help safely? I barely got into investing and would have a super bad taste in mouth if I lost it all. 

Thanks in advance! I hella appreciate it!"

2021-06-04 12:27:30,wallstreetbets,"I like when he gave a sweetheart deal to a hedge fund, granting them the shares they need to cover at a discount, while further diluting shares after pledging to the shareholders he wouldn't-during a vital runup for a squeeze.

The mechanics were never as good as GME for a squeeze and the management wanted to stuff its its own pockets and give hedge funds an out.  If you championed AMC over GME you have been a grade A moron every step of the way. Enjoy your small popcorn and some dude not wearing pants, great investment"
2021-06-04 12:27:35,wallstreetbets,Is this considered a cockumentary

2021-06-04 12:31:43,wallstreetbets,Is this a fetish thing? I feel like they purposely take off their pants to feel the thrill. Because i don't roam around without pants even when in my house alone
2021-06-04 12:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Stock up, pants down!"
2021-06-04 12:32:23,wallstreetbets,I saw this on my phone and the thumbnail confused me (because I have videos set to not autoplay because of the bug where videos from random parts of your feed would randomly play and you couldn't pause them) and I thought it he had a very red pp

2021-06-04 12:56:31,wallstreetbets,"Honest question - why would you not at least have a pair of shorts on?

I've been WFT since before COVID and have never worked with no pants/shorts. It's fine if you want to keep them off, but why not keep a pair handy to throw on if you need to be on camera? Even the same pair everyday. Just seems like something super easy to and avoid an embarrassing moment."
2021-06-04 12:56:54,wallstreetbets,he was trying to tell us about the naked shorts… by wearing naked shorts
2021-06-04 12:57:02,wallstreetbets,"People traditionally look at this kinda thing as unprofessional.

But IMHO, this just makes him legendary and helps the stock lol.

2021-06-04 12:57:12,wallstreetbets,Maybe its a sign of “no more shorts?”  0- 0

2021-06-04 13:02:29,wallstreetbets,"I bought at 15 and for a while was unsure if I'd ever make that money back. Now I'll admit I sold some to recoup what I put into it, but I still have a ton that I'm happy to diamond hand."

He couldn't legally talk about naked shorting but he sure as shit wanted us to know that it's happening. Fucking genius!
2021-06-04 12:02:50,wallstreetbets,He had to review his legal briefs first.

2021-06-04 09:35:22,wallstreetbets,Truth is so so much stranger than fiction
2021-06-04 13:12:26,wallstreetbets,Then he would have said it with his words and not with his legs.

2021-06-04 18:08:43,wallstreetbets,Do you think I should hold out to buy more? I already bought 2 more on today’s dip.

2021-06-04 09:27:21,wallstreetbets,"At this point, assume any offer for anything related to any AMC or GME stock is a scam. The squeezes haven't happened yet. What are they going to make a movie of? lol Ignore any and all of those people.

&#x200B;

edit: to the guy who asked what made me think the squeeze has yet to be squoze the deleted your comment, here is my response to you:

Go back and check out the DDs here, the AMAs, and everything else. There is plenty of information out there. You should have at least an understanding of a stock or what's going on before investing, so it sounds like you're going to fit in nicely here! Welcome!"
2021-06-04 09:46:46,wallstreetbets,This was on GME & WSB in general rather than AMC specifically
2021-06-04 10:12:08,wallstreetbets,"If anything they would make a movie about GameStop, not amc."
2021-06-04 12:00:57,wallstreetbets,They don’t need to ask you to use your comments don’t click links ape
2021-06-04 09:50:29,wallstreetbets,I can confirm that there is one account that is legitimately from Netflix and they're starting to do their research collection phase right now. What was the username that contacted you?
2021-06-04 10:38:23,wallstreetbets,"there is a group of dudes doing a Documentary on the AMC/GME situation, but they've mainly been on Twitter from what I've seen."
2021-06-04 11:06:42,wallstreetbets,They want to shoot a scene of us selling all our shares for the end of the movie
2021-06-04 11:08:42,wallstreetbets,I'm so not interested in anything covid related for another 10 years
2021-06-04 10:52:51,wallstreetbets,The My Pillow Guy could play Adam Aron.
2021-06-04 11:41:51,wallstreetbets,It would honestly be boring as fuck. Bunch of neckbeards sitting at computers watching charts and posting really tired memes.

This sounds more exciting than just going without pants"

2021-06-04 14:09:09,wallstreetbets,I do the same thing except I don't put on a button up for meetings. I just wear a t shirt. Its time to end this dress code non sense.
2021-06-04 12:15:15,wallstreetbets,Lol yes this is the way!
2021-06-04 18:22:01,wallstreetbets,"Shorts, always wear shorts. C’mon kids it’s summer time basically."

he's at that point now"
2021-06-04 11:15:52,wallstreetbets,"Because you only have to maintain an image not actually be the image, had his camera not fallen no one would of known, i did this several times for class during the pandemic. Life’s really not that serious that you have to get dressed for a webcam lmao"
2021-06-04 11:11:04,wallstreetbets,"Courageous mens don't wear pants. But in my case my legs are under my desk and even if the webcam fell, you wouldn't see my legs."
2021-06-04 11:23:21,wallstreetbets,"Because who cares, especially the ceo"
2021-06-04 11:25:09,wallstreetbets,"I wear a t-shirt style long nightgown so it's unprofessional but at least I'm not flashing anybody if the camera goes wonky. And if it doesn't it just looks like I'm wearing a knit shirt.

The comfort level also feels like I'm winning."
2021-06-04 11:44:13,wallstreetbets,"You just have an abnormally high level of diligence. Most people will show up to zoom meetings without pants, or imitate their coworkers in the same room as a VHF radio, until they get their buttholes burned by Hot Mike.

Ignore the downvotes and keep wearing pants. You're doing fine."
2021-06-04 13:10:50,wallstreetbets,This isn't the first time this has happened since covid and everyone is working from home. Seen it about 4 times now. Why get fully dressed just to sit in front of a camera that's not gonna show anything but your top half. The chances of the camera falling is slim to none.
2021-06-04 10:12:37,wallstreetbets,Something paper hands knows very little about.

2021-06-04 11:58:28,wallstreetbets,"This right here.  A masterful CEO knows how to communicate to the shareholders without saying something directly.  It wasn't an accident that he exposed the naked shorts.  There was probably an intern helping him make sure the quick camera recovery worked so it wasn't too obvious.  

If the exposure was going to be too long he might have hired a fluffer or stuffed the shorts with a sock.  That could send the wrong signal, so I think this worked perfectly."
2021-06-04 11:34:36,wallstreetbets,"Fucking absolutely.  There was nothing wrong with his phone/camera either.  And he chooses to ""adjust"" it right as he's talking about shares?  

100% an intentional message."

I know it doesn't make sense. I can't explain why they do it."

2021-06-04 16:09:08,wallstreetbets,"Well, some times I tuck my undershirt if I’m also wearing a dress shirt (to keep it from bunching up), but I went back and rewatched and the dude just hesitated for 1/2 second and kept on talking—-no “oh sheeeaat!” Or “oh, sorry about that!” No blushing, etc; so you may be on to something!"

2021-06-04 10:22:36,wallstreetbets,probably some shitty YouTube documentary
2021-06-04 09:44:57,wallstreetbets,It was after one of my DD posts that blew up over 30k upvotes.  Said their lawyers needed my consent to use it.  I straight up blocked them but I would not be surprised if there was a movie made about all this 😂
2021-06-04 11:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Lmao the squeeze on GME has 100% happened and the fact that it hasn't shows you aren't an investor, you're a gambler."
2021-06-04 10:46:17,wallstreetbets,">auspicious

A squeeze has not squeezed until the shorts cover 🚀"
2021-06-04 10:51:11,wallstreetbets,Can you give a short summary of why the squeeze hasn't happened for AMC?
2021-06-04 10:34:16,wallstreetbets,AMC hasn’t squeezed yet???
2021-06-04 13:57:14,wallstreetbets,"If they made a movie about gme, amc would be included in tha movie."
2021-06-04 10:40:56,wallstreetbets,Why not both?
2021-06-04 10:43:11,wallstreetbets,Should make video game. Instead of guns we shoot green crayons. We must band together to defeat the red inkmasters.
2021-06-04 12:42:25,wallstreetbets,Lol they don't need your permission to use your comments. You're falling for a scam.

2021-06-04 11:17:11,wallstreetbets,Why risk it? I don't want my junk seeing by the whole world especially my coworkers.
2021-06-04 11:32:23,wallstreetbets,"It's 'would have', never 'would of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!"
2021-06-04 14:17:59,wallstreetbets,"It's not just the camera falling. You might think it's off but its not. You forget you're not wearing pants and stand up. And a ton if other possibilities. You're dealing with your coworkers, least you can do is try and be a bit professional by not exposing yourself to them.

I've had my laptop fall to the floor once with the camera shooting right up my crotch. If I wasn't wearing pants all 40 of my coworkers would have gotten a really nice view of everything. Why risk that unless you're somehow strangely ok with that?"
2021-06-04 12:34:41,wallstreetbets,u/Thick-Knowledge69 said it's real. Good enough for me! /s
2021-06-04 10:21:03,wallstreetbets,"Um, anything can be deepfaked. I could have pants on right now, I might not. See?"

2021-06-04 12:15:34,wallstreetbets,"makes zero sense, since it would be helping the shorts close"

2021-06-04 11:01:39,wallstreetbets,You got salmon? They told me “we only have eggplant left.” It’s clear they lied to me and I don’t know who to talk to about retaking the scene.
2021-06-04 10:13:57,wallstreetbets,“Sure. Please transfer 200 GME shares to me and you may use my posts. Good day Sir.”
2021-06-04 09:45:30,wallstreetbets,Yeah I blocked them but I honestly wouldn’t be surprised if there was a movie 🍿
2021-06-04 11:45:17,wallstreetbets,"Lol you guys have been consistently worked over by scammers for over 2 years now at least.

But for the most part you wifefuckers are too garbanzo beans for them to make any traction (except for the silver thing, you guys ate that up didn't you?)."
2021-06-04 11:23:22,wallstreetbets,We smoothed out its meat so it wouldn't remember.
2021-06-04 10:27:04,wallstreetbets,Some dude talking over royalty free music while mom vacuums in the background
2021-06-04 10:33:04,wallstreetbets,"it was probably legit honestly. Its standard for anyone publishing anything using anyone elses content to get permission first.

Edit: there without a doubt is movies/documentaries being made about the GME/ DFV/reddit stock craze frenzy that started in january. Alot of that revolved around wsb so they're definitely going to be going around asking for permission to use people's posts and whatnot."
2021-06-04 11:23:16,wallstreetbets,I got featured in a Vice documentary about Q Anon family members because of a Reddit post so like hey you never know.
2021-06-04 11:43:17,wallstreetbets,I need to go back and read some of those posts. Sounds interesting!
2021-06-04 12:02:47,wallstreetbets,30k upvotes means nothing.  How many emojis did it have?
2021-06-04 10:57:21,wallstreetbets,"Because the rich didn’t pay what the have to. They’re losing a lot in shorts but they’re not covering it. Trust me, once they start covering the shorts you’ll know."

2021-06-04 10:35:06,wallstreetbets,How many times must I smack you before you act right?
2021-06-04 13:58:51,wallstreetbets,"He didn't say anything about a comment, he referred to his post. I didn't fall for anything, all I said is I know for a fact that they're legitimately is someone from Netflix with an account doing research right now."
2021-06-04 10:54:31,wallstreetbets,sure. post me the link after
2021-06-04 12:11:55,wallstreetbets,you can call that mental freeze

2021-06-04 15:33:03,wallstreetbets,"That's like saying never get drunk because why risk doing something stupid one time. Sure it's nice to be sure, but not at the expense of being a total pussy."
2021-06-04 13:43:03,wallstreetbets,That's enough DD for one day. All in.
2021-06-04 10:21:45,wallstreetbets,Okay fine you’re right. Happy? Jk no you’re not. I am.

2021-06-04 11:50:17,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-04 13:15:12,wallstreetbets,as long as you cover your shorts
2021-06-04 12:45:35,wallstreetbets,Can’t short sell today!
2021-06-04 12:42:13,wallstreetbets,In my eyes the shorts are evil!
2021-06-04 14:05:51,wallstreetbets,I assumed this was self-aware but maybe I'm wrong...
2021-06-04 13:45:42,wallstreetbets,There’s no way he planned it he looks surprised
2021-06-04 18:35:34,wallstreetbets,Laying here laughing my ass off and can't even tell if he's serious or not.
2021-06-04 14:22:49,wallstreetbets,I love it
2021-06-04 12:54:31,wallstreetbets,"I am scared and scarred to ask this, as ive seen the male version of it. But what inspired you to use that username? I dunno, i believe it was like 5 years ago, not even on here but on 9gag where i saw it. But have you ever heard of turtle dick?"
2021-06-04 10:38:11,wallstreetbets,"good bot, you got the idea"
2021-06-04 11:17:59,wallstreetbets,"Soooo....  
 How was the eggplant?"
2021-06-04 11:48:15,wallstreetbets,Well your anus can stretch like 8 cm or some shit. Can fit a smallish raccoon up there if you try hard enough.
2021-06-04 11:30:54,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, let's pretend we're that expensive."
2021-06-04 11:32:04,wallstreetbets,Post it as Youtube shorts and get 2 billion views
2021-06-04 13:38:12,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I’ve received a few messages like this. One from Tinder for a post in /r/Tinder to use when they were doing their success/fail story things. I replied “Venmo me 5 dollars see what happens,” they did not reply."
2021-06-04 10:51:03,wallstreetbets,I believe it’s legit it’s just that it also could be scammers using a legit thing as a ruse
2021-06-04 10:58:59,wallstreetbets,Can you give a short summary of how you know this?
2021-06-04 11:19:43,wallstreetbets,"Ok. Usually people that can't expain in a sentence or two why they believe something and instead tell you 'go do your own research' don't actually understand the research. Since if you understand something it should be easy to quickly summarize it (takes less time than replying back 3 different times to have people do their own research).

Hopefully that doesn't apply to you and someone else can explain it to me. Good luck."
2021-06-04 11:12:02,wallstreetbets,Do you know what market cap is? GME hit its top in January and as for AMC I doubt it’ll ever be over 70 again
2021-06-04 12:56:36,wallstreetbets,people talk too much
2021-06-04 16:55:35,wallstreetbets,"What an absurd analogy. It be more like saying you should never drive drunk because you'll hurt someone and you guys coming back and screaming ""live a little bro, don't be a total pussy"".


Is having your pants off that big of a deal to you? You guys are fucking weird. I'm starting to think yall just want to expose yourselves to your coworkers."
2021-06-04 12:27:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm wearing pants, but under those, i'm not wearing any pants at all."
2021-06-04 17:26:38,wallstreetbets,Well you convinced me I will buy some shares of the amc

2021-06-04 13:11:37,wallstreetbets,"In case you're being genuine, turtle dick/turtle neck refers to an uncircumcised penis. I'm not sure what is so shocking or scarring about that, especially considering they look the same when erect."

I mean ETSY! you can buy dick turtles on etsy!

Second edit: NVM, just saw what I'm assuming you referenced. I have to say, I'm jealous? Intrigued? Relieved that turtles collapse and roll over like we do? Actually, I have no idea what to think, but turtle labia and turtle dick seem synonymous now. And I can't believe this is knowledge I picked up on WSB. I'm going offline for a while to recuperate"

2021-06-04 09:34:22,wallstreetbets,In my 2 years of trading meme stocks this is a sign a bunch of sell orders are about to execute drilling the price into the ground. Imagine if the stock market crashed because of a meme.

#Hello shitheads and aspiring shitheads.  It is time to get into cow farts.  *(If you aren’t already. 😉)*


I needed a new play to continue this meme high, and one stood out above the rest, mostly because it has something that gets me all hot and bothered but may frighten and baffle my fellow primates:  

A goddamn date.  *(I know, you’re not used to getting them.)*   
**>>>>June 18th<<<<**


There’s also shit involved, which is just a bonus.


#THE SHIT  
Clean Energy Fuels ($CLNE) specializes in renewable natural gas. Like all good RNG, renewable natural gas is about taking a bunch of random (and literal) bullshit and turning it into beautiful loot.  
In this case, they are grinding for methane. From all the 🐄💨. It’s poot loot.


This is the most natural (ha!) step for the juggernaut initiative that is Green Energy which is coming nation-wide circa 2030 one way or another, even if the rest of the industry is still trying to work out an actual plan.  CLNE is ahead of the game. While 🍦🕶🇺🇸 and co. are trying to decide how much of the country can actually run on all-electric, CLNE is securing deals with a little company called AMZN and securing some huge long term revenue.


#THE (GAMMA) SQUEEZE  
I can’t believe you made it all the way through that last section on only five emoji.  Good boy! Here’s some treats before I go on.  🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌


So what is special about this stock and why the date?  
Well, some rubes went and built a Goldberg machine out of options expiring on 6/18.  If this thing goes off, there will be so much gamma squeezed out that your new green dildo will make Bruce Banner feel inadequate.
  

CLNE has a float of 145 million and had been sitting, flatter than your wife’s boyfriend’s abs, at around $8 for the past month, consolidating and getting all pent up like you when the missus goes on her weeklong trips “to the grocery store”.  
Prior to yesterday’s open, it had an open interest of 47,000 in 6/18 calls with strikes between $9 and $15.  
As of typing, that range now has 69,000 OI (nice!), 65,000 OTM, which means the squeeze potential has only increased with yesterday’s activity.
The most striking (HA!) of these numbers is the 29,000 calls aimed at a share price of $13.


Sure seems like someone knows or is planning something I don’t know about...  Either way, it is set to go off, like you when the missus...


Even before hitting that lucky number 13, calls representing 26 million shares, **18%** of the float and **500%** of the 10-day average volume prior to yesterday, should be hedged.  When it hits $13, 29 million more shares in calls become ITM and the volume beast will begin shitting out green dildos that it will consume to shit more in a shit ouroboros that will fuel the ape shit ship back to the moon.  💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀💩🚀  
Yesterday was just a preview of what will happen as more of those strikes are reached. The daily volume exceeded **600%** of the previous 10-day average and that resulted of a share price high of $9.74, **19%** higher than previous close. 

#THE PLAY  
Okay, fair warning, this part pains me to write a bit because it almost doesn’t seem like a bet, but the most safe method, and what will fuel the squeeze, is to buy and HODL shares.  You should know the drill by now. 


The reason shares won’t quite scratch the gambling itch is because CLNE’s ATH of $19 happened just back in February, and it hasn’t dipped far below its current level in five months. [It also has a price target of somewhere between $17 to $18, depending on the analyst.  ](https://finance.yahoo.com/research/stock-forecast/CLNE?symbols=CLNE&ncid=qsprelated_bl1fruji100)  
This means that even with its recent rise, there is not much downside, and the upside is huge even if the gamma squeeze does not play out.  The feeling of holding is not quite the same when there is no apparent risk of your bags being -50% for a quarter of a year before you can break even, I know, but hopefully you can find a way to adjust to all the green in your portfolio.


Shares also benefit from a possible raincheck of the scheduled event should 6/18 fail to deliver.  
While not quite as ideal, 9/17 calls have a whopping 20,881 open interest at the $20 strike which could grow into a similar situation should lower strike interest grow.  There is currently an OI of about 29,000 in the run up range from $10-$19 but it is not so nice and evenly distributed as it is on our magic date.  Worth watching though.

Overall, shares should securely keep your tits below you, if that is how you like them.


Options are where the biggest upside is going to be, and boy is there a lot of potential.  Thanks to CLNE’s month long power nap, premiums ~~are~~ were stupidly low for calls 6/18 strikes $13 and above.  A light breeze is all it took to make some of those ten baggers yesterday.  They still have plenty of room to run and premiums are still somewhat modest, all things considered.  Triggering the squeeze would send these to high heaven.

#TL;DR
Gamma squeeze. CLNE. 6/18.

***Episode II: AMC, Ape strength 🦍🤝💪***  

***Episode III: Mr. Clean 🐄💨👨‍🦲💦***

As you say , the IB's will fight like hell to keep the price at 12.99. But when you talk about the apes, you're talking about an unregulated hedge fund with over 100 billion dollars in AUM. They own 20 billion dollars worth of Raisinets alone. The reason they're so successful with meme stocks is because there are only a couple of hedge funds in the world that could go to war with them on an individual equity and win, and none of those will do it. The IB's and HF's eventually win as ape attention becomes fractured and they stop unifying, but when you get them all on the same page, nobody's stopping them. I think you're gonna see that tipping point. A sub 2 billion dollar midcap is not the hill these people are going to die on.

CLNE also has contracts with AMZN/NYC/LA/ETC (Check out their website) and is installing stations throughout the US for clean truckin'

2021-06-04 13:53:15,wallstreetbets,"New ape here in regards to proper terminology.

Been holding onto GME since December tho, so not as retarded as I am about to seem.

I have been looking into buying options and have a light grasp on the subject. Correct my small brain if wrong.
Buying call options = buy right for 100 shares at this price. I want the price of stock to shoot up so I can exercise my cheap ones, big $$$ if right.
I’m confused on the buy open/ buy close options and what is the proper call/ thing to do."

2021-06-04 12:10:43,wallstreetbets,"Amazon warrants are priced at 13.49

Current market cap of CLNE is 1.6b

CEO values the Amazon deal alone worth 1.5b+

Feels pretty undervalued at current prices, and Amazon warrants is a sign to me that that should be the floor..  but check out the DDs if you're not convinced."
2021-06-04 12:17:51,wallstreetbets,Literally anything. It could go up to BB level or it could even be the next AMC or GME given the short interest.
2021-06-04 10:09:39,wallstreetbets,I am in for +15. Diamond Handing enough shit. A few more won't hurt.
2021-06-04 12:05:26,wallstreetbets,"I’ve had positions in CLNE for a while now, avg share cost is $8.63 after averaging down, and then averaging up this week. Also been selling/rebuying for some profits while it was being manipulated during May.

But the DD is good. It’s basically the same solid info as any recent CLNE DD or from a couple months ago, only difference is the gamma squeeze wasn’t a much of a possibility until recently. Company really is a solid value regardless of gamma squeeze, which is why I originally got in before any squeeze possibilities. With the global push towards cleaner energy, that hydrogen isn’t 100% ready yet, and the fact that you can’t feasibly use electricity to transport freight means that the best alternative atm is some sort of NG. Their deal with Amazon is really good, too, and realistically should put the floor at $13.54 (+/- a few cents, can’t recall the exact price they agreed to buy shares at), but I think the timeframe for that is Q3 or Q4 this year at the earliest. Also have a few deals with Big Oil.

Tl;dr: 🐄💨 = 💰. Shares are better than 6/18c if you want the squeeze. Medium-/long-term moneymaker for sure."
2021-06-04 12:06:21,wallstreetbets,"Solid DD has been around for months on CLNE, just now getting some attention because the stock was pushed down too hard, reason there's so much OI for 13c on this stock is because $13 was supposed to be the floor after the AMZN contract"

2021-06-04 14:44:44,wallstreetbets,"CLNE has this special opportunity in it's option chain in which there were a fuckton of CHEAP ASS 13 calls (that solely existed due to previous price suppression), which will expire ""in the money"" if we end over $13 by mid June. This will force the market makers to buy millions of shares, and since the shares outstanding & float is small, any buying pressure will cause the stock to skyrocket."
2021-06-04 12:15:54,wallstreetbets,They expire worthless
2021-06-04 12:18:42,wallstreetbets,Shit fingers crossed ape

No offense.

I'm a lurker myself.  Saw trolls trying to get people to sell ape stonk to buy other shit."
2021-06-04 09:51:36,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I really appreciate any help I can get.

2021-06-04 09:15:28,wallstreetbets,"Follow up, do we expect the contract price to move in accordance with the pre-market movement?"
2021-06-04 10:07:49,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I already bought more today as it dipped off opening."
2021-06-04 10:07:43,wallstreetbets,"Your retard strength is so strong you could easily use that past retardness of the former retarded account owner to validate your full retardation in this retarded post. 

I look forward to your retarded rebuttal.

2021-06-04 13:09:03,wallstreetbets,"Did I hit a nerve?

This kind of advertising (hype) doesn't work on me, not sure who falls for it. So, maybe I'm a few blocks short."
2021-06-04 09:52:21,wallstreetbets,sorry brohan i’m a real person not a mirror lol
2021-06-04 11:20:15,wallstreetbets,"You don't even need to switch stocks. CLNE resisted $10 in Jan until it rocketed to almost $20.

Now it's sub-$10, headed back to $8."
2021-06-04 10:46:35,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong, I'm long clean energy in general and made a few bucks from CLNE earlier this year. Just right now, the chart looks short-term bearish, feels like maybe some bounce between 8-10 before it tries to break out again.

Seems like there's long-term support around 8, and support turned resistance at 10. Maybe it'll oscillate down and back up for another break out try by 6/18."
2021-06-04 18:27:41,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t mean I can’t read another generic dd claiming another big short squeeze is imminent. I’ll have sex though sure.
2021-06-04 14:54:19,wallstreetbets,You can read??
2021-06-04 15:44:44,wallstreetbets,you belong here
2021-06-04 13:16:48,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-04 19:59:02,wallstreetbets,I mean not really... Nobody here is allowed to give advice. Nothing here is financial advice
2021-06-04 13:00:31,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess, I don’t think there’d be any downside from it if it even has an effect. But I’m not rełarded enough to have a definite answer tbh.

CLNE does have a multi-year deal with the LA Metro to supply RNG, by the way. The largest transit bus fleet in the U.S."
2021-06-04 12:42:48,wallstreetbets,"You caution is reasonable.

Obviously I have a vested interest in seeing the price rise before my calls expire, but my 9/17s were bought on 5/10.  30 of my shares were bought in the first half of May. I quadrupled my position yesterday after someone else lit the fuse (a little too early, IMO).

If not for the gamma potential, my commentary would be better suited for /r/investing because the price is still barely off the floor and, in my opinion, less than 50% of where it should/will be.

I don’t need CLNE to become a meme for it to be a good investment."
2021-06-04 10:06:15,wallstreetbets,"this sub has a history of being mean to noob questions, it serves to keep people from hurting themselves with risky trades.  


Not understanding options before playing with them, you can end up owing your brokerage thousands of dollars if you're not careful.

Do your research, don't YOLO more than you can afford to lose, never sell naked options. you'll get better answers in those subs"
2021-06-04 10:24:18,wallstreetbets,Shares.  They are like super long dated options.
2021-06-04 09:17:39,wallstreetbets,"Whoa lmao same lad haha, small world"
2021-06-04 09:18:20,wallstreetbets,"Sorta. Morning is the most volatile time for contracts, so yes probably but it’s gonna be erratic for the first 30 mins or so"
2021-06-04 10:29:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah and if it dips again you can average down even more. This stock is taking off so the more you buy the better you're gonna be

You ain't lying"

2021-06-04 18:17:07,wallstreetbets,"Nice to meet you other real person, you sure you don’t want to buy the next big squeeze stonk to be an official shithead???"
2021-06-04 12:33:57,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe!

1 week"
2021-06-04 11:37:42,wallstreetbets,"No chance. Got to pick up on the vibe of the house.

What do GME, AMC and BB all have on common? They spiked in January, fell, then gained momentum and support, then memed back up again. What did CLNE do it January? Spiked. What is CLNE starting to do now: gain momentum and support. What's it about to do? Meme back up again, that's what."
2021-06-04 11:01:08,wallstreetbets,"My personal guess is we find a resting place around $10 for most of next week and then the week of expiration becomes do-or-die for that fight.

But regardless of how 6/18 actually plays out, it will still be a long in my portfolio. The only question is whether I’ll be selling and buying back in or just continuously buying."
2021-06-04 18:45:06,wallstreetbets,It’s not a short squeeze dd lol
2021-06-04 14:55:14,wallstreetbets,Come on man don't call me out in front of everyone like this...
2021-06-04 10:12:33,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! I agree. I haven’t bought anything other than amc yet. I’ve been trying to piece everything together. 

I will definitely check those out."

2021-06-04 18:18:49,wallstreetbets,"😆

surely every stock on reddit will squeeze right? *right???*"
2021-06-04 12:01:55,wallstreetbets,"It's been trading sideways and stagnant near the bottom of a channel, which was also the long-term support, at $8, for weeks; it was due to come back up. And it did, and it tested resistance at $10 (all the way to the moon at $11), then it failed to break out, and now it's falling back into its channel.

SMA 20/50/200 in a bearish stack, MACD pretty neutral, RSI > 50. Aside from the meme-ability, there's not a lot of bullish technical signs here."
2021-06-04 11:15:18,wallstreetbets,"Clean energy is the future, no doubt. There's no long-term path forward for humankind without it.

I think it'll break out of this downtrend eventually; CLNE was affected by the Jan/Feb meme-stock spike and has been returning to pre-meme levels since then. I believe in the pre-Jan $8 support line, if it can get back above $10 and hold it for a few days, I could definitely see it as a trend reversal and the end of that downward channel. Maybe a little cup and handle forming too? Not sure, but that'd be another strong buy signal.

Here's to hoping for cow farts!"
2021-06-04 14:27:06,wallstreetbets,nobody tell him
2021-06-04 15:25:01,wallstreetbets,It’s when you take off all your clothes and buy.
2021-06-04 09:49:00,wallstreetbets,"While I don’t really advise people what to buy, generally yes. It can work, and has worked for some, but I try to never buy contracts in the morning if I can help it. Too erratic movements, IV spikes, no clear techs (if you believe in that) on where the stock is going to go yet"
2021-06-04 14:34:50,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like your interpretation of my rhetorical question was the exact opposite of its intent, which is pretty impressive."
2021-06-04 18:20:07,wallstreetbets,Buy stock X please it will make you rich!! It’s the new squeeze stock!! Ridiculous how many of these there are right now
2021-06-04 12:23:08,wallstreetbets,"Meme-ability is plenty enough though, as GME AMC and BB have all proven."
2021-06-04 09:51:37,wallstreetbets,Thank you for sharing your experience. I’m down 22% already. Oh well. It’ll bounce back.
2021-06-04 18:42:44,wallstreetbets,"seriously man 🤣

i’m all for fair market & difference of opinion but i think its kind of silly how many are being hyped"
2021-06-04 12:26:29,wallstreetbets,"Easy to cherry-pick the winners.

How're TSLA, PLTR, and SNDL doing these days? RIOT? MARA? Those bags getting heavy yet?"

2021-06-04 10:37:30,wallstreetbets,Selling kills the rocket from spiking. Hold and buy BB then watch it takeoff soon. Look at what happened to AMC last week. We can recreate it for BB. Who’s with me?? 🚀🚀💎💎🦍🦍

2021-06-04 09:11:06,wallstreetbets,"Picked up more BB when it dipped, this one is good for the long run"
2021-06-04 09:24:44,wallstreetbets,"The reason why BB keeps hitting resistance, is because there are too many bag holders from the last time when it shot up to like 40$.  Those people want out!  So the moment it hits their break even or gets to an acceptable loss, they will sell.

I'm long BB."
2021-06-04 09:38:05,wallstreetbets,Everyone sold at $20 thats why its dying mf paperhands

I was also high on acid. If I lose money I’ll probably do more acid and buy another one for next week. I’ll have to ask my wife’s boyfriend for cash, but I have no ego anymore so who cares. BB to andromeda."

2021-06-04 11:09:51,wallstreetbets,"I'm a holder of BB too. Just remember, if you sell at red you lock it in. Fuck it, just hold. We know BB is a strong company and you can always DCA down eventually.   


Fuck all those people who are complaining, who went in wanting gains. That's why they're whining and bitching about BB being a fake play. This sub has always been about loss porn and people doing mental shit. So what if BB tanks, it's not like its going away instantly. 

JUST FUCKING HOLD."
2021-06-04 11:17:30,wallstreetbets,Still holding. My cousin and I. come get us at 18$

2021-06-04 10:58:37,wallstreetbets,Remember the price is only down because of greedy shorts trying to cause fear so they can cover cheaper from panic sellers.  Look through this thread and you will see that the ones who spread fud are also shorting.  One of them already admitted to doing so.
2021-06-04 11:10:37,wallstreetbets,"Bought the dip today at \~$14.50.  Nearly doubled my shares, but I'm yoloing with beer money, so it's just 18 shares total.  

May not get that fancy bourbon tonight, but I look forward to moon booze."
2021-06-04 11:14:02,wallstreetbets,It’s important to see the dips as an opportunity. This is not the sex your wife is having with her boyfriend you cannot pull out during dips.  You must bust inside 🚀🚀🚀 $BB $TLRY $SNDL

2021-06-04 11:01:13,wallstreetbets,"Can’t believe I’m saying this, as I am not “one of you” but I have a ~$5k gamble in. First post to WSB, I’m an outsider and will never use your derogatory/childish slurs. BUT... I’ll be damned if I haven’t seen what this sub can do when it wants to grab “the man” by the balls. Stand corrected on what I thought would happen w GME / AMC from the first few days of the craze... so here we are. I don’t think BB is the same but has some potential and I like the company (if not the stock from pure value at my cost basis)."
2021-06-04 09:53:29,wallstreetbets,Whelp there goes your money...

Why think some of these stonks are popping off? It’s because they’re a great DISTRACTION $GME & $AMC.

2021-06-04 08:39:39,wallstreetbets,"I said yesterday that Monday’s market closure and the bad news from amc shares offload did not help the bull run. It’s Friday so it might be slow but next week I think it should be better.

Edit: jobs report is out. It’s ok sorta, added 492K private sector jobs from the 559K added May payrolls.

Edit: 5.8% unemployment rate. The rate will continue to go down so long as States remove the additional unemployment benefits. This did not start happening until mid month in May. LFG!"
2021-06-04 10:05:05,wallstreetbets,Must be all bots paid for by hedgies apparently cuz the price action is garbage

When at a big loss, why not keep holding on? At some point it can only go up."
2021-06-04 10:02:28,wallstreetbets,How do you see this?
2021-06-04 17:27:59,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you have shorted BB and are not happy about getting squeezed.

FYI I hold AMC as well."

On top of that? An untold number of people are now on disability, possibly permanently. The Long Haul COVID sufferers and those who are just diminished forever from the illness.  


The unemployment benefits don't have as much to do with people not being able to return to work."
2021-06-04 11:11:43,wallstreetbets,We definitely should not be taking out unemployment benefits but ok
2021-06-04 10:34:09,wallstreetbets,The rate is dropping because of the vaccine and places reopening lol stfu

2021-06-04 10:47:12,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-06-04 12:44:14,wallstreetbets,Why would you nag someone for liking the stock? Did you know BB creates a lot of software for EVs? It’s a no brainer and we’re all retarded.
2021-06-04 10:48:03,wallstreetbets,This month 43 calls on June 16th

2021-06-04 17:48:39,wallstreetbets,"No way... BB has great tech that’s gonna be used in the new EV’s coming. 

It’s just obvious by now that these kind of post are trying to deter everyone. You can have my Downvote."
2021-06-04 09:50:50,wallstreetbets,Ape brain should have listened
2021-06-04 11:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Well you’re a new guy here, and don’t seem to understand our moto of buying the dip. Avg down and it’s not a problem for when it goes back up."
2021-06-04 11:35:22,wallstreetbets,Call your bank and say you need more ammo.
2021-06-04 10:28:22,wallstreetbets,"Ofc I hope it pumps up, cause I've just bought in on it. Getting in nice and early for the next big stock about to takeoff. I was hopinh BB would shoot up and hopefully helped and made a killing in the process. And anyone that listened to me on BB will have made a killing too. Now it's a chance to make a killing on CLNE which is gonna be the next big mover. Everyone's a winner here if you get in with the crowd and jump on the next train arriving at the station."
2021-06-04 09:19:45,wallstreetbets,"Honestly i've read a lot about how compared to other meme stocks, $BB is definitely a deeeeeeeeeeecent long term investment"
2021-06-04 15:38:42,wallstreetbets,"Monday comes from Old English “Mōnandæg,” named after Máni, the Norse personification of the moon. So, either is correct."

2021-06-04 09:30:07,wallstreetbets,Why don't they call me back when I don't apply
2021-06-04 09:19:30,wallstreetbets,"The immigrants wouldn’t even find jobs in construction. Projects are shutting down until the lumber prices go down. Also, additional benefits do not help the economy."
2021-06-04 09:25:19,wallstreetbets,"I know of a significant amount of people who ""got fired"" to get on benefits, and they made more money on them than they did at their job"
2021-06-04 12:22:41,wallstreetbets,We should cut by at least 25% from federal benefits. It will help in moving forward.

2021-06-04 09:46:56,wallstreetbets,There’s plenty of benefits already. But the additional cash is just for nefarious reasons. You have states spending on stupid shit and adding more government jobs.
2021-06-04 10:01:41,wallstreetbets,"There's plenty of jobs out there. Sometimes you have to change career paths. Does that suck? Yes, of course it does, however loading up the system with fiat when there's way too little production absolutely can, and indeed probably will come back and bite everyone in the ass in the end.
There should never have any ""extra"" benefits. What people made should have been what they got.
Maybe give the extra benefits to those that were willing to change career paths in order to keep production moving along. You know, actually incentivize production either than people sitting on their collective asses..."
2021-06-04 10:40:26,wallstreetbets,Yeah people have opinions. Get the fuck over it.

2021-06-04 10:06:06,wallstreetbets,"Wages at the bottom need to go up, period.

No business should be paying anyone poverty or below poverty wages for a day’s work. 

By allowing that, it throws everything else askew. Businesses that pay wages at or below poverty and thus necessitating their employees be on public assistance should be charge five to ten times the amount for “administrative fees” to cover the difference between what their wages are and what the local cost of living is.

That alone would put a lot of shit companies out of business, but it would also cause relative wages to increase, while simultaneously removing the expense of a welfare state supporting people whose ARE working one or more jobs as many hours as they are able to obtain."
2021-06-04 10:07:43,wallstreetbets,Lol you are a child with zero experience in what you're talking about.  Fuck off back to PragerU.
2021-06-04 10:41:20,wallstreetbets,Except that opinions have no place in market moves lol
2021-06-04 15:10:16,wallstreetbets,"I mean, look at what people say when they’re touting BB. It’s always one of two things:

>1) look at what AMC did!! Get in early and we’ll see the same gains they did!!!

Except this logic doesn’t track at all. Because if it did, we would have seen plenty of movements like GME did in January, but with other stocks. Hype alone isn’t enough to squeeze a stock with a relatively small SI and a fairly weak shareholder base. Honestly, I’m betting that a lot of people who have been posting positions have just been posting their positions they entered in Jan/Feb. A lot of bag holders are likely exiting those positions right now, while creating a new generation of bag holders. 

>2) It’s a great long-term investment, they’re developing software for EVs, they’re a solid company. Blah blah blah. 

This one kinda speaks for itself. Imo, BB *is* a great long-term investment. But that does absolutely nothing to support a short squeeze. We’ve likely already seen the peak for BB for the next few years. 

In any case, congrats on not buying into BB. Great investment, terrible trading opportunity (at least at this point)."
2021-06-04 10:38:45,wallstreetbets,Idk...-1 billion dollar revenue last year on a company that can only maintain sustain a sub 10% margin...is clearly a death sign...
2021-06-04 10:12:57,wallstreetbets,"""no business should be paying"" who are you to decide that? Businesses as they sit only bring in about 7% total overall profit. Everything else is spent on overhead of some form or another.
Maybe if people worked harder so there were fewer bodies needed at said business then they would get paid more.

You obviously have never run a business in your entire life.

There's a reason Amazon and WalMart, two of the absolutely largest companies in the United States, advocated for a raise in minium wage. That's because they know it will destroy competition."

2021-06-04 10:31:31,wallstreetbets,"The business that I am involved in running pays nobody under or even near poverty levels wages.  


This is supposed to be an advanced society, why do should we just ""be cool"" with starvation wages being paid to anyone? Why should we sit around and allow employers to take advantage of the welfare system to subsidize their profit margin?   


When Wal-Mart and other big box retailers move into a town, crushing local businesses and become the primary employers, putting most of the populace onto poverty levels wages, making them eligible for welfare... Well, where do those people end up shopping?  


We end up subsidizing the wages of those working poor who then shovel the money we give them right back into the very businesses that force us to subsidize their wages. Basically letting them double dip off the public's good will."

“Until further notice, Jefferies Prime Brokerage will no longer offer custody on naked options in GME, AMC and MVIS,” the memo noted. The firm will no longer allow the execution of short sells of those securities, the memo continued, noting that other stocks may be added to that list.

A Jefferies spokesman declined to comment. Street Insider reported the news earlier, citing an unidentified trader.

The news comes a day after the latest meme stock, AMC, closed at a record high of $62.55 after a 95% gain. The stock was down 5% Thursday at 1:37 p.m. New York time.

e.g
But 1,000 stocks during dip, wait until it goes up, sell 500 stocks and also sell 5 covered shorts, wait until goes down, buy more stocks at dip with profits and then do it again. Allowing shorts of ANY kind will still affect the market by allowing the potential for market manipulation for funds that have the massive purchasing power to do this. 

Until retail takes some of that power back and redistributes it into our retirement accounts, from their hedge fund accounts. Fuck em, let’s take it all back and make a decent living."

So if other institutions follow suit, wouldn't that mean that these short sellers would need to buy out their positions?  And wouldn't that mean that the demand for the stock would shoot up?  And since they need to buy out 250% of a stock that has less than 100% of its shares being floated, wouldn't that mean they CANNOT buy out of that position?

Supposing Jefferies' restrictions do reduce future short selling, that still wouldn't close the existing short positions. Plus, a successful reduction in short selling would help drive up share prices until long shareholders sell, which may not happen until they see the short squeeze they've been patiently waiting for.
Edit: Oh yeah, and as far as I know, it's still easy to short these stocks if people really want to. Jefferies is just in charge of what people do through Jefferies."

Basically people don't like going to the theater much. It's too expensive, you have to be there at a certain time, dress up, sit there without getting up or pausing. We all have big screen Flat screens. I just don't see theaters coming back. Movies mostly suck quality wise. And seeing them in theaters isn't really worth it anymore. It didn't take Covid to keep me away from the theater. The theater experience did that a long time ago.

Yes, but what happens when no one is allowed to speculatively borrow anymore shares in the future?  More short interest is generated by more overvaluation and high RSI indicators.

From the bank's perspective.. when the person they allowed to borrow can't cover the bank holds bag so if it becomes a trend these brokerages and banks can blacklist at their discretion because they have a responsibility to their depositors.. and when the bank is irresponsible and has to cover for a bankrupt investor FDIC has to print money to cover those deposits and bail out the bank.

So what happens when you have a stock you can no longer force anyone to buy at an overvalued price?  That is essentially the speculative trading pool they are trying to cut off.

As for AMC at this point.. 80% of the shares are owned by retail investors and there is only 13% short interest.  Doing the math, that 80% of retail investors will bid themselves down to be the first to cover that 13% of short interest.

What kills the GOASS theory is that you will never get 100% of investors to hold their positions because it requires 100% of the investors to not be greedy."

2021-06-04 09:49:43,wallstreetbets,SqueezeTrigger is the VWAP (volume weighted average price) of the CUMULATIVE total shares shorted in AMC for the past 5 years.

2021-06-04 10:00:53,wallstreetbets,VWAP=Very Wet Ass Pussy.  I'm pretty sure.

2021-06-04 08:18:38,wallstreetbets,"The jump from $8.50 to $9.50 sent those calls from $0.05 to $0.85?  

Did the IV dectuple or something?"
2021-06-04 09:15:52,wallstreetbets,"You’re about to start printing tendies

2021-06-04 09:39:24,wallstreetbets,Soon Will be in the 3 comma club
2021-06-04 08:19:01,wallstreetbets,The contract value absoltely skyrocketed yesterday for those Jun '18 $13 calls. Went from like $0.05 to $0.85.
2021-06-04 08:11:30,wallstreetbets,a nice ornament on the back of the xmas tree
2021-06-04 08:23:38,wallstreetbets,"The IV shot up, increasing the value of the contracts. It's now over 180%."
2021-06-04 09:51:01,wallstreetbets,I would probably ride the wave with a trailing stop loss maybe?
2021-06-04 11:04:42,wallstreetbets,"It's diamond. Best time to get in is now while it's so low.

I'll say the same thing as I did for BB before it took off. It's picking up pace and very likely to explode, whereas the odds of it falling dee\[ are very slim because people are starting to get behind it. The potential gains here are so much greater than the potential losses. It's just the perfect gamble. And when something is the perfect gamble: well people will gamble on it.This is potantially much better than BB too if it memes because it's an actual upcoming company, not one that's down and out and looking to be propped back up. So once the meme-ride is over you'll actually have stock in a decent company that's good for the world, BB has potential to make money but nowhere near the amount that the stock level rose it's market cap too. Whereas CLNE actually could genuinely be worth more than it's meme spike some day (if it does indeed meme.)"
2021-06-04 09:36:43,wallstreetbets,You got it(:
2021-06-04 13:14:00,wallstreetbets,Something in my pants heavily shorted this morning after CLNE hit the high but started plummeted....

2021-06-04 14:01:33,wallstreetbets,I’d like to see bank that much!!
2021-06-04 08:20:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wish I had gotten in on Wednesday but I waited to let a few of my existing investments play a little more. They made me money but by the time I got in on Thursday the price had already hiked most of that.
2021-06-04 09:51:42,wallstreetbets,"I got 5 for $0.08. One tendie, please."
2021-06-04 08:22:28,wallstreetbets,On the back
2021-06-04 08:22:13,wallstreetbets,"Yeah same, wish I was 1 day earlier. I deposited some funds into my IBKR account but they needed a day to clear, so probably too late on calls. Super annoying. But I have some shares, so may consider some expensive calls today depending on the price."
2021-06-04 11:38:26,wallstreetbets,"Same brother... didn’t hear about CLNE cause everyone is spamming amc, BB, and GME"
2021-06-04 09:53:27,wallstreetbets,"Enjoy your tendies. So pissed off with myself that I retardedly bought one for $1.75 just now, litterally bought the peak like a dumbfuck. The fuck was I thinking."
2021-06-04 12:20:52,wallstreetbets,it actually fell off weeks ago and the cat batted it down the hall into a dust bunny
2021-06-04 08:23:39,wallstreetbets,I mean if it runs up the way people are talking ($20ish) I think a dollar or so for 13calls is probably still worth it. They will likely be worth 10 by the time it's done if it really goes up like that.
2021-06-04 08:25:09,wallstreetbets,"Yeah agree. I'm gonna wait for an hour or so after market open and maybe get a few contracts.

May buy some leaps too with super long expiries, maybe even January 2022 becuase it's still a long term hold that's undervalued."
2021-06-04 09:22:06,wallstreetbets,"A dollar? Tastyworks is showing me $5

EDIT: Nvm it was being very slow and bad"
2021-06-04 11:16:33,wallstreetbets,Go for Jan calls. Its like $1.5 more for 7 months of runway and you can still benefit from nice short term action
2021-06-04 08:29:33,wallstreetbets,Yeah I am almost exclusively in positions that I see long term value in and potential short term huge gains. That way if the short term run up doesn't happen I'm not left holding a worthless bag.
2021-06-04 09:37:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was basing it on close last night I have no idea what they are going for now.
2021-06-04 11:17:11,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's a red red day for me so I'm not selling anything to free up the cash for more calls.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,YOLO 290k on WKHS 🚀 💥 💰 
2021-06-04 09:27:51,wallstreetbets,This is the most heavily shorted stock out there. The squeeze could be epic.   Short interest is at 42% of float.
2021-06-04 09:49:21,wallstreetbets,"I know Amc the topic of the day,but I think WKHS going to be a almost as crazy as the GME short squeeze. Garbing 20 shares and going to put in a few calls on payday."
2021-06-04 08:49:09,wallstreetbets,What's the bull case for WKHS?
2021-06-04 10:39:56,wallstreetbets,"10% down as of now, ouch. ima buy one stock to help you out fam"
2021-06-04 11:00:00,wallstreetbets,Upvoted for visibility. In at a *much* lower amount (less than a hundo shares). Wish I waited til after premarket to save a bit but in the long run it won’t matter!
2021-06-04 13:20:08,wallstreetbets,This 🦍 eats 🍌. Bought 300 stonks. LFG 🚀
2021-06-04 12:11:16,wallstreetbets,I almost just doubled my stake in WKHS today and now have 101 shares. Hopefully we can jump on WKHS and ride it to the moon.

2021-06-04 17:22:18,wallstreetbets,400 @ 13 I hope we are not fucked
2021-06-04 08:48:49,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when people are conditioned to think that a lot of short interest is always a good thing...
2021-06-04 10:01:16,wallstreetbets,Agreed. It’s twice the short interest of AMC. And AMC floated more shares yesterday.  If the AMC gang took some profits and rolled them into WKHS we could see a massive squeeze
2021-06-04 18:05:37,wallstreetbets,">twice the short interest of AMC. And AMC floated more shares yesterday.  If the AMC gang took some profits and rolled them into WKHS we could see a massive squeeze

but holy fuck that thing they're selling is ugly, I would personally short it for 200% if I didn't care about losing money"

2021-06-04 10:14:21,wallstreetbets,Yep. I've looked at it and compare this garbage company that doesn't deserve any profit to CLNE which is a much better and good prospect for the world
2021-06-04 14:33:58,wallstreetbets,We are adding here! 12.50 buys!
2021-06-04 08:23:14,wallstreetbets,Why?

2021-06-04 15:21:13,wallstreetbets,What a gift to load up at 12.50-12.60
2021-06-04 16:04:49,wallstreetbets,I got in at $12.51
2021-06-04 10:49:47,wallstreetbets,Does the fundamentals of the company matter when the whole point of this is a short squeeze? It's heavily shorted.
2021-06-04 10:55:22,wallstreetbets,Well some people have morals and don't believe the management deserve the gain. Have to consider what company people are actually going to like and want to get behind if you expect it to take off and meme and get a squeeze.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Bought after the March crash in hopes for another run. Jackpot. Cashed in for 22k profit! 
2021-06-04 08:00:23,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-04 10:46:29,wallstreetbets,"Newb here, I just want to make sure I understand what I’m looking at here. 

You bought 40 contracts with a strike price of $40 in March with an expiration date of January 21,2021 at an averaged price of 0.52 per share per contract. 
And then recently sold them for $6.05 per share per contract. 

So, currently these contracts have no intrinsic value as they are well below the strike price but gained a substantial amount of extrinsic value. 

Did I get all that right?

Edit : January 21,2022"
2021-06-04 08:29:44,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Now go back and buy more.

2021-06-04 11:27:50,wallstreetbets,"January 21,2022

I think you are right on the rest though, since it has shown possibility of moving to $40 next year the value of the contracts has gone up so someone else has bought them and he pocketed the $5.53 difference."

2021-06-04 10:03:47,wallstreetbets,"Holding with you, good luck to us all!"

2021-06-04 11:01:09,wallstreetbets,Bought you the dip
2021-06-04 13:20:27,wallstreetbets,300 stonks. LFG. 🚀
2021-06-04 09:16:18,wallstreetbets,I hope so too. But recently HYLN came out with good news yet was shorted over 50% down to 7 dollars. Would be nice to see these manipulated stocks stop being bullied by shorts!
2021-06-04 13:06:28,wallstreetbets,Personally I like the company but they failed miserably to get the USPS deal. They've got no deliveries. Bad call bud
2021-06-04 14:16:55,wallstreetbets,Bots reported 🤖
2021-06-04 19:56:40,wallstreetbets,Gotta say this is pretty fucking retarded
2021-06-04 10:16:39,wallstreetbets,I'm out at 20+ probably. That was the original goal. Options expire Jun 18 so I've got two weeks to get there. Based on other squeeze patterns it looks like Monday / Tuesday is a big move day.
2021-06-04 10:36:22,wallstreetbets,"well, hopefully see you on the other site next week. :) good luck!!!"
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Current Price Action of GME is shockingly similar to the past two major run-ups and 'micro squeezes'. Also T+35/T+21 elaboration. I'll start with the usual: I am not a financial advisor.  I do not provide financial advice! Everything following this is opinion/observation.  Much of my knowledge of the markets has been acquired through reading countless hours of DD posted by others.

OBLIGATORY - BuY & HoDl!

Now that that is out of the way, I would like to reference a few authors and their inspired DD that helped get me to this point.  The below have DD's that are a must read if you have not already; please visit their profiles and read their posts.  I will attempt to summarize the main points briefly below.

u/Criand:

[1)]**The flurry of rules before the storm. GME might be hitting T+35 and T+21 next week**

[2)]**Things are shockingly similar to the February 24th and March 10th runup**

u/myplayprofile - I am highlighting just one of their posts, but it goes into linear correlation which is now shifting to logarithmic correlation between GME & AMC prices.  AND he explains how there is the possibility that AMC is being used by hedgefucks to hedge their GME losses.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

This post is focused on u/Criand's DD, which enlightened me and many others as to what the fuck has been going on with the 21 day / 31 day FTD cycles.

Basically his DD over the last few weeks is the most accurate hypothesis that we have to date regarding the FTD cycles, and one of his most recent posts shows how this theory is now supported by the price action seen on May 25th and in the following days.

Key Points:

* He clarifies the confusion around why the standalone T+21 day FTD cycles, which have been shown to cause price surges, do not act the same way as they did during the $480 run and the $350 run.
* Explains how the Feb-March $350 run was caused by a dual event of T+35 & T+21 day FTD cycles occurring in close proximity to one another (back to back trading days)
* Notes that the Feb 24th initiation of the run up to $350 was exactly 10 days before we peaked at $350
* He references u/yelyah2 DD, which shows how gamma neutral spikes on day 1 of the $480 and $350 price run ups, returns to normal for about a week, and then spikes up massively again, initiating the January and February Gamma Squeezes

Below is my furtherment of u/Criand's work all in one concise graphic which feels oddly like a child to me right now.  Not sure if that is just because I have not really written any DD's before.

Please click the image to view it blown up and actually take in what is being laid out for you with my lovely computer crayons which I swear to god I don't eat... EVER.

[Transparent boxes represent the initiation of the combined T+35 \/ T+21 day price movements + 6 days \(because it has only been 6 trading days since ](https://preview.redd.it/v8tmo6hdi5371.png?width=1287&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a7e70813852641f29b2e57d8fc64ea7f7b83f77)

Notes:

* I am not sure why I called the $480 and $350 price run ups in the visual ""Micro Squeezes"", but thats what came to mind.  Perhaps gamma squeeze is more appropriate given u/yelyah2 recent DD?
* Yellow is micro squeeze 1
* Blue is micro squeeze 2
* Pink is the past 6 days

Alright folks.  I have talked a lot about other peoples work, and given you a graphic.  Now comes my value add.

Key observations:

* Not only was it a 10 trading day ramp up from the February 24th initiation to $350 on March 10th, but it was also **EXACTLY 10 TRADING DAYS** between the January 13th initiation to the $480 peak on January 29th.  My reason for calling this out specifically is that it strengthens the theory surrounding the combined T+35/T+21 day price movements, and helps us further establish that we could potentially go **PARABOLIC AGAIN 10 trading days from 5/25 on JUNE 9th.**  Will they be able to stop us this time?  Maybe it doesn't even matter if the do... See my next points
* In the aftermath of the January ""micro squeeze"" the Dec-Jan price floor of \~$20 **DOUBLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$40 between Feb 5th - 25th.     In the aftermath of the Feb 24th - Mar 10th ""micro squeeze"" the price floor of \~$40 **TRIPLED**, and the new price floor was set at \~$120 between Feb 5-25.  Given that the price floor doubled and then tripled after these two events, **could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?** (That would be a price floor of $360+ for those of you who needed help there)
* Edit to previous bullet: someone makes a fair point that ""We can’t assume that since it doubled in January from $20 to $40 and tripled in March from $40 to $120 that therefore the next floor must be more than 3x $120. What if the rule in the sequence is +20->+80->+140? Or what if +20->+80->+20->+80?""  I have included this just to explicitly state that my question **""could we be expecting the new price floor of more than 3X $120?""** by no means is intended to say the price floor WILL triple again.  I feel like this is a good point to say that this is speculation and theorization based on observation and nothing more.
* The MACD line has literally only had significant crossovers (golden cross) 3 times this year.
   * Event 1, Yellow ($480 run)
   * Event 2, Blue ($350 run)
   * Event 3, Pink (May 17th - today)

Additionally, I have plotted trend lines for each of the events.

* Event 1 (Yellow) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 1,733%
* Event 2 (Blue) we saw a 10 day increase of roughly 770%.
* 770 / 1733 = 44% or a 56% reduction in 10 day price increase, although the price was starting from a floor of $40 instead of $20.
* 44% of 770% would be 338% starting from $120 which would mean a peak price of \~$405 in event 3, **IF** this short pattern continues exactly the same.
* THIS PATTERN WILL NOT CONTINUE EXACTLY THE SAME.
* I am only observing the trend of the current pattern.  The sample size here is literally 2 events, albeit 2 very unlikely ""coincidental"" events.  And I don't believe in coincidence.
* The pattern will break for many reasons, but the main reason is that hedge fund manipulation literally cannot continue forever.
* Once they get margin called its off to the races, and hopefully this event is the straw that quite literally breaks the camels back (Kenny G, you are the camel)

Oh yeah... forgot about this one.  LOOK AT THE VOLUME.  ITS LITERALLY FUCKING INSANE.  MEDIA IS PUSHING AMC, KOSS, ANYTHING OTHER THAN GME AND YET IT HAS RUN UP FROM $132 (April 13th) TO $290 WITHOUT A SINGLE TRADING DAY VOLUME GREATER THAN 21 MILLION.  WE SAW VOLUMES OF MORE THAN 150 MILLION IN JANUARY!

Alright guys.  To summarize.  We could be looking at going parabolic again on June 9th based on the pattern identified by the authors I mentioned above.  The price action and technical signals are bullish as fuck.

2021-06-04 19:44:32,wallstreetbets,"The extremely low volume but non-collapse of the price is interesting.  I doubt it indicates a moonshot, quite the opposite, most of the apes have moved onto newer and flashier speculative bubbles and what upward growth that exists in GME is likely a result of algorithms echoing AMC's movement.  Yet it still refuses to crash!  At this point I think the passive index funds that followed ape momentum into GME just...persist in holding GME until they get further large patterns to follow.  They can execute no momentum themselves, just follow the mob.  Unless there's a mess exit from GME, the passive funds will just keep the price idling around its new normal level."

2021-06-04 13:58:16,wallstreetbets,It's so funny how the mods have been suppressing GME discussion lately.  That is very anti-WSB and the mods really need to reevaluate what they are doing.

Wat? T+21 is the Market Maker delivery cycle, T+35 is the Clearing House delivery cycle. At least if I'm reading the referenced DD correctly. 


>Also, last t+21 was on 5/25 so it's not occurring again next week.

The last T+21 was 5/18 and the last T+35 was 5/24. This is as per the DD posts from the users the OP referenced."

2021-06-04 19:08:38,wallstreetbets,VW was the largest company in the world during its squeeze. That would put GME over 30k/share (Apple 2.2T) and by all accounts this squeeze will have way higher highs then the vw one.
2021-06-04 17:16:41,wallstreetbets,"Roughly 730B$ actually, but who's counting... 😅
Jokes aside, based on fundamentals might be an unfathomable number, but sidelining fundamentals and concentrating on the naked short selling and real short interest (presumably we'll discover the real numbers on 6/9), this could realistically become an ""infinite money glitch"" simply because how do you cover 200M shares of there are only 70M in existence and only 30M is the tradable float? This is gonna be the most interesting scientific/socioeconomic experiment of our lifetime! Or I might be damn wrong but still hold because I like the stock and I don't know what an exit strategy is...
Good luck everyone, not financial advise!"
2021-06-04 16:13:45,wallstreetbets,"A guy can dream 🥲. Apparently if the hedge fund goes bankrupt, responsibility falls to some bank or something and they have insurance to cover up to $500k per share, which will obviously never happen, but it's a nice thing to daydream about.

$500k invested in total market index funds can return $20k/year, basically forever. Lots of places you could live well on $20k, lots of people living on way less. An occasional fun thought experiment is how many lives I could change with a billion dollars. Ignoring the taxes of transferring the money, that's 2k people getting a basic income. Family, friends, community organizers, and people down on their luck, just given the chance to exist without worrying about their next paycheck.

2021-06-04 12:02:19,wallstreetbets,"To quote from one of the posts:

> 1. Option Expire date. T+35 days later a price spike occurs. (January 15 -> February 24th)
1. An endless cycle of price spikes T+21 days later starts. (February 24th -> March 25th -> April 26th -> May 25th)

Based on that info it's T+35 from April 16th, thus May 24th. The T+21 cycle would carry on from there. So the cycle date that May 24th met up with was from the 'original' January 15th option date which, as point number two shows, eventually landed on May 25th after following the T+21 loop.

Hope that helps"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"[$Wish : Contextlogic] : My wife telling you the rocket is preparing to MOON As Always I never give financial advice and this is not different.  
Last Week I did some DD about Wish, which came right at the bottom :  [DD to My Wife](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nolcn9/wish_contextlogic_dd_i_showed_to_my_wife_to_let/?sort=new)  
Since that, the It moved about 10% (300 % potential)   
Now My Wife is very  happy, and she may consier breaking out with her Boyfriend who was All in on C3AI. 

Now Why I think Wish is preparing to go to moon ?   
1- It had a short float average (9M\~ day)  in the last 6 months, but for the last 10 days it's about 20M \~ Day. And as we all know, when the consolidation is done with a very a high volume, it's just the sound og the gas added to the rocket !  

2- 25% short interest, t's very high  for a company with good fundamentals at the bottom   

3- a good DD done  by  [user/PhD\_in\_FD/](https://www.reddit.com/user/PhD_in_FD/)  :   [wish\_institutional\_share\_increase](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/nqkzbc/wish_institutional_share_increase_with_open_puts/)  Explaining how the big boys are adding shares, in the same time they are selling puts, and I you know institution will only sell puts when it thinks the company will go up or it's under-evaluated (so they will be more than happy if they got assigned).

4- Huge Upside potential and very risky short play, so even the big boys will never stay short at this for a long period because the know that every small catalyst will send it to Mars.

5- Consider Best Buy in 2012, when everyone thought bankruptcy was inevitable and Best Buy stock had plunged from $40 to $10. Today, shares trade north of $100.

Consider Nintendo in 2013, when everyone thought the gaming titan had lost its magic touch and the stock also dropped from $40 to $10. Today, Nintendo stock trades above $60.  
Or even   Etsy for which the IPO price was 16$, the first day of trading went to 35$.  
After that It went back to 6$ in 6 months

Well look at it now !!!

Or consider Twitter in 2016… Crocs in 2017… Chipotle in 2018… Tesla in 2019… Wayfair in 2020…

  
Finally, this is maybe a ""dumpster diving"" that have a huge 300% potential  with a little risk (still fundamentals) ,  as a  GME fun and past retard investor, I know the facts , and the facts saying that on Wish we are at the Bottom, and the upside potential is just huuuuge !"

2021-06-04 11:45:12,wallstreetbets,"Logistics revenue grew 300% last year to over $500 million!! Are you fucking kidding me?? That business  segment alone, which will be profitable in another couple of quarters, is worth far more than the current market cap! Add to that Wish Local, which is going to completely reshape how mom & pop retailers survive in this decade, their data algorithms are extremely valuable, & they’re bringing on more and more brands quarter by quarter & more and more of their merchants are from the US or Europe. The only reason why institutions were able to short this down to $8 is because so many retail investors think this is just a crappy app for buying cheap Chinese products. The more investors really understand wish, the more hedge funds are going to have to close their shorts & go long. This bitch is going way pass the moon to MARZ N SHITZ"

2021-06-04 08:40:05,wallstreetbets,"Because it is a shit company that sells cheap chinese nonsense that's killing the environment. Also, China in general - not a place to invest."
2021-06-04 08:45:57,wallstreetbets,It’s an American company. They are just the middle man. I believe in the concept but I won’t buy from it. I really don’t need cheap stuff. That’s if I can afford it.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Another Blackberry Love Story. Sweatpants guy. It's true what they say - you never forget your first. 

It's 2007 and I'm working at Future Shop as a retail sales associate in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada up by Conestoga Mall. I've been assigned to sell in the home theater department alongside some veteran TV-pushers and I'm in wayyyy over my head. I'm trying to learn about things like HDMI gold plating and 720p vs 1080p...or was it 1080i? Shit. I dunno. Read the tiny sticker at the bottom and act like you know some stuff. Gesture at the screen and crank that volume on the audio until their ears bleed. That's the ticket.

I'm doing my very best just to keep up but it's obvious that I'm just maybe a little too nice to be in sales. I won't sell hundreds of dollars of add-ons that a family man doesn't really need. I'm not going to push the product service plan (PSP...that word still makes me shudder) if I know that it's pretty much useless. My manager, an Indian dude with a silver tongue and an impeccable sales record, is being kind but really...he's regretting putting me in the highest commission department so soon. 

But then in walks sweatpants-guy. 

He looks pretty much like every other dude that cruises the aisles and asks a tonne of questions that lead nowhere. He's got an old stained shirt and some grey stretched-out sweatpants on. I have zero reason to give this guy the time of day. Nobody else bothers. My slick sales colleagues look through him and past him.

But I grew up poor. I know clothes don't make the man. So I strike up a conversation. Why? Because let's be honest, my sales are non-existent today and I need to have a chat with a real goddamn human being without awkwardly trying to steer the conversation towards buying some techno trash he doesn't really need. 

I talk to sweatpants guy for like 20 minutes. About anything and everything that isn't TVs. About my aspirations to become an airline pilot, how tough an industry it is and how broke I am. About living with my parents again.

My colleagues walk by shaking their heads. Waste. Of. Time.

Then we both realize the time and sweatpants guy tells me why he's really here. He's the a tech director for Research in Motion and he needs ""...just like twenty really good TVs for a few boardrooms...like bigger ones"". 

I try to contain my excitement and point him towards a Samsung 48in or something like that. I give him the speech, on some level subconsciously apologizing for being so awkward. He sizes it up and says ""Huh. Okay looks good. I'll go for it.'

It's all I can do not to cry. 

I ring in the sale and for the first time in a very long time, I start to feel the slightest bit like my life is starting to turn around. 

The next month when I get my paycheck, I walk over to Rogers mobile and put all my cash down on a BB Curve 8320. And mannn is it sexy. Buttons that click juuuust right. Remember those? Mmm yep. Track ball?? Wtf is this magic?? I was in love. 

Oh. And a few weeks later, I quit my job at Future Shop (because let's face it, I was terrible) and  started my new chapter as a BB factory worker. The rest you guys already know from my last post.

That guy was just one of many BB managers who exemplified why I loved that company. A down to earth guy in sweatpants wielding crazy amounts of money, and choosing to back the little guy. 

Still gets me choked up a bit. 

Still holding BB on a Friday morning. 

Cheers buds.

TLDR; BB manager gives broke shitty salesman a shot

**Again guys. Still getting some PMs here about me not being a legit BB stockholder. Same dude. Still a BB holder. Only got two stocks in my Wealthsimple and I ain't f*in selling. Proof:

2021-06-04 10:14:18,wallstreetbets,"I remember my first BlackBerry. I got hired on full time at Fidelity Investments and they issued me one. It was GLORIOUS. Yes, the web browser was locked down and proxied through the company BES, but the keyboard beat the hell out of the Motorola RAZR I had as a personal phone. As soon as my contract was up, I traded the RAZR in for a BB Curve 8830 (which I STILL have, I just don't have a battery for it).   


A few years back, when they released the PRIV, I bought one. Great little phone, but the BlackBerry Hub software tended to drag the rest of Android down with it, and the battery life was shit as a result. Still, I LOVED that pop-out keyboard."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"EUCAR.PA from .26€ to Hello Apes, 

A few months ago I posted on here on why I was bullish on EUCAR.PA , one of the largest rental car firms in all of Europe. The post got some minor traction but was removed by the mods with something along the lines of:

> ***Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of*** r/wallstreetbets***.***  
>  
>*Moderators remove posts from feeds for a variety of reasons, including keeping communities safe, civil, and true to their purpose.*

No biggie, I know I'm not an expert on DD and this was just my opinion on the stock that at the time was only 0.25€. Since then it has gone up to .46€ and is currently at .42€. In short I still feel very bullish on this company since it has been shaving off its debt, has a wide range of mobility companies and partnerships all across the globe, has made changes to it's board of directors, is making a big push to introduce EV's into their fleet, and there are even rumors flying around that Volkswagen might be looking to buy them before the COVD discount sale ends. 

I worked in the rental car business for a few years and from my understanding EUCAR is one of those big companies in France that if shit hits the fan will be protected by the government. Not only that but as vaccines roll out and more places open for the summer demand will be quite high for rental vehicles. 

Keep in mind that due to COVID lockdowns, car hire companies have shed a lot of their fleet in order to keep operating costs low. This means that as things start opening up and people start traveling supply will not have caught up to the sudden spike in demand. 

Meaning all cars will be rented out at a premium. I've personally seen this first hand in Alicante during the 2009 crisis where the airport was packed full of tourist and there were not enough cars to go around. The companies that did have cars were renting them WAY above normal rates since they placed a stop sales on all inbound reservations. I have a feeling the same or something similar will happen this summer. 

Anyways just wanted to drop that in here since I think that at .42€ per share it is still looking like a juicy buy. 

&#x200B;

2021-06-04 06:13:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this great DD. Its free money. Can hardly believe that there is not more talk about it. 👍

Before you can answer, his mother chimes in: ""Oh, honey, don't fall for your grandfather's tall tales.""

You smile at the boy and nod at his mother's wisdom. Of course, there's no such thing as Bulls or Bears, just as there's no such thing as Unicorns.

The boy shrugs, suddenly bored, and returns to playing with his stuffed animals: a massive pile of toy kangaroos, grotesquely inserting limbs into each other's pouches like the foreplay at a massive orgy. A quiet rage flares behind your eyes, then fades to sadness."

2021-06-04 17:58:47,wallstreetbets,"Basically. 

Just YOLO at meme stocks. Drink heavily when down anywhere from 25% to 95%. Have blind faith in the fact there really are as many people out there as dumb as you YOLOing into memes. Hold. Buy the dip. Maybe add an extra bowl or two of the devils lettuce to the day. Fuck it, times are tough, you're somehow down 100% which you didn't think was possible but with meme stocks apparently anything is so a little screwdriver in the morning now is necessary. 

And then boom, one random day a few weeks or months down the road you'll go from down 69% to up 420% for no reasonable reason whatsoever. If you're real slick, you'll start out by buying the top and selling CCs telling yourself the premium will eat away at the losses. 

\[insert lots of rockets and dick emojies\]"

2021-06-04 06:15:53,wallstreetbets,"I find it really interesting that such a diverse range of stocks all move in a similar pattern. (AMC, GME, BB, et al).

Like they're all pretty different in what they produce, sell, offer but they all move in the same way because they're all 'meme' stocks. Or is it that they're all relatively high on short%?

Edit: I realise this isn't new information, just an out loud thought."
2021-06-04 07:20:51,wallstreetbets,"CLNE did great yesterday and in the AH. I suggest you guys have a look and consider adding this to your portfolio. Probably the most undervalued stock out there.

2021-06-04 14:14:59,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood liquidates calls that do not have money to exercise at 3:00 pm EST

When a call is liquidated more often than not MM sell stock used to hedge writing of call

This creates downward pressure, every time from 3 to 3:30 on expiration

Given the amount of gamma squeeze and all ITM calls expiring on AMC expect it to drop significantly as we get closer to liquidation of calls at 3pm

On top of that I believe RH sells puts in customer accounts to Citadel before the calls created downward pressure.   Citadel then quadruples its profit on these puts from 3:00 to 3:30 EST

I have been screwed on this time and time again.  Get ahead of the game.  Don't let RH and Citadel screw you.  

I want to start a class action suit against these fuckers.  Message me if you want to join."

It may not give you a Lambo by the end of the weekend, but by the end of the Summer you'll be glad you got in early."
2021-06-04 11:55:18,wallstreetbets,"BB can’t be compared to the other stonks cuz it’s less of a meme and more of a growing company. Theyre not making phones; to be clear , they’ve developed software for EV & the company they bought to do so is doing them much justice for the future. Selling BB just because it goes down 5-10% means you’re in this for the wrong reasons. Don’t get me wrong I’m all for a good day trade & I love my meme stonks but BB deserves a different level of respect fundamentally. Tell me if I’m wrong 🤷🏾‍♂️☹️"

I’m not ultra wealthy but my account is several hundred grand so I’m pretty sure I’m not the kind of customer who’s account you should talk shit about even if there’s no recourse for closing that trade.

Step 2 - sell covered calls. strike 50% above your avg share price. Unless you're dumb and just bought after the stock ripped 100% which then sell cc's like 5% above your average price so you get a good chunk in premium just in case.   
Step 3 - profit. Stock up? premium + assignment = 50% gain on underlying + premium. Stock down? Underlying loss + premium = Potentially still a gain depending on how early you got in on meme stock and how long that high IV lasted.

BB is the captain now"
2021-06-04 12:38:53,wallstreetbets,"Have you retards found the common denominator yet in your successful plays? Why did GME & AMC succeed? It’s because you retards literally filter fed on all the shares like the soft brained whales you are. 

That was your secret weapon. You bought lotto tickets through calls, and then gobbled up shares like a collective silverback combiner transformer. That’s what’s missing from your other plays - your collective retard strength. 

You guys move as a herd through the savannah, but once you’ve cleared a field of all vegetation instead of moving on and letting the field regrow, you fucking sit there in the muck fighting over the remaining sprouts instead of going to graze the next field and multiplying your numbers. Learn how pasture raised animals graze and follow the pattern. When you deplete the fields of a certain stock, take your profits and move on to the next stock. You can always return to the same fields once they’ve regrown."

2021-06-04 12:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Yesterday about $31.9 billion worth of AMC stock traded, down a bit from Wednesday’s $39.7 billion but still quite a lot. For comparison, Tesla stock traded $17.8 billion yesterday. Apple traded $9.4 billion. Amazon.com Inc. traded $7.7 billion. GameStop traded $2.1 billion. All U.S. stocks on all U.S. exchanges, combined, traded $536.4 billion yesterday. AMC was 6% of U.S. stock trading. That’s pretty high. Could be higher, though. RBC Bearings, a ball-bearings manufacturer, traded $12.3 million of stock. Seems unnecessary. In the future the only stocks will be AMC, GameStop and Tesla. The idea that you’d go to the stock market to buy or sell shares of some boring company that makes industrial parts, just because you expect its future cash flows to be higher than what is currently discounted in the stock price, will seem weird and quaint. “No we only trade memes here.”

2021-06-04 08:05:32,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I have to give it to the hedge funds.

The fact that they have convinced millions of people that ""holding until your money is gone"" is somehow brave... is amazing. And the fact that they have convinced millions of people to do so by convincing them that holding somehow hurts hedge funds is even more amazing.

They have somehow gotten millions of people to run up stocks for them, using their life savings, by making them think they are hurting the people they are helping.

Frankly, it's one of the most impressive disinformation campaigns I've ever seen, and I can't wait for the Aaron Sorkin movie."

2021-06-04 08:15:54,wallstreetbets,Little tip for new investors here. Everyone saying AMC is set up for a good day is just trying to get out before you. The stock is down over 20% from highs yesterday it’s expiration day so a lot of people are going to try to get there options sold and minimize losses. If you’re new DO NOT buy AMC at open. Watch the first 30 minutes and thank me later.

The way to build superior long-term returns is through preservation of capital and home runs...When you have tremendous conviction on a trade, you have to go for the jugular. It takes courage to be a pig.

The trick is to take risks and be paid for taking those risks, but to take a diversified basket of risks in a portfolio.

It's not whether you're right or wrong that's important, but how much money you make when you're right and how much you lose when you're wrong

**George Soros**

Mr. Market's job is to provide you with prices; your job is to decide whether it is to your advantage to act on them. You no not have to trade with him just because he constantly begs you to.

**Benjamin Graham**

People should be highly sceptical of anyone's including their own, ability to predict the future, and instead pursue strategies that can survive whatever may occur.

**Seth Klarman**

Investing is a business where you can look very silly for a long period of time before you are proven right.

**Bill Ackman**

Everyone has the brain power to make money in stocks. Not everyone has the stomach.

**Peter Lynch**

One of the best rules anybody can learn about investing is to do nothing, absolutely nothing, unless there is something to do... I just wait until there is money lying in the corner, and all I have to do is go over there and pick it up... I wait for a situation that is like the proverbial ""shooting fish in a barrel.""

The only thing I do know is that from chaos comes opportunity.

**Daniel S. Loeb**

The wise ones bet heavily when the world offers them that opportunity. They bet big when they have the odds. And the rest of the time, they don't. It's just that simple.

**Charlie Munger**

We're in the business not so much of being contrarians deliberately, but rather we like to take perceived risk instead of actual risk. And what I mean by that is that you get paid for taking a risk that people think is risky, you particularly don't get paid for taking actual risk.

**Wilbur Ross**

Bull markets are born on pessimism, grown on skepticism, mature on optimism and die on euphoria. The time of maximum pessimism is the best time to buy, and the time of maximum optimism is the best time to sell.

**John Templeton**

To anticipate the market is to gamble. To be patient and react only when the market gives the signal is to speculate.

**Jesse Lauriston Livermore**

Charting is a little like surfing. You dont have to know a lot about the physics of tides, resonance, and fluid dynamics in order to catch a good wave. You just have to be able to sense when its happening and then have the drive to act at the right time.

**Ed Seykota**

I always laugh at people who say ""I've never met a rich technician"" I love that! Its such an arrogant, nonsensical response. I used fundamentals for 9 years and got rich as a technician

**Martin S. Schwartz**

What you will be looking for is a day that closes above the prior day's high and most likely 'breaks' out to the upside to close above a trading range. This is the twitching worm that causes the public to leap before they look.

**Larry R. Williams**

Time is more important than price. When time is up price will reverse.

**William Delbert Gann**

It does not matter how frequently something succeeds if failure is too costly to bear.

**Nassim Nicholas Taleb**

Choosing individual stocks without any idea of what you're looking for is like running through a dynamite factory with a burning match. You may live, but you're still an idiot.

**Joel Greenblatt**

There are no bad days in the market. When the market is down, you've got bargains, and it's lovely to think of what you are buying at low prices. When the market is up, the bargains have gone, but you're rich.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"LendingClub Radius Bank - Two Digital Innovators Joined Hands ## Summary

* LendingClub became the only full-spectrum fintech marketplace bank and the first publicly traded US neobank. Synergies between these companies provide LendingClub to explore more opportunities for their existing 3+ million.
* Synergies between these companies provide LendingClub to explore more opportunities for their existing 3+ million borrower base and other customers as well.
* Access to lower cost of funds positions them to grow their loan engine by reducing the dependency of the warehouse bank.
* LendingClub loans were stress-tested during covid times and they were still holding higher returns for investors.
* LendingClub loan originations were continuously increasing from Q2 2020 which was hit hard by the pandemic where Q2 loan origination was 326 million, that is down by 87%, but Q3 loan origination gradually increased by 79% to 584 million, and Q4 loan origination expected to increase by another $300 million which will be 50% sequential growth. which is a good sign.

With the national footprint along with a technology-driven platform, the two digital innovators can produce solid growth and a profitable business model with a healthy stock price. Let’s talk, why I still believe that.

1. ***Why Radius***

They don’t share anything in common, but both are digital innovators. LendingClub don’t have banking products, and Radius don’t have lending products. . Both joining together can provide better financial solution product than the traditional banks. Radius with branchless digital banking platform also the nation’s best online bank in 2020 by Bankrate. It is a cultural and technology fit. When two magnets are brought together, the **opposite poles** will **attract one another.**

**2. Match made in heaven.**

LendingClub will use Radius bank **$1.7 billion** deposits as a stable source of funding for future loan growth, With direct access to funding, LendingClub will no longer need to share revenue with warehouse banks. It can fund its loans. The bank deposits can help in lending during the recession time when the warehouse lenders were suddenly withdrawn. On the other hand, Radius Bank can use lendingclub for lending their deposits, they both mutually benefit each other in marketing/lending costs.

**3. Competition:**

Still being a market leader in personal loans, the Radius deal puts LendingClub ahead of the competition, where many fintech players lack a banking charter. providing a seamless banking experience with a broader range of products and services, they can easily acquire customers which will put LendingClub ahead of the curve to build a consistently profitable and resilient business.

**4. Loan performance:**

Loans originated pre-COVID vintages are trending toward IRRs of 4% and post-COVID vintages IRRs are trending towards 5 to 6%, which shows LendingClub is giving better returns in the tough times. Which is a good sign,

**5. Source of income**

Not only the revenue comes from Origination Fees and Transaction fees, but they also collect Fees from investment funds and other managed accounts.

**6. Cost-Saving**

The acquisition helps LendingClub save

✓ $25 million a year by eliminating the need to pay a partner bank for its services in originating loans

✓ $15 million in bank fees/compliance / regulatory cost, since they can leverage the existing compliance infrastructure and

✓ $40 million for each $1 billion of personal loans hold on their balance sheet. As they shift from higher-cost warehouse lines to lower-cost deposit funding.

that total to $80 million which grows over time. Based on these Savings, for the $185 million radius acquisition, the cash on cash payback will be paid off in 2 years.

**7. Holding a loan on its book.**

If lendingclub bank decided to hold the life of a loan on its balance sheet, then they can approximately make $90 million of economic profit for every $1 billion of personal loans.

***8***\*.\* **Technology and a data-driven platform**

Having a national footprint with no physical locations, they both can offer innovative financial solutions to consumers that will help them pay less when borrowing and earn more when saving. they can generate higher revenue at a lower cost compared to a traditional bank, which often has to support large operating infrastructures

***9. The Future***

*reaping all these benefits, LC can be easily profitable with half of the pre-pandemic 1.5 billion loan volume per qtr.*"

2021-06-04 10:34:21,wallstreetbets,"I liked being a lender on Lending Club, saw good returns on my modest portfolio, but since the merger you haven't been able buy more notes.  I still receive payments and interest on existing notes, and it all goes into a new Radius savings account which is nice, but I can't transfer anything else into it (would like to since the APR is higher than my normal savings).  We'll see what they do next but it feels like the investor opportunity is over or at least massively cooled off."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD - $BEKE (KE Holdings) and why it should be your holding too **Alright, some of y'all have been complaining about people doing DDs only when they have gone up over 9000%. I'm here to bring you a stock that I really like that (1) have been beaten up UNFAIRLY recently but (2) will MOON - can't say you weren't invited on this ride.**


With that out of the way, to cater to the level of evolution in this civilisation the post will be split into the following 2 levels. Read them as how you would categorise yourself (don't cheat you bastards):

* L1: You're a primitive ape, probably can't tell what green and red drawings on your trading dashboard

* L2: You're a functioning ape, probably asking what shares are and have very strong opinions on the hedgies >:(


And if you don't even consider yourself an ape, go to the bottom for the tl;dr.


*So what's BEKE?*

* Effectively, a real estate transactions platform, matching of demand and supply of residential properties (new, existing) as well as renovations. (MAIN POINT OF BUYING BEKE)

* Also owns an offline brokerage brand (Lianjia), which drives some % of transaction value by the platform

* Currently books ~8% of housing market in China


*So what's going for it?*

Rising tide floats all boats: Chinese residential real estate market is expected to continue growing steadily over the short, medium and long-term - structurally favourable growing pie

* L1: Real estate market will continue to go up steadily = good for BEKE and competitors' revenues

* L2: Gross transaction value (GTV) of the market addressed by BEKE faces tailwinds in terms of demand and supply drivers 

   GTV increase = 

   Continued urbanisation to drive housing transactions (increased demand) + 

   Consumer demand for housing upgrades (increased demand) + 

   Guaranteed supply of new houses by the Chinese government (increased supply) +

   Continued dependence on middlemen / brokerages to facilitate transactions in the opaque market (maintained penetration)


Unrivalled proposition: BEKE owns a disruptive (best and sole-in-class / country serving as the broker-of-brokerages) and self-compounding business model, allowing it to snatch market share and become the dominant industry player

* L1: BEKE = Only Shopify of real estate transactions in China = BEKE revenues > Competitor's revenues

* L2: BEKE will continually grab market share from a growing pie because of the flywheel effect within its business model, enabled by its 'Housing Dictionary' and best-in-class infrastructure to support the real estate transaction lifecycle. 

    * Housing Dictionary = Largest and most accurate listing of properties in China, providing a superior transaction experience for all brokers and housing customers. The company sees this as a prized asset and dedicates resources to ensure the authenticity of listings, and have even offered cash rewards for every listing found to be untrue.

    * Best-in-class infrastructure = Software suite and services provided to external (partner) real estate brokerages and ability to link different participants across the workflow within a real estate brokerage, has not been replicated and have already formed a moat by being the first mover within the industry.

    * Self-compounding business model vs. rest of industry = By using the Housing Dictionary to provide a superior experience for customers and brokers, and the ability to onboard and improve the operating efficiency of brokerages, which then further supplements the Housing Dictionary, and thus providing a much superior experience again for customers and brokers, BEKE effectively outshine competitors who are typically advertising companies who have a transactional relationship with brokerages and customers.


Attractive valuation: Street valuation does not account for BEKE’s growth through network of other brokerage brands + the recent passing of the founder + antitrust rumours

* L1: BEKE growth > Wall Street estimates growth + Founder have relinquished management duties to co-founder before death + antitrust so? Look at the inconsequential fines given to BABA lol

* L2: BEKE will outperform in growth in revenues and profits (oh look they are already profitable as a growth company) against the concerns:

    * Partner brokerage network based on Wall Street estimates assume that revenues from that segment will stall by 2023 - what a joke; based on the value proposition of the company, this will continue to grow at an exponential rate as (i) more brokerages are onboarded onto the platform to improve their sales efficiency and (ii) more % of businesses by each onboarded brokerages improve as they realise they can partake in more transactions through the aggregation of transactions by the platform.

    * Founder sits on the board before passing away, shares that he hold in a trust (70+%) is mandated to be held for minimally 1 year. Additionally, this means that institutional holdings of the company is 80+% - just saying there might be some possibilities here :)

    * Antitrust concerns are overblown - seriously guys what are they going to do? Alibaba who did a shit ton of anti-competitive practices and had Jack Ma just straight up shit on the CCP had a 2.8BN CNY fine (4% of revenues, big fucking whoop).


tl;dr BEKE is criminally undervalued. and a growth stock you definitely would want in your holdings :)


Mandatory disclaimer, I am Long BEKE 400 shares and leaps. This is not financial advice I just like the stock!"

We have people here arguing this and that with each other acting like MMS are normal...yes but their behavior is not normal. Front running orders, latency arbitrage, all that crap is only normal in this point in time where this manipulative behavior has been normalized. People calling it out even here get gaslit.  Saying MMs serve a purpose is true but it’s completely ignoring the levels of abuse them and their buddies have gone to.

You’re limited to .xx digits while they trade at .xxxx and you think you’re not being taken advantage of, come on dude.  The “tax” or extra price is hidden right there for you.   Then they can front run your orders and take advantage of that price difference that you don’t even see.  What you think is a good deal is a price that’s not even fully accurate by the time you buy it, the cost difference you’re looking for so you can point to and say “this is what it costs me” has been baked into the system as a whole already.  

I’ve read and seen enough to know PFOF is a scam. Think what you like.  The creator of it went to prison for fraud.  And the main people using it and pushing it are sketchy Wall Street firms with tons to gain by convincing you they have your best interest in mind."
2021-06-04 07:40:30,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think they have my best interest in mind.  I think they have their best interests in mind. It just so happens in this particular method of transaction my interests and their interests are aligned.  Therefore while I agree they make out, I also recognize I make out.  The losers are legacy institutions whom this relationship has negatively effected.  Obviously politicians jump in the mix too.  They usually signal they are “protecting the little guy”, In all actuality they are guarding the legacy institutions which they themselves are a part."
2021-06-04 07:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Back before PFOF order days (just a few years ago!), trading costed like $5\~8 to buy and the same to sell.

Imagine buying a $10 stock and having to pay $11 in trade fees. Ya... it definitely hurts retail.

&#x200B;

For larger purchases in order of hundreds of thousands dollars plus, yes, PFOF hurts.

But then again, at that point, go to an actual brokerage.

Also, not every brokerage practices PFOF. That's up to you as a customer to choose. There are free trade brokerages like Fidelity/Vanguard/Merrill Edge/etc. that has no PFOF.

And you can always pay for IBKR Pro if you really need execution speed on options market and all.

&#x200B;

The average Robinhood user has a couple hundred bucks. PFOF is a life saver. Let's not kid ourselves.

Robinhood takes 47 cents per 100 shares. You think average Robinhooder is buying 100 shares of say Amazon?

How many shares do you even need to justify out purchasing say $11 in fees. A heck a lot more."
2021-06-04 08:18:11,wallstreetbets,"Thank you.  

Its worth noting that in very typical fashion of today’s age.  The phrase “payment for order flow” has been redefined.  Now people use “front running” interchangeably.  This is a very disingenuous practice. 

I’m guessing this forum would melt is they heard my Robin Hood takes.  But ya know !!!yea WE BULL yea!!!  As the kids say"

In accordance with Russell US ground rules, the reconstitution of the Russell US Indexes will take place after the market close on 25 June 2021. Performed annually, reconstitution ensures that the Russell US indexes continue to accurately reflect the current state of the US equity market and its market segments, including market capitalization (e.g., large and small cap), sector breakdowns, and style structure.

&#x200B;

# Timetable:

**Friday 07 May 2021:** Rank day. Russell US Index membership eligibility for the 2021 reconstitution is determined from published information and market capitalizations at market close.

&#x200B;

**Friday 04 June 2021:** Preliminary membership lists are published after market close. **This is the catalyst.**

&#x200B;

**Friday 21 May to Friday 11 June 2021:** Query period. Users are welcome to query the published data; any corrections will be communicated after market close each day. Merger and spin-off companies will be re-ranked when the transaction is effective between the rank day and the index lock-down. No further re-ranking will occur after.

&#x200B;

**Friday 11 June 2021. Monday 14 June 2021:** **Lock-down.** No further corrections will be implemented\* and the Russell US index reconstitution can be considered final (with any further changes to shares and free float isolated to changes associated with corporate events).

&#x200B;

**Friday 25 June 2021:** The Russell US reconstitution is implemented after market close.

Provisional Russell US Indexes will be published **beginning on June 4 to allow investors to track the new indexes prior to the reconstitution effective date**.

2021-06-04 19:05:40,wallstreetbets,"According to S3 Partners the SI is 46,67M shares (41,38% of free float) and this time it's right (not like when they discount the CEO class b shares out of the class a float). Even could be higher because they are not taking out of the free float the shares that the ETF based on MSCI small cap added last week and they should because this ETF can not sell this stocks without selling all the other stocks on the ETF as far as clov keep being part of it. If we consider this, the % of SI could be higher than 45% of the float. Also the institutional investor owns 55% of the free float. If you see nasdaq website it say it's 106% but it is an error because they count the 96M shares of Greenoak as class a shares but they have class b shares (class b shares are non tradeable and are not part of the float). Last but not least, today we will know for sure if clover will be added to Russell 2000. If it happens the ETF will have to buy more than 10M shares (9% of the free float). If we take out this shares of the free float when they buy it and the shorted stocks remain the same the SI will be 56% of the free float after 25th of June. I recommend to everyone to save money and on 23rd and 24th of June buy like my wife on sales, so the ETF based on Russell 2000 will have to buy it much more expensive because they have to buy more than 10M shares yes or yes.

Furthermore, ET is one of the only midstream businesses that services all 15 major U.S. oil and gas producing regions in the U.S., giving it significant geographic diversification and scale competitive advantages

It only goes up to 120 strike, not sure if that's just the site's free tier showing limited data or if all the options higher were closed out in today's trading.

There are a *shitload* of options outstanding.  Remember that gamma can also work against a stock, as expiry approaches OTM hedges get released, pushing the option further OTM (for both calls and puts).  It's going to be fireworks, especially towards the end of the day.

here's the best analogy i can give you.

old godzilla was hoppin' around tokyo city like a big playground when suddenly batman burst from the shade and hit godzilla with a bat grenade. godzilla got pissed and began to attack but didn't expect to be blocked by shaq, who proceeded to open up a can of shaq-fu when aaron carter came out of the blue and he started beating up shaquille 'o' neal. then they both got flattened by the batmobile. before it could make it back to the batcave abraham lincoln popped out of his grave and took an ak-47 out from under his hat and blew batman away with a ratatattat. but he ran out of bullets and he ran away because optimus prime came to save the day. godzilla took a bite out of optimus prime like scruff mcgruff took a bite out crime. and then shaq came back covered in a tire track but jackie chan jumped out and landed on his back. and batman was injured and trying to get steady when abraham lincoln came back with a machete. but suddenly something caught his leg and he tripped. idiana jones took him out with his whip. then he saw godzilla sneaking up from behind, and he reached for his gun which he just couldn't find, because batman stole it and he shot and he missed, and jackie chan deflected it with his fist. then he jumped in the air and he did a somersault while abraham lincoln tried to polevault onto optimus prime but they collided in they air. then they both got hit by a carebear stare.

2021-06-04 06:03:36,wallstreetbets,"It's also possible that we see a gamma splat today. The MM has bought massive numbers shares to hedge all the call options that are open right now, in case they are exercised. The vast majority of people who loaded up on call options will need to unload those calls today because retards that bought 100 contracts don't have the actual capital to buy 10000 shares of AMC at $40 or $50 or $73. Unless the majority immediately reinvests their options profits into shares and/or calls for next week there is a chance that we see a death spiral today like we did last Friday as the MM unloads 20-30 million shares from open contracts that weren't exercised and hundreds of thousands of call contracts go from ITM to OTM.

Either way it goes it will be a bumpy ride today."

2021-06-04 11:47:23,wallstreetbets,No need to be aggressive is there? Retard
2021-06-04 03:29:31,wallstreetbets,"No.....

The expiration is today so that means as the expiration approaches,  the price of the call starts to rapidly fall to zero. It doesn’t even gradually fall because it’s not linear. The “speed,” of the fall to zero accelerates rapidly. If the stock dips just a little, the fall to zero quickens. If the stock blips up the call will still lose value because the expiration is today and the contract is far out of the money. 

The only thing I can imagine someone doing this is if they sold to open 173k calls, (they wrote and sold the call options to someone) and so they bought the calls to close and take profit because they will be having testicle reduction surgery today and don’t want to risk their shares being assigned and sold at 145 on the off chance that AMC goes to $300."
2021-06-04 03:00:43,wallstreetbets,"Only if there's a buyer. Greater fool theory considering these contracts are basically 0 cents tomorrow. Maybe they can sell to someone for 1 cent. Oh wait, they probably already bought for like a few cents. Never mind, they retards."
2021-06-04 02:57:45,wallstreetbets,"If the stock magically flies far above $145 you get the $$$.

That's how you saw people make $1k to $1+ million back in Jan from GME calls.

You buy calls so unrealistic that premiums themselves are near non-existent. In other words, you are paying almost nothing for all the profits of the 100 shares per contract if that 'unrealistic call' actually goes ITM.

99.999999% of time those calls expire OTM (worthless) and everything you put in flies to $0 ;) Welcome to WallStreetBets. A place you YOLO everything to FDs and pray."

2021-06-04 19:01:05,wallstreetbets,"Ya.

But for GME to go past $800, people here have to be willing to pay that much first (all the way to that share). If the media arounds the world covers GME again, sure. But media is mostly silent globally now.

Same idea for AMC. For AMC I assume hedge funds from GME event has some sort of insurance. So prices will have to go far higher than $145. More like $300+ too."

2021-06-04 06:28:02,wallstreetbets,I see open interest at 42K on TD Ameritrade right now.
2021-06-04 05:35:18,wallstreetbets,"Just curious how no one can own these contracts, but call options from 74-145 were available, starting yesterday, for trading"
2021-06-04 09:26:36,wallstreetbets,Next you'll be telling me the 50% in the right column doesn't show how likely it is that the price will hit the strike price
2021-06-04 09:55:01,wallstreetbets,So you are telling me it's not too late to jump in? 🤔
2021-06-04 09:56:17,wallstreetbets,"ToS is showing me open interest of 41k on those, so *someone* bought a bunch of them.

Either way, it's hilariously retarded."
2021-06-04 10:01:27,wallstreetbets,And in fact the bigger the call option position the better the hedge funds are doing.

2021-06-04 06:13:54,wallstreetbets,I thought they bought them for $1.17 each contract that means they are down already almost 50% 🤔
2021-06-04 03:04:17,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, bought a $145 call for $295 this morning and I was willing to lose all $295 (which I’m almost certain I will) but in my defense I really was quite high"

2021-06-04 07:15:45,wallstreetbets,"Even if someone did buy 42k of these contracts you know fuck all about why.  Someone could've bought them as cheap, cheap delta hedges to cover the back end of a large position.   Someone could've bought a lot of OTM options to spike IV and collect some vega $$ on other positions.  Someone could just like setting money on fire on the back yard.  

Fact is, the only thing OI is good for in the market is calculating how many shares will trade hands if those positions go ITM.  Other than that, without knowing why someone bought them, you really don't know dick."
2021-06-04 15:05:28,wallstreetbets,"most likely it was thetagang selling them, and MM's who had to take the other side.  OI doesn't indicate long/short because there's 2 parties to every trade."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC and BB both have potential, Research and put your own thoughts into your decisions do not use anyone else's opinions or decisions as your own. This will probably be buried maybe deleted as I am a lurker and could be taken wrong and accused of spreading FUD as I don't contribute to discussions here and only lurk. I am just so frustrated with what happened today and the discussions I have been seeing that I sent a few comments and now honestly just need to vent, maybe someone can get something out of this retard's ramblings or we can have a discussion about any of what is below without attacking one another, maybe it will only help one person and that is fine it is better than saying nothing at all.

People who have been here for awhile probably will find little value in this post but who knows maybe you will. Hell, newer people probably wont either but it could be useful to think about some of what I have to say who knows I did too much brick red shit is getting weird.

***Keep in mind obviously I am retarded and my opinion is terrible, do not read further. I sniff glue, and none of this is financial advice all it is meant to do is engage your brain to think about things before picking sides or spreading information that could cause harm. Also, Excuse my grammar its worse than my investment strategy.***

I am generally curious to hear thoughts about the current situation in both what happened to AMC today or anything related to it, and I guess just general thoughts surrounding both BB and AMC without shitting on the other with misinformation and FUD. It is starting to look like a BB vs AMC brawl at the moment with AMC getting shit on for a terrible misguided reason. I don't know how many people are actually contributing to said shit but ***ignorance breeds FUD.***

I am not going to attack people investing in BB or anyone talking bad about AMC or vice versa because everyone is entitled to their own opinion and can say and invest in whatever they want to, I just hope you can think about both sides and research into it yourself before doing so at the least. Honestly, I believe that both companies have potential, I lean more toward AMC because I know more about it  (which is not much because again I am retarded) not because BB is terrible or a dumb investment I just do not know much about it so I will not have a strong opinion on it. I will however be looking into it tonight because more knowledge is always a positive. The more we educate ourselves, the better decisions we can make. That being said I think AMC is being shit on a little harder because of the FUD that happened today with AMC price and the media's pushing of BB and spreading AMC FUD as well. Paperhands more than likely contributed heavily today with short attacks to suppress AMC gainz but this is just speculation.

AMC's sold shares to Murdock 2 days ago and also some to the market today and it is being blown way out of proportion in a negative fashion which in all honesty it could very well be very advantageous to retail's gainz. On the surface that statement sounds insane to most people who do not know much about the stock market or business operations in general. If you look up information directly from AMC and try to understand what was actually done and why it was done and logically think about it instead of trusting others 100%, Today could have played out very differently. I'm not saying it was a terrible day by any means just stating that it possibly could have been better if FUD could have been spotted and stamped out by retail more efficiently by thinking for themselves and not relying on others most of the time. 

**Retail needs to be VERY cautious when reading about ANY news they hear about the market, retail has completely flipped the market upside down and media will be a huge factor in trying to get retail ""back in line"" we have seen it happening for months. There is and will also be more retail to flock to these stocks that will drive volatility higher which means retail must not accidently spread FUD and learn to think for themselves based on data and facts given. If we do not think for ourselves a little more, and be more skeptical about what we hear, less tendies will be had.** 

The 20m shares that got issued were going to go into the Outstanding shares regardless if they sold them to the market. The shares were going to be given to the executives of AMC for their personal benefit, instead they used these shares to secure capital to be used in the future benefit of AMC and thus retail, the shareholders. They gave up personal gain to have more capital infused into AMC, this to me is very good news. The only way shorts do not have to cover is AMC going bankrupt which capital they gained from those shares helps to avoid. **These shares were basically going to be a bonus that AMC executives refused in order to give it to the company.** Think about all that has happened to AMC, then think about what you hear happen at failing companies and what their executives do before said company goes tits up. Ill give you a hint they usually dont try to decline bonuses to help the company. Granted you could argue they are nowhere near close to claiming bankruptcy, but even so more than anything I think it proves that they actually give a shit and are grateful to retail for saving their ass, then I must have ate too many crayons.

About the ""dilution"" problem, think about it logically. Do you think that roughly 20m shares that were added on two different days with \~480M and \~590m volume on the days in question, to a share count that is already somewhere around 500M that is roughly 80% owned by retail already is fucking us over? If you think it does, is it really enough to jump ship / spread FUD? It could be, who knows, but my retarded brain thinks otherwise. I am not telling you what to think but rather to actually think about it/ research it and come to your own conclusion. Even if you have no interest in investing in AMC spreading negative things about it only hurts the other so called ""meme"" stocks that directly correlate to it.

AMC no longer has any shares to sell they have 46k shares left, which means retail will have the final say on any vote in shareholder meetings as they own the majority of shares and AMC can not ""dilute"" the outstanding shares if you believe that is actually what they have been doing with ill intent. They want to have the ability to issue 25m shares and given the circumstances that AMC just survived I think it is a good idea to have that option in their back pocket as they literally don't have to use them unless needed. **I am not telling you that you should believe what I believe.** I know a majority of retail might not agree with my opinion and that is completely fine I just want some thought to be put into it, think about it and research it yourself. If you come to the same conclusion then vote against it in the meeting. **Retail will have final say in the deal so we must be educated about any matter like this that may come to a vote**. This deal might be completely irrelevant in fact it probably is but who knows it is better to be prepared so an informed decision can take place. Retail literally has final say in decisions that can effect an entire multi billion dollar company. What Retail decides in any vote will effect the company and in turn each of the individual investments in it. Give it some effort

We all know what happened today with AMC price (6/3/2021). I Don't think it was the best day ever by any means but it was not all that bad. Considering the circumstances with the confusion that happened throughout the day with shares being sold by AMC, especially when you factor in new investors who are not yet accustomed to the FUD seen everyday ***Midday was was one fucking hell of a ride.***  We should think about the positives of today as well as the negatives instead of focusing mainly on the latter. I think today was nowhere near as bad as what some would think.

One final note, The live stream of AMC's CEO Adam Aron answering questions Is one of the main reasons I will continue to support AMC. **In my own personal opinion** I am extremely hyped for what is going to happen tomorrow. I could be completely wrong but it seems like He knows what the hell he is doing and he actually gives a shit. I know there is an argument that could be made that it was all an act because of retails majority share ownership. I just don't get that vibe from him, the man sounded like is taking us seriously or at least that he actually is taking steps to understand retail as best as possible in order to make decisions we would support as a majority. If you have not watched it yet I would recommend doing so if you are interested or are already invested in AMC. **Remember there are legalities that a CEO has to follow which could account for some of the things being said by Adam. I did not look into this but it is something to consider if something seems off, that doesn't mean that everything that seems fishy is because of this.**

I'm not going to end with some speech about holding the line or be proud. Just give thought to everything you see, be skeptical and do some research. The more of this that occurs the better off retail is as a whole, and the better off you as an individual will be in securing your tendies.

Anything said above was for the purpose of discussion and getting people to really give it some thought and effort before believing/spreading everything that seems like it is true or that you want to be true.

TLDR: Ignore entire wall of text and watch Adam Aron answer [Questions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-EkPZMIAeM) then maybe read above if not just try being more skeptical of everything and put the research and thought into your actions. Effort will be what makes the difference. Emotions are peaking and it important we stay vigilant."

2021-06-04 12:33:34,wallstreetbets,"well where do I begin. sorry I don't wanna be patronising in any way, its just a lot and I don't have much time.

1. shorts do not have to cover. I might get downvoted for this, because many ppl here (want to) believe that, but there is simply no law or rule or contract that says shortsellers have to cover. the may decide to cover if they fear their losses might rise or the interest they have to pay on borrowed shares becomes too expensive. in many ways, shorting is the exact opposite as holding shares. if you hold shares, nobody can force you to sell. you may decide to hold your red position for ages until it becomes green again. if you short sell, you may do the same (and pay interest; but if that interest is like 0.1%, who cares)
2. AMC can (and did) issue new shares. company value stays the same, but share float rises. its called dilution and usually bad for investors (bc all of a sudden you own less of the same company). in 99% of cases though, when you buy a share, you dont buy it from the company, you buy it from a random stock holder who sold it in the same second).

bottom line is, its simply impossible to predict when shortsellers cover. the amount of shares the company can still issue (46k in this case) is basically irrelevant in that regard."

2021-06-04 12:40:23,wallstreetbets,"Right, so I understand both of these points. I guess I'm confused by the logistics of it. AMC has stated that after yesterday, it won't be issuing new shares until 2022. With retailers owning 80% of the votes, that seems to ring true. But I guess I'm still trying to understand the who synthetic/borrowed shares thing. If there shares do not exist, then the HF are losing money as we all HODL. And I guess I understand that shorts do not have to cover but it's probably ideal for them to eventually. 

When/if they do, and in this scenario everyone else is HODL, are their only option to buy back in the remaining 46k shares that AMC has? That's all I'm trying to understand. Will the demand be high among HFs because they all suddenly want back in?"

* Q1 production was limited because that was all the old battery supplied (Enerdel) could deliver. It's apparent because in April  they built 32 vehicles.
* Oshkosh Defense has never put out a vehicle of any kind through Federal Motors Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) Crash testing nor built a vehicle through EPA Emissions testing to get EPA certification of conformity.
* Still under an NDA with the USPS.
* Why did ARK sell? Considering all of the above, the only logical reason was she was forced to. I say this because she bought WKHS at the all time highs and tax harvesting just doesn't pass the smell test. However, if she knew her ETF's were shorted using a method coined 'operational shorting' and it was because of WKHS, then she felt it necessary. ARK funds have massive FTD's.
* 156 million shares traded today and the total float =129 million..

Almost forgot:
The 8 subsidiaries of JBPCO were all companies that they bought. They never ""created"" a subsidiary in their history until just a few days after Workhorse had a sit down meeting with USPS to discuss the contract... then they created a subsidiary for the first time ever (EAVX) and signed a Strategic Development Agreement with Workhorse to create a ""Next Generation Delivery Vehicle"" ......

WKHS received a 10% non dilutive stake in LMC/RIDE for the W-15 pickup IP now rebranded as the Endurance. Since the WKHS USPS NGDV and the Endurance use the same skateboard LMC is already tooled to mass produce and can deliver trucks next year. 

GM, the 800lb gorilla, owns 5% of RIDE and practically gave LMC away expecting the mail truck contract. 

To many the stock is categorize as garbage no thanks to attacks from Hindenburg, Fuzzy Panda and other media. I posted this for the facts to be visible. 

This old article could explain the WKHS Morgan Olson partnership because USPS will need walk in last mile delivery EV’s. [C-1000](https://www.trailer-bodybuilders.com/truck-bodies/article/21739600/morgan-olson-to-produce-6533-usps-delivery-trucks)"

That being said I don’t know or expect anything to change with the contract, but the contract is for 50-120k? Vehicles so there is a definite chance that they could go elsewhere for an EV solution.  Osk has no ev vehicle, so to produce one and have it on the road will take a long time.  As a holder I hope they end up with some of the contract, but that’s not the reason I’ve invested and held my shares. I also do not think that they’re focusing on that contract anymore unless there is actually something there."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Serious Question for AMC apes To start, I'm retarded and don't understand anything.  I'm hoping someone can help me here, but it's unlikely given the avg. IQ of this sub.  Either way:

I was watching this clip from this spooge-stain Rich Greenfield [here](https://youtu.be/Z9-jJNjdfCs). He said something that kinda surprised me as he bitched and whined about how stupid retail traders are.  First, he said the volume of trades is in the billions, so it's impossible that we are all holding.  That's funny, it sounds like he said the quiet part out loud.

More importantly, he said, ""the fundamentals don't support the valuation"". I'm stupid and don't know that word, so I turned my head sideways to listen at these weird sounds.  He then brought up Cinemark, which he says is ""the exact same company"".  The only differences he uses to separate the two are (1) Cinemark ""has a stronger balance sheet"" and (2) Cinemark is a $5b enterprise value while AMC is at $30b.  

So this stupid ape did some stupid monkey math and 30/5=6.  So far, I think I'm okay.  Now I did more stupid monkey math.  CNK stock price of $23 X 6 = $138 for AMC.  That can't be right, as AMC is trading at $48.

Here is where I'm really retarded and know nothing.  I looked at Market Cap.  It's a number I see all the time and don't know anything about it.  I look at CNK market cap and it is $2.56b.  AMC's market cap is $18.85 muthafuckin billion.  18.85/2.56= 7.36.  7.36X$23/share= $169.  One 69, which is what my wife will give me if this is all correct.  

Help me please.  Tell me how retarded I am, this is.  Please tell me how wrong I am on the FUnDamentals.  Otherwise, I might go full retard and buy some $100 AMC calls with my wife's monnies"

2021-06-04 01:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Enterprise value is market cap + debt - cash. Essentially if Amazon came by and decided they wanted to buy up one of either AMC or Cinemark, it is the EV they would use to compare total price to pay for both. That is because they would have to buy all the shares and take on the debt, but would then get the cash from the balance sheet, after buying the company.

Now in reality, they would have to pay a premium to the current share price to get shareholders to sign off on the purchase, but it's a good starting point to see the entire worth of a company. Enterprise value exists to give an idea of the worth of the entire company, but also adds in debt, since market cap doesn't account for that."

2021-06-04 01:16:07,wallstreetbets,I’m honestly not sure if this ape is actually that retarded or this is some genius high level satire.
2021-06-04 02:16:05,wallstreetbets,"Let's tease this out:

IF AMC was $5/share, it's market cap would be around $2b +$1.1b in debt - $800m in cash= $2.3b EV.  CNK EV is currently at $6.13b.  Given that AMC is the largest publicly traded in the sector, with double the amount of theatres worldwide of CNK, let's just say AMC EV should be double CNK (fundamentals, right?).  So if the EV SHOULD be $12.26b, the reverse math would be $12.23b EV - $800m cash + $1.1b debt= $12.53b market cap.  That is 6X the $2b amount above, meaning the actual share price SHOULD be 6X $5= $30 / share. 

Is this also more retarded ape math?  Would CNBC really having a segment with a guy saying AMC should be a penny stock for a discrepancy of 2x actual value?"

So all your maths are wrong, or... theyre calculating the wrong thing anyway. You can just look at market cap and see that AMC's valuation is way way way ridiculously too high compared to simular companies.

All you did was calculate how high cinemark share price would have to be ($169) to be as equally overvalued as AMC."

2021-06-04 02:44:58,wallstreetbets,AMC has $10B debt
2021-06-04 02:50:30,wallstreetbets,"I'm seeing one main number that is differing a lot for me. I'm seeing AMC with $5.4B in debt, the same $800M in cash, so I get an EV of $6.6B at $5/share vs the $6.1B for CNK. Also you didn't actually reverse the math. From the $12.3B, we need to subtract the $5.4B, but add $800M, so $7.7B for theoretical market cap of where AMC should trade, which would be closer to 4x the $2B. That would mean by your statement of AMC should be worth about double CNK, it would give a price target of $20, still a far cry from that guy's $0.01 price target.

I will add a caveat that I'd have to check all the above numbers versus the SEC filings. I was just looking at Seeking Alpha for my data, so please excuse me if any of it is incorrect. It also adds an extra layer of complexity that AMC just sold at least 20M shares, but has raised over $1B this quarter (I think it means they have certainly sold more than the 20M shares sold recently). This is still good for the overall math of AMC being worth more than $20/share, because they sold shares for more than that, or at least all the ones sold in the last week were.

In the end, I think that analyst has a $0.01 price target for shock value. I'm sure he wouldn't put any money down on them hitting $0.01 within a year, even if he does think they'll eventually go bankrupt somewhere several/many years from now. One thing is definitely true from all this though- it bought AMC a lot of time to try to change around their business to a format that works again. Hopefully they can turn around the trends of the past couple decades. Perhaps enough other movie theaters will go out of business to help AMC out more."

2021-06-04 00:23:18,wallstreetbets,"AMC is a good play. but it IS overvalued and the fundamentals DO NOT support the price its trading at. That much is true. Its being driven up by a combination of a gamma squeeze, a shit ton of hype, and the short interest. Its a good (high risk) opportunity to make money. Should it be a 20 billion dollar company? Hell no. But for the time being it is. Just know that it cant stay overvalued 5 times over what its really worth forever. There will be a correction after the squeeze/hype bubble pops, and it WILL return to a value thats supported by the companies fundamentals. 

TLDR its going back to $12 where it belongs after people have had their fun with it. Hopefully not until after supersqueeze has occured."

To your second point, you can't compare single share prices, because there are a different number of shares for each company. That's why you use market cap. It is price * # of shares, so you can actually compare the entirety of each company."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"THE JOB CRISIS So I have been thinking a lot lately about this whole job crisis. 

People are always telling me it is because people do not want to work anymore for the pay that everyone is offering, but I just can't really accept that.

I think it might be because the demand for goods, like fast food, leisure items, and stuff we do not really need sky rocketed up because people are getting vaccinated and are feeling more comfortable to go out again. Plus it didn't help that companies were letting a lot of people go during the pandemic because they weren't making a lot of money.

But what do you guys think?!?"

2021-06-04 01:28:55,wallstreetbets,It’s funny to me that companies have a great understanding of supple and demand when it comes to their products or services. Let their be a shortage on apples and watch what they do to the price. But all of a sudden there’s a shortage on labor and they wanna cry to the government instead of react to the market conditions. Notice none of the companies that pay $15 an hour are having trouble getting employees. It’s the restaurants paying their employees $2 an hour that are crying about how everyone is lazy and doesn’t wanna work lmaooo

I know people who are applying to various jobs in various industries ranging from IT to electrician or plumbing apprenticeships and haven't gotten even a call back. And supposedly construction is booming currently.

2021-06-04 00:06:01,wallstreetbets,"House prices are so high that you could quite easily spend your whole life slaving away at Wendys and never own anything when you retire. So the easy answer to this problem is to bring in workers from poor countries. They dream of living in the first world and will break their backs to make that happen, and complain a lot less. I mean a lot less. Complaints per hour is way down ATM. 

Employers say there aren't enough workers so that they can get more cheap migrant labor to exploit. It's been this way for 100s of years, and is still better than any other part of the world.

But this does explain why productivity goes up every year, and any small wage increases workers at Wendys get are wiped out by inflation. They pay less per hour because they have too, or else their competitors, who are paying less, run them out of town. 

Cheery isn't it. Luckly for us, happiness is free. You just have to not be a cunt!"

They don’t want to take the risk of bidding if they can’t supply the materials needed and they won’t hire more crews until they bid on more jobs as they can’t have crews idle. It seems to me it’s a cycle of contractors worrying about supply line shortages and then when the supply line comes through they worry about having the workers"

But you might have to break a sweat, and do actual work.

Stupid people have to work twice as hard, for half as much.

It’s gonna be a tough ride in this country for a while, and just think.

3. Everything is now open, people are getting back out there, except there is no one to work and companies have to pay like 30% higher wages which makes things cost a lot more. So you have this combo of higher demand and much lower supply which is skyrocketing prices and therefore inflation."

Instead we’re left with dusty decades old talking points about “saddling our children with debt” and “inflation.”.  Yet according to the CBO, Trump added some 7 trillion to the national debt (literally just a scorecard).

Both parties deficit spend, and quite frankly on the same shit.  The military industrial complex and corporations.  Meanwhile the average american is left out to fend for themselves.

But ZIP is the only recruiting software company. I should have clarified my comment. That’s what I meant to say

The reason this is important is because of scale. If there are an extra million people who contact Robert Half and want to be matched with job, that company will need to go hire several thousand recruiters. (Revenues go up but also expenses). If ZIP gets an extra million job searchers on their platform, their incremental costs are practically zero... but with more job seekers (free) it attracts more job posters/hiring companies (paid) and it makes the platform better

My point is that the coming hiring boom is going to have an outsized impact on ZIP because they are the only software pure play recruiting company"
2021-06-04 10:48:49,wallstreetbets,"Zip is more friendly and usable for the job seeker (the part of the business model that is free)

The platform is free for individual people to look for jobs, but companies will sign up for recurring accounts where they create jobs and post them into the platform. ZIP is a job aggregator, meaning it takes the job posting and replicates this on thousands of job boards across the world, and then brings back quality candidates to the companies. For employees, it will match you with dozens of roles based on what you are looking for.

The secret to getting workers has always been *make it worthwhile*. If you can’t find workers, the truest statement is to say the whole sentence: you can’t find workers at the wage you want to pay them. Offer $20/hr and see if you get more bites. 

Obviously this hurts a small business, but no one said owning a business guaranteed you to cheap labor. It’s kind of like crying that life is unfair. Yeah, it is; make do.

Underpayment of employees for their work is absolutely theft in my view.  The size of the company is functionally irrelevant there, but the large corporations can, as I said, absolutely afford it, especially when they give their c-suites golden parachutes. We all know where their priorities lie.  Bezos could double every one of his employee's salaries and not feel the dent... but he won't. 

I've worked enough underpaid contractor jobs to see it for what it is.  When billion-dollar companies have an excess of contractors, they are *literally* doing that so they can pay their employees less.  That's the entire point of hiring contractors, right? That profit comes at someone's expense.  Who's expense is it? It isn't like they're worked less.

When companies merge, there's always layoffs.  The work doesn't lessen either.  This affects inland (rust belt) cities hard, because those jobs are shifted to the company headquarters (typically on the coast) or aren't replaced.

Hell... my current company has outsourced the majority of its HR department of all things.  

Conversely, I do know small business owners who pay their employees as well as they can, but in my experience, those are the exception."

If you look in older neighborhoods built in the 50’s and 60’s you would find some entry level 2 bed 2 bath starter homes, and a few streets over start seeing the 3-2’s with bigger yards, then a few streets over see those 4-2’s and even 5-3’s. So there was always an option for any price range. Nowadays all those houses are deep inside the cities when they used to be on the outskirts. So they are high priced because of proximity to downtown. And when you get out to the now called suburbs, all the new planned neighborhoods have McMansions in them. The builders want to maximize profits on the land used. Can’t blame them really, but that is how we got here. Cody is where its at man. I’ve been eyeballing some land in the bitterroots in Montana.

So that would not make much sense. If every job would offer these perks you want than there would be a raise in all prices where the consumer would pay more.

What's the bare minimum you need for you current lifestyle, and would a $15/hr job cover it?

I'm guessing it wouldn't.  I know it wouldn't be enough for me.  What's the bare minimum you need to feel l safe and secure?

Now regarding privilege, it is real and doesn't take away from the hardwork.  I was very privileged in Uni.  I had no debt, and supportive parents that enabled me to drop out my senior year to focus on a startup.  I knew I could take the risk and have a fallback position.   The privilege allowed me to work 100 hour weeks with little pay.  It eventually payed off but it was a risk most would have a hard time choosing.   For me, it was a no brainer."

""A few less billionares"" is a small price to pay, and if stock price is a concern, reasonable corporate taxes would be offset by more retail investors putting their excess in the stock market. 

Make the path toward citizenship easier and faster. It isn't like we don't have space for those folks, or a lack of jobs. Immigrants, regardless of how they got here, are the lifeblood of the country. Petty xenophobia and jingoist nationalism won't change that.  

None of these are easy problems, but we cannot operate on the idea the poor people are lazy.  If wealth were solely about hard work there would be no poor people.  Reducing the military budget to a reasonable level alone would pay for so much of the things society needs."

The whole point of my argument is that their are systems in place that prevent people who are less privelaged from accomplishing what others have easier.

Abortion is not protected in all cases. There are many many caveats and it all depends on what state you happen to be born into or where you happen to live--most of the time which is pure happenstance and luck.

People destroying certain community's education systems and denegrating public teachers is the textbook example of a systemic issue. Free educations are not equal and certain communities work to funnel money away from education purposely. A basic education means nothing when they cannot staff teachers or have outdated books, facilities, and programs. If you honestly believe education is not privelaged and problem in America, then I don't know what to say.

You cannot 'just' unionize. Corporations spend millions of dollars fighting workers rights and fighting unionization. Yes, even sometimes illegally. Pay has stagnated in many industries for many years and many companies don't even offer basic benefits such as sick time or healthcare. There are wonderful companies to work for here, but many will do whatever it takes and let as many people turn over as possible before bowing to even basic demands.

You have an absolute terrible attitude about your own situation. You are literally using your own hardships and struggles to justify the systems that are in place thinking everyone is just capable of working hard to move beyond them.

More examples of people like you are those who whine about the idea that student loans might be forgiven because they already paid theirs. Or the fratnerity bros who haze and humiliate their pledges because they had it done to them. Or the worker who doesn't train someone properly since they didn't get any help when they were being trained.

2021-06-04 16:19:18,wallstreetbets,Bruh. I haven't seen 1% interest on a CD in 10 years. The max my bank goes these days is 0.22% on a 7-year CD. Might as well be negative interest rates. You must be in a bank that invests in high risk accounts.
2021-06-04 05:59:30,wallstreetbets,How much is the inflation rate?
2021-06-04 06:02:29,wallstreetbets,"This sounds like Indonesia (I’m Indonesian). In Singapore, it’s 0.5% lol"
2021-06-04 05:55:20,wallstreetbets,I'm thailand it's 0.375% for 3 months. Where are you getting 5-7%?
2021-06-04 08:32:47,wallstreetbets,What's your mortgage rate though?
2021-06-04 12:07:56,wallstreetbets,is it Vietnam?
2021-06-04 03:30:52,wallstreetbets,TMZ is reporting that Dave Ramsey's wife has caught him looking at credit cards. He claims it was just to laugh at the interest but we know better.
2021-06-04 06:20:07,wallstreetbets,Dave Ramsey the cult leader who declare bankruptcy to make his money advising people not to declare bankruptcy.

2021-06-04 09:49:48,wallstreetbets,"That's kinda me.

When I was born my grandpa made me a private pension plan that tracks the inflation index with an added 6%.

This index is no longer used for investments, its used by my government to adjust prices of goods and services.

But since I have a legacy account I still get the index based savings. Last year I got a 35% tax free profit on it.

The bank calls me like every month trying to get me to change to one of the new accounts and they have all these bullshit benefits they keep trying to sell me."
2021-06-04 06:18:20,wallstreetbets,"> the sort of paranoid weirdo that wore face-masks to the supermarket during flu season even before covid was a thing

So, a super-genius with great foresight?"
2021-06-04 18:55:50,wallstreetbets,history of S&P avg returns is 6% above inflation per year.
2021-06-04 06:44:57,wallstreetbets,My parents could buy a house in their twenties with two average jobs so I would still take that deal
2021-06-04 06:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Hmm, 14% interest on a 30k loan that I need a 6k down-payment for, or the same house today for 500k+ at 3.5% interest and a 100k+ downpayment?"
2021-06-04 13:50:45,wallstreetbets,"Right but it allowed people to actually save money and avoid being fleeced by high rates. Now prices are high with low interest rates and easy credit. Since so many people can “afford” the competition keeps prices just out of reach. It’s not possible to attain anything by saving, the meta is now bum rush assets you can barely afford and hope they appreciate faster than the alternatives, at the same time praying you don’t get fucked by something in the short term."
2021-06-04 14:54:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you could actually realistically pay off your house within a few years back then.
2021-06-04 09:46:49,wallstreetbets,"Yep, a lot of people who owned properties were hammered during that time. These were interest rates world-wide at the time, mainly in order to combat high inflation."
2021-06-04 05:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Want to hear something even more crazy?

One went on to make The Big Bang theory.

Funny how one guy wrote for the both the internets most loved and hated tv show."
2021-06-04 08:20:32,wallstreetbets,"We absolutely are going to leave that out. 

Why make the grief any worse?"
2021-06-04 08:31:31,wallstreetbets,Thats crazy. But why does it matter the years in *total* they went to Harvard? Is it like if you join forces with people and you reach level 50 you can make a good tv show? What would 100 years total of Harvard do? What could we achieve?
2021-06-04 08:48:47,wallstreetbets,“NOT FAIR! YOU CHANGED THE OUTCOME!”
2021-06-04 09:14:46,wallstreetbets,Yeah the theorem is impressive. The math in this bit is like middle school level math.
2021-06-04 13:04:29,wallstreetbets,we can leave it out because this fact is presented on reddit without fail every time the show is mentioned. it almost borders on the “buscemi was a 9/11 firefighter”
2021-06-04 02:37:05,wallstreetbets,"You need to watch the damn show. It's still a lot.
There doesn't seem to have been much inflation over that 1000 year window canonically."
2021-06-04 03:05:23,wallstreetbets,well it's not like everyone has a 1000 year old account. it was worth much.
2021-06-04 05:13:43,wallstreetbets,"Coffee was worth $3 in the future, so inflation was pretty non-existent or even somewhat deflationary."
2021-06-04 04:12:50,wallstreetbets,I would imagine there would have been significant deflation by that point in history due to civilization being destroyed twice in a thousand year period. Both times were the fault of ||Bender||
2021-06-04 08:11:36,wallstreetbets,"Everyone burned a shit-ton of cash to stay warm during the great freeze, so it all evened out"
2021-06-04 04:19:22,wallstreetbets,And you know that the Federal Reserve didn't raise and keep interest rates high for 1000 years to defeat inflation how?
2021-06-04 04:17:17,wallstreetbets,Did you not know that Reddit is stupid & bitter sometimes
2021-06-04 05:03:34,wallstreetbets,He had 15+ upvotes

2021-06-04 09:30:35,wallstreetbets,This is the way

2021-06-04 03:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Well his was not ""most"" and got compounded yearly apparently."
2021-06-04 04:09:40,wallstreetbets,monthly compounding makes an effective apy of higher than 2.25%. may as well just call it 2.3% or whatever. since it’s still going to be a set rate of return just a little higher due to earlier compounding of interest on interest.
2021-06-04 06:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Mine offers 0,01% 🥶"
2021-06-04 06:54:33,wallstreetbets,the Bank of India offered me .45%

2021-06-04 08:12:06,wallstreetbets,My banker raped me and then asked me to tip him 1%.

2021-06-04 13:10:54,wallstreetbets,And the sad thing is they advertise it like it’s a huge deal even if you take the feds word on inflation it doesn’t even come close to scratching it
2021-06-04 07:37:41,wallstreetbets,That’s the point. They don’t want you to save. We are in a debt based society now. No longer a savings based one. Hence the reason a business is about to collapse after a bad month.
2021-06-04 13:07:20,wallstreetbets,WOAH I didn’t realize you had fuck you money

2021-06-04 04:49:27,wallstreetbets,So now?
2021-06-04 11:32:34,wallstreetbets,What happened?
2021-06-04 07:34:47,wallstreetbets,My parents paid for this house with my mom's bank teller wage only (my dad rage quit his job right before closing and was unemployed for a few years). 4 years ago I considered buying it from them at fair market value and I wouldn't even have been approved for the mortgage with my salary. Closing costs were more than what my parents paid for it.
2021-06-04 05:16:52,wallstreetbets,"Futurama was a show that dressed up smart jokes in dumb ways so if you didn’t get it it was still funny and if it did get it then it was an extra reward for you.

Big Bang Theory is just… dumb."
2021-06-04 09:01:01,wallstreetbets,BBT hate is relatively new though. When it first came out it was the show everyone talked about and had to see. It was insanely loved and popular.. but didn't age well.
2021-06-04 05:31:33,wallstreetbets,"XD one over complicates to the point of not caring if the viewer base gets it because they know viewers will just assume its cartoon physics. 

The other over simplifies it to the point highschoolers are like.... that's not how that works at all! To be fair only the physics part of that show is up for debate. General relativity and special relativity are basically moot after you get pass the 5th or 6th dimension, (I can't remember which). Physics and reality can literally be completely different. Cosmic super gravity is a completely different concept and doesnt really worry about dimensions at all... They were targeting the 20 somethings to 30 somethings that had forgotten most of their high school physics. Problem is they pandered too much and their corny jokes lost steam because it came off as demeaning to the audience.... Overall it's not a bad sitcom for sitcom sake. But they were hypercritical of their target audience.  ""nerds"" ... Physicist and other ""smart people"" may have been socially awkward in the past due to bullying ect. But need culture has progressed to the point it has become mainstream.  Portraying them as social outcast learning to be people next to their ""normal"" neighbor is also demoralizing to the ""normal"" people out there. "" Oh they are just too stupid to get the jokes in this show."" is what it screams....


 I'd love to see a sitcom about the outside world not realizing how normal of a person nerds are now. ""Dan you play DnD? Your average good looks and Bachelors in logistic management make you seem like a normal person!"" Dan:"" I play Pathfinder with Lucy the company lunch lady who is stuck in her job despite having a doctorate in Anthropology and Paul our area manager and his kid who is 31 still living at his dad's because rent is too damn high."" 


You know, normal society."
2021-06-04 05:41:59,wallstreetbets,Who actually hates Futurama though? It wasn’t my favourite show but there’d have to be something good on another channel on tv for me to skip it
2021-06-04 05:42:31,wallstreetbets,"Different formats for different audiences. Younger audiences hate BBT but oldsters like me like it just fine. 

99% of the hate seems to be just the classic “sitcom with a laugh track” format, which puts younger audiences off regardless of the quality of the writing."
2021-06-04 05:13:26,wallstreetbets,What's the most hated?
2021-06-04 09:13:47,wallstreetbets,"Are you talking about Eric Kaplan? Because he did not make The Big Bang Theory, he is just one of the writers."

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

2021-06-04 09:50:15,wallstreetbets,"Instead of being incentivized to save(higher interest rates on savings, CD’s, etc), we are incentivized to borrow(become indebted) through lower interest rates on borrowing. The banks would rather you owe them(your debt is their asset), than owe you(your savings are their liability). Some countries have gone so far as to have negative interest rates to keep the velocity of their currency high, and stop it from being parked(saved)."
2021-06-04 08:47:47,wallstreetbets,"If I had to make an educated guess, it’s how much the value of the dollar is affected by the amount of debt the country has. Granted most of the US debt is to citizens via bonds but still."
2021-06-04 09:48:43,wallstreetbets,"we’re largely following a Keynesian model, which encourages consumption. Since we quickly get to the point at which we consume what we can afford the Fed encourages us to borrow money to continue consuming by pushing interest rates down. 

For companies, who earn money from all of the money they borrow, this is great. They get easy money and can use it to grow their companies with very little risk. 

For consumers, who don’t earn money from the money they borrow, this is terrible. They get easy money, but quickly find that they are stuck servicing their debt.

In either case consumption remains high, so the Keynesians are happy."

2021-06-04 10:08:17,wallstreetbets,We have more debt than assets and we're okay with that now.  It used to be a big deal when you had more debt than what you are worth today.  We have more debt on average now than we are worth in 2 lifetimes. (Worth by monetary standard)
2021-06-04 12:31:45,wallstreetbets,"not the person you asked but if all debts were paid off completely from everyone using the USD, money would disappear. We've been creating money out of nothing and using inflation as a hidden tax to pay for what ever the fuck the government will spend it on since they can essentially keep borrowing from the fed. Read ""The creature from jekyll island"" dude gets a little tinfoil hatty at the end, but the first 80% of the book is just public fucking record and does a pretty good job of point out what is his own personal speculation on the matter.

include bailouts to that list because that is essentially the whole point of the federal reserves creation from the beginning. It allows banks to make very risky loans and have the government bail them out on everything in which they get the money from the federal reserve. It doesn't make any sense because it isn't logical. I just hope it doesn't all collapse in my life time or my childs tbh."

There's some truth to that story, he just doesn't talk about the parts that don't help him sell books (and they're fundamental parts of how he became so wealthy).

His parents were real estate developers. He got his agent license at age 18 and they hooked him into the good old boy network that allowed him to leverage in ways that are impossible for people without connections. He was clearing solid 6 figures of profit annually ( in 1980's dollars) and built a portfolio >4M in his 20's.

Banking regulations changed (the 1987 Competitive Equality Banking Act passed), some of his lenders were acquired and the new debt holders called in 1.2M of his 90 day loans. Here's the part of the story he skips over: he restructed his assets under that bankruptcy, he didn't ""start over from 0"". He walked away from that situation fairly wealthy, but became very financially conservative (which is pretty easy to make work for you if you already have a big chunk of capital)."
2021-06-04 10:50:45,wallstreetbets,"His strategy to get out debt was declare bankruptcy, he did not snowball. He declared bankruptcy."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Full explanation of this morning's price movement in $AMC and why this means ""Next Stop Moon!"" 🚀 🚀 🚀 The HF's and the MM's are getting pretty desperate to pop this thing. $AMC CEO made the right decision to raise capital; he wouldn't be retarded enough if he didn't. It's prudent financial management to reinvest and another reason why $AMC is going to recover greatly as we re-open. This doesn't even include the 'next-gen' theaters that are being developed to include immersive experiences, ""choose your own adventure"" movies, augmented reality, and 3D video gaming without VR headsets. But I don't know anything about that...... i just ate a crayon! 

#Is $AMC about to become the next hot tech stock?

Here's the deal. The HF's used the news about the new infusion of shares to try and pop the bubble by dumping in pre-market and at open. It had an impact, but limited. They are running out of ammunition to stop this runaway train.

There was also the multiplier effect from hedging exposure to ITM calls expiring friday in the range of $50-70. As the price fell, the trading algorithms automatically unwound the hedges against their call exposure as ITM calls went OTM and they no longer had to hold the shares. It started a cascade of 20%, which is small potatoes for shares that were up 100% yesterday. It's a small correction which will lead to 'sideways consolidation' before the next big move up.

Here's the thing. All of those ITM calls that went OTM will go right back ITM as the price recovers. This means the HFs will once again have to buy back shares to hedge their exposure to calls that were deep OTM just a few days ago. There is A LOT of call option volume which means there will be tonnes of MM hedging buying up the shares again as the price starts to recover. So, instead of dumping shares into a falling price, they will be forced to buy shares as the price rises. It will have a 'spring multiple' effect, like releasing a beach ball underwater! And again, even OTM shares with low delta need to be hedged as the price rises and the delta rises.

#TLDR: BTMFD!!!"

How do you know the price will recover?  If it doesn't, then higher strike hedging shares will start getting released as the day goes on and the spring effect pushes it down (dampened somewhat by puts moving further OTM and closing out the short hedges).  If it doesn't recover I'm guessing, based on open interest of puts and calls at various strikes, that it will close around $30.  And I don't think it's going to recover.  But I'm usually wrong about these things."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MRNA in bub go pop? There are few sectors of the market which are as privy to radical change in reaction to breaking news as the biotech/pharma sector. “X drug getting FDA approval”? – people pile in and the stock price sextuples. “X drug fails some tests”? – you know the drill. <<our boy>> Martin Shkreli, who never failed to return the tendies, took advantage of this predictable chaos and earned his claim to fame by correctly predicting that Regeneron would dump. What does this have to do with MRNA? I don’t desire his fame, the Wu Tang, or the subsequent jail… but Moderna (MRNA) is going to dump. I’ll begin with the fundamentals, then point out the obvious TA.

MRNA current price: $195, all time high as of right now. MRNA price on Jan 1, 6 mo ago: $104.47. MRNA price 15 mo ago (March 13 2020): \~$20. On this last date the MRNA market cap was 7.5 billion. These dates/prices are chosen very intentionally and paint a simple 0th order picture. Before the covid hype MRNA was valued at $20. The total market has grown \~40% since then (comparing total market index then and now), which, all else equal would suggest a price today for MRNA of $28 – not bad. But clearly we’re not factoring in vaccine profits. Moderna was approved in the U.S. in mid December \[1\] and EU approval was expected soon after so vaccine profits were priced in by the Jan 1 date at $104.47.

https://preview.redd.it/hxk4bnccz5371.png?width=1380&format=png&auto=webp&s=e52b8630105ef485d7c8d79aed55dc7233a8fb12

This price already seems too high though… depending on the sale the Moderna vaccine sells for $15 to $20 per dose \[2\]. They reached a deal to sell the U.S. 300 million and the EU 150 million doses, generously totaling $10 billion. A one time sale, yet their market cap has increased 10x from 7.5 bil to \~75 bil (read: overbought) \[3\]. The only way this makes ANY sense is if they’re counting on a significant mass of the global population > 1 billion people ( note they have “plans to make 1.4 bil doses in 2022”\[2\]) to purchase booster shots every year. To their credit, they announced a deal with UNICEF this morning to be a “long term” supplier and supply 45 million vaccines to them in 2022, but this is a far cry from their required numbers (this deal is why MRNA is at ATH right now). Do we really think MRNA is going to be able to bring > 1 billion doses to market and find enough willing buyers?

https://preview.redd.it/0k9d5e9yz5371.png?width=925&format=png&auto=webp&s=c30953d953707e0c4f3246a131f7afb165a4a26f

I don't think so, and I think the market reflects my uncertainty. First, Moderna’s main competitor (Pfizer) has been shown to be more user friendly and have less side effects now that some 150 million have tried the two. \[4,5\] Furthermore, with Pfizer, J&J, Jensen and others the covid vaccine market is actually showing up to be fairly competitive. Lastly, and very importantly, a large fraction of the people who haven’t YET got the vaccine never intend to: “nearly 40% of Americans say they will definitely not or probably not get the COVID-19 vaccine when it becomes available to them”. \[6\] This information, combined with the fact that MRNA stock is severely overbought looks to me like a ticking time bomb. MRNA’s boosted position seems incredibly fragile and has already tried to dump recently on three occasions (1 yr chart: dec 11, feb 19, may 4th )

[3 attempted dumps in past 6 months](https://preview.redd.it/pefvvc6q06371.png?width=1669&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd07abc840f8a9311424ac04d3cf56940c99e220)

[ended trading day today with high volume & momentum to gap down](https://preview.redd.it/pn92crhs06371.png?width=1451&format=png&auto=webp&s=39150b42e8324b77def00dce980999d28ccf357c)

And the reason it’s going to dump is because the current bullish valuation requires MRNA to hold a practical monopoly over the vaccine market for years to come. The facts are unraveling and this is very much showing not to be the case. If they maintain their current market share at \~500 million vaccines per yr (unlikely as we will see), this translates to an adjusted market cap of 45 billion and about the $104 price we saw in January. So the base prediction given information here-to-now is that MRNA will dump to \~$110, a 40% decrease due the fact that the MRNA vaccine production monopoly was a pipe dream all along.

And furthermore, it seems the covid treatment/prevention market may be open to even more competitors outside of vaccines. Discovered by Satoshi Omura who received a Nobel Prize for the work, Ivermectin is a cheap, not-under-patent, common drug that’s been used for forty years as a common anti-parasitic.

In Latin America, where the U.S. fancy MRNA tech is nary to be found, the people (and the market) have settled on a different solution. “The drug has been so in demand that in May health-care workers passed out some 350,000 doses to residents in northern Bolivia. That same month, the Peruvian police seized around 20,000 bottles of animal-grade ivermectin that was sold on the black market as a treatment for human coronavirus infections. And in July, a university in Peru announced that it would produce 30,000 doses to bolster the country’s supply.” \[7\] This article advocates caution because, at the time “data is scant”. But that was many months ago (oct 2020), now the data is in.

https://preview.redd.it/hjcnlbdrz5371.png?width=503&format=png&auto=webp&s=242931c1cb76e0e32e5e51ce305f8b5887a09f41

What started the rush was a demonstration that Ivermectin completely stopped covid19 replication in a petri dish \[8\], but would it do the same to covid in the human body? Well – what was the result of the mass buying in Peru? For the 24 peruvian states that implemented IVM treatment (and Lima), excess deaths quickly dropped by 75% after only 45 days. \[9\] “Extraneous causes of mortality reductions were ruled out.” At higher doses Ivermectin could be 80 to 99% effective at preventing Covid19 if taken preemptively. One trial done in Argentina had \~1,200 healthcare workers, \~400 did not take Ivermectin and the other \~800 did. Of the \~400 people who did not take Ivermectin over half of them fell sick with covid. Of the 800 who did take it, 0 (ZERO!) fell ill. \[10,11\] And lastly, meta-analysis studies: “98% of the 52 studies to date report positive effects. Random effects meta-analysis for early treatment and pooled effects shows an 81% reduction, RR 0.19 \[0.09-0.39\], and prophylactic use shows 85% improvement, RR 0.15 \[0.09-0.25\]. Mortality results show 76% lower mortality, RR 0.24 \[0.14-0.42\] for all treatment delays, and 84% lower, RR 0.16 \[0.04-0.63\] for early treatment.” \[12,13\]

Also India is improving just as many Indian states offered Ivermectin to every single adult…\[14\]. What about Africa? Didn’t analysts predict Africa would be a huge covid disaster? Well… a lot of people in Africa actually already take regular doses of Ivermectin for parasitic diseases and these populations show much lower incidents and mortality from sars covid 19.. \[15\] How do you think the covid vaccine market will fare if it has to compete against an over the counter prophylaxis drugs? You do know that the vaccine Emergency Use Authorization for the MRNA vaccine is contingent upon there being no known alternatives to preventing or treating the disease, right? \[16\] That being said, they have applied for full authorization along with Pfizer and will probably get it so this specific point is mostly moot, but still relevant.

So what do you guys think? Seems to me like MRNA is in a bubble and will pop, and the burst could be accentuated by an increasingly competitive market. Love to hear some people who disagree!

https://preview.redd.it/m2qn07t516371.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c413c11f1a4277475beb640f545c49fa7ce0dae

TA: Just look at that chart, I don’t even need to draw it. It’s a perfect Baby Eagle Hatching from Golden Egg – i.e. bout to drop another curve to complete the egg.

TLDR:

Puts on MRNA if in bubble, could drop \~40%. MRNA $145 P 7/16 (I picked dup 8x of these)

2021-06-03 23:35:37,wallstreetbets,You think it’ll fall down to pre covid levels ?
2021-06-03 23:35:35,wallstreetbets,I honestly can’t believe this piece of shit is trading this high
2021-06-04 13:05:44,wallstreetbets,"I'll just reply to 2. as this is the interesting point and the rest was more of a reaction to the egg than anything else.

Covid is presumably a one-time event so you are correct that this represents a non-annualized revenue. However, it will recur for a (small) number of years until countries stop buying vaccine. It will probably dominate their accounts for 2-3 years.

So the valuation looks like a multi-billion-dollar income for a few years, and the potential of other revenue streams replacing it. In essence pre-revenue biotech startups are ten-a-penny, but the market is (apparently) valuing the experience of crossing that threshold as an indicator it can be done again.

In relation to Pfizer the spike does look overdone, in relation to BioNTech not so much. I sold my Moderna shares at 171 before the last peak and didn't get back in because I thought it would dip lower. For the confirmation bias alone I would love to agree with you but long-term I'm pretty bullish about Moderna and will probably buy again if it dumps, so GLHF on the theory."
2021-06-03 23:44:54,wallstreetbets,"No way. My absolute worst (or best case for me) scenario is that EUA is revoked due to other drugs which could send the share price plummeting to $30 (but this is not an event I anticipate occurring). I think $110 is a better bet, and I played it safe with $145 which are running 2hundred a contract."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"HMC (Honda) is INSANELY undervalued I’m just gonna preface this by saying I love movies, and I love gaming *rockets*. 

That said, HMC (Honda) is trading UNDER its book value. Easily a 30% upward move would be a correction. It’s stock is practically illiquid with the volume on it. Options are insanely cheap. It’s PE ratio is saying it’s massively undervalued. If Honda was trading with similar metrics to Toyota it would more than double. 

I really can’t think of any good reason that Honda isn’t trading above $80. Legitimately. I recognize that my brain is smoother than the paint on Hondas, but even my crayon filled mouth is screaming to buy HMC at everybody. Awesome dividend by the way. 

Position: 150 shares and calls"
2021-06-03 23:08:43,wallstreetbets,"It’s literally selling at it’s all time high right now. How is that undervalued? Show your math.

Edit: It’s not an all-time high. I was looking at the three year chart by mistake. It has been above this level in 2011 and 2018."
2021-06-03 23:08:30,wallstreetbets,"The car industry is a technology race now, and unfortunately, Honda is behind. Comfortable and reliable cars, but not the most technologically advanced cars."
2021-06-03 22:58:49,wallstreetbets,"Honda is probably one of the most reliable engine manufacturers out there. Phenomenal products.

I have owned 3 civic hatches (all heavily modified) one 4 door integra and a civic coupe. All time favorite was my EG hatch."
2021-06-03 22:56:40,wallstreetbets,Nah Honda has done a crap job adapting to electric market.
2021-06-03 23:08:59,wallstreetbets,"They are not undervalued, they are priced very very average...in a very average industry...

While they made good cars, they are a value trap.."
2021-06-03 23:02:13,wallstreetbets,Honda has cut a lot of corners lately.  They aren’t what they used to be.  Living on legend only now.

2021-06-03 23:09:42,wallstreetbets,I’m going Ford before Honda
2021-06-03 23:11:20,wallstreetbets,Lol 😂 Ford is undervalued. It’s the og car manufacturer. They invented the assembly line. The new electric lineup but is only $14 share. Why?
2021-06-03 23:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Sorry Dude, Ford 100% too!"
2021-06-03 22:59:05,wallstreetbets,Not a bad bet but wouldn’t expect a big gain though. I like Honda.
2021-06-03 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,Honda is like a niche manufacturer now. Doesn’t make enough vehicles and got stuck with building sedans and didn’t have carplay and android auto for a long time. They think they’re the best. Korean brands much more relevant atm.
2021-06-04 00:27:25,wallstreetbets,Been undervalued for years. Nothing will happen to it. Slow movement I’ll stay away for now.
2021-06-04 02:20:39,wallstreetbets,"Honda make great cars, take the Type R for example
absolutely bullet proof, however they are well behind the EV curve and times are a changing."
2021-06-04 03:50:23,wallstreetbets,"They are a good company that makes great cars but that doesn't mean the stock is good. Their cars are so good that they can last 20 years, therefore they won't sell as much cars and be as profitable, versus a bad company that sells sht cars to the same customers every 5 years that break down and requires manufacturer parts every year. Honda is an honest company trying to make it in the real world of scummy profit driven corrupt human abusers like Nestle."
2021-06-04 07:23:06,wallstreetbets,Hondas are way too reliable!
2021-06-04 10:02:09,wallstreetbets,"I owned hmc 20 years ago.  I think I made a 1$ per share in like a year.  I think you are right, but it just isn't rewarded in our stock market.  No one is following it, you would need wsb to get on board to move it.  No hedge funds want it and haven't for years."
2021-06-03 23:12:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm constantly amazed at how many great companies are trading at P/E's under 10, while TSLA is trading around 600.

2021-06-04 07:28:21,wallstreetbets,"I agree that there is potential for future growth there and I love Honda motors, but it seems your DD may be a bit overstated. Comparing Tesla to Honda is a bit of a apples and oranges situation. On one hand, you have the pioneer of auto tech which is entrenched in focusing on the future (non-auto related as well). Then on the other hand, you have a semi-dependable auto manufacturer who has been left in the past due to reduced quality in their products for the past 10 yrs as an attempt of cutting costs and a complete swing and miss on any EV attempts they’ve made during that time.

Again, I agree there is still room for them to grow and gain more value. But unless they make some major improvements to their EV business model, they’re going to be left in the dust long term. I know they’re working with GM on a Honda and Acura EV SUV for the NA market right now that should start production in 2023. But they’re depending on another manufacturer which means minimal profits and I’m worried they’re going to be too late to the game."
2021-06-03 23:31:05,wallstreetbets,My counter argument is that Toyota is equally behind in the tech department. How come their stock is doing so well?
2021-06-03 23:30:24,wallstreetbets,Have literally never had a problem with any Honda’s I’ve owned. I can’t say that about the Ford I owned. That fusion gave me so many dumb issues lol

2021-06-03 23:56:14,wallstreetbets,Fuck Ford. They are literally the reason for our shit 5 day work weeks that we're all trying to get out of
2021-06-03 23:32:06,wallstreetbets,I agree that Ford is also undervalued!
2021-06-03 23:32:29,wallstreetbets,I agree Ford is another great pick!
2021-06-03 23:16:38,wallstreetbets,good monkey
2021-06-04 00:09:58,wallstreetbets,Toyota is furthest in fuel cells.
2021-06-03 23:54:45,wallstreetbets,"I think Toyotas only leg up in tech is the success of the Prius. Recently read that the Prius is #1 when it comes to vehicles over 15yrs old still on the road (Camry & Corolla in top 10 as well).

Not really tech but may be keeping their lack of EV advancement at bay."
2021-06-04 01:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Toyota has so many hybrids.  Honda, yeah they also have it somewhere.  RAv4 hybrid has dented SantaFe segment so much. I hate Toyota's interior and boring looks but they are putting a serious effort on become more and more electric. Honda engines are impeccable, my brother inlaw has 14 year old honda pressure washer. But honda is atleast 1 generation if not 2 behind Toyota in  Battery operated motors. I am from Canada and according to a survey 70% people said they will buy electric as next car. If honda catches up in 2 years may be then yes,  but  Ev6 and Ioniq is already here."
2021-06-04 05:38:30,wallstreetbets,"Actually, toyota was stock piling the necessary chips for theor cars. Well ahead of the competition. Consequently, they will be the only major manufacturer that will not have supply issues. Thus contributing to their recent run."
2021-06-03 23:31:32,wallstreetbets,"People hate on Honda’s because they also make lawn mowers... they forget to acknowledge that they make jets too. 

They probably have more experience building engines than most companies out there."
2021-06-04 01:31:29,wallstreetbets,Too reliable. Buy F. More time in the shop means more tendies for shareholders buy Honda cars. Buy ford stock.
2021-06-03 23:57:28,wallstreetbets,Great cars. The k20 is a modern marvel. I have a buddy running low 10’s all motor in an eg. Retarded

Interested to see how their electric f150 does tho"

2021-06-03 23:38:40,wallstreetbets,They have successfully built some of the most fuel efficient vehicles for decades. They will adapt. I’m def not worried about that.
2021-06-04 01:01:23,wallstreetbets,Agreed on most of the modern fords. I think they’re doing quite well in the EV development and have a lot of potential to grow. I’d rather drive a Honda but I’d sooner invest in Ford.

* **SIGNED** agreement with Vitol. At today’s prices, the agreement is valued at approximately $12 billion in revenue over ten years.
* Look at other similar companies. How many similar companies are debt free and signing significant contracts? This stock is **criminally undervalued**. Kept down by shorts.

I can only short fewer shares, yes, but AMC will need to reach 500-600 dollars for me to get a margin call, which i have additional cash set aside just in case.

Yes don't sell, your 5, 10, 20 shares aren't going to matter anyway. But the people with 500k shares and 1 mil shares, what's their next move? You think someone who has amassed enough wealth in their life to purchase a mil shares will come to this sub and go ""oh s*** some random guy told me not to sell, and I am going to hold on"""

Some craziness going on with WKHS today, tomorrow should be interesting.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$NOK - Discussion  

**Some points to ponder**

* Historically a stable stock around $4-5 range for past 5 years
* Currently trading Mid 5's
* The Chief Financial Officer of Nokia (Marco Wiren) has bought 152,000 shares of Nokia stock on May 31, 2021.
* Averaging above 100 million shares past days.
* Backlash of US and Europe on Huawei causing more focus/reliance on Nokia (use google for more info - I want to make this simple)
* Ericsson ( A big competitor to Nokia) to pay $97 million to Nokia for after settling damages claim
* Has rode the short squeeze train in the past along with AMC and GME (give proof of ability for stock to climb in price)
* ""As of May 14, Nokia had 33.28 million shares held short as opposed to the 28.23 million shares held short on April 15."" Increase in shorts
* Looking at chart for yourselves it has been bubbling and slowly rising. Other stocks have shown similar patterns before they take off"

2021-06-04 01:48:02,wallstreetbets,"NOK will at the VERY LEAST match Ericsson Market Cap by the end of 2021... roughly $8 a share.  It is currently undervalued based on Q1 growth, and the companies own Q2,3,4 projections."

I don't think it will be possible for NOK to ever moon to GME levels of 350. But 50? 60?... We could do that one day though it might take a reverse stock split or two to get us there.

My mode of thinking is that I am long on NOK, short squeeze or not, Im holding. I believe that NOK is a good company with a lot of good prospects and irons in the fire. I look forward to see what they do over the next few years."

I missed out on most of GME but cleaned up on AMC and now am doing good already on $14 BB calls expiry June 18th I paid $400 each for on Wednesday. Sold half for $700 this morning so almost freerolling.

Meme stocks all run together, I want AMC to skyrocket so BB will too..IMO your getting in a lot cheaper on calls for NOK and BB than AMC...next week $145 AMC are like $1200 and that's risky imo. Prob will happen but def a gamble.

$14 BB or $6 NOK call much more likely to pay higher if your only getting in now imo."

More than 160 contracts in the past two years alone. License fees are starting to accumulate on the balance sheet, and above all absolute superiority in software development for 5g. Those guys are massively undervalued, please understand that the 5G industry will be the main backbone of the 4th industrial revolution. I am talking about more than a trillion of investments, services and maintenance, equipment and tons of new commercial products, all dependent on that 5G technology of which NOK is a leader.

Possibly I have used some wrong language, I will try to fix that with this post. In any case, this is important news for all AMC holders:

AMC has issued almost all of their shares (they've got only 46,124 shares left). And they will NOT issue any additional shares in 2021, according to them. This is good news, as it can certainly help the stock price to move higher.

They issued some shares today, and raised cash. For the company this is a good thing. They are well capitalized now. They asked for permission to issue 25 Million shares sometimes in 2022 - But we can talk about that when it is important, in 2022 their business could be a 110% again, and issuing new shares won't be necessary anymore.

This is the important part of their statement:

""As of today,  in our efforts to best position AMC for a successful recovery from the  pandemic, we have issued or reserved substantially all but 46,124 of the  shares that were previously authorized. ""

Full statement:[https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Files-Preliminary-Proxy-Statement-Voting-to-Begin-June-16-2021/default.aspx](https://investor.amctheatres.com/newsroom/news-details/2021/AMC-Entertainment-Holdings-Inc.-Files-Preliminary-Proxy-Statement-Voting-to-Begin-June-16-2021/default.aspx)"

2021-06-04 08:17:45,wallstreetbets,"This is such an unhealthy post. AMC near the highs had a market cap well over Bayer AG (yes the German multinational pharmaceutical company) and many other well known companies. 

AMC just in April said they couldn't pay rent and were on the verge of bankruptcy. Yes they have capital now but remember at the end of the day this is a movie chain. The only reason for this stock to still go up short term is squeezes and aggressive day trading.

Mad entertaining but put things into perspective at least OP."
2021-06-04 08:20:14,wallstreetbets,"Debt holders can still force them to issue shares since they came out of bankruptcy the company has a fiduciary duty to their debt over equity.

Something important to remember with 20% short interest and 80% retail long.  Even on a squeeze only 1/4 apes can cover.  The rest cover at 0."

2021-06-04 08:46:20,wallstreetbets,Does AMC have a plan to turn their business around like GME does? Not fud but I'm genuinely curious.
2021-06-04 08:50:25,wallstreetbets,So if AMC stock is really worth muh les than current reading price the only incentive for AMC to not issue shares in the future is stock options for the executive team. Any shares issued should be accretive to their long-term intrinsic value.

2021-06-04 11:16:30,wallstreetbets,Do you also see how they're selling same expiration date contracts with lower strike? They're bearish.
2021-06-04 09:21:07,wallstreetbets,"Don't focus on what-ifs and leave your emotions out of it. Avoid regret and develop an ever evolving strategy and learn from your mistakes. If you don't leave your emotions out of it you're going to end up insane.

Did you have any idea that the stock would grow this much and fast? If not then don't be hard on yourself. If you had randomly owned the stock before then it would just have been lucky.

Did you think at any time during these days that it would continue growing? If you didn't and didn't invest then what did you do wrong? You shouldn't act irrational so be proud that you didn't.

Study this and see if you can learn anything from it. 

Like I watched it grow to $40 and then back to $30. I thought that was that and that it was too late to jump in. Then it jumped to $60+ and I was proven wrong. But I had no idea or even any kind of evidence to be able to suspect that it would continue growing. So I wasn't confident in trading he stock. 

So I have no regrets. I missed an opportunity but there is no way I could have seen it coming with my current skill level and experience in the stock market. If I had randomly timed it it would just have been a fluke."

2021-06-04 12:31:50,wallstreetbets,Always care about funsamentals for a long term hold. AMC is certainly not a long term hold. I sure as hell will trade the volatility though if I think there is money to be made.

2021-06-04 01:52:32,wallstreetbets,"Yes, although just long enough until momentum investors (most of the people who bought AMC) realize the price is not moving and sell out. That's the problem with the greater fool theory, eventually there's no longer a fool who'll pay you more."
2021-06-04 07:27:54,wallstreetbets,"The stock has to change hands in order for the market price to reflect what’s happening. If no one sell, and no one is buying then you have zero clue what the value of the stock is. It’s only worth what someone is willing to pay."
2021-06-04 02:43:50,wallstreetbets,"Remember the supply & demand module from Econ in highschool? 

Yeah, moon."
2021-06-04 05:10:45,wallstreetbets,"It’s simple. 

Those who want to buy will increase their offer price until someone who owns shares caves and sells. 

That will then be the new price of the stock."
2021-06-04 09:31:34,wallstreetbets,"Theoretically if no holder sells under any circumstances, there would be no stock ""price"" to speak of. The price you see on a chart is the amount the last stock sold was sold for, usually landing somewhere in the bid and ask spread. 

In practice, people would eventually sell if the bid price got high enough or if they got bored of holding."

2021-06-03 23:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Also they do not have any shares to issue anymore, except the 40k... they cant print them out of thin air, this process to get this approved takes time."

2021-06-04 01:32:15,wallstreetbets,"Nothing. Makes no difference who owns the shares— AMC is selling them now, individual owners will sell them later. Short positions will buy what is being sold to cover over time unless margin called (unlikely), in which case they will buy all at once to cover, cause a sharp spike (during which many people will sell simultaneously) followed by a correction to a lower “true” value (caused by all the selling) as supply and demand determine the price."

2021-06-03 22:42:34,wallstreetbets,the 11k? what do you mean exactly?

2021-06-03 22:53:34,wallstreetbets,"All they did was ask for permission to issue 25 million shares in 2022 in case it is needed. That doesn't mean it will happen, and if it does, it will not happen this year."

2021-06-03 22:45:26,wallstreetbets,They intend to bring it to a vote in late July. But guess who votes? Us. No one is going for that unless the squeeze is over and it’s coming muuuuuch sooner than that.

2021-06-04 01:26:20,wallstreetbets,"This is the quintessential schism between NewWSB and OldWSB—and the way you can tell that someone’s purely a post-GME person. Sigh… OldWSBetters don’t care whether anyone else makes money. I want to make money, if it comes out of a hedge fund’s pocket or an ape’s pocket—I don’t give a single fuck tbh. 

The stock market is not a team sport. There is no “we” and if you think there is, you’re drunk off the hype and will end up holding the bag. To make money —that you can actually withdraw and hold in your (diamond) hands— you will HAVE to sell. Yes, blasphemous but true—you want tendies? You must sell. 

When you do, it’s in your best interest to do so alone and not alongside a million other apes trying to step off this airplane before it hits the ground."
2021-06-04 01:40:28,wallstreetbets,Technically it says the positions can be used for long or short exposure. I thought it was interesting they had a whole short squeeze section added to that filing stating that a short squeeze is possible to happen. Although have not read many of these so what do I know.

2021-06-04 02:37:35,wallstreetbets,"they didn't issue these share bro, and now they pulled back and reduced the amount from 500 to 25 millions. the 25 million MIGHT happen in 2022 - if they still need more cash then, but not in 2021."
2021-06-04 06:40:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah don’t mind me, it was an incomplete version of an article that left out the 2022 thing. Whuddo I know though… I’m all in on $RTRD"
2021-06-04 09:09:06,wallstreetbets,They’re giving away free popcorn what more do you people want
2021-06-04 09:52:49,wallstreetbets,"This possibly for next year, but they do not even have approval yet.

And the 500 million shares is not true at all, they changed it for 25 million"
2021-06-04 10:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Im glad they are done issuing shares for 2021, now price can pump"
2021-06-04 14:08:37,wallstreetbets,A universe where they devalue fiat by printing it into oblivion
2021-06-04 10:00:13,wallstreetbets,"no, that's the point, they will not create new share in 2021"
2021-06-04 03:25:28,wallstreetbets,Sheesh tits are jacked
2021-06-04 02:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Does that mean if amc jumps to 145 you get tendies? I really don't know, smooth brain 🦧 here"
2021-06-04 00:51:11,wallstreetbets,What expiration?
2021-06-04 04:00:48,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-06-04 09:20:49,wallstreetbets,Rooting for ya!
2021-06-04 12:33:33,wallstreetbets,"Ah you poor dumb bastard. Even if it reaches 145, youre probably going to lose money. I don't think you understand why those 145c were bought."
2021-06-04 12:55:42,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-06-04 15:22:11,wallstreetbets,Post results please.
2021-06-04 19:31:05,wallstreetbets,When does it expire? The costs of the calls right now is crazy high.
2021-06-04 01:26:05,wallstreetbets,You tell me when to sell pls
2021-06-04 06:06:35,wallstreetbets,"If I buy 1 contract 6/11 $73 calls for 9.60 costing me $960 total, what is the break even point?"
2021-06-04 06:27:55,wallstreetbets,Could be a $145 strike calendar spread.. i.e. buying a long expiry and financing it with a short expiry ( same strike ). You are not exposed that much as if the short one reaches $145 you can always exercise your long one to get the shares. All you loose is the difference between the bought one and the sold one.
2021-06-04 07:37:10,wallstreetbets,"It doesn't have to actually hit 145 to force hedging.  If it can even begin to approach it, an absolute massive gamma squeeze could occur."
2021-06-04 00:55:11,wallstreetbets,"Some trader purchased 173k contracts @ 1.17 
$145 calls expiring JUNE 4"
2021-06-04 00:29:18,wallstreetbets,"173k contracts, not dollars. Check the volume of 145 strike calls expiring 6/4"
2021-06-04 08:01:39,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, writing a 145 call is free money. There's fucking no way it gets even close to that today. Even if it rallies, not getting there"
2021-06-04 01:56:27,wallstreetbets,This usually means the opposite is going to happen 😂 I’ve seen this one before but I’m not fucking selling!
2021-06-04 07:30:17,wallstreetbets,"Just like when everyone was buying $800 GME calls, MM clearly don't capitilize on these FDs yall are buying.

2021-06-04 11:39:05,wallstreetbets,It’s possible. Some very sophisticated planned that move.
2021-06-04 11:39:26,wallstreetbets,I agree. It’s a sophisticated move.
2021-06-04 11:40:11,wallstreetbets,The trade was likely part of a bigger strategy I suspect
2021-06-04 11:41:01,wallstreetbets,Definitely agree. I just found it an interesting trade.
2021-06-04 11:42:35,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t agree more. But i think this was part of a hedge. Some had to own the shares and then sell covered calls or a synthetic trade.
2021-06-04 11:43:10,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
2021-06-04 11:44:34,wallstreetbets,I agree. Selling calls is a bearish bet.
2021-06-04 08:46:43,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-06-04 14:59:21,wallstreetbets,fckin lmao
2021-06-04 09:22:11,wallstreetbets,"You have done the right thing. Together we have achieved momentary balance.

When you are in the green though, will you do as i did? Time will tell."
2021-06-04 10:20:13,wallstreetbets,when in doubt always buy High and sell Low
2021-06-04 09:21:04,wallstreetbets,"Sadly yes. Damn this creamy white center!

For I am soft all the way through."
2021-06-04 08:03:02,wallstreetbets,honestly the premarket has rarely reflected the days moves for meme stocks
2021-06-04 07:02:45,wallstreetbets,slim.
2021-06-04 00:46:39,wallstreetbets,">How is it that zero AMC posts are at the top of WallStreetBets?

3 of the top 5 are all AMC???"
2021-06-03 23:40:55,wallstreetbets,I don’t know about compromised but I think a lot of people see 200% returns and want to find the next one but also people want the stock they picked to be the right one so they promote the hell out of it.  When GME went up AMC was all over the discussion.
2021-06-04 02:00:45,wallstreetbets,people have been talking about BB on this sub since January and even as early as December. I’m not sure what you’re talking about lol
2021-06-04 08:52:19,wallstreetbets,I watched several posts completely disappear two days ago from the feed regarding AMC.
2021-06-04 00:18:50,wallstreetbets,I have other retarded ape friends that don't follow WSB and they're telling me they're buying blackberry and Nokia.  Not sure where they're getting it but it's not here
2021-06-04 00:27:16,wallstreetbets,Has been since January. Old wsb is gone.
2021-06-04 08:37:18,wallstreetbets,I had the same thought yesterday. The AMC posts are few and far between. It should be a very hot topic
2021-06-03 23:35:14,wallstreetbets,"Talk to the moderators about that one. They do the deleting.  In fairness, there is a lot of pointless AMC posting going on so I don’t blame them for removing posts."
2021-06-04 03:19:23,wallstreetbets,"Indeed. Anything other than AMC and GME is simply a distraction, none of the other “meme stocks” have the short interest, retail owning the float, upcoming shareholder meetings etc."
2021-06-03 23:54:27,wallstreetbets,Cuz amc is the original distraction
2021-06-04 03:50:59,wallstreetbets,Idiot
2021-06-04 05:55:35,wallstreetbets,https://imgflip.com/i/5c2msx
2021-06-04 07:58:19,wallstreetbets,BB is paying. AMC isn't.
2021-06-04 02:17:49,wallstreetbets,Literally the second one. And the first is at least in part about amc too https://i.imgur.com/fOeuspu.jpg
2021-06-04 02:34:32,wallstreetbets,"Well those of us on here pre amc, had bb, and we want it to finally go up after being held down since before January."
2021-06-04 00:10:59,wallstreetbets,Dawg GME has 1/5 the float of AMC .. a lot more to it than just price of stock
2021-06-03 22:55:08,wallstreetbets,I doubt it goes that high. The situation with GameStop that caused such a huge squeeze was because they literally had 140% of the float shorted. Obviously it was high leverage being used. And that’s why that stock went up so much. I do not think AMC will see that kind of rise. But certainly $100 a share is very doable
2021-06-03 23:01:55,wallstreetbets,"
I am using the dips, like the one we got today, to pick up calls. Call option profits have been absolutely blowing up especially this past week. $$$$"
2021-06-04 00:33:04,wallstreetbets,I smell a sad sack who didn't get in on time
2021-06-04 17:35:56,wallstreetbets,"They're near 6 billion in debt and have like $800 million cash on hand.

And are losing money.

They'll issue those shares as soon as they can."
2021-06-04 09:18:03,wallstreetbets,Yup they'll be bankrupt before then and the half billion shares will be worthless and they can start over again issuing a new half billion to morons
2021-06-03 22:56:12,wallstreetbets,"No they're not, they'll be bankrupt at their current burn rate by the end of next year and are still $4bn in debt."
2021-06-04 08:28:03,wallstreetbets,They were in a dogshit position well before covid my friend.
2021-06-03 23:33:47,wallstreetbets,Fuck covid. No such thing.
2021-06-03 23:17:01,wallstreetbets,"He did an interview with trey's trade without his pants.  ""Naked short"" anyone?"
2021-06-03 23:24:05,wallstreetbets,Ageed.  He offered us free popcorn right before the announcement.  Lol. We want tendies not popcorn.
2021-06-04 00:31:34,wallstreetbets,He's been milking retail titties as much as he can.
2021-06-04 02:06:42,wallstreetbets,you mean a guy with a bad business is able to issue shares at 4 times actual value and has no risks if it goes tits up?
2021-06-04 01:06:38,wallstreetbets,"He said he wouldn't issue a single share of the 500M additional shares they were asking to add at the next vote. He was very candid *about a month ago in the first interview with Treys Trades* about having ~46M shares that they already had on hand they could/would sell this year if the opportunity arose and made sense for the company. No offense, but you clearly didn't actually watch the interview otherwise there would be no confusion.

*edit for clarity"
2021-06-03 23:20:11,wallstreetbets,"They issued 20 million shares which would have been issued ANYWAYS. They were the 20 million shares that were supposed to be given to the executive team. 


The executive team forfeited 20 million shares they would have been given, to raise over 1 billion for AMC. 


GME and AMC are both plays. Executives giving the company their bonus shares to improve the fundamentals of the company while fighting short positions is not a bad thing.


Improving long term fundamentals increases pressure on shorts, and they did that."
2021-06-04 04:37:30,wallstreetbets,amc is a sellout 😂
2021-06-04 00:10:12,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 03:47:36,wallstreetbets,"That was in regards to the canceled 500Mio Share dilution. 

The 11Mio shares that were Sold yesterday were part of the 43Mio they already had and now sold. The offer was already registered in April but was sold yesterday. 

No new shares."
2021-06-04 07:17:55,wallstreetbets,Nah he said he wouldn’t sell anymore shares passed the 43 million he had
2021-06-04 09:25:51,wallstreetbets,I don’t get this animosity between AMC and GME people its super tribal. Pick one or pick both. No reason to make it an us vs them thing. Apes are weird.
2021-06-04 12:05:54,wallstreetbets,They won’t be bankrupt anytime soon. They have enough money for years now.
2021-06-03 22:57:17,wallstreetbets,"GME fundamentals aren’t that out of line. Retail p/s is typically .75-2, Ecom is 5+. If GME transitions to ecom I would expect their market cap to trend toward 5x sales or about 50b."
2021-06-04 09:55:53,wallstreetbets,When did you buy them?
2021-06-04 10:11:32,wallstreetbets,Sorry....yesterday afternoon
2021-06-04 00:50:47,wallstreetbets,I've GOT to stop tipping all these pre-med strippers in Vegas...
2021-06-03 23:15:14,wallstreetbets,"""according to them""        I've been on this train long enough to know that they will find away to dilute. It's second nature."
2021-06-04 02:21:59,wallstreetbets,or demand would cause the price to skyrocket since there would be no supply.
2021-06-04 03:41:22,wallstreetbets,"Volume / transactions are what change price, no?  Price would remain the same until someone is willing to sell for some higher price."
2021-06-04 03:04:23,wallstreetbets,Mars
2021-06-04 07:09:40,wallstreetbets,What if we keep buying from all those fools trying to sell? Let the shorts bleed for as long as it takes. I don't want another retarded apes money. I want short seller tendies.
2021-06-04 09:40:54,wallstreetbets,Or... shorts borrow and sell ath and the market will do its own correction. And then even if the stock price drops... because it will... the shorts will try and take some profit but... no one is selling. Gamma spike. The shorts get margin called but amc just issues special shares at 200 a pop to allow them to cover without going bankrupt and the 1% just paid to save a movie theaterl that was going out of business.... but what about you retail investors??? You guys are given divident payouts for holding shares. Because you own the company and they owe you. But you put someone in charge... like one of us. Thats my retarded best scenario. There are others. Which one would you like to hear.
2021-06-03 22:49:39,wallstreetbets,"End of Week, my dear ape <3 (yasss)"
2021-06-04 13:35:30,wallstreetbets,People don't understand how bad covid was for them.
2021-06-04 00:32:45,wallstreetbets,Every week they will dialute.. until us retail get fed up and leave.. this is the only reason I see for HF to keep upping their position
2021-06-03 23:13:01,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 01:28:33,wallstreetbets,So that previous 500 million authorized shares has all been sold?

2021-06-03 23:36:04,wallstreetbets,When has that stopped greedy pigs? They dont care about our fundamentals
2021-06-04 09:14:18,wallstreetbets,"""Makes no difference who owns the shares"" is misleading and flat out wrong."
2021-06-03 23:16:32,wallstreetbets,He's clearly going to fuck a pig.
2021-06-03 23:31:26,wallstreetbets,that's just coach giving you a pep talk
2021-06-04 01:45:11,wallstreetbets,"My dude, they SOLD the shares today for a 587mil profit"
2021-06-03 23:30:23,wallstreetbets,They made an announcement they sold 11 mil shares today to make money.  Amc is a sellout
2021-06-03 22:51:32,wallstreetbets,11k means 11000 you ape.
2021-06-04 14:38:25,wallstreetbets,Classic delusion that AMC will squeeze like the MOASS. I am glad for homies that made money on AMC but it’s a distraction to say the least
2021-06-04 06:42:30,wallstreetbets,Ah
2021-06-03 23:32:08,wallstreetbets,Thats what they said last time and they just sold 11mil shares today. So dont believe anything amc says anymore
2021-06-03 22:56:55,wallstreetbets,Well it has to be voted on by the shareholders and you apes apparently collectively control 80% of the company now. So it means whatever you want it to mean.
2021-06-03 22:53:17,wallstreetbets,"Like for new movies, for rifftracks live, for studio ghibli. I guess I should say ""I go to everything they have."" Or at least I used to back before..."
2021-06-04 10:46:35,wallstreetbets,Double top on the daily now.
2021-06-04 09:48:23,wallstreetbets,They filed it yesterday. There's plenty of shares. Good luck though
2021-06-04 01:32:06,wallstreetbets,Of course we are looking out for ourselves. We can still band together for a push and take gains. Rising tides raise all ships.
2021-06-04 12:40:45,wallstreetbets,If that is true then they will never be forced to cover in mass. The short interest will always remain around the same 20% and the only addl volume to buying is coming in from retail which will soon figure out they are just acting as an ATM card for AMC debt. Only $5 billion left to go lol.
2021-06-04 02:38:55,wallstreetbets,"Haha they released 25m new shares just this week dude, after the CEO was saying previously they weren’t going to sell any more shares this year

I can’t blame them though. AMCs profitable business is selling stock, not movie tickets 😂"
2021-06-04 09:30:51,wallstreetbets,Lol is this for real?
2021-06-04 08:06:50,wallstreetbets,Breasts are indeed swole
2021-06-04 07:36:05,wallstreetbets,Aimed and ready to go!
2021-06-04 03:33:47,wallstreetbets,"In a word, yes."
2021-06-04 04:36:32,wallstreetbets,"No, it has to go above 145 + whatever they paid for the contract, otherwise they're still losing money from the price of the contract."
2021-06-04 07:16:09,wallstreetbets,Especially today their time of decay is basically out the window!! Dollar for Dollar
2021-06-04 05:50:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you could sell anytime ITM or OTM before close."
2021-06-04 07:28:19,wallstreetbets,And if it doesn't the same people who are shorting your stock keep his premiamos money.
2021-06-04 00:54:12,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow June 4
2021-06-04 00:53:37,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow
2021-06-04 17:13:17,wallstreetbets,Expired worthless lost $57 haha
2021-06-04 10:37:20,wallstreetbets,I don't think that will happen...you gotta do you...but best of luck..and I'd suggest watching that call real close today...🤔
2021-06-04 06:41:01,wallstreetbets,"Options contracts are sold in 100, but priced per share. Calculating break even is fairly straightforward: 73 + 9.60 = 82.60"
2021-06-04 17:29:37,wallstreetbets,If you look at your options in the account it should say bep or break even price
2021-06-04 09:02:16,wallstreetbets,Exactly. It just needs to trend towards that strike.
2021-06-04 01:29:17,wallstreetbets,U are insane
2021-06-04 02:58:22,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain this to a true retard?
2021-06-04 03:03:42,wallstreetbets,Did you by chance look at 13f info and see if institutions hold that? If so it'll be bullish as duck for me. Time to dig.
2021-06-04 03:24:17,wallstreetbets,God speed
2021-06-04 03:36:23,wallstreetbets,Wow...
2021-06-04 03:27:17,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban
2021-06-04 00:54:03,wallstreetbets,Where do you check that?
2021-06-04 01:30:58,wallstreetbets,"Keep in mind these could easily be hedges. You sell say the 120s buy the 145s. Under the belief that if it goes past 120, it doubtfully lands under 145."
2021-06-04 00:37:43,wallstreetbets,Really? That’s wild I probably could have looked it up on Google or something but my broker was not showing me any info on the 145 strikes when I checked it was blank like it was glitched out or something. I mean they were pretty low in premium compared to all the others when I checked this morning but 173k contracts those are some balls for options expiring way OTM tomorrow. Hoping to bank on premiums or what? What would be the strategy there.
2021-06-04 11:56:56,wallstreetbets,On wsb that may as well be a savings bond.
2021-06-04 08:05:48,wallstreetbets,I am owner of the stock but i am trying to be realistic
2021-06-04 08:32:31,wallstreetbets,Why that? I thought After a dip there is a high
2021-06-04 02:10:33,wallstreetbets,I remember a lot of talk back in gme days saying AMC and NOK is just to divert our attention from GME
2021-06-04 05:36:09,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, you joined in February tf u talking about"
2021-06-04 00:59:57,wallstreetbets,"Old WSB, 9 of the top 10 posts at any given moment were loss porn screenshots of different random options trades.

New WSB is 100% meme-stocks and people like y'all complaining about people not hopping on the same bandwagon.

2021-06-04 07:31:17,wallstreetbets,"GME happened because it was a new game of sorts that hadn't been run in a while, and it was run in a novel way on a company that deliberately wanted to not let the shares increase. This caught Wall St by surprise.

AMC is the opposite for reasons people here know. Maybe it is the end of the offerings or not. The CEO is covering himself by telling retail not to believe in the stock. That's pretty unprecedented.

I don't know who is organized on the buying side, but the Wall St side knows the game now, and has ways to direct trades in ways to scare the wits out of the uninitiated.

BB I understand bc that's a tech company with a possible future. AMC has no future, unless they own all that property and can turn it into apts, or some new sort of gaming centers that actually make money."
2021-06-03 23:27:22,wallstreetbets,Yeah plus RH keeps halting as soon as it goes over a certain amount.   I dont see a GME thing happening.   I cashed out at an average of $68. Tripled my investment.

AMC sells shares they’ve had the ability and right to for years now = some people try to use it against them.   

GME sells shares and it’s the smartest most 1000 IQ 9-D chess move ever.   

AMC asks for a bigger reserve and people freak out. GME does it and it makes total sense.  People are just dumb and acting like there has to be one short to rule them all."

2021-06-04 09:16:44,wallstreetbets,With half a billion shares there is supply. Someone will part with them for an amount because some idiot will stupidly buy it with your line of thinking. Look at Look at volume each day. Half a billion. People will sell because the company sucks and they don't want to be bagholders. When the bagholders realize this they'll be too late but will trade their shares progressively lower so they aren't the last moron standing
2021-06-04 07:08:25,wallstreetbets,I'll sell you a share for $50k. Is there high enough?

2021-06-04 14:43:49,wallstreetbets,"GME still too expensive for most to make a real profit. You’d have to put in $125,000 for 500 shares at current price. Even if it went up 30 points, that’s still only $15,000 gain.

The typical retail ape can’t touch 500 shares, and would be lucky to be able to afford 20-30, which equates to a pitiful $600-900 profit before tax. GME has to crash by 50% for an influx of newbs to be able to get on board."
2021-06-04 02:47:41,wallstreetbets,It wasn't just said this time. It's written in the filing
2021-06-04 00:03:28,wallstreetbets,"They made the play back in april. The plan at least. Sold today. They won big because of retail investment and will now survive for the next 6 years without a worry. Seems smart to me.  Those bastards sold 11m shares today for 587 million. Adding 11m to 450m shares... And ensuring the company survives for 5 yrs no matter what?!  Fuck the borrowed shares 2 days ago was 89 million. Win win.

2021-06-03 23:42:51,wallstreetbets,"They will go bankrupt if they can't raise the fund, won't they?
So either you vote for them to dilute your share or it becomes worthless. I have no skin in the game so just wonder if it is the case."
2021-06-04 09:50:28,wallstreetbets,"that's wrong bro, they issued the shares yesterday, sold them, and no they do not have anymore to sell. except around 40k, which is nothing"

2021-06-04 03:49:04,wallstreetbets,I get so confused about strike price. I made $200 off a 12$ call for AMC but Idk why I’d buy a20$ call when I could just get the 12 dollar one what’s the difference please and thanks x
2021-06-04 04:51:31,wallstreetbets,"So if it stays under 145, whoever paid for the contract loses money, right?"
2021-06-04 04:52:45,wallstreetbets,but he can resell this contract if it goes green?
2021-06-04 06:19:29,wallstreetbets,"Not necessarily, if it went to even 90 pretty quickly, the contract would still have a significantly higher value. That's likely what most people will do with those contracts."
2021-06-04 09:30:07,wallstreetbets,They also profit if it just goes up towards it and hey are able to resell the contract at a profit
2021-06-04 19:01:15,wallstreetbets,"in theory yes, but in practice  a runup to 145 would mean a massive volatility spike which would probably result in those being profitable even before it reaches 145"

2021-06-04 17:17:54,wallstreetbets,"Ahh, rip the dream. Hey next week is probably gonna pop off too. Good luck!"
2021-06-04 03:46:58,wallstreetbets,"The people/companies who bought it paid $1.17 for each right to buy one piece of stock at $145 on June 4 (that's today).

If the stock costs less than that on the open market, the right they bought is worthless, because why would you buy at $145 when you can get it cheaper.

If the stock goes to $146... they still lost money because they spent more than a dollar on the right.

If the stock goes to $150, they can buy it for $145, sell for $150, make $5 (minus the $1.17 they spent) for a massive profit.

It's a bet that loses unless the stock makes it to $146.17, then pays off massively.

That's how those massive gain porn screenshots are generated - it rarely goes well, but if it does... tendies.

Oh, also, a contract is 100 units if I'm not mistaken. So if the number is correct, overall, investors and gamblers put $20M into this bet that is highly unlikely to pay off.

Note that not all of this has to be WSB apes gambling, options are also used to e.g. limit risk (""hedging""). Imagine you promised someone 100 pieces of AMC stock tomorrow as part of some other trade. You can afford to take a little risk, but if it goes over $145, that's too much for you... So you pay $117 (100x1.17) to make sure that in the unlikely case it goes up even more, you can at least get it for $145.

~~But I suspect most of it are WSB gamblers.~~ edit: the last sentence was a guess and there are good arguments below why this could be all hedging."
2021-06-04 03:12:32,wallstreetbets,They yoloed 173k on $140 calls that expire tomorrow. Thats about a over 300% price increase in amc tomorrow

2021-06-04 07:35:05,wallstreetbets,Max loss on a bull call spread is 145 and up.  Landing between 120 and 145 there can still be profitable.
2021-06-04 06:23:07,wallstreetbets,I would instead buy the lower strikes and sell the higher to help finance it.

It's actually what you want the company to do, it's a smart move.  And the shares were already issued as part of a prior shareholder shelf offering.  They just sold now bc price was high, so it raises more capital.  Which is the ENTIRE POINT of selling shares.  To make money.  See what I did there?  Let's moon apes."

2021-06-04 05:39:42,wallstreetbets,"Because the lower strike price probably cost you more premium. When buying an option there is intrinsic value - current value and extrinsic value - time left on option.

The more time an option has the more premium. The closer the strike price is to current stock price the more premium.

So why would you buy the $20 strike? Because it would be cheaper in premium."
2021-06-04 07:50:00,wallstreetbets,"A Call Option's Value = Intrinsic value (Underlying Price - Strike Price) + Option Premium

The lower strike call options are always more expensive as they have more intrinsic value. You can buy more of the higher strike options and proportionally make more with the same capital if the price explodes past the strike you are holding..."

2021-06-04 04:01:40,wallstreetbets,They're cheaper
2021-06-04 15:12:45,wallstreetbets,You gotta brush up on options Greeks bruh. Options aren’t just about strikes
2021-06-04 04:57:40,wallstreetbets,"Sort of, they only lose the money that it cost them to buy that contract. That’s why a short is different than a call (obviously they also go different directions because short = you betting it goes down) because on a short you can lose infinite money (if the prices keeps going up) but on calls you can only lose the amount you paid for the contracts and then they may expire worthless.

Edit: 

For how much you make: The contract is a right to buy the stock at that price. So if buying calls at 145 for .4 cents, it must go higher than 145.4 for you to make money overall on the transaction. If it hit 160 you would make 160  - 145 - .4 which is 14.6. But then if your contract is actually for 100 shares, you make 1460. If the stock finishes below 145 you will lose the amount you paid ( .4 ), and if it finishes between 145 and 145.4 then you lose (final price - 145.4).

Edit 2: this is the case if you exercise the calls. HOWEVER you can also SELL the calls to someone else if your position is improving BEFORE they expire. For example if you bought the calls when it was 100, but now the price is up at 140 and there is still 2 weeks left to get to 145, your option contract is now worth more, and people will be willing to pay for it. As a replier said, the premium may NOW be .6, even though you bought at .4 . The option is now yours to sell if you choose (pun intended), so you can sell at .6 and collect the .2 per share (which will be 20).  Overall this is what most people do because others/the market will pay a premium on the chance that it keeps going up, while in reality it may just be 50/50 by the time you sell or maybe even lower in your opinion if it’s hit its ceiling. In my opinion it’s the best move to do that, unless you are confident the stock will keep going up, because you never really know with volatility."
2021-06-04 05:46:33,wallstreetbets,They could try to sell it during the session before close. Green or not
2021-06-04 05:03:17,wallstreetbets,"Yes. If it expires and the stock is under 145, the call option will become worthless."

 If AMC wasnt paying their CEOS and board members 100-300  mil in shares, bonuses and salaries every year they wouldnt be in debt and they wouldnt have to sell shares.  Blow me whoever thinks AMC and these other crappy companies ceos are due a 20mil salary plus bonuses and shares every year.  They drove that company to the ground every year if they couldnt survive a pandemic.  Government was giving out loans and handouts to these big corps.  How did they get billions in debt?  Because even though they were making 20mil a year they didnt Forsee something like this happening?  Im mean noone saw covid happeing but something like it.  Their whole plan has been getting people in to the theaters.  Paying 30 for oily popcorn and dried up hotdogs and $30 for tickets $100 for a whole family?   Tell me they deserve that kind of salary every year.  

They dont care about the cause.  Strictly greed for them.   So yeah im covering my ass too and getting out.  Im not going to get left holding the bag while those guys get 2 mil bonuses for running a failing business. I wish the best for you and the other holdouts."

2021-06-04 08:29:50,wallstreetbets,I’m new to all of this and just happened to read about calloptions yesterday. You have just explained the gap of information I was still missing about this. The article I’ve read only explained the basics and didn’t go very much in detail. Thanks! :)
2021-06-04 08:37:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the premiums are lower, but you also pay more when you exercise that option, so you lose more on the back end.  I see a lot of options where a $20 strike price is $1 premium, but a $21 strike price is .75.  Sure the the premium is lower for $21, but you also have to pay $1 more for those shares."
2021-06-04 04:00:45,wallstreetbets,Very insightful. Thank you so much.
2021-06-04 04:03:19,wallstreetbets,Why is it cheaper?

2021-06-04 08:19:16,wallstreetbets,"This is completely not true. That would be the case if you exercise the options. It you bought a 145c at .40 premium, you pay $40 total for that call. If the price rockets up the premium will follow. It may not be much because you are still way OTM, but if the premium jumps to .60, you can sell the call and net $20. The vast majority of people buy and sell and probably dont have any intention of exercising the calls."

2021-06-04 10:54:29,wallstreetbets,You should make it more clear that almost no one ever actually exercises the options. Like 99.9999% of options are never exercised.

2021-06-04 07:38:22,wallstreetbets,"One thing I have been curious about. If you buy an option and it is in the money by the time the contract expires, do you need to sell the contract before it expires if you do not plan to exercise it? Is there a way to exercise an option immediately so you don't need the capital to pay to exercise the option and instead exercise the option and then immediate sell the stocks at market value for your profits?"
2021-06-04 07:40:55,wallstreetbets,"The point is you can control more shares than your capital allows, right? So what happens if we go beyond 145.4? Is it that you sell the contract to someone with enough capital to exercise it? And you do so for the now positive intrinsic value + a premium depending on the time left?"

2021-06-04 01:27:05,wallstreetbets,I was using the 6/4 $120 strike.  It bounced from about $0.50 to about $4.75+ twice today.  With a 1DTE when it spiked over $3.5 I picked up puts.  When it dipped under $0.75 I closed the puts and opened long calls.  It was about 9-10x play if timed perfectly but I was happy with the profits.  First shot was right from the open.  Around 11am was the first switch.  Then on the spike towards $70 was the second.  When it hit the targets I closed and went the other way.  I am currently long 6/11 expiration.

2021-06-04 04:43:07,wallstreetbets,"Because the risk is greater. 

At a $12 strike price you are buying a contract to purchase 100 shares at $12. If the stock was $10 then the likelihood of it reaching $12 is greater than reaching $20 so the cost of buying the contract is different because of that risk. If the stock rises to $15 the contract with the $12 strike price would be worth something while the contract with the $20 strike price wouldn't."

Not to mention I invested in AMC to support it because I absolutely love the movies. If it means they can survive for longer then I shouldn't complain.

It seems like a bunch of new investors in AMC are in for the wrong reasons and being kind of dimwits about this whole thing. 

Yeah a squeeze would be great but ultimately you invest in something because you believe in it. For me, fundamentals are pointless for AMC because I personally like the movies and I hope AMC can survive. Streaming is cool but nothing beats the big screen."

Selling those calls netted easy profits. But certainly not something I planned to hold more than I day. Its something i use on huge spikes.  High IV = Sell calls as option premium is excellent. On dips I will buy the calls to go long. Those are the big monymakers with AMC currently. So just try to play all angles rather than being just a long or just short guy. Play what the market gives, either side. Cheers!"

2021-06-04 08:52:23,wallstreetbets,"You can't exercise any options that is OTM.  Options either calls or puts can only be exercised if they are ITM.  They can be sold but not exercised.  If you buy an OTM Call Option on AMC at 145.  Options are derivatives of the stock.  To review the Greeks briefly.  The value of that Call Option will increase as the stock price increases, that is called Delta.  Delta is positive on calls and negative on Puts.  As the option gets closer to expiration the Theta (time value) decays reducing the price of the option.  Gamma increases the Delta as the stock price moves meaning the Option value increases faster as the stock prices move more.  There is Vega which is the options volatility (not to be confused with IV which over all market volatility).  Vega gets larger and increases the options price the closer you get to the strike price.  Finally there is Rho which is the overall interest rate and rarely ever influences anything.  The short answer is that even OTM calls can increase in value and be sold for a profit without ever being ITM."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"What is your secret to a good chicken stock? I made a chicken stock yesterday so I could make a chicken soup (which I got playful and gave it a Japanese twist) The recipe is below.

My main question though is what is your secret when you make chicken stock? Is there anything I did that should be done differently?

My chicken stock recipe that I just kind of made up, I didn't follow any directions.

1 whole chicken

5 chicken thighs (bone in)

1 leek

1 onion

4 carrots

2 celery stalks

2 bay leaves

1 tsp whole peppercorns

2 tsp of salt

4 spring onions

6 smashed cloves of garlic

handful of parsley

5 twigs of thyme

​

I simmered this for 6 hours removing the chicken after 1 hr 45 mins to remove the meat and return the skin and bones.

​

I then made a shoyu tare (I made this up)

4 dried porcini mushrooms

3 sheets of kombu

smashed ginger

3 tsp of szechuan peppercorns

This simmered together for 15 minutes in 3 cups of water before I strained the liquid. I then added to the liquid base

1/2 cup shoyu

1 tsp of red boat fish sauce

2 tbs of dark miso

and 1/4 cup of tepache (homemade)

To make the soup I added stock to a pot added carrots, celery, onions, spring onions and reduced a little bit. 5 minutes before the end I added some shredded chicken meat.

​

The tare was added to the bottom, then the soup and I finished with a homemade habanero chili oil."
2021-06-03 23:01:51,wallstreetbets,"Typically you should be making it with the carcass, necks, feet, and wingtips, instead of a whole chicken. It's both cheaper and much better insofar as gelatin content and clarity goes. 

Also, you want to add bay leaves. I usually use turkish."

2021-06-03 22:53:20,wallstreetbets,I strongly recommend browning the onions in whiskey before you add the water and the rest. The flavor addition is just simply wonderful. You can use dumb cheap whiskey if you’ve spent all your money on dips.

The stock I make with the bones and left over meat that didn't get cut off the bones. I simmer the whole thing for 6 hours or so and I don't remove the bones/ veggies/etc until the very end. 

Then cool it, scrape fat layer off the next day, then re simmer and season as needed."

Shellfish = 15 minutes
Fish (fume’) = 1-3 hours depending on the fish and the size of the bones
Chicken/other poultry = 12 hours
Beef/lamb = 24-36 hours. 

All at the lowest simmer possible, skim the “trash” every hour or so depending on how fast it collects unless you’re using the raft method. 
Keep the agitation to a minimum so you’re getting all that lovely gelatin and tallow out of everything without breaking bone and stuff into little particles."

Ironic."
2021-06-04 02:45:11,wallstreetbets,"Prime example you are reducing the posts to flood out AMC and GME.  Do you really not earn enough money that you have to get paid to post about bullshit stocks?  At least tell me you’re taking that money AND investing in AMC and GME, cause those same fuckers who’s paying you are gonna be some broke ass bitches."

2021-06-04 10:09:32,wallstreetbets,But the majority of the post yesterday were BB. It was if AMC was non existent. Only posts i saw of amc were people saying drop amc for bb.
2021-06-04 11:31:13,wallstreetbets,probably. this is a gamble. i don't mind if i lose it all that is ok

 Not gonna miss my chance with BB.

Hopefully when amc launches and some if the big apes cash out.. They put some of that money from amc into BB and we can all unite and keep driving  up!"

2021-06-04 12:20:42,wallstreetbets,So 14 from 23 is good ?
2021-06-04 07:43:23,wallstreetbets,"I think $20 EOM is doable, but a lot of people are saying $25 or even $30. 

Or it could just trade sideways. 

Or it could tank."
2021-06-04 00:49:08,wallstreetbets,Oy.. paperhanded both?  How is this gonna differ for you? Asking for an ape friend

2021-06-04 02:50:49,wallstreetbets,There was a huge paper hand wave today. Hopefully the worst of it is over for a while.
2021-06-04 02:40:58,wallstreetbets,Lmao 🤦🏼‍♂️
2021-06-04 03:16:27,wallstreetbets,When it tanks to 10 before 🚀 you’d better not be a paper hand again 😆
2021-06-04 11:38:19,wallstreetbets,Can you explain how you properly utilize options? I’ve only ever done shares just cause that’s all I’ve known.
2021-06-04 19:23:22,wallstreetbets,HUAH!

2021-06-04 07:26:25,wallstreetbets,"Get paid? What do you mean? I’m up and recouped any loss, to the point that technically I have $0 out of pocket invested at this point. All free money. But that’s ok, people catching on. Lol good luck with BB. 🤦🏼‍♂️🤣 SMH"

2021-06-04 12:21:29,wallstreetbets,$23 -> $7 was even better.
2021-06-04 07:58:13,wallstreetbets,You must be a meteorologist in your day job with predictions like that!
2021-06-04 00:54:43,wallstreetbets,I paper handed because I didn't understand stocks enough to feel comfortable with what I'd spent on the shares. I was expecting them to quadruple overnight and then panicked when they didn't. I understand a little bit better now.
2021-06-04 15:08:59,wallstreetbets,"I'm super new and wondering that too. And now seeing under your post a guy buying, calls. They have made the stock market so crazy that tax returns is elementary compared."

2021-06-04 16:01:13,wallstreetbets,Dat’s an easy one! Of course you can be. Now Riri or Billie Eilish might’ve been more difficult but we could’ve did it.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Screenshot before closing his AM, for slightly less than pictured. Hope everyone survived that regression. We were set up pretty nicely before that #$%&ing share offering. Thanks about $300k more, AA, for not letting $AMC open at $75. "
2021-06-03 21:14:03,wallstreetbets,man got slaughtered by the automod trying to post this. Couldn't figure out what I did wrong.
2021-06-03 21:39:25,wallstreetbets,I’m up 340k because of $AMC. Fuck yeah.
2021-06-03 22:25:08,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was at $18500 up from $7000 on Tuesday at open and then bam, down to 13k and finally bounced back to 14 at close. It was a hell of a day."
2021-06-03 21:32:54,wallstreetbets,Tendies!
2021-06-03 21:32:20,wallstreetbets,Can't understand that one either? Seems to be getting a little greedy.

2021-06-04 00:06:02,wallstreetbets,nice hit! hope you get out of this trainwreck soon. tomorrow's going to tell a story either way.
2021-06-04 05:05:26,wallstreetbets,Learn to take profits man. You could of sold on day two and then average down on day 3 and get more shares.
2021-06-03 21:46:07,wallstreetbets,Agreed! They pocketed $587 million from the offering. With that mix up on the day I think it can be expected so we just need to ride that situation out. Stock bounced back quick because of interest in shares. They’re volume is just gigantic though shit!
2021-06-04 01:03:09,wallstreetbets,Tilray is gonna 🚀
2021-06-04 06:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I was planning on selling at open (mistake). It crashed so fast I didn't have a chance and I spent the rest of the day just letting it recover. Live and learn."
2021-06-04 00:05:06,wallstreetbets,"I mean, $AMC is a shit company and the CEO might actually be retarded... but goddamn if I'm not gonna scalp that shit on the way up. Their 4/27 filing, selling shares to Mudrick, this ATM offering... shady shit by the EXEC team.

2021-06-03 21:12:28,wallstreetbets,I think F is great for options trading honestly.
2021-06-03 20:57:10,wallstreetbets,YOLO and Ford shares used in the same sentence. What a world.

2021-06-03 22:17:00,wallstreetbets,I got 4000 shares at 4.50 a piece back in last April. I’m loving the moves!!!!!!!!! F is going to the 🌚 🚀
2021-06-03 21:06:06,wallstreetbets,I’m long on both Ford and UWMC.  Which means I’ll probably get drunk and sell two days before they really start to dance.  What a time to be alive
2021-06-03 20:59:11,wallstreetbets,F is not a sexy position but it’s always been good to me.
2021-06-03 21:10:33,wallstreetbets,"$F is a sneaky 🚀 I have 0 clue, but the electric f-150 seems cool. I think if you're the best selling truck in America for decades, and you come out early with a strong electric contender, while trading at a ~15 P/E the odds are in your favour. 

Bought Aug 16 calls the other day."
2021-06-03 20:58:32,wallstreetbets,I own 10 shares and after this I feel stupid. Not to mention I bought in at 14

2021-06-03 21:35:40,wallstreetbets,I kept seeing the commercials for the electric f150 and grabbed me stonk at 12.05 and decided to trust the green energy let’s get it and get it greenly

2021-06-03 21:01:18,wallstreetbets,Do financials even matter anymore haha
2021-06-03 21:51:45,wallstreetbets,"How tf did F gain 8% while trading at average volume.  BB and AMC trading at least 4X daily against average volume yet tanked.  

HF and banks are really trying to drive this down huh"
2021-06-03 22:49:49,wallstreetbets,"One other thing to look out for coming up with Ford is the run up in used autos. This is a potential net benefit to their operations and extremely helpful with the shortage of new vehicles. Ford leases out an incredible number of vehicles which are reserved at a residual rate that was way underestimated relative to today’s market. These vehicles from 2018-2019 will sell at a premium and should help the financials. 

With that being said, anyone coming out of lease in the next few months should check their residuals and consider a buy and trade in. I have significant equity in my truck."
2021-06-04 00:28:22,wallstreetbets,I bought $3k worth of Ford last year March and it grew into about $8k. I sold it all and bought GME. It's currently worth over $15k pre-squeeze.  LOL
2021-06-04 01:04:14,wallstreetbets,"Holy crap a discussion on Ford.  I bought 1000 dollars each of Ford and Ferrari  (#RACE) after I watched Ford vs Ferrari movie on Netflix
What a retard move buying stocks from a movie
Ford up 50% Ferrari is flat now
Awesome movie great stock advice 😆"
2021-06-04 04:12:59,wallstreetbets,Nice! I really should have switched from Tesla to Ford half year ago. Not a financial advice.
2021-06-04 09:45:57,wallstreetbets,Ford has burned my fingers every time I've touched it.   Not doing that again.

Plus a divi"
2021-06-03 22:20:40,wallstreetbets,"Ford is tough call in my opinion. Tesla spear headed the EV market, now the corporate giants are moving towards the change after thumbing their nose for so long
I don’t think the big 3 have enough loyalist to buy  for them to justify long run productions....why pay $50k for a Ford EV when you can get a tried and true Tesla. It will take some time to make the brand trust worthy in the green age.
I believe Tesla, Fisker, and few China companies have a better chance."
2021-06-03 20:57:08,wallstreetbets,No.
2021-06-03 22:14:35,wallstreetbets,Copped me a few 15c 1/22 a few months back. Been cooking these tendies for a while. New living room furniture hopefully

I also think their first generation electric F-150s are going to be riddled with issues."
2021-06-03 23:23:42,wallstreetbets,"I saw that ... I'm still clueless as to what triggered it.

2021-06-03 21:15:51,wallstreetbets,Their investment in Europe with electric is huge. They already have facilities they want to convert over there and are going full steam ahead to the future. They know electric is where it at.
2021-06-03 21:43:54,wallstreetbets,Bronco is going to be sold out for at least 2 years. Mustang Mach e is also seemingly impossible to get.  Transit fans and New F-150 are also going to sell incredibly well.  They just have a lot of winners.  Automobile stocks historically don’t move a ton but I’ve been sitting on a couple hundred shares for a couple years knowing they had a fleet of winners on the horizon.
2021-06-03 23:41:31,wallstreetbets,The f150 is not only the best selling truck in the USA it’s also the best selling vehicle overall since the 1980s. I sold ford after I saw all the pickups they have parked at the Kentucky speedway because they don’t have the chips to finish them. Two days later they announced the lightning lol.
2021-06-03 22:25:27,wallstreetbets,Itm?

2021-06-03 22:02:48,wallstreetbets,"It would help if F did a buyback, to lower their huge volume of shares (Edit:  See below for the likely scenario of restarting the dividend before a buyback). 

$160 Billion in debt is a concern. (Edit:  please see /u/fivespdcat excellent explanation below on most of the F debt)

With low rates, F floats that debt, but if rates go up (and they will, it's not if but when), they'll use any buyback capital to pay down any outstanding debt that higher interest rates will be charged on them, so the interest doesn't kill them.

Could it run another 20%?  Sure, but the basic fundamentals of P/E, and market cap seem to have Ford's ceiling at $20ish.

They both pay down the debt and do a buyback, then damn!  It could move"

So they can be sold out but not meet earnings expectations. Hopefully they can get a stream of chips to produce units to keep the stock up."
2021-06-03 22:58:13,wallstreetbets,also next week going to officially announce the maverick subcompact pickup. also it is going to have hybrid options. Expected to start about $20K for base. Built on the ford escape platform if your wondering size wise and AWD available so it should sell like crazy too.
2021-06-03 21:47:12,wallstreetbets,The bronco is so lame to lol I just wish it was more like the original.
2021-06-03 21:13:01,wallstreetbets,Every bit counts
2021-06-03 22:08:50,wallstreetbets,"Ford will bring back the dividend before they consider any share buybacks. It’s how the Ford family makes money of Ford. 

On the other hand the debt is less crazy than it seems since most of it is held by Ford credit (the captive finance arm) which lives off debt and has receivables against said debt. Generally speaking Ford credit debt increases when car sales increase.  The operations have significantly less debt but did take some more during the Covid peak in 2020."
2021-06-03 22:14:07,wallstreetbets,"The debt is backed by assets from Ford Motor Credit, it's one of the largest banks in the country and very profitable for them.  It's all collateralized, zero reason to pay it off."
2021-06-04 03:18:50,wallstreetbets,"A few different dates since Aug 2020.  However, as recently as when the price was around $11.35 in early May, you could get the Jan 2022 $5.50 call for $5.90. So your breakeven was $11.40

So let's say you liked F at $11.35, cause you knew the F150 Lightning was the real deal and would have a lot of hype with it's introducing at the end of May, thus you thought F could go to $16.

So you wanna buy 500 shares.

500 × 11.35 = $5,675

But instead of buying the shares, you take your $5,675 and buy 9 contracts

9 X $590 = $5,310

So you've spent less money but now control 80% more shares (900 total).

Because the premium is so low, the contracts basically follow the stock (rising a bit extra with some new IV).

So at $16.  500 shares straight up would have your investment worth $8,000.   

However the LEAPS contracts would be selling for $10.55 each.  

So 9 X $10.55 = $9,495.

Thus, you invested less, and have nearly 20% more."
2021-06-04 02:46:44,wallstreetbets,Mazda b series ftw! What a fantastic little truck. Currently 2011 ranger. Eh...
2021-06-04 11:16:08,wallstreetbets,Haha I never knew ac was such an issue for some models. I actually just got the evac and blow out for my ac. Florida guy in summer in these Covid fast food lines with no ac = </3
2021-06-03 22:52:32,wallstreetbets,"I agree to some point. I am a jeep guy myself. The thought of buying a EV jeep makes me cringe. 
The switch throughout the brands product will be tougher for them. They do have a loyal fan base.of over 100 years but what farmer would feel comfortable with a F150 EV? It will be a steep educational curve to create the desire to change over....Tesla, Fisker, etc started as an EV company an are widely accepted as the leader in the space."

Great point, thanks!!"
2021-06-03 22:31:14,wallstreetbets,"This. This right here. No one ever talks about that when they mention the 1.6 bil in debt. I dont know the exact amount, but im certain somewhere +/- a billion is collaterlized and backed. 

Im from the PNW, farming country. Your either born into a Ford fam, or a chevy/gm fam and NEVER change. Brand loyalty is fierce with pickups."
2021-06-04 03:38:11,wallstreetbets,Totally understand the benefit of leaps over shares here. I'm not here for shares. Was just curious how far off on the timeline I was from those .05 leaps. Just became of aware of F potential when they dropped the lightning. I'll be getting into some F leaps. With the intention of selling long before exp. Too poor to exercise.

And you are correct the new Rangers are too big but they are great looking trucks
The world definitely needs those little trucks and I bet they are used more like a truck than the typical suburban big pick up drivers do 😅"

Ford is a smart company I don't think they needed the bailout but we're forced to take
I think the F150 lightning will be amazing but I cannot wait and it's probably more than a tesla Y
Ford and Volkswagen will catch up to Tesla quickly in EVs
The real race is who gets to autonomous driving first"
2021-06-03 23:32:33,wallstreetbets,"I see both sides. Very interesting time in history we all get to be part of. Regardless, I think all companies making trucks have a way to go when convincing the masses as reliable.

I read an article about a guy driving  a Tesla Y with a  camper trailer and the tricks/gimmicks he had to do when going up hill (mountains) to conserve power as depleting faster when hauling. Tesla has a bit of an advantage with this tech and if they don’t have it nailed yet...hard to think the others will from the start."
2021-06-04 17:54:08,wallstreetbets,Thx
2021-06-03 23:20:33,wallstreetbets,I was referring to the bronco.  You’re not getting one without a reservation and there were enough reservations to use up their yearly production numbers.  There is a delay but that’s because of a hard top supplier and has nothing to do with chips.
2021-06-04 02:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Those early 90's Mazda b series still be kicking it too! What a legendary truck! But tbf, the early 90's f-150's with the inline 6 were also legendary. Not a little truck, but I pushed mine over 400k miles!"

2021-06-04 04:12:05,wallstreetbets,"Solid plan. You got in at a great time! I would say $15 mid summer was a perfectly timed PT! I always feel like a pro hitting it early and taking those gains, regardless of further price action. Always nice to keep a lotto ticket or two though. Well played friend. Riding 10-20% long on your leaps I'm assuming. I'm hoping to get in now and out before production delays become fully realized. But also, ford isn't the only company being hit by chip shortages, its everyone. Got a lidar play going as well to be hit with it. Not really sure how thats gonna play out overall.. I also have a 2011 4x4 ext cab ranger @ 42k miles ready to reap inflated used vehicle prices. I'm technically already invested with major upside! Hoping to trade it in by eoy for the lightning with cash in hand! That ev tax credit is about to get even bigger, and the lightning is 1 of maybe 3 ev's rn that can reap the full 12.5k!

There is this company called Upstart which is an AI lending platform, it automatically approves loans for you without going through banks! It recently IPO-ed in December at $20/share, and now it is sitting at $165/share 8x multiplier!

Here is the last earnings report they are profitable! It is a super high growth company. for the year of 2021 they will make $600M in revenue, and they only have 700 employees, that is around $850k of revenue per employee! They are growing 70% YoY in revenue/[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006076/en/Upstart-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210511006076/en/Upstart-Announces-First-Quarter-2021-Results)

For your short squeezers:

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/upst/short-interest](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/upst/short-interest)The current # of shares shorted is 5,278,317 shares shorted which has INCREASED since the last report by 2m shares.

By my calculation, the current SI% is 5,278,317/16.15M shares shorted which are \~32.6% of the current available traded float before the lock-up period ends on June 14!How did I come up with this calculation?[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201215006204/en/Upstart-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201215006204/en/Upstart-Announces-Pricing-of-Initial-Public-Offering)IPO provided us with 13.8M shares if you add up the IPO 9M + 3.05M + 1.80M

If that doesn't get you OFF, this stock has been silently squeezing up with the short interest fee going up here, and the available # of shares going down to be shorted. It went $85 to new all time high of $172 in 3 weeks. The earnings before this one it went from $60 to $170+ AH[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UPST](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UPST)

It has climbed from 2% short interest fee on May 14th to now 110% fee! If this isn't a short squeeze, I don't know what is! Usually before a lock-up period ends hedgies try to short the stock down hard to get the price low, lets fuck them up.

TL;DR Upstart is high growth and getting squeezed possibly BUY BUY BUY 🚀🚀🚀🚀

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"JKS- A solar panel company with strong fundamentals, high short interest and yet only trading at 1.2x book value. I found this company while looking for large solar panel companies to invest in. It is the largest solar panel producer in the world and the only one I can find that is actually profitable without government credits or financial magic. 

I think this is a hidden gem just look at the numbers:

**Fundamentals:** 

Market Cap: 1.88B (current share price 40.15)

Operating Income: 270B in 2020 (6.9x market cap)

Shareholder equity: 1.53B (1.2x book value)

Insider and institutional holding: 54%

**Short interest: 15% (7 million shares)**

Yoy revenue growth: +19%

PE: 50x ( in reality this is actually closer to 7x PE I will explain below )

**Possible reasons why it is overlooked or shorted:** The PE ratio might seem high but it is only due to the change in convertible bonds value. The convertible bonds outstanding could be redeemed for 3.5 million shares which actually negatively affect EPS if the stock price goes up (which it did ALOT last year). But in reality even if they actually redeem all those shares the total shares outstanding would just increase by 7%. 

The reason by I say the real PE is around 7x is because if you look its operating income ( its EPS from only the business) and look at the change in value in shareholder equity then you can see that the company is actually gaining in value at the rate of its operating income. 

**TLDR: this company has been growing at 10-20% every year, trading at 7x PE, 1.2x book value, the largest solar panel manufacturer  and the only public solar panel producer that is profitable without government credits .** 

Make sure you look over the numbers yourself.  (no your not dreaming)

Bonus: If you look at their sec filing they bring up they bought **call options with Credit Suisse that is set to expire on July 31st 2021. At expiration Credit Suisse must deliver 1.8 million shares or pay current value in cash.** They bought call last year to hedge against convertible bonds they've sold.

2021-06-03 20:26:03,wallstreetbets,Just posting so I can find this later to read what people with brain wrinkles think about it.
2021-06-03 22:48:34,wallstreetbets,"Last I checked they had~1.5 bil in debt, and their cash flow was just able to service it. I personally don't trust their financials, as back in 2018 they went from a ~15margin to a ~17 margin despite a free fall in solar pricing. 

Also, FSLR financials kick the crap out of JKS, though they are a one trick pony with no other revenue streams other than their series 6 panel. Strong balance sheet with clear consistent demand."
2021-06-03 21:09:37,wallstreetbets,"1.2x book value? Lol value doesn’t mean anything. Jinkosolar diluted their shares a while ago and they will likely keep doing so. It’s a Chinese solar company and the US hates China right now apparently. 

Frankly, no JKS is not a good choice right now and you likely already missed the boat on that one."
2021-06-03 20:36:10,wallstreetbets,"I bought JKS last year at $20 based on valuation and high profitability within the renewables sector. It jumped to $90 in about 3 months later.

The stock became overvalued and fell back to earth. In the meantime traditional energy stocks like oil and gas have jumped after being repressed over the past few years.

JKS has a high debt load but they are still one of the top profiting companies in the sector and as written above it's growing despite a gov't credit program.

I've been averaging my position down since last year and this is my 2nd largest holding. I (still) like the stock."
2021-06-03 20:35:10,wallstreetbets,Did you pick up a position in this?
2021-06-03 20:36:23,wallstreetbets,"This company is insanely big with footprints in all phases of solar panels. Massive panel sales, big projects, a lot of storage development.

Probably 3x undervalued ignoring future growth but being Chinese it doesn't get the same love. CSIQ is another big player that's growing...but I don't really trust them."
2021-06-03 21:01:27,wallstreetbets,Love me some solar and renewables
2021-06-03 21:12:33,wallstreetbets,Janko is a shitty name. Aren't jinkos old ghetto ass baggy jeans?

2021-06-03 20:26:45,wallstreetbets,Well I upvote any DD that’s not about GME or AMC
2021-06-03 22:15:17,wallstreetbets,Shit company? It's the largest solar panel producer in the world.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Reasons to have $CLNE in your portfolio outside of a potential Gamma Squeeze So you might have seen the ticker $CLNE pop up more and more in the recent days in the combination of a potential gamma squeeze.

If you want to inform yourself about this check out NrdRages comment history where he explained the setup multiple times.

Might aswell check out his DD about the company from some time ago in his post history.

This is supposed to be a little reminder about how fantastic Clean Energy Fuels actually is.

What do they do in short?
They take methane, convert it into transportable fuels (RNG), fill up tanks with it and then charge trucks for filling up.

Why is this amazing?

- It's way superior towards electrial charging stations simply because it's faster but also completely enviromentally friendly, which as we all know is the future anyways.

What else is great?

- They have partners such as BP, Total and the Los Angeles Metro.

- They will provide fuel to Amazons truck because these motherfuckers build their refilling stations next to Amazon Warehouses.

- Once the transport industry adapts properly CLNE is in a unique position to profit from the green energy transition.

So we have a company that has a great product, a great setup for succsess with huge partners and a gigantic future ahead.

So yea outside of a potential Gamma Squeeze the company itself is also really solid and it's probably wurth to consider a buy for this one

I am currently holding 200 shares at an average of 9.30$ and planning to add more.

TL;DR
Yes CLNE has a insane setup for a potential gamma squeeze but the company itself has a great product, great partners and a great future so you might want to consider holding it as a long term investment generally"
2021-06-03 22:18:14,wallstreetbets,"I've seen the same ticker more than once on WSB, so I must buy.  Strikes and dates anyone??"
2021-06-03 23:14:17,wallstreetbets,I am in CLNE but can we either get new DD or memes instead of just the constant summaries of someone else's DD?
2021-06-03 20:25:28,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is a solid play for LT success.  It’s carbon neutral with great partners.  I’ll take a gamma squeeze, but I’m holding for growth."
2021-06-03 23:21:54,wallstreetbets,"Nice run today and it’s up nearly 7% after hours, should make for another build up tomorrow. Still plenty of time to get in imo with a safe floor. Next week should really start to run"

Expensive play on their part but really brilliant when you think about it. Couple that with a Biden admin that please to be going heavy on the green agenda and it just seems like everything's in the right place for this to blow.

Gonna buy and hold long term with some of my next check. I see this thing growing 100's of % over the long term as Amazon continues to conquer."
2021-06-03 22:35:38,wallstreetbets,Let's go apes.
2021-06-03 22:49:52,wallstreetbets,I like the stock
2021-06-03 20:42:23,wallstreetbets,"Also I somehow feel the need to add this here. In no way do I intend to take attention away from BB, AMC or GME or anything else. My wish for you is to consider simply addi g this one to your already established positions.

Super cheap. you do sonething your conscience and you have the potential to piss on citadel if the gamma squeeze works out. Can't really lose with this one."
2021-06-03 21:44:15,wallstreetbets,"Great DD!  CLNE is a rarity in that it has meme like explosion, but it's actually a really sound company with 3x, 4x potential eoy!"
2021-06-04 07:55:27,wallstreetbets,"Calls are only going to work if you also get shares. You can NOT depend on everyone else getting shares.

The thesis for the squeeze only works if we can drive the price to $13 by share buying.

If we stick together we all win, if we try to take advantage of each other we all lose. More importantly, the hedge funds shorting this will win.

We have a common enemy, we have a common goal.

Let's go make this money, and let's bleed out the hedge funds 🔥🚀🌕"
2021-06-04 00:28:55,wallstreetbets,Never heard of it until now. Will look into it. Thanks

This play reminds me of GME in the sense that it is value investing, with potential gamma sqeeuzes as a cherry on top. Sure, the gamma sqeeuze could fail, but then ill be a value investor and not a massive bagholder."
2021-06-04 12:17:24,wallstreetbets,Literally the only play here is shares. Calls are stupid af.

2021-06-03 22:25:38,wallstreetbets,"Natural gas fuels are not even close to carbon neutral, let alone good for the environment. Loose claims are made that natural gas is cleaner than petroleum fuels because the overall decreasing rate of emissions in the US is directly attributed to the increasing use of natural gas fossil fuels in some news reports and articles. But there is some scientific evidence that indicates natural gas fuels produce greenhouse gases at a higher rate than petroleum fuels.

If you want to make a difference as an individual towards curbing the effects of climate change, you can do so by not investing in companies that continue to push the use of fossil fuels, which includes natural gas, like CLNE. Choose making a difference for our future over making 20% for yourself."
2021-06-03 21:20:32,wallstreetbets,Yes. All shorted stocks will squeeze but don’t miss the big daddy GME cuz it’s the one going furthest & W out us launching none will.

2021-06-03 22:28:00,wallstreetbets,"Shares would be the safe play. It’s barely off it’s floor, with lots of upside. Calls are lottery tickets with IV being pretty high already. That being said June 18ths, whatever the best deal you can get, but you better hope it flies if so. I have split."
2021-06-03 22:30:06,wallstreetbets,"Shares > calls, like 80/20. 

Calls spiked a bit today, but 18 June for $13 is the “gamma” or whatever thing. I don’t get it, but the tea leaves (read “DD”) told me to buy shit. Still can’t believe they let me play with options."
2021-06-04 01:18:27,wallstreetbets,"Much of the reason to buy the calls were due to a few of them being undervalued (we're talking $0.01 when they should be $0.50). Now, if you're buying short term calls, you're hoping for an ape gathering. That said, if the stars align, and enough apes throw enough shares at this thing, it could get close to the $13 stock price. For some reason (that's beyond me), the shorts drew a line in the sand at $13. Should we cross it before 6/18, that's the only way for a squeeze.

But, we don't need to squeeze. The company is a solid growth choice. I'm in it for the medium to long term play. Maybe $16 EoY. Leaps could be an excellent choice here, but pair it with a good chunk of shares in the hopes that we can ape it."
2021-06-03 23:27:34,wallstreetbets,"I want memes. I like the DD, I understand the thesis here regardless of the June 18c (hopeful though), but I want damn good memes"

2021-06-04 17:59:30,wallstreetbets,"It was mainly because the calls for $13 on June 18 were going for $0.01 because of how stable it trades normally. That combined with how much of the stock is held in long term holders Blackrock etc who don't trade much and there being a decent (not large) short and it being a relatively small market cap meant that it wouldn't take much for apes to push it to $13 by then. Especially since it's fair value I usually see listed at around $15-17. Then of course since it's options for every call the institutions selling the calls and would have to purchase 100 shares to fill those orders not to mention the many shares being bought as part of this strategy to push the price up since options wouldn't on their own. 
That and it's a fucking steal at current price anyways since they're about the only game in town for the future of long haul trucking and since their RNG (renewable natural gas, aka cow farts and rotting landfills' methane) isn't just carbon neutral it's negative due to it being exhausted into the atmosphere or burned needlessly before they put it to good use.  

Sooo the June 18 $13 calls are mainly because of how ridiculously cheap they were (might still be, am the smoothest of brains who only has been investing since the GME thing but read the fuck out of anything NrdRage posts and loved his weekly DDs).

Hopefully for anyone curious I helped explain a little better. But honestly I can't recommend CLNE enough, even if this gamma squeeze doesn't work it's still probably a double bagger if you hold a few months and quadruple bagger if years long holder so might as well get when it's still undervalued.

**Edit:** Nvm I figured out how to check (am smoothbrain who is scared of options and my little money is too precious to me. The call play is too expensive/risky now for the most part but shares are still safe ofc."

2021-06-04 16:03:43,wallstreetbets,"I admittedly did not know RNG indicated the natural gas source was human waste. How would it be carbon negative? I can understand how it's better to use RNG than it is to use CNG, but you're burning natural gas either way you spin it, which produces CO2, a greenhouse gas...

I would agree RNG>CNG, but ideally we dont use natural gas as a fuel at all. Ideally the byproduct from our waste is captured and converted into solid carbonaceous materials/waste."
2021-06-04 16:11:24,wallstreetbets,"I admittedly did not know what RNG was all about before yesterday, so thank you for pointing that important detail out for me! Interesting idea, definitely a market for it and definitely much better for the environment than allowing offgassed CH4 from entering the atmosphere.

However, using natural gas as a fuel releases CO2 and therefore still adds greenhouse gas to the atmosphere, even if the source of the natural gas is a waste byproduct. Yes the RNG prevents CH4 from entering the atmosphere, but if it's used as a fuel I dont understand how that process could be carbon negative or even carbon neutral. It's better than CNG, but not a solution. CH4 byproduct is ideally converted into solid carbon sources, completely preventing that carbon from entering the atmosphere for a very very long time."
2021-06-04 16:25:17,wallstreetbets,"I'm not talking specifically about CO2 production rate for each reaction. I'm talking about the environmental impact of the entire source to combustion chain, which involves the extraction procedure, transport, and reaction efficiency. Yes, less CO2 is produced per mole CH4 than per mole octane, but methane is a more potent greenhouse gas and therefore CH4 release, intentional or unintentional, between fuel source and combustion, can dramatically increase the environmental impact of using CH4 compared to petroleum. This is sort of irrelevant here because CLNE deals with RNG, not CNG, but was my thought process when I wrote my initial post."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$ASO Academy Sports and Outdoors ER I think Academy Sports and Outdoors ($ASO) will blow ER out the water this quarter and here is why:

1. Their competitor $DKS Dicks Sporting Goods killed it this quarter but $ASO barely went up by proxy, comparatively.

2. Retail is killing it this season, if you look at $DDS, $M, $TGT. This is especially true with inflation on the run.

3. I believe $ASO has a secret weapon (literally) that will result in them blowing expectations out the water: Guns - all the competitors have been soft in this space due to recent events. As a (law abiding) gun owner, my friends and I all shop at $ASO. We have all noticed their stock have been consistently selling out. Cabelas and Bass Pro also have hunting stuff but there is 1 store per every $ASO 

4. $DKS has a P/E ratio that has been steadily decreasing due to their increasing stock price. Ratio went from 12 to 9 (after ER), $ASO currently has a P/E ratio of 10 but I think once they beat earnings it will be adjusted as such. I realize this last one isn’t much of a reason for it to moon but hey, sue me.

2021-06-03 22:00:49,wallstreetbets,"To expand on points 1 and 2--

ALL their peers crushed earnings.  All the shit they sell crushed earnings.  Sports in the south are full go.  There was 12 months of pent up demand for things people dont buy online such as baseball bats, golf clubs, etc.  CEO mentioned on Q1 conference call that apparel and shoe sales were likely to come roaring back (and that there were days when the company didn't sell a single pair of cleats in Q4 2020)

ASO also paid off 25% of its debt in Q1 ahead of schedule, which they announced last week, which suggests they had incredible free cash flow.

most importantly to me, KKR (the private equity that brough them public) has divested all the way below 40%.  That selling has likely been what has been suppressing the price after surges in value.  they will likely begin settling down with the selling.

Analysts have been sending out increased price targets just due to debt reduction and KKR selling down.  those factors had been suppressing expectations.  Once they see the financials, this thing will rocket.

my positions are June 35 and 40 calls, October 25, 35, and 40 calls, and July 35/40 spreads, and shares."
2021-06-03 20:44:06,wallstreetbets,"I’m going balls deep in calls either tomorrow or Monday. I’ve been trying to find the bear case for this, and I haven’t seen much yet. And that scares me. It seems like such an obvious winner."
2021-06-03 20:51:30,wallstreetbets,This the way.
2021-06-03 22:07:55,wallstreetbets,ASO has an institutional ownership of 92.22% and a short interest of just over 22%.  Does this make for an easily squeezable stock?
2021-06-03 22:28:15,wallstreetbets,Oh you actually like making money? That option looking good so far
2021-06-03 20:26:04,wallstreetbets,"Love Academy. Store is always full of shoppers. It’s also the most 2A friendly big box store, even more so than Bass Pro (not being political, I state this as fact. And there are many shoppers who will go there for that reason). It’s one of the few stores I love going into."
2021-06-03 22:58:46,wallstreetbets,lets go!  party time!
2021-06-03 23:10:49,wallstreetbets,Short interest.
2021-06-03 23:49:43,wallstreetbets,I have some 6/18 40c that are struggling. Hoping Tuesday seals the deal.
2021-06-04 09:05:51,wallstreetbets,Aso is the way. The charts don’t lie.
2021-06-04 18:47:36,wallstreetbets,I’m in. Shares and June $40c. Expecting them to beat earnings with the bats they are flying through right now.
2021-06-03 20:26:49,wallstreetbets,Academy is the shit...love that place. They actually had 556 on the shelf this past weekend...I nearly fell out. Who the hell shops at Dicks anymore...unAmerican to be outdoor store but anti gun rights.
2021-06-03 22:50:41,wallstreetbets,I work in one of these two… I suggest you go shop in both and then you’ll know why one will out perform the other.
2021-06-03 23:15:53,wallstreetbets,don’t cum till tuesday !
2021-06-04 10:51:57,wallstreetbets,Do we know much of a stake KKR still has?
2021-06-03 22:15:39,wallstreetbets,The float on this thing is pretty low..
2021-06-03 22:17:30,wallstreetbets,Wtf is 2A?
2021-06-03 22:56:33,wallstreetbets,If you’re implying it’s Dicks I’ll tell you why you’re wrong.
2021-06-04 05:00:22,wallstreetbets,"yeah just keep edging it till then, makes it all that more intense when we blow 😉"
2021-06-04 11:34:35,wallstreetbets,"A press release last week showed total KKR ownership below 40%.  They last sold 14 million shares on 5/5.

Believe it or not, KKR ownership is not a positive factor.  The less they have to sell off, the better."
2021-06-03 22:24:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm still pretty new to really looking into the stocks and valuations.  So the float is the more important number?
2021-06-03 22:19:36,wallstreetbets,2nd Amendment
2021-06-03 22:22:38,wallstreetbets,"You know the thing, cmon man."
2021-06-04 00:11:19,wallstreetbets,"to be honest, they don't compete head to head except in just a few markets.  i've worked at dick's, and i have a family member who manages a dick's, and it's a great store.  But ASO is the one that makes me giddy with the valuation."
2021-06-03 23:39:55,wallstreetbets,"Tough to read the float though, because the company that took them public still owns 40% of the issued shares, over a billion dollars worth. They have been selling, and may very well keep selling. If they sell, they could put up a hell of a wall."
2021-06-03 22:28:12,wallstreetbets,"Ah, sorry I’m an idiot. Thx"
2021-06-03 22:31:37,wallstreetbets,Are you telling me that not every country has a second amendment allowing guns for everyone?????

2021-06-04 13:29:43,wallstreetbets,I wish I had understood options and updated my account but I just opened it. I saw the light at $12.50 when I read about the mach e and bought 20 shares. Great play.

2021-06-04 04:24:19,wallstreetbets,The 1.3b news was ignored by the fact that may was up sales wise.  My guess is q3 not 2 is gong ti be bad. Which kinda sucks for my puts.

Everyone’s a genius when their right... 👍"

I’m 53 now, if I buy a Lambo I’m a toolbag with a midlife crisis, but If I buy the R8...I’m just an old dude with a sweet ride!"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Wendys? Lot of people getting jacked behind the dumpster, they gotta eat too? With many people on WSB from time to time giving handjobs behind the local Wendys dumpster.....got me thinking?  there must be some inevitable foot traffic into the Wendys too. 

I mean i dont know about you but after a fine HJ by one of my down and out WSB Bretheren It can work up an appetite.  Also said Jacker will have to eat at some point in the day. Nothing is smoother then a Wendys frosty after a long day of jacking people off. 

Its slightly above pre-pandemic levels but I think I am going to show the big WEN some support and throw some of my eventual BB gains their way. 

Thoughts?"

2021-06-03 20:30:03,wallstreetbets,I won't lie... I like Wendy's and have been looking at the listing for a while. They increased their dividend recently.
2021-06-03 20:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Ill buy the next dip and open a position. 
Small market cap  only a little more then 5 billi.
Mcdonalds is 173 billion market cap. Yea i get it creepy Clowns make me hot too but the difference is too big.
Its not gonna squeeze or anything only aboyt 4% short just prob a safe place to stow your tendies money."
2021-06-03 22:45:47,wallstreetbets,"Count me in for 20 boomer shares. Too bad we missed the dividend by a few days. When we do a wsb hostile takeover we'll have them put the fries in crayola crayon boxes! Even better, put crayons in the  fry boxes."

2021-06-03 23:23:35,wallstreetbets,I mean seriously if they decide to give workers 15 dollars an hour across the board and are the first ones to tweet about it I bet they would gain 20% in stock price in a day

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"NIO/XPEV Deliveries Up. Tesla (TSLA) Deliveries Down I've been buying NIO/XPEV leaps although now I wish I would have bought more when they were in the mid 20's. 
I will be waiting for pull backs. Before buying as I believe they are neither over nor undervalued currently but room to move up to their former highs Easily. What I see happening is Tesla falling and other Chinese EVs rising after this news. 

NIO/XPEV Deliveries have been up while today it was reported Teslas Chinese orders have been cut in half. 

NIO VS XPEV Which is better? 
The answer is both. They serve different markets. 

NIO is luxury with advanced battery tech. 

XPEV is your every day Joe Toyota corolla with advanced self driving tech in fact XPEV and Tesla are the only 2 companies with their own ""In House"" developed software. ""In House"" Meaning elon says they stole it from him and then they added lidar and likely have made it better than him. The lidar supplier is Luminar. I don't know how to value LAZR or MVIS. 

NIO = Lexus
XPEV = Toyota Corrola 

You guys feel free to chime in about LI and others because I know nothing about Li Auto but I'd be curious. 

Market Caps. From the market caps below you can see Chinese companies are undervalued compared to American companies.  

XPEV = 29B
NIO = 50B

F = 64B
GM = 92B
Tesla = 550B 

Growth
Cathy Woods has predicted 300% year over year growth for Chinese EV companies for the next 5 years. I wondered why she never bought a single Chinese EV

China
My long theory is the only reason china allowed Tesla to play over there was so Chinese firms could steal their tech. Elon has accused XPEV of stealing their self driving software which may now be more advanced than tesla's. 

MiniChiDD is a famous DD poster on Twitter etc based out of China. She had reported a month ago that in the malls no one was at the Tesla displays. This is now confirmed by today's news reports. She's also a bit bias towards NIO but that doesn't make her wrong."
2021-06-03 20:05:57,wallstreetbets,"I think today’s Tesla headline was misleading. I thought the had something similar about Fremont/US when they started exporting to Europe. Plus, Teslas sell out completely how ever much they make (so far), which is what matters. This is why the resale value is high, and why existing inventories have been nonexistent on their site."
2021-06-03 20:01:11,wallstreetbets,With Tesla you can go from 5500 to 640 in 0DTE trade. We can both win
2021-06-03 20:20:32,wallstreetbets,"Chinese do not let American companies outperform them. This isn't America. They don't even let gold leave the country. 

XPEV and NIO combined have more Chinese Deliveries than Tesla does world wide. Is Tesla worth 450B more than them combined? Not by Deliveries and not by features or technology. 

You don't expand into China
CHINA E
XPAND INTO YOY"
2021-06-03 20:25:09,wallstreetbets,The 2023 NIO LEAPS gonna hit different
2021-06-03 20:07:01,wallstreetbets,Chinese companies will not receive the same valuation as American companies in American markets. The PRC cares of China and its citizens. Their regulatory entities are opaque and access by foreigners for detailed channel checks isn’t easy. There is a long history of US investors getting stung by the Chinese. Best way to invest in China is to buy American companies expanding into China.
2021-06-03 20:54:41,wallstreetbets,Cathy can't buy shit much from abroad companies that don't reside in states. Chinese numbers produced by their earnings are not always real. Chinese hustle is long know thing so it would not look good in investors eyes. At the end or the day she likes risk but she needs to keep the job to be in position to risk...
2021-06-03 21:57:35,wallstreetbets,City also see 50% growth in NIO stock from its current price. Bought NIO recently. Missed the low 20s range.

2021-06-04 10:23:02,wallstreetbets,Hey wanted to see what you think. I did a little comparison earlier today of the run in Jan and now. Looks like the short % of float is bit bigger than Jan although that doesn’t really matter. What I found interesting is that alpha trading signals trigger came off today and it was the RSI 90-100 and that also came off back in jan (23rd I think?). The volume yesterday was higher than any day in Jan (I think). Combined with RSI trigger coming off yesterday as well this all looks super super bullish. Am I on the right track with analyzing?
2021-06-04 10:26:11,wallstreetbets,Does BB need to hold above $14 or $13 for that?

I'm not super familiar with options. When you say you bought to close, do you mean that you essentially bought the call options back at a higher price and it cancelled out your previous call sells? Were you able to specify that you wanted to purchase the exact same calls that you'd sold? Did you have to have capital on hand to buy shares after buying to close?

Thanks in advance for any help!"
2021-06-03 21:29:54,wallstreetbets,No. That’s a good price. You have stock or options?

2021-06-04 11:37:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah so when you sell a covered call you ""sell to open"" which means you're selling and opening the contract. If you want to buy that contract back for whatever reason you can ""buy to close"" and re-buy back the contract. So I sold it for I think 10-15 dollars and then rebought at 27, so I lost out on that intial income but wanted to avoid having my covered call exercised against me in the case that BB increased significantly over the strike price.

&#x200B;

You don't have to specify, if you have open covered calls and you select buy to close it will assume you're buying those calls back"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cow Farts and the Philosophers Stone: How We Learned to turn Methane into Gold Alright fuckers, listen up.  I'm going to speak slow and in small words.  I originally wrote this in crayon, but can't figure out how to convert Crayola into 1's & 0's. I know you're looking for a place to put your newly found tendies so they go forth and multiply.  I mean who the fuck wants to ""work from home"" anymore, when you can just ""from home"".  And that's where my bovine friends come in. Now that markets are closed I can finally divert my attention away from staring at my stonks and do something constructive, like convince other people to also spend every waking minute staring at their stonks. Fair warning this DD contains the term ""Ultra-Bull"" which, for me at least, triggered some major PTSD about my wife's BF condom packs littering my bedroom floor. Pick that shit up, Jefe. It's common courtesy.

Guh, this is a fuck ton of words already.


First things first, Cramer shit on this stock.
Jim Cramer said Clean Energy Fuels Corp has ""run out of gas""

Sigh...you poor geriatric fuck, that pun was pathetic even for a guy who cried when the Eagles lost SuperBowl LII. Also, how dare you challenge my confirmation bias.  If your going to challenge me, I choose NG4 Golden Eye at dawn.  And no Odd Job, we all know that shit is for pussies.

​

OK - now that that's out of the way....

Let's talk about some things that stonks need to thrive, for you short term FD rainbow warriors who are obviously looking for somewhere to put your newly found crispy tendies that's guaranteed to pop (read: probably fucked too).

\Something fucky with the formatting has made everything listed below a #1 of a therefore seemingly eternal list. I can't count though so I have no idea.**

Traffic/Sentiment - CLNE has rocketed (pun) into the fourth position in a list of tickers mentioned on Reddit today. ""So what, fourth is for kids with wrinkles"" exactly - but it came from nowhere - DEAR GOD YOU MIGHT GET IN EARLY. Yesterday it was bottom feeding with the likes of people who buy bath water off of onlyfans.com (hey guys, how are ya). Today it's riding high, passing the likes of an absolutely garbage weed production, another weed outfit that is actually a business, and the commander-in-chief of DoucheCoin itself.

A catalyst... - I'm sure you've all seen the DD which I will link (here: DD). However, since I know you can't read that much anyway and you're just looking at the pictures, I will simplify it for you here and accompany that with an image of the options chain below. (Accompany means ""tag along with"" like when you get lucky enough to be the camera guy for Jefe and your ""wife"").
CLNE daily volume is low and it's small/mid cap, shares purchases drive the price up quickly
There's a metric shit ton of options interest in the coming price levels, which started generating excitement today like a Britney CD insert at a middle school in 1999 (don't judge me)
When the price hits $13, 2.5 million or so shares worth of OI will suddenly fall ITM and get exercised faster than your b-hole after 7 of those $1 chipotle melts from T-Bell fuck me are those good for $1
Now, obviously that strike is the trigger for a major event, but the $10 - $12 levels are no joke either and will only accelerate the climb on June 18 and before.
https://preview.redd.it/xjn752u1b4371.png?width=541&format=png&auto=webp&s=649d6abf38c5098f4bcaaf3d9b792e2f2c2a0082

VOLUME - So you're thinking fuck off retard, 2.5 million shares isn't even going to fill my gaping asshole since it hasn't recovered from my PLTR calls and UPST puts (FUCK UPST FUCK) and AMC had 17.38 billion shares traded today (overestimate, I haven't checked). 2.5 million is a TON for CLNE though - it would be 50% of an average day's volume, and in terms of $$$ that's about $32.5 million in equity
(HOLY FUCK IT FINALLY MADE A 2) A very influential user on here who definitely likes the stock ran some actual, not retarded math and determined that a sweep of only $6 million or so of total capital would be needed, based on the order book on that given day, to push the price to that level and put the options ITM. That's only 550k buys or so. Will 550K shares purchased sustain it there? Obviously no, because rainbow bear homos will sell too, but the point is that it will take very little action (a concept which you're very familiar with) to get there.
(what the fuck now it's 1 again) Shorts have been beating this thing down DAILY and the interest increases steadily over time. This isn't a play where we're going to see huuuuuge volumes of short shares, but it's still important to mention because when you use buzzy words like ""AI"" or ""equality in the workplace"" people start to feel good about what they're supporting. Here's an example from the stolen DD linked in this post:
https://preview.redd.it/ysa9cxm2b4371.jpg?width=714&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2e78a7c75979d2764cae684515b49c264ddaca2

Now let's talk about thing that are actually important, like competing technologies, farting cows 🐄 💨, and the future of heavy transportation:
and absolutely zero travel centers of america, this section is going to be brief because I know no one fucking cares

The point of this section is that beyond this epic short term opportunity, this company is going to fuck long term and for legitimate reasons. This is not financial advice my mom ties my velcro shoes daily.

CLNE is focused on heavy transportation markets and providing trucking with a fuel that isn't killing the planet faster than social media influenced justice campaigns. Let's review some alternative green energy technologies and talk about how they can (spoiler alert, they fucking can't) better serve this market

Hydrogen: no substantial infrastructure in the US, and if it does come it will be years/decades before it's developed enough to support network of highways for trucking
Hydro/Wind: lol wtf are you talking about how could that power a truck
EV's: the obvious competitor here, and very feasible for consumer transportation. However, trucks are fucking heavy. Like heavier than your mom after [another] trip to Golden Coral for $10 all you can eat ""filet mignon"" (you know she says ""MIG-NAHN"" and you want to kill her for it). You know what trucks don't need? Substantial amounts of additional weight in the form of batteries dragging their efficiency down.
Solar: I'm not even going to entertain this
RNG (renewable natural gas, FUCK why are you here) requires a truck only to have its engine converted (read: not replaced) and it runs just like normal. The fuel is carbon negative because CLNE traps already existing bad gasses and repurposes them into fuel. Sources include dairy industry, landfills, and your PLTR wrecked anus.

I found it very interesting that cow's farts 🐄 💨 are made up of the following:

https://preview.redd.it/crd55yl5b4371.png?width=534&format=png&auto=webp&s=b684309932543861cf0d6aa8251029a16e17bb5c

That has no bearing on my post, I just wanted to share it.

Autism is really starting to take over so I'm going to wrap this shit up. You've got a company with mega partnerships with Amazon and others, heavy involvement from big players like Total and Chevron, an actual product, fuck loads of infrastructure, and good news coming out frequently. California's ports are already moving to provide subsidies to truckers for using RNG and are integrating the fuel into their processes.

TL;DR

CLNE is sitting at $9 per share (52wk high around $20) after months of beat down from shorts like SHITADEL and Blackstone, moves on very little enthusiasm (different than orgasm), and is only a small amount of volume (read: apes) away from a huge series of circuit breakers on the ride upward. RNG has a longer term future than this play, so there's something for everyone.

Oh and Cramer doesn't like the stock.
EDIT: HOLY SHIT I almost forgot to say Ultra-Bull as promised. I have no fucking clue what this chart means, but the word triggered me as I mentioned before and I liked the looks of this:

2021-06-03 22:59:06,wallstreetbets,Gennerally it costs 300% more to use RNG and it produces the same amount of emissions so not really solving an emissions issue. RNG has a limitation on how much gas you can get from Cow farts so it won't scale up. The carbon negative claim is so crazy that it doesn't make any physical or thermodynamics sense. Good luck with the bet but I doubt it is a game changer.
2021-06-04 11:32:01,wallstreetbets,"In this case carbon negative is a bit of a misnomer. They're not carbon negative in the way most people think (ie sucking carbon out of the atmosphere like a tree or Aether Diamonds) but they are carbon dioxide equivalent negative. The greenhouse gases emitted through the use of renewable natural gas (RNG) are less than those emitted by the feedstock (methane) if it were left alone. 

Since different greenhouse gases have different warming potentials they are converted to carbon dioxide equivalents (1 metric ton of x = y metric tons of CO2) for the purposes of comparison. Methane (cow farts, manure, etc) has a CO2e of roughly 30. 

So when RNG is made from methane some of it goes into making trucks go vroom and some goes into the atmosphere as CO2 (not as potent as methane). When you leave the cow shit alone, it sits there happily producing methane and roasting us to death. 

The big potential for RNG is not in reducing emissions (which it does do) but in waste management. It literally turns shit into cash. 

It is also a bitch to remove methane from the atmosphere so it's better if there are any emissions, they are CO2 rather than methane. Atmospheric methane's only real sink is bacteria in the soil (most commonly found in forest floors). There are machines that can scrub CO2 from the atmosphere and turn it into diamonds. All we got for methane is a bunch of trees close together. 

So go invest in RNG and 💎✊ some 🌳🌲🌳.

Edit for legal purposes: I am not an investment trade-y person, none of this constitutes insider trading, I'm just a tree-hugging nerd who doesn't like when the planet burns down around them. None of this is investment advice."

If support is established above $10, then it’s reasonable to imagine the price hitting $14-$16. 50%~70% upside is plenty of potential for me, but YMMV.

I’m not going to tell you CLNE to $69 or $142 because I don’t believe that will happen. This is a solid stock that has been punished."
2021-06-03 22:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Couldn't agree more. CLNE should be 14-16 and not hard to imagine it getting there soon. I think $30 within 12 months. Long term share play for me and hopefully some quick profits on options. Although, come to think of it I have some 23 LEAPS as well."

Please be aware that most discussion over marijuana legalization is of an optimistic nature with it being a ticket item on the campaign trail this passed election in US.   


**Personal Full Disclosure:** My bets are in and have been in for awhile, 1000 shares of Medmen, 1000 shares of Sundial, and 50 shares of Telray. I have a dog in this fight but I have no idea what this outcome could likely be. I have little experience in law, marijuana, and how Appellate Court cases and hearings have effected the stock market in the past.   


I wanted to post to see what others had to say with a hearing for an oral argument to deschedule Marijuana to be heard on June 10th. Each side will get 20 minutes to present in Sisley vs DEA to the 9th Court of Appeals. Mostly curious if anyone has any historical points involving stocks and how court hearings have effected those stock prices as their respective cases go on.

Trading or other transactions relating to the shares, such as share borrowing, derivatives (including options contracts) or short selling, do not impact the number of shares entitled to vote at the Shareholder Meeting.”

It sounds like to me that AMC is setting the expectations that they’re not going to just let anyone with shares vote. How does this impact the share recount which was hypothetically supposed to trigger the short squeeze?"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$CLOV has all the catalysts to MOON It’s being added to the Russell 2000. It has a short float higher than AMC and BB combined. It has a positive growth rate (~20% YOY), plenty of cash on hand, and a low cash burn. Abusive shorting has led to this stock being beat down. CLOV has one tenth the market cap of AMC so much more room to run. 

It’s nothing against AMC or BB, they’ve done amazing, but you’re much closer to the top than the bottom at these levels. CLOV has all the right things needed for a big spike NOW. 

Options are still reasonably priced compared to the other meme stocks and this stock is early in its run. I have 6/18 12c options, which are still priced well and not wrecked by IV. Buying shares always works too.

Like the other typical ""buy and hold"" plays?"
2021-06-03 22:53:27,wallstreetbets,It should be an easier squeeze since the float is a lot less than AMC. I think it’s around 112 million.
2021-06-04 07:09:12,wallstreetbets,A call option that has a $22.00 price target that expires 6/18. Please don’t take option trading advice from me because I literally just enabled it last weekend.
2021-06-04 03:58:14,wallstreetbets,"Insiders can't sell their shares, but can they loan it? 


Institutions obviously can't own 106% of shares, so can we subtract the shorts to get their true percentage? 106 - 36 = 70%. Insiders own 24%, and that means retail owns 6%. Is that how it works?"

2021-06-03 21:44:40,wallstreetbets,You're off a decimal point. Each contract is for 100 shares. Each $0.43 call actually costs $43 ($0.43 x 100 shares).
2021-06-03 21:42:04,wallstreetbets,You buy in 100s.  1 call is $43 in your scenario.
2021-06-03 21:42:53,wallstreetbets,I’m no expert.  Actually I’m totally new to options.  This is attempt 2...   lots of 100...  I know what happens when they become worthless.  Not quite sure yet about the other way.
2021-06-03 21:50:02,wallstreetbets,"No...
Each share is .43. each call is 100 shares.

So $43 per contract.

If they expire worthless, you lose $43 per contract."

2021-06-04 12:46:31,wallstreetbets,More money in S&P 500 / NASDAQ 100 funds and much higher weighting for Tesla relative to other companies in it. Clover is one Medicare B company in a collection of 2000 small caps. I’m not writing off a chance of a squeeze but I don’t think passive Russell buying will do it.
2021-06-04 13:40:23,wallstreetbets,I’m good with the $90 loss if it goes to zero.   I’m just learning. I’ll start experimenting with some longer ones.
2021-06-03 20:59:32,wallstreetbets,I think it’s wrong. Look at what I pasted from the SEC filings.
2021-06-04 00:59:10,wallstreetbets,"GME was much higher. But most of the stocks currently being pushed here are in the 10-20% range, like AMC. And we’ve seen what AMC has done. 36% is enough to ignite a pretty serious short covering and is about double what AMC has been averaging lately."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Does Anyone Else Find It Odd? Everytime Gme starts to squeeze again, all of the sudden all of these other ""meme stocks"" start trending and being promoted as the next short squeeze candidate. Amc, BB, Nio, etc. I can't prove it, and maybe I'm just retarded, but I feel like maybe it's a divide and conquer type deal. It's a lot easier for hedge funds to stave off a massive squeeze, if everyone is putting their money into other stocks instead of concentrating on the one that got us all here. Maybe they're using other meme stocks as a hedge against GME. Like buying calls on stocks like AMC, and then promoting them as the next GME, then when everyone buys into AMC or whatever the new hot stock is, they then have more money to cover their shorts on GME. I know it's a crazy theory, but it just seems odd that everytime the squeeze is initiated, all of the sudden there are numerous other ""squeeze candidate stocks."""
2021-06-03 22:57:13,wallstreetbets,Theyre trying to keep the money from only going to one stock so they dont go broke. The shorts are starting to sweat. Keep buying.
2021-06-04 05:35:50,wallstreetbets,Yes yes yes yes! Finally a post about this! I try to post it too many times. Its them infiltrating this sub. Bb compared to gme is nothing yet the attention it gets???

I honestly have no idea what I’m talking about but cash out on AMC while paying the interest or whatever on gme as an example. Someone with bigger brains that knows options probably has a better understanding but that’s the way I see it.
2021-06-04 00:18:50,wallstreetbets,I don't think it is a conspiracy. I think it is evolution. The idea behind pushing GME was to hurt hedge funds and benefit other retailer investors. WSB is moving towards other stocks trying to short squeeze investors. This is not about a specific stock. It is about bringing down companies that manipulate the market for their own gain. More importantly it is about individuals moving together for the benefit of us all. Apes stong together. The individual stock is irrelevant. The apes are all that matters.

I'm here to make payoff bets."
2021-06-04 00:09:57,wallstreetbets,"The problem is that a lot of people lack that understanding of simple math. Does no one understand a free float and percentage gains or fractions? Doesn’t matter how many shares you buy it only matters how much % return is... that’s like saying 4 bricks at a total of 100lbs weighs more than 100 pieces of paper at 100lbs....1/4 brick is 25% of 4 total bricks. just like 25 out of 100 is 25% of the paper....25/100 = 1/4 which = 25%....Holy cow that’s some amazing shit right right? Here’s what AMC and BB have, A LARGE FLOAT. If GME had 700 million in volume like AMC did at 70, it would be well over $2000 a share. This is because there are only 50 million shares available for the market to buy! AMC has 450 million...For example, If Chad buys $10k of Gme at $250 and it went to 1k you would make $7500 profit. if Chad buys $10,000 worth of AMC at $25 a share and it went to 100 how much would Chad profit? Anyone???  The reason why AMC/BB held strong is because large floats are harder to push down/up. My point is retail has way too paper handed and impatient to hold through a sharp price dip that is inherent with smaller float stocks. It’s the same reason why no one can hold a fucking share of RKT even though that shit could go from 20 to 100 in a few days of trading regardless of SI, just on volume but the ape to smart ape ratio is low and most don’t look fundamentals/technicals they just buy high and sell low.

2021-06-04 03:31:55,wallstreetbets,Because one has better fundamentals and is in a far better position for a short squeeze? Its more expensive because there are less shares. That is a good thing when talking about squeezes.
2021-06-03 22:27:34,wallstreetbets,Another important metric is market cap. Us collectively buying $300M worth of AMC ($23B) won’t have quite the same same price impact as buying $300m worth of BB ($9B) or CLNE ($1.8B).

2021-06-04 01:14:48,wallstreetbets,AMC popped before GME this time. I've been following both stocks. Lot's of DD that applied to both cause of the shorting. BB is good stock but there's no squeeze potential that's worth pursuing
2021-06-04 01:13:19,wallstreetbets,False. DeepFuckinfValue started the push. He had no idea  GME game would skyrocket. It was a play based on principles.

2021-06-04 03:29:43,wallstreetbets,No money is rotating out of GME at this point tbh. People who have sat through $4 to $480 to $40 aren't going to just decide to sell at $250 because BB made a random push

2021-06-04 00:49:48,wallstreetbets,I agree. But GME has a market cap of $18B I believe. So it is easier to move than AMC

Yes. An old game retailer that may reinvent itself successfully is far more of a ""sure thing"" than an EV OS company that does cybersecurity.  

You're out of your mind. AMC might be trash and GME might be a real play, but BB is the definition of a sure thing."

I never bought into the amc hype (I bought at $9, sold at $12 over a month ago) but purely from a return standpoint (so far) amc has given better results, for this new round anyways"
2021-06-04 01:16:40,wallstreetbets,It was a value play based off fundamentals DFV himself said he wasn’t betting on a short squeeze.

It's much easier to control and there are much less shares to cover with. Idc what the price is or gains right now. Realistically amc or BB are probably not going over a couple hundred bucks. GME is literally the sky is the limit due to it's very controllable float. If enough people actually realize the potential it has retail will quite literally name their price."
2021-06-04 01:38:20,wallstreetbets,GME was a value play @$18. Not @$158. GME showed what we can accomplish if we work together. Why not move on to other value plays? I am rooting for you. I want us all to make money. We can find a squeezed stock every 2 or 3 weeks and moon it. Limbos for all of us.
2021-06-04 11:31:01,wallstreetbets,"Where did I mention market cap, I mentioned total float"

2021-06-04 02:01:06,wallstreetbets,"Not everyone can be winners— for all the posts you see with gain porn, many are options plays which can and will result in equally epic loss porn at the flip of a switch. For every winner there is a loser and that loser is NOT always a hedge fund, it’s often regular folks who are crowd-thinking their way to bankruptcy. The hedge funds aren’t good or evil (nor are the apes) they are just profitable. They exist because their methods work— they seek profit, and make the plays they think are profitable. 

Hedges are literally meant to offset the potential loss of a long position, so all these funds are not just shorting stocks, they do so to balance out their long positions which are likely larger. Yes they are run by rich people who are probably rude republicans, but stop creating a mythology around them that they are some evil super villains. This isn’t a movie, and relying on “everyone” working together to benefit all is a pipe dream as long as were in a capitalist market economy. If you want that, read Marx and start working towards a communist revolution, because that’s the dream you’re hoping for."
2021-06-04 03:21:55,wallstreetbets,"Some of this is false though. The most well known shorts were long on companies that are in direct competition with the companies they are shorting. (AMZN AMC for movies, Netflix trying to get into gaming & AMZN trying to grow in that direction vs GME). 


By naked shorting those companies to oblivion, they not only make a ton of money on that play (especially when they successfully bankrupt a company), they also set their longs up to capture market share. You are thinking far too small, or are far too naive about the inner workings of big money and how the pieces move if you think everyone is just playing their best ideas and hoping for the best.


If most people had essentially unlimited resources, and had methods for guaranteeing they could keep winning a game against people to set everyone in their family lineage up to live the life they want until the end of time, most would also go to extreme measures to protect those methods."
2021-06-04 11:17:10,wallstreetbets,"Do you really think when those short positions were sold that any hedge fund seriously considered GME a direct competitor to Amazon or Netflix? To be realistic they probably still don’t. If GME went bankrupt that would have had zero effect on Netflix and a virtually undetectable effect on Amazon, which benefits when any retailer goes out of business. They didn’t target GME because they saw it as a threat, they targeted it for exactly opposite reason— it appeared last year to be a literal joke of a company whose customers hated it and wouldn’t have batted an eye at its bankruptcy if it hadn’t been for the tendie train. 

Let’s not pretend this is somehow a story about how the wholesome and long-beloved GameStop came under fire and apes rushed to its aid out of brand loyalty— this is a cash-grab for most, who have probably never set foot in a GameStop and don’t give a fuk about NFTs or whatever. If the same situation had happened with Hardee’s or EA Games, people would be bandwagoning behind them too and talking about how mean it is for hedgies to short, even though nobody really likes these companies. 

The emotional thinking is going to make you a worse trader, but do what makes you feel good."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Important: MAY CPI / inflation data release next week Just a heads up to everyone that bought stocks after the rally that we have had since the last weeks of May. A couple of weeks ago we got CPI data of April and it turned out to be far worse then expected causing the entire market to collapse and stocks to be down for weeks. 

Unless some miracle happend there is no way that the CPI data of May will be better than April since it has been getting progressively worse each month. So if you own a lot of Spacs, Tech or any other non-boomer stocks expect heavy loses next Thursday / Friday as everyone panics sells due to inflation FUD."

2021-06-03 20:13:23,wallstreetbets,It is sad that this isn’t the most upvoted or discussed topic and there Aren’t more posts about it.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why do I see 10x as many post about BB than I do AMC? It's interesting how AMC can run 400% in a week and in one night all the posts disappear and BB takes its place as the number 1 talked about stock. I'd also like to point out that when gamestop ran like crazy, WallStreetBets gained over 8 million autists.  I don't think we are even seeing 100,000 new autists with this run. And the market cap of AMC went 3x what GME did.  I just have this awful feeling that we might have been infiltrated from the inside. You are seriously going to compare BB to AMC? We own 80% of AMC and it is shorted 20% that we know of (plenty more that we don't). 43% of BB is owned by institutions and shorted 10% that we know of. I think something is up. Keep the posts and buying going for AMC fellow autists and we will all be sipping margaritas on the moon. 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Jesus Christ you smooth brained fucks, I had to turn my notifications off because my phone was burning a hole in my pocket because of the friction from vibration. Also thank you for all the awards! (Trying to message everyone a thank you). Just another note, Stocktwits has AMC messages at 164,000 messages in 24 hours vs BBs 22,000. The squeeze has not been squoze! Now I'm going to do some reverse psychology. Everytime a post blows up, the OP sometimes says ""StOp WaStInG MoNeY oN aWaRdS"" you retards then proceed to 10 fold the awards. That being said, SEND THE AWARDS! Apes can't compute instruction so this should send AMC to at least $100,000. (I tried to think of a conservative price)"
2021-06-03 23:55:13,wallstreetbets,"Please just follow the rules when posting. The reason a lot of posts get taken down because of the following

1. Rule 8 violation.
2. Discussion post that should have been a comment in the daily thread. So many of these don't even have text.
3. Static image memes.

If you are new and not familiar with the rules, go familiarize yourself with them. Those rules help keep content on track and provide an objective way to manage the sub.

Please keep posting content for your favorite stocks, just do it in way that doesn't break the rules."

2021-06-03 21:13:11,wallstreetbets,"Cause BB hasn’t made a huge run yet. Buyers see the chance to get in on BB early, rather than risk getting AMC at the top"
2021-06-03 22:47:44,wallstreetbets,Did you say buy more BB?
2021-06-03 22:46:47,wallstreetbets,Something is up?? You know how many of us fucking BB bagholders have been getting our asses pounded for months? We've been waiting forever for this run after BB got left in the fucking dust by so many paper hands on this sub who abandoned it to buy GME. When it was the OG next thing wayyyy before AMC. It's finally back so we're coming out of the woodwork
2021-06-03 23:14:55,wallstreetbets,"I'm a BB believer who has been quietly watching wsb since January, I think there's just a lot of us bagholders who've been waiting for a breakout moment. Go AMC though, it is awesome to watch"

2021-06-03 22:41:12,wallstreetbets,Bought BB in jan at 20 sold 1 week ago at 8.  Good times.
2021-06-04 01:34:55,wallstreetbets,Lmao BB usually arent bots it’s some people jumping in as it’s cheaper and it’s a bit earlier some believe in the rocket than AMC. Also a few people like me who have been bag holding BB for a while who know it’s a solid buy who just spam BB lmao
2021-06-04 04:12:51,wallstreetbets,5K just dropped in pre market for $BB she is my baby.
2021-06-03 20:44:30,wallstreetbets,BB has a ton of long term potential and is therefore much safer than AMC in my opinion.
2021-06-03 21:16:34,wallstreetbets,BB good
2021-06-03 21:14:32,wallstreetbets,I mean people felt the same about amc when compared to gme. BB might be the new amc
2021-06-03 20:35:01,wallstreetbets,Cause BB to the moon SON!
2021-06-03 23:46:47,wallstreetbets,This post reeks of someone who just bought at the top lol
2021-06-04 03:53:05,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck turns on reddit notifications.
2021-06-03 23:06:50,wallstreetbets,AMC is the way. Ape strong together.
2021-06-03 23:37:37,wallstreetbets,"BB is now 20% shorted.

100,000,000 shorts added yesterday."
2021-06-04 03:33:22,wallstreetbets,"Because BB actually has a bright future since it's shifting to IoT, which people severely underestimate (over 20 billion connections already) and I believe it will become even bigger and absolutely vital in the future.

GME is shifting to digital sales which is something but AMC Ive seen literally no real fundamentals for to warrant massive growth.

Also AMC keeps diluting by releasing more stocks and they themselves are recommending against buying the stock at this price."
2021-06-03 21:39:59,wallstreetbets,Because bb is gonna squeeze harder
2021-06-03 20:12:19,wallstreetbets,There's probably a lot of answers that are partially the reason. My explanation is that no one wants to buy into AMC this close to its ATH compared to BB which still looks tame by FOMO standards. Plus room to gain vs AMC.
2021-06-03 21:17:11,wallstreetbets,"This is nothing new tbh. This happened during GameStop mania with SLV and people even called AMC a distraction.

Truth is, though. BB was already among the triad of meme stocks that ran up with GME (because of highly shorted quality) back in January. That triad being GME, AMC, and BB."
2021-06-03 21:34:35,wallstreetbets,CLOV is more legit squeezable
2021-06-03 21:46:55,wallstreetbets,I saw BB I bought BB. Why are you assuming my Intelligence
2021-06-03 22:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Because $BB at $8 to even now was a no-brainer. Plenty of people genuinely believe in the DD and the recent news bringing cyber crime to the forefront make the future VERY bright for BB.

This is not a short squeeze. (although too many people believe this is what they're getting)

&#x200B;

This is a legit company with very nice potential income streams and tech to back it up.

&#x200B;

The stock market is not only short interest. Sometimes you want to invest in secure assets, not just speculation and short busting."
2021-06-03 22:57:31,wallstreetbets,Oh god here you guys are with the fucking conspiracies again
2021-06-03 20:30:26,wallstreetbets,It’s bc it’s still at a bargain price bro and tons of potential some people don’t want to buy in at the amc high missed the chance at 8-15 dollars chill
2021-06-03 20:19:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm all for amc doing well, hell I bought call options originally when amc was 3 dollars!  

But in my mind bb is the better play.

I in no way think amc doesn't have a potential short squeeze but bb I  think has patent potential waiting for lift off 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-06-03 21:01:12,wallstreetbets,I feel like GME heads never fucked with AMC and didn’t realize we can all make money on multiple opportunities the more we grow our community. BB was like the middle child of the BANG stonks and us apes are ready to show it some love. TLDR; 👶 🍼 🐒 🚀 🚀 🚀
2021-06-04 01:17:19,wallstreetbets,Because BB is cheaper. That's fuckin it. AMC ran up to the 60s. Buying a high volume of that is impossible for 99% here
2021-06-03 20:35:04,wallstreetbets,Everyone is holding AMC I just have BB as well
2021-06-03 21:29:45,wallstreetbets,I’m letting BB take off so I can buy puts and then take my tendies to buy more GME jet fuel
2021-06-03 21:43:09,wallstreetbets,A month ago if you even mentioned AMC you would be downvoted into oblivion. This isn’t new.

2021-06-03 21:05:02,wallstreetbets,This is just the beginning for BB. I have a feeling that BB will shoot up soon
2021-06-03 20:35:01,wallstreetbets,"I'll just come out and say it. I dont care for amc as a business.  I don't see the value in it for the future. Ya it's on an insane run, but I'm not gambling on a business I dont believe in.  I'm also not a full time trader and cant babysit a stock all day while it acts all schizo.  BB to me is different.  I actually see value in what they have to offer and think they can continue to grow.  I'll play some meme stocks but not with a good chunk of my cash."
2021-06-03 20:48:09,wallstreetbets,B/c AMC management screwed retail today. They could have let it keep running but instead did a capital raise immediately. GameStop at least let itself run before doing it. I’m in $BB and $PLTR ONLY
2021-06-03 21:10:37,wallstreetbets,"BB is going to move, Amc already moved a lot. JM2C"

2021-06-03 21:44:29,wallstreetbets,We’re allowed to have multiple winners in this game
2021-06-03 22:41:01,wallstreetbets,They did it in here to GME... Now they'll do it to AMC... Then to BB... Why? To keep you trying to jump ship from the big fish to the little fish to help themselves.
2021-06-03 23:12:16,wallstreetbets,"People have the same excitement for $BB that they do for $AMC. In fact, many people including myself own $GME $AMC and $BB. My friends new to Ape nation have contributed to both $AMC and $BB. I understand the fear that $BB is sucking away from $AMC but that's not the case. People are excited to run two affordable stocks up rather than just one. I've said in one of my trending posts that $AMC simple makes more sense right now but $BB has a lot of potential. People miss the boat and $BB give others a chance to ride. I'll go further with an anecdotal example of a friend who bought $BB and yolo'd  into $AMC since $BB brought him in the fold."

Kinda obvious actually."
2021-06-04 00:56:16,wallstreetbets,"a lot of manipulation in the news trying to get everyone to panic sell or think the squeeze is over, when in fact, it truly hasn't started yet. Time is the key, keep holding will force the margin calls soon."
2021-06-04 01:13:16,wallstreetbets,I'm convinced it's an attempt to shift focus away from the larger stocks that are shorted in an attempt to get resources pulled elsewhere.
2021-06-04 01:25:56,wallstreetbets,I like BB
2021-06-04 01:59:24,wallstreetbets,Hold the AMC for those who did not!

We own AMC. 
BB has far more institutional owners as u said 

it's an inside job. AMC apes to the moon!"
2021-06-04 03:32:47,wallstreetbets,"Because a 400% spike is the kinda spike smart people were looking for, and there’s always the next thing.  AMC went double what it did last time, what’s your price target?"

2021-06-03 20:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Easy: AMC and GME already mooned massively.  Out of the big 3 meme stocks only one that is left is BB.

2021-06-03 23:33:15,wallstreetbets,"It's been historical.  Once GME started popping you'd see a ton of AMC posts.  Once AMC starts popping off now you see BB etc.  Damage and narrative control.  WSB has already been infiltrated, sadly."
2021-06-03 20:01:32,wallstreetbets,"I for one, have been sitting on a bunch of BB shares for 6 months... I would love to see them take off!

2021-06-03 23:42:17,wallstreetbets,BB was here before AMC.

2021-06-03 21:18:34,wallstreetbets,Earlier today I saw a post bitching about this and the first seven posts under it were about AMC.
2021-06-03 21:30:06,wallstreetbets,AMC AMC AMC! No distraction!!!
2021-06-03 21:32:39,wallstreetbets,Because it’s WSB. The hate has been surrounding it since January.
2021-06-03 21:46:40,wallstreetbets,"I was once on the mods are gay train but I'm pretty sure they are just trying to hold this place together with some duct tape and superglue so they aren't letting anything slide and it looks like shit is being censored. 

There are 10MM subs here and I would bet at least 500k of them are bots. You know what is easy to do? Program a bot to upvote anything BB related. When you have an overzealous automod and 500k bots upvoting anything BB, guess what you get? A curated BB sub because most people don't filter by new or rising they just look at the top post and vote that way. This is the same reason most every subreddit that gets too big loses the reasons that made it popular."
2021-06-03 22:27:56,wallstreetbets,This post is retarded.
2021-06-03 22:35:16,wallstreetbets,This is legit sad this sub has been compromised I don't know if people realize but they've been removing almost all post about AMC and GME
2021-06-03 22:48:14,wallstreetbets,Good point. We own 80% of share. We have the power of stock move if we dont bitch hand
2021-06-03 23:10:33,wallstreetbets,So what your saying is BB to the moon 🌚?
2021-06-03 23:12:42,wallstreetbets,I completely agree and was pointing this out to a few fellow coworkers.  AMC still deserves top mentions especially into a critical day tomorrow.
2021-06-03 23:16:15,wallstreetbets,I think you know but I’ve said too much.
2021-06-03 23:36:58,wallstreetbets,"As a bag holder of BB I don’t see the issue. Whistle, whistle, whistllllllle (save my portfolio) more whistling."
2021-06-03 23:40:44,wallstreetbets,This sub has been dog shit since like February
2021-06-03 23:40:51,wallstreetbets,Finally ape spoke. And the fact that ape fight fellow ape for bb vs amc is too much
2021-06-03 23:41:03,wallstreetbets,"Same reason you been seeing 6-7 figure ""YOLO""s since the mods been bought when before you only saw retards YOLO 5-20k. It's all fake."
2021-06-03 23:42:58,wallstreetbets,This Ape hold AMC GME and BB ape no discriminate fuck hedges give me tendies
2021-06-04 00:04:14,wallstreetbets,Dude thinks amc is the only play and that's how you get burned son.
2021-06-04 00:07:59,wallstreetbets,Distraction
2021-06-04 00:13:47,wallstreetbets,"1) Buy the dip and hold.    
2) Repeat step 1 until out of money  
3) Hold  
4) AMC to the moon."
2021-06-04 00:15:37,wallstreetbets,Notice how you see none of GME as well. Quite weird wouldn't you say? Ever since the last mod takeover things just ain't been quite right.
2021-06-04 00:20:44,wallstreetbets,The reason for this is many retards missed the $AMC train and are now jumping on the $BB train while it's still at a low PPS.
2021-06-04 00:28:57,wallstreetbets,People don’t wanna buy into something that already popped. They want the next thing that they think they’re getting into on the ground floor. Same reason why AMC got so much attention while GameStop was exploding.
2021-06-04 00:39:14,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s easier for normie wage cucks like me to make a large profit off a stock with a lower value, it’s impossible for me to get rich off GME or AMC right now because the UK doesn’t have options trading and the price of the stock itself has gone quite high now. It’s also easier for it to 2x 3x 4x value etc from a lower initial value like AMC had and now BB. Hope this makes sense. 
Ook Ook 🦍

2021-06-04 01:56:49,wallstreetbets,"My full retard analysis: BB will have some spikes, but then come down (I wanna see it go to $60). AMC will keep going up and up. Bottomline, Whatever MSM preaches, do the opposite, fuck em."

2021-06-04 02:23:17,wallstreetbets,Because WSB is compromised. GME ALWAYS HAS BEEN AND ALWAYS WILL BE THE ULTIMATE PLAY. (Not financial advice)
2021-06-04 02:27:32,wallstreetbets,"I thought the exact same thing a few days ago, it was people saying they are selling for BB, like the fuck they are...? It was bad english and a lot of votes which made it weirder.  

If it’s at that rate of people, thousands, then we have a serious war going on. Just my two cents."
2021-06-04 03:08:40,wallstreetbets,"Everything other than GME is a distraction or divisive tactic trying to split retail investors money and attention and you know it.

DFV was always 100% about GME and nothing else.

GME is the main play."
2021-06-04 03:13:09,wallstreetbets,Was wondering the same thing. Also the accounts yoloing into BB seemed weird.  Some Accounts were 5 days old with tons of karma.🤔 some were really old accounts.
2021-06-04 03:14:02,wallstreetbets,"It's also amazing to me how quick the mood shifts, from ""BB TO THE MOON"" and DD's all about BB - to people saying ""don't yolo anything"" or ""BB is longterm lol it was never going to be AMC"" while one day earlier the exact opposites were stated. 

And of course, the hindsight is always correct, it's a confirmation bias that ALWAYS the hindsight was correct (because, and follow me here fellow apes, it's IN HINDSIGHT). The same happened with GME, every DD was like ""it's gonna happen next week"" or ""this friday!!"" and then it dipped. That's just the nature of stocks of course and no one is to blame for it, but the sudden mood shifts by, sometimes, the same people is funny as hell.

AMC was... refreshing to be honest. People hyped it, and it happened! It happened WHEN it was said it would happen - not ""lol no now it's a month"" or ""this was always longterm"" - nope, apes said it'd break the roof before friday, it broke the roof before friday."
2021-06-04 03:31:03,wallstreetbets,"Its because retail masses tend to buy the cheaper meme stocks. Once a meme stock goes significantly up, people start looking at the next easier to buy but ""logical"" meme stock. I think GME will be the only exception to this rule being the first meme stock explosion."
2021-06-04 04:37:23,wallstreetbets,why do i see X100 posts about AMC than GME?
2021-06-04 05:36:46,wallstreetbets,"a low number of new redditors is a good thing, there are too many posts made by greedy individuals who are already well in the green aimed at suckering noobs to push the price higher and become permanent bagholders at prices that the stock will likely never see again once the squeeze has died down"
2021-06-04 06:40:47,wallstreetbets,"A distraction, paid by citadel and friends."
2021-06-04 08:21:20,wallstreetbets,Y'all know which stonk the tendieman is really coming for. Don't lie.

2021-06-04 12:22:38,wallstreetbets,"I think it is correct AMC/GME, especially GME are the ones the hedges are afraid of, they are arrogant and have continued to short more and more making what was an unlikly squeeze more and more possible all the time. I really think any of the others are a distraction and yes, I only arrived in January but really believe tons of infiltration has happened, as I was a reader before that. Evidence is downvotes...there will be tons of downs votes mixed in to this post."
2021-06-03 23:10:56,wallstreetbets,"Difference between AMC and BB is that Blackberry is a real bluechip and has long term traction. AMC is a meme stock held by diamond hands apes. Both are legit, but BB does not need to move the needle that much to draw attention."
2021-06-03 21:47:34,wallstreetbets,"BB is working on a bunch of cool shit relevant to the world of today/tomorrow, while AMC is just... stuck in the past."
2021-06-03 21:55:36,wallstreetbets,You mfers better make me proud tomorrow to own Bb. I have a few left over calls that need to print biggie.
2021-06-04 03:18:14,wallstreetbets,BB was a wsb staple well before AMC. BB to the moooooon baby!
2021-06-03 21:09:59,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC is pretty much doomed, realistically. The decline of hollywood and the rise of cheap home theaters is a death blow. Blackberry on the other hand has real room to compete in the product space. That said, I own a little of  both :)"
2021-06-03 23:07:34,wallstreetbets,$BB is a fundamentally better stock. The downside risk is a lot less. It's a value play.
2021-06-03 23:12:26,wallstreetbets,I have BB that's why I talk and about bb.
2021-06-03 23:52:30,wallstreetbets,HF want us to focus on BB
2021-06-03 23:53:42,wallstreetbets,"I get annoyed by BB posts honestly

I think the mods are heavily invested in BB though so they remove AMC posts and inflate BB posts to help themselves.

Don’t believe me? Look at their post histories."
2021-06-04 00:12:38,wallstreetbets,watch out for long term BB bag holders wanting to unload stock  lol  AMC  GME all the way
2021-06-04 00:25:16,wallstreetbets,"Cause BB is gonna take off to a higher universe 
Honestly today’s move by their ceo
Of issuing 11 million shares
And 25 mill more by the end of year
The dilution is going to be pretty deep
And investors later on will not see value
Redditors made GME,and Ryan Cohen is gonna follow thru,the right way,unfortunetly I just don’t see the same from ceo of amc, the first time Reddit bailed them out,all on top took big bonuses,they just finish a dilution,now setting up for another one,then another one for 25 mill shares at end of year,it basically tells investors,after it goes up and all dilutions are performed,the wait is going to be inmmensr for your value to rise,I’ll support GME,I’ll support BB.,and I’ll support,BED BATH N BEYOND ,anytime ,we will see what’s AMC move down the road,cause the dilution is going to be an issue sooner or later ,I personally don’t even see the need"
2021-06-04 02:02:49,wallstreetbets,Sell AMC and buy BB
2021-06-04 10:40:12,wallstreetbets,BB is legend
2021-06-03 21:20:08,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, AMC was always a distraction from GME. GME would probably be $500+ by now if people didn't choose to invest into AMC instead of GME. Now AMC people are complaining that people are investing in BB?"
2021-06-03 21:54:47,wallstreetbets,It's bots trying to get us away from the AMC stock.
2021-06-04 01:08:03,wallstreetbets,Just amc all done. BB turn lol
2021-06-03 21:36:06,wallstreetbets,AMC sucks
2021-06-03 21:02:56,wallstreetbets,Because BB rules and AMC has its own subreddits.
2021-06-03 21:31:33,wallstreetbets,Cuz BB is a boof distraction
2021-06-03 23:05:03,wallstreetbets,"I, for one, am pretty tired of seeing only GME and AMC for months when a quarter of the posts like this are why is noone talking about GME and AMC.

It's pretty clear that AMC leveled off which means the hype goes with it. Will it pop off again? Probably, but BB is a good meme stock we can hype too."
2021-06-03 20:35:03,wallstreetbets,WSB turned into garbage back in January. Never will be the same. Sorry not sorry. AMC to the Moon. Because it literally makes sense. 🚀🦍🚀🦍
2021-06-03 20:46:48,wallstreetbets,I am sticking with my old argument that BB isnt going to moon. I think BB investors secretly know this and thats why they are so butthurt over AMC...a company that actually DID moon.
2021-06-03 20:58:12,wallstreetbets,Mods have bb calls expiring tomorrow
2021-06-03 21:42:29,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC, as an aggregate of letter of the alphabet is 17 - A(1) + M (13) + C (3) = 17. 17 is the weakest hand in Blackjack that is socially required to stand. 

BB, is 4 - B (2) + B (2) = 4. There are 2 letters in BB. If you add the letters and subtract from the number of the alphabet, you get 0. 4. 2. 0. 

BB (420) is better than AMC (17)."
2021-06-03 22:07:12,wallstreetbets,BB was being talked about long before AMC. It's also the more exciting one at the moment because AMC has already had its run.
2021-06-03 22:15:32,wallstreetbets,"I’m in both, but BB has a lot of potential outside of it being a meme stock and with AMC having the day it had people are rallying behind BB because it might feel like the “safer” option"
2021-06-03 22:45:41,wallstreetbets,I sold my AMC At $55 and put it all on BB. It’s the next rocket and this one will actually reach the moon. 🚀🚀🦍🦍💎💎
2021-06-03 22:53:02,wallstreetbets,I dropped $1k into BB and literally have no idea why. 🤷🏼‍♂️ cool?? Not cool??? Whatevs
2021-06-03 23:06:48,wallstreetbets,AMC keeps diluting shares right now. They sold 11 mil today to tank the stock and now they are trying to get authorization to sell another 25 mil. They are trying to become debt free from us apes throwing our banana peels at the stock..
2021-06-03 23:08:04,wallstreetbets,"Because the first distraction/dilution of AMC worked on  GME, time to dilute our power some more."
2021-06-03 23:08:06,wallstreetbets,"OP must be a newbie here. People said the same thing about AMC when GME was hyped lmao. AMC is fake! GME REAL DEAL! DONT GET FOOLED! Your just too dumb to keep holding AMC, smart money already moving to BB..and u said why??? are you serious? SIMPLE, CUZ WE LIKE THE STOCK!"
2021-06-03 23:11:05,wallstreetbets,"Because money talks, even to Reddit mods for this page. 

Guarantee that they are in the pockets of a certain few to moderate this page for not our benefit but theirs ie hedge funds. 

If you say I’m crazy call out the mods on it. 
I promise you I’m correct."
2021-06-03 23:27:56,wallstreetbets,"AMC CEO has fucked the bag holders, diluting Stocks just one day after another that’s why it’s going down as fast it went up and as far as BB it has potential  and I like the stock."
2021-06-03 23:37:09,wallstreetbets,I mean  BB didnt dilute their srock and it has lots of room to run plus real long term potential
2021-06-03 23:57:11,wallstreetbets,*Cough*GME has always been the way*cough*
2021-06-04 00:13:29,wallstreetbets,"Stock went up 800% in a week and you guys still think a squeeze is about to happen?! Just out of curiosity, what is the magic number that will confirm the squeeze? SI will probably remain high because new players are shorting at these unreal levels and replacing the old ones who got margin called."
2021-06-04 00:28:39,wallstreetbets,Mods are absolute shit here. Most bullshit things that happen here can be attributed to them
2021-06-04 00:40:43,wallstreetbets,"That's how the retardation moon in the sub works, the more of something you see the more likely the decision you should make to go deep into the fucker.  I just moved $4k into BB.  In January I made $7k in 1 day.  Shoot I sold my calls too soon on that day, but would've made $14k had I not sold my calls too soon this past januaryy.  This time I will ride the rocket to the ends of the earth and beyond."
2021-06-04 00:52:46,wallstreetbets,"BB baby, that’s why"
2021-06-04 01:30:21,wallstreetbets,Because BB is the BIG HUSTLE! AMC has no long game it’s just a mere short term Trollope. When everything is said and done BB is the end game!
2021-06-04 02:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Because BB is the way

Everyone knows 
buy low sell high, then 
buy low then sell lower"
2021-06-04 03:30:02,wallstreetbets,They're all from fake profiles. That is a really good sign for real people here who hold AMC
2021-06-04 04:21:46,wallstreetbets,"Redditor for 5 months. Bro, I think you are upset that AMC is down big and there is so much shit is wrong with your post. There have been memes about the BANG portfolio since DFV graced us with his presence. BANG = BB AMC NOK GME. Go back to your AMC subreddit if you are butthurt about people putting their AMC gains in BB."
2021-06-04 10:37:16,wallstreetbets,Selling kills the rocket from spiking. Hold and buy BB then watch it takeoff soon. Look at what happened to AMC last week. We can recreate it for BB. Who’s with me?? 🚀🚀💎💎🦍🦍
2021-06-03 20:32:34,wallstreetbets,bots taken over
2021-06-03 22:57:05,wallstreetbets,Citadel owns BB !!! Are y’all morons!!!
2021-06-04 00:11:04,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC is just a theater and a meme stock, it’s always been a meme stock. BB is a super undervalued tech stock with game changing software. Even Though gme was a meme stock too it has Ryan Cohen behind it."
2021-06-04 00:17:20,wallstreetbets,AMC already mooned. Apes are taking profit and getting into the next rocketship = BB
2021-06-04 00:47:32,wallstreetbets,I have both BB and AMC.  The truth is I'd rather add more to BB than AMC.  AMC is at insane price level now.  You really have got to be crazy yoloing at this point add to AMC.
2021-06-04 00:56:17,wallstreetbets,People cared a lot more about gme as a company. And amc is basically done. The odds of amc going bigger seems pretty small now compared to the chances of getting in on bb early and riding the wave
2021-06-04 01:05:16,wallstreetbets,"If I had to guess, I’d say it’s people taking profits from AMC (already mooned) and looking for the next big play."
2021-06-04 01:47:55,wallstreetbets,"AMC management Succs bro. I like GME, BB"
2021-06-04 01:50:07,wallstreetbets,Umm because AMC is over.
2021-06-03 20:04:21,wallstreetbets,"How dare you say AMC!!! How dare you, sir!?"
2021-06-03 20:06:18,wallstreetbets,"DONT SELL your GMC to buy BB or AMC.

2021-06-03 20:22:02,wallstreetbets,Reporting in with my small shares of AMC with some popcorn.
2021-06-03 20:23:15,wallstreetbets,Yes this I to have noticed - I held BB and will again after but it’s not about BB it’s about how many BB posts are rolling through ! Really now ? Seems sus and I like BB
2021-06-03 20:35:05,wallstreetbets,"Compromised sub

2021-06-03 21:42:47,wallstreetbets,There is actually another subreddit where they mostly just talk about amc and gme only

2021-06-03 22:16:02,wallstreetbets,You have to remember this is post GME mindset where a lot of people lost money or missed out ...I think a lot of apes became paper hands because of that
2021-06-03 22:16:18,wallstreetbets,Down with the MODS!
2021-06-03 22:17:00,wallstreetbets,I was here before GME and all of the millions of people flocked in. BB was very much a value play posted multiple times in the sub before the meme train began.
2021-06-03 22:18:52,wallstreetbets,That's how memes work.
2021-06-03 22:20:40,wallstreetbets,There’s a server error on the comment section now..
2021-06-03 22:20:46,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ, this again?

Mods are fine. There was some weirdness in February, but it's been cleared up.

Posts are probably being deleted because they break some rule. Just like back in February and March. 

Why would you assume that because amc is jumping like gme did that the sub count will also grow like it did with gme? 

Pretty much this exact post was made around the gme jump. There is no conspiracy. Save that shit for the amc/gme cult subs."
2021-06-03 22:23:37,wallstreetbets,I remember a point that every post about GME completely disappeared and any new posts were automatically deleted. It felt like all of the energy that kept GME alive was sucked out of the room and it made it seem like the GME movement was dead. The first thing i thought of was WSB was infiltrated and the mods were deleting posts... I hope something like that doesn't happen again.
2021-06-03 22:24:15,wallstreetbets,"In the beginning it was BB and GME...
 Some of us are just excited to finally see gains and heat that we were not forgotten."
2021-06-03 22:25:48,wallstreetbets,Thanks OP. We all see it.
2021-06-03 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,SUPER SUS  I’ve been pointing this out for two days and I get downvoted or buried.
2021-06-03 22:27:42,wallstreetbets,Because the amc and gme holders are no longer here.

2021-06-03 23:06:07,wallstreetbets,Kinda new to this... just reading and doing idiot who knows nothing deduction bb seemed like the better buy 🤣😂🤣😂 so there is more to the story? After seeing what just happened it scared me away from amcbut I just got here..  like literally...so I dont really know wtf is going on.... idebe happy to turn some profitoff brand drop it back into amc but it seemed it was rotating the other direction 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-03 23:08:09,wallstreetbets,The man's trying to stop the hold. HOLD RETARDS

2021-06-03 23:17:58,wallstreetbets,Are you seriously realizing that now?
2021-06-03 23:24:21,wallstreetbets,"Because real apes are holding both BB and AMC. You're a true greedy fucking autist going all in on 1 position, but you can play more than 1 thing."

2021-06-03 23:26:17,wallstreetbets,"I think a lot of the AMC holders are on the AMC sub.  GME was always WSB's favorite.  Or posts are getting taken down, IDK.  I notice way less frequent meme's nowadays compared to the old days of GME."

2021-06-03 23:55:12,wallstreetbets,Does this really matter? I just went ahead and bought a bit of everything that's shorted on wsb lol.

2021-06-04 00:11:47,wallstreetbets,Because wsb has always hated amc. They use to ban like every post on amc. That’s why I hardly pay attention to this sub anymore.
2021-06-04 00:11:53,wallstreetbets,Fud
2021-06-04 00:12:55,wallstreetbets,Because there are still some shares left?
2021-06-04 00:19:40,wallstreetbets,"BB has been trending in WSB for as long as AMC 
Notice how the media does not cover it. Media try to say Beyond Meat was a Reddit stock. But BB is solid and has been heavily shorted"
2021-06-04 00:20:37,wallstreetbets,"So, I think you’re unaware of the ‘Market Makers Involved factor’.."
2021-06-04 00:22:40,wallstreetbets,I like bb because it was relatively cheaper than amc for stock price. Price can not be understated when it’s comes to people’s investment
2021-06-04 00:23:19,wallstreetbets,I’m just running BB because it’s still relatively cheap so I can actually load up on a few shares 🤷‍♂️
2021-06-04 00:36:19,wallstreetbets,Same reason you see 10x more AMC posts compared to GME
2021-06-04 00:37:17,wallstreetbets,Because the setup on amc is different and theres nothing beyond the $72 resistance.
2021-06-04 00:40:54,wallstreetbets,It’s probably put time.
2021-06-04 01:00:35,wallstreetbets,This is definitely an inside job they had to get back at us some how
2021-06-04 01:00:40,wallstreetbets,"Keep saying the word ""autist"", it turns me on."
2021-06-04 01:14:47,wallstreetbets,"Ppl look for the next thing more so of course BB, it’s probably too late to really generate insane returns on AMC at this point. 

But then again... I’m a fuvking idiot lol"
2021-06-04 01:15:20,wallstreetbets,Hmmm… I wonder.🤔
2021-06-04 01:17:23,wallstreetbets,">we have issued or reserved substantially all

They didn't say they have SOLD all the shares they are authorized to create - just that they have ""Created them"" - what's the maximum authorized share count?

2021-06-04 01:34:48,wallstreetbets,cuz bb went up today-- have more shares of AMC then BB but bought more BB then AMC today-- Bought more NOK as well.  Even more Kodak-- bought 1 share gme-- had to raid limit orders to fund-- didn't sell anything today--

2021-06-04 02:40:14,wallstreetbets,BB to $100
2021-06-04 02:45:23,wallstreetbets,Because it's easier to spell.

2021-06-04 03:13:35,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds worth billions doing all sorts of illegal things to rig the game. Infiltrating a simple forum seems only logical. If I was a mod and they came at me with a bag of money I'd give them my username too.
2021-06-04 03:26:20,wallstreetbets,What’s the talk about beyond meat
2021-06-04 03:34:20,wallstreetbets,"Here's the thing, WSB lost a lot of credit and trust when GME attracted paid posts to discredit the stonk, mix this with new mods, new rules and a new attitude and you have a recipe for a sub hedge funds would short it. 



WSB lost the trust of it's members.

WSB showed it was changing direction through mod rotation.

WSB mods took money to change the direction of the sub.

WSB banned some memes.

WSB stopped being about loss porn whilst all the newbies joined for gains.



WSB changed, people don't flock to a sub where it's members aren't unified. Especially now there's competition in the subs for AMC or GME or future meme stocks in super stonk. These were support more by some of the old WSB mods setting them up. The mods are very carefully controlling what is and isn't posting and it's killing the sub and community."
2021-06-04 03:46:43,wallstreetbets,"Make a quality AMC post and it'll stay up.

Hint:. Three rocket emojis and a pump statement do not make a quality post."

2021-06-04 04:51:32,wallstreetbets,"No doubt bro.  Blackberry is a distraction just like it was in January.  AMC AND GME.  That's fucking it!  

Now, I have other positions!  Hell, I don't even OWN GME.  But there is a difference between a short squeeze, a gamma squeeze, a momentum run, and then what's happening with GME/AMC, which if you don't know by now DYODD.  BB is not on that list.  Doesn't mean it won't run!"
2021-06-04 04:58:30,wallstreetbets,"when the GME shenanigans started end of last year, it was the hot new meme so everyone who had any interest in the matter joined ( BB was spammed a lot back then too btw because i joined in the main GME hype too :) )

Also 20% short is a number, but GME had like 200% short numbers at some time

It's not that AMC is not causing the same ruckus, it's that everyone is already here... we know about AMC, it's just not as hyp-ey as GME was back then... we all got our brains ironed out wrinkle free already"

2021-06-04 05:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Because Adam Aron sells his own shares, does deals with the devil & gives you 🍿

Besides that it still has $10b in debt burden & no way to claw out of that beyond going into business with Wendie's to sub-contract the dumpster reach-around again to people who have reached the top tier of what is inhumanly possible and don't realise it because the cult has taken over your brain...that is all.

2021-06-04 06:02:46,wallstreetbets,Stop with the conspiracy shit you narrow minded moron. Bb was part of it from the beginning
2021-06-04 06:09:54,wallstreetbets,Just placed an order for more BB and am in AMC too so let’s go
2021-06-04 06:19:44,wallstreetbets,"So all in all, buy and hold?   But at what point is okay to sell if one want to consider that option? 

Currently holding AMC, BB, $CLNE."
2021-06-04 06:25:03,wallstreetbets,"That is weird when GME is still very much on? There is literally no talk of GME any more, and it‘s crazy considering it has always been the OG squeeze play. Low amount of shares, 140% short interest, a turnaround to e-commerce, Ryan Cohen and his dream team of executives etc. What did AMC do? They issued more and more shares. BB? It might be a good company in the long run but it never had a squeeze potential. WSB had been infiltrated by bots and bought out admins a long time ago."
2021-06-04 06:25:34,wallstreetbets,I fear a lot of people will get fucked over BB. Have a bad feeling
2021-06-04 06:32:51,wallstreetbets,Look at the age of most of the accounts spamming BB. Then look at what happens when a stock completely dominates the front page of WSB for a day or two.
2021-06-04 06:38:38,wallstreetbets,AMC is doomed. BB is actually a legit company. Undervalued and well managed with growth and profits.
2021-06-04 06:40:16,wallstreetbets,Divide and conquer.
2021-06-04 06:44:08,wallstreetbets,BB market bots

2021-06-04 07:07:34,wallstreetbets,Because BB is the truth and AMC is fraudulent you donkey
2021-06-04 07:10:23,wallstreetbets,It’s because you have hedge fund infiltrating these boards now.  They are spreading fud .
2021-06-04 07:11:14,wallstreetbets,"Same reason you see 10x posts for AMC vs the gamey stock, but one more level removed. Guess"
2021-06-04 07:14:51,wallstreetbets,Bc AMC already happened. BB is now...or it was...maybe everything is done now.
2021-06-04 07:36:29,wallstreetbets,Bb is actuallly a good company though
2021-06-04 07:53:41,wallstreetbets,"the answer is simple. 

BB is following the footsteps of AMC, and is gonna explode"

2021-06-04 08:15:24,wallstreetbets,It’s cheap
2021-06-04 08:19:16,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC is in borrowed time and has ran its course in my opinion.

Blackberry is not only a stock thats up and coming, but its got real value and its not a meme stock.

BB to the moon!"
2021-06-04 08:27:32,wallstreetbets,Why not triple BB and AMC And GameStop🙌💎🚀

2021-06-04 08:42:12,wallstreetbets,"As for the lack of new accounts, I’m pretty sure the GME fiasco was like a giant beacon summoning all the world most retarded retards.

2021-06-04 08:48:26,wallstreetbets,Why about GME? WSB is weird now
2021-06-04 08:53:18,wallstreetbets,"People want to buy the next cheap thing.  Amc already moved.  Would you rather pay $3 atm options on a $20 stock that hasn’t already moved or $10 for atm on something already up.

20% short interest isn’t even that much.  With 80% retail that means only 1/4 apes can even get a short to buy from them."
2021-06-04 08:56:43,wallstreetbets,Cause WSB SOLD OUT as usual. Always pushing a different narrative instead of the one that matters
2021-06-04 09:01:18,wallstreetbets,Hey dipshit. BB DDs were here way before you morons. AMC is literally a P&D when people saw what happened with GME. GME and BB were undervalued stocks.
2021-06-04 09:15:39,wallstreetbets,AMC is looking so good. This movement will redefine algorithmic trading and how stock evaluation has traditionally been done
2021-06-04 09:19:41,wallstreetbets,The stock is bb or bb.to ????
2021-06-04 09:19:56,wallstreetbets,"You think this sub has been infiltrated? My dude, It's been infiltrated since January."

2021-06-04 09:26:03,wallstreetbets,Just buy and hold both. Like holiday nuts.
2021-06-04 09:28:07,wallstreetbets,Shorts here posting like pretending to be apes?
2021-06-04 09:29:22,wallstreetbets,I had two discussion posts about AMC get deleted by the mods yesterday for no obvious reason.  I'm guessing they don't like AMC.

2021-06-04 10:46:13,wallstreetbets,If us investing can give BB more capital for R&D I think that alone is a good thing. Android and Iphone have had a hold on the market for far too long.
2021-06-04 10:48:31,wallstreetbets,You're soon gonna see a load of posts for CLNE lol. These memestocks move in cycles and will continue to do so
2021-06-04 11:15:44,wallstreetbets,There are a lot of Bag Holding retards that have been sitting on BB since January waiting for a spike.

2021-06-04 11:51:15,wallstreetbets,We do all know that Shitadel and Co are Long on AMC and BB right?
2021-06-04 12:31:20,wallstreetbets,BB was the play even before AMC and I think maybe GME. Back when even cramer was talking about pltr. Back in january when everything started happening I was kind of pissed people were talking about AMC out of nowhere instead of the play before that which was BB lol
2021-06-04 13:12:46,wallstreetbets,Its simple as market manipulators manipulating the markets. This is SHFs biggest FUD campaign of their careers and it's clear to see what lengths they'll go/ stoop to.
2021-06-04 13:19:22,wallstreetbets,"I just HODL
no brained ape"
2021-06-04 14:47:57,wallstreetbets,"Indeed there is a shift.  IDK I am holding onto AMC and just not selling since the short interest is still high, but its a risky hold.  I did buy into BB just 40 shares.  If it does something it does something, if not whatever.  I do view BB as a company that could be viable as a long term hold if need be.  I might just buy dips on BB for the next few weeks."
2021-06-04 15:45:59,wallstreetbets,"Yes very sad. Apes had short attention span :) but  it's also rent day, as well."
2021-06-04 16:11:13,wallstreetbets,Can I comment
2021-06-04 16:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Looks like I can. If rich greenfield can go on cnbc and say the stock is worth 1 cent, why can’t matt kohrs say it’s worth £500k without reprisal, this is a fkd up system. Like why did AA have to cover his offering by saying stock is risky, but other nefarious billionaires against the stock can make up any fud story they want. This is cannibal capitalism"
2021-06-04 16:33:01,wallstreetbets,Mods r gay
2021-06-04 17:03:04,wallstreetbets,Because BB isn’t a threat to HF like AMC so naturally suppression will happen for AMC and they’ll try to subtly push BB
2021-06-04 17:05:41,wallstreetbets,"Why are people dismissing GME like it isn’t the main squeeze play? Fundamentally it is way stronger than AMC even without the squeeze. It will pop for sure, but it won’t be comparable to the sleeping giant that is GME"
2021-06-04 17:31:16,wallstreetbets,Went real deep today. Can’t wait til next week. Go see some movies this weekend.
2021-06-04 17:37:31,wallstreetbets,The candle that burns brightest burns fastest. AMC got to hot to fast for a lot of people. The ones buying meme stocks are the ones looking for massive and quick gains. AMC is worth $24 billion. BB is $9 billion. I'm simply assuming most people throwing money at these stocks aren't diving into the financials. A quick roulette spin and BB has a bit more ease gaining. Also BB bagholders are still underwater while AMC is at all time highs. Bagholding is a bit more intense than cashing out at gains. They'd post more.
2021-06-04 17:38:22,wallstreetbets,NOK NOK Nokia is here!!

2021-06-03 20:08:55,wallstreetbets,Finally someone said it.
2021-06-04 01:12:07,wallstreetbets,Because AMC is trash that keeps diluting itself

2021-06-03 22:15:43,wallstreetbets,It's because the risk reward ratio for BB is much higher. AMC has already hit as high as it can go while BB is just getting started. A lot more room to run and a lot less room to fall if it sputters out. Who wants to risk AMC @ $60 to have it be worth $30 a few days later?
2021-06-03 22:16:32,wallstreetbets,"Because AMC is dead and buried. Cash out and move on, dude."
2021-06-03 22:23:29,wallstreetbets,Because AMC CEO abandoned everyone by selling more share which meant giving life boat to hedge funds
2021-06-03 22:26:28,wallstreetbets,"Bc you missed the moon shot you doomhauss. The next moon shot is BB, not AMC."
2021-06-03 22:29:23,wallstreetbets,"What’s the point in talking about a stock that’s up thousands of percent? Now isn’t the time to buy AMC; if you bought  low you’re already on the winner’s track and it’s just a matter of waiting until you see your profit point to exit (or take partial). If you didn’t buy in low, it’s not advisable to join in late. It could run up more, or you could get eaten up."
2021-06-03 22:38:53,wallstreetbets,"The problem is AMC is massively in debt and is now trying to use us to bail them out by throwing more shares out there, 20 mil from what I read, which will bomb the prices even more.  Wait, let it drop some more and then it will shoot."
2021-06-03 22:45:33,wallstreetbets,And why don't we see any post about the 31% $bbby short?
2021-06-03 23:05:30,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they are trying something new. Like make AMC moon (distraction), maybe BB will do the same, it raises and everyone jumps ship. Seriously, people’s attention span is about 1.5 seconds. Watch ANY show and watch how long any one scene lasts. About 2 seconds. WE HAVE BEEN PROGRAMMED"
2021-06-03 23:11:30,wallstreetbets,I noticed the same
2021-06-03 23:12:33,wallstreetbets,Didn’t amc just sell shares directly to a short hedge fund ? Lolllll gme is and has been the only play
2021-06-03 23:15:09,wallstreetbets,AMC pretty please
2021-06-04 00:11:39,wallstreetbets,Cause it’s ......![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|poop)
2021-06-04 00:27:39,wallstreetbets,And you guys make fun of Q Anon believers.
2021-06-04 00:28:18,wallstreetbets,Amc bb is fud crap to get peole from gme to sell lol. When will you clown get it already
2021-06-04 00:29:27,wallstreetbets,Somebody always holds the bag. Get some of your winnings off the table so you get to post some of that goodness.
2021-06-04 00:46:08,wallstreetbets,Why would you care if people had reasons to like a stock?
2021-06-04 00:48:03,wallstreetbets,WSB has been penetrated that’s where the elites came in  and started WSBE...for true autists....FUCK RULE 8
2021-06-04 00:54:44,wallstreetbets,Because you didn't sell at the top and now you're butthurt
2021-06-04 00:58:28,wallstreetbets,Bc this sub is compromised and pushing any distraction they can to keep ppl away from GME
2021-06-04 01:00:47,wallstreetbets,Just wondering if any of you knows what a BlackBerry phone looks like? Or how fun it was to text on? I bet ya don’t!!!!
2021-06-04 01:01:30,wallstreetbets,GME IS THE ONLY PLAY STFU
2021-06-04 01:22:01,wallstreetbets,"AMC is a distraction, BB is a distraction. GME is the only stock that matters."
2021-06-04 01:50:02,wallstreetbets,There is only one GME. AMC is BB and BB is AMC.
2021-06-04 02:51:44,wallstreetbets,imagine buying AMC when the CEO just lets a shf dump your shares and make them money kek
2021-06-04 05:42:53,wallstreetbets,"Mods unfairly remove the majority of posts before they leave 'new'.

During the GME craze I had a post with 4k+ upvoted get removed because ""it's not what people in the subreddit are looking for"". I was told to keep it to the discussion thread. 

Can we all now take a moment to let the mods know that we have 0% interest in posting within the shitty discussion thread? It is not a suitable place to post genuine topics for discussion."
2021-06-04 09:27:09,wallstreetbets,"GME and AMC are the girls you don't take home to mom, BB is the girl you put a ring on"
2021-06-04 09:36:20,wallstreetbets,"I mean... AMC already went 7x.  


What you're seeing is people who cashed out and moved on, AMC won't go 100x like GME, so the smart move was to take profits and reinvest in BB, but for some reason, half the people here are still expecting AMC to run, it's just stupid."
2021-06-04 11:34:11,wallstreetbets,"BB is destined to hit AT LEAST $50. Therefore, 💎🙌 until moon!"
2021-06-04 13:15:54,wallstreetbets,"Imagine thinking BB investors are bots lmaooo

That’s coming from someone who push GME hard in January"
2021-06-04 13:21:36,wallstreetbets,WHEN does BB go?!
2021-06-04 14:31:22,wallstreetbets,$BB has been always the shiet even before amc
2021-06-04 14:33:14,wallstreetbets,Dude bb has potential
2021-06-04 14:51:34,wallstreetbets,GME>BB>AMC
2021-06-04 15:19:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to sit on my shares of BB for now, not sure about AMC now since it seems like it will crash soon. I got my profits out of it anyway, right before I was banned as a day trader. Maybe if they look, they will see I'm a day loser."
2021-06-04 00:01:56,wallstreetbets,Nerd.
2021-06-04 11:09:43,wallstreetbets,Do you have friends irl?
2021-06-04 01:04:11,wallstreetbets,Fuck you.
2021-06-04 09:41:57,wallstreetbets,Oh shit you’re a mod now! Nice. I remember when I was admiring your flair just a few months ago
2021-06-04 02:17:51,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I tried several times, but I got deleted in no time. That bot kills all my posts. What am I doing wrong?"
2021-06-04 05:43:08,wallstreetbets,Also… he needs to settle down. Is that a rule?
2021-06-03 21:53:46,wallstreetbets,"Ah, you need to do what I did when I started, whatever brain tells you to do, make hand do the opposite. Make brain like computer. Stocks go down so you sad and want to sell? You buy. Stocks go up, make you happy, you want to put more money in because you’re making so much?You sell.   Banana!! 

Clearly I’m not an advisor. The risk tolerance with this is, far from sound."
2021-06-03 21:01:01,wallstreetbets,Bobby long?
2021-06-03 22:33:46,wallstreetbets,"I did that with GME the first time it went parabolic, sooooo theory checks out"
2021-06-03 22:51:15,wallstreetbets,Yeah gotta jump into a stock before everyone else is.  For example SPCE Virgin Galactic.  No one is talking about the Richard Branson flight ... yet.
2021-06-04 02:29:01,wallstreetbets,"Every time I sell a stock it skyrockets the next day so just a heads up I sold my AMC shares at COB June 3rd. 

Enjoy your goddamn profits you beautiful fucking humans."
2021-06-03 23:53:59,wallstreetbets,"Once I goes bearish, the stock will skyrocket. Thats the dilemma"
2021-06-04 01:08:31,wallstreetbets,"Have a plan and execute it. 

Don’t sell based on yer emotions"
2021-06-04 01:21:45,wallstreetbets,We’ve been banging on about AMC for 6 fucking months.. WSB logic at its finest
2021-06-04 02:04:49,wallstreetbets,This.
2021-06-04 02:18:45,wallstreetbets,"This is the only way I ever invest in AMC. I think its a shit company in the long run. I have no faith in their business model. I haven't heard of any plans to actually improve the core business, but its shorted to shit and apes own the float, so you know ill make some tendies while the gettins good."
2021-06-04 03:00:20,wallstreetbets,No logic. Just emotions. You fomoed cause you missed out on gains. Happens to all of us.
2021-06-04 06:39:10,wallstreetbets,"Never feel confident about any stock because it will randomly move up or down, based on all the players who participate in that market. When you stop putting emotions into your trading and accept whatever happens, as long as you have an edge that works, you will make money.

I am working on getting to that state, but sometimes the emotions take over and I make stupid decisions."
2021-06-04 08:00:52,wallstreetbets,Same same. I get bit almost every time or miss out because I made a frustrated decision and sold early. I want to throw a small amount at AMC right now and the only reason why I haven't is because those bites are a good reminder that you're (I'm) a retard and don't do that.
2021-06-04 09:05:20,wallstreetbets,U did all this?
2021-06-04 09:46:40,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’ve seen “I sold all my AMC for BB” in multiple posts here and YouTube. Going to be scary in the future when you can’t establish clearly it’s Hedgefund bots.
2021-06-04 10:06:55,wallstreetbets,my AMC gain post is being aggressively downvoted... it wont break 80. It's weird as hell.
2021-06-04 10:42:37,wallstreetbets,Lmao please pm ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)me so I can avoid anything you feel good about.
2021-06-04 17:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Did you always know you were a retard?
I recently became self aware, well about as self aware as a fucking rock."
2021-06-03 20:02:52,wallstreetbets,Yeah why are they censoring all of our shit?!
2021-06-03 22:15:28,wallstreetbets,NEWSFLASH: This sub got infiltrated months ago
2021-06-03 22:30:32,wallstreetbets,"Most replies are bots as well.

2021-06-03 21:03:10,wallstreetbets,"Yea WSB was compromised a long time ago. That's why all the apes left. This sub is a joke to most people holding AMC or GME. Might as well get out, and be sure to avoid using Robinhood unless you want to be unable to sell when shit goes down."
2021-06-04 00:56:19,wallstreetbets,Lol .. You dont think a company that lost 5 bil in a day cant buy out wsb mods for half that ?
2021-06-03 21:11:16,wallstreetbets,"Yep. There is a strange desire among traders to appear successful even if they aren't. I'm not sure why --- doesn't change the outcome. They can even fool themselves into thinking their ""analysis"" is working and it's all going to plan as their accounts evaporate."
2021-06-03 20:56:31,wallstreetbets,They delete most posts in a minute. We also don't want this sub to be about one stock.
2021-06-03 21:27:09,wallstreetbets,"Please link some deleted posts that didn't break the rules.

The vast majority of the posts all day have been getting wiped by VisualMod for stupid shit like posting shit with the totally wrong flair (if I see one more ""gain"" or ""yolo"" without a picture even attached at all Imma lose it) or for posting one line DD just saying shit like ""to the moon!""

The vast majority of all posts that are posted here get deleted because the vast majority are posted by people before they even read the rules.

Plus, people say this exact same shit about every single meme stock that comes through here now. GME, AMC, RKT, UWMC, SNDL. All of them. If you listened to people complaining about mods censoring stocks, you'd think there'd be nothing left at all."
2021-06-03 23:06:58,wallstreetbets,THE FEDGE IS AMONG US?????????????????????????????? F THE HEDGE
2021-06-04 17:42:20,wallstreetbets,Is this really happening???
2021-06-03 23:44:28,wallstreetbets,"That's a lot of accusation for someone who made 4 comments here in the past week.

We probably purge 75% of the posts that get submitted regardless of ticker.  More than half of the stuff I delete is strictly based off rule 8 which has hard tangible reasons. The rest of the stuff I purge is due to market manipulation issues.

There are a lot of new people here that don't bother reading the rules before they post. I delete so so many posts submitting a $20 gain off of $100 in shares.

You want to make up the conspiracy of the week then go for it. I at least expect the people on here to do their DD on the person posting. 4 comments here in a week? Does anyone here really believe you are dedicated enough to browse new all day and watch ""75% of AMC posts"" get deleted? Do you even look at them? Are you even familiar with the rules of the sub or automatic enforcement regarding static memes and discussion posts with no text?

Just because you don't understand how something works, doesn't mean the boogeyman you made up to explain it is real.

Quit your bullshit."
2021-06-03 22:10:29,wallstreetbets,"It goes both ways, i made a killing on puts and it was taken down. They’re just covering their buts."
2021-06-03 21:37:35,wallstreetbets,"> they are deleting 

Who is ""They""?"
2021-06-03 22:09:24,wallstreetbets,Do you think they shouldn't be? This sub can't be dedicated to ONLY ONE stock. 99% of the AMC posts are the same thing anyway.
2021-06-03 23:20:14,wallstreetbets,"They’re painting a picture I’d say lmao so much fucking black Berry nonsense the last few days alone / msm / Cramer / they’re trying to pin the tail on the donkey somehow. Like hello, it’s a good long term change around we found out months ago. Impressive, really"
2021-06-04 01:41:26,wallstreetbets,Cuz you’re a bunch of retards
2021-06-04 02:02:13,wallstreetbets,"Because wsb is owned by Shitadel and friends. Has been since after the January GME run.

Why do you think the media always credits this sub for AMC? Because they want new investors to flock here and then paperhand"
2021-06-04 07:04:36,wallstreetbets,I think most of you just dont know how to make a correct post on here. Automod is vicious
2021-06-04 07:19:09,wallstreetbets,Who is they?
2021-06-04 08:14:29,wallstreetbets,same with GME posts

2021-06-04 09:44:42,wallstreetbets,still good timing to buy AMC?
2021-06-03 23:57:37,wallstreetbets,This guy understands lol
2021-06-04 02:54:29,wallstreetbets,Agreed 🅱️🅱️
2021-06-03 23:23:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah exactly lmao. We want gains too bitches
2021-06-04 00:16:03,wallstreetbets,Same! BB ---> 🌙
2021-06-03 23:49:59,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding BB for a minute and the company has been making money, maybe not a lot. I have a little bit of AMC as well."
2021-06-03 23:32:53,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-06-04 00:48:50,wallstreetbets,"Also, because BB is an actual good company and QNS is in 23 of the 25 top EVs, whereas AMC is full of debt and struggles in a dying industry and their price is entirely propped up by short sellers(ironically).

In 2 years, BB will justify its current price. In 2 years, AMC may or may not actually go out of business.

I'm not biased at all because I own BB."
2021-06-04 01:36:22,wallstreetbets,"I am defused, amused, and guilty."
2021-06-03 23:39:14,wallstreetbets,Lmao you got that shit right
2021-06-04 08:15:52,wallstreetbets,I am not a bot!
2021-06-04 09:44:08,wallstreetbets,"Held BB bags for half a year, ofc we now post about it! Glad I got a quarter sold at 20 yesterday, saving the rest for the moon"
2021-06-03 23:53:12,wallstreetbets,I don’t know. This is the kind of thing a bot would say.
2021-06-04 05:32:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a bot, I love $BB, I spam it and I believe in it! It's not short term that's true"
2021-06-04 07:48:46,wallstreetbets,"We're unstoppable, we own 🚀's too"
2021-06-04 08:09:49,wallstreetbets,It’s true
2021-06-04 09:53:29,wallstreetbets,"As a BB holder, I don’t know why I own BB"
2021-06-04 10:17:20,wallstreetbets,Indeed. I like the stonk! BB🚀🌝
2021-06-04 11:24:19,wallstreetbets,THANK U
2021-06-04 12:35:47,wallstreetbets,"how else are people gonna know BB isn't a phone company, they can't even read."
2021-06-04 01:07:34,wallstreetbets,Yeah so do the GME and AMC holders. But their posts just get insta deleted.
2021-06-03 22:59:30,wallstreetbets,100% agree
2021-06-03 20:09:23,wallstreetbets,"This. I could never get behind AMC because I never believed in it. I was dumb not to make a momentum play, but it’s a falling knife if you don’t get in at the right time."
2021-06-03 21:31:43,wallstreetbets,This I have like 20 movie shares that I got as a joke with my original gme purchase and bb purchase in December. IV only added to 2 of those positions based on fundamentals. But I do believe amc will have a lil come back to life once the pandy is freed up and some good movies come out on theatre only.
2021-06-03 23:42:52,wallstreetbets,"Somewhat agreed.  GME is the OG with most support from community, BB has the least squeeze potential but it's one that the community kind of supports and also has good news on development (fundamentals).

AMC is somewhere in between in popularity, but doesn't have anything else.  The moment it hit over +100% I removed it from my watch list, telling myself that imma just treat it as ""squeeze completed""."
2021-06-03 20:11:08,wallstreetbets,"Let’s not forget a significant portion of AMC stock is still owned by the Wanda group, despite not being majority holder anymore, so WSB is making some suits in a China a lot of money this week.

I’m not saying people should pull out of amc, but be aware that there are people on the other side of the world that will love to cash out some shares and leave the apes holding the bag."
2021-06-03 22:14:57,wallstreetbets,"Same. Never high on AMC until now, but I jumped in to make some plays, of course"
2021-06-03 23:00:56,wallstreetbets,I day traded the shit out of AMC. Made like $300 just looking at charts and crayons while getting high. Work from home is amazing!!
2021-06-03 23:16:32,wallstreetbets,precisely. the business model isnt sustainable. unless they pivot for real like GME/BB
2021-06-04 06:33:00,wallstreetbets,"Sold yesterday and made some 250% on my 20 shares. More game money!

I got burned with gme and am still holding bags since january."
2021-06-04 01:09:03,wallstreetbets,"It’s a ducking distraction. Top posts in this sub about BB have mostly been from fucking obvious bots. They don’t even mix up the script, it’s the same damn thing every time."
2021-06-03 21:21:05,wallstreetbets,"I get that but I think you are wrong. I love them both AMC and GME but what is happening on AMC seems well prepared battle (what I mean is I always have some cash on the side for next dip, did not spent all my bullets). Most of the APES are psychologically ready. I suggest to you watch Adam Aron's interview. AA is ready for the battle and shows the path for the apes.

2021-06-03 23:11:14,wallstreetbets,"BB is also undervalued at its current price still so it's still attractive short and long term, the shorts are increasing their positions too."
2021-06-04 00:47:14,wallstreetbets,"i’m pretty bitter about this because way back in January, it was GME AMC and BB all being hyped up. I chose to put my money into BB because they seemed like they were the company that was ACTUALLY best positioned for long term growth. The other 2 stocks fucking SKYROCKETED and I missed out on a huge amount of money (which is fine). And now this post is kind of attacking us BB holders for finally trying to ride the hype train and smash the hype? That kind of hurts. I thought apes were strong together :("
2021-06-04 00:55:49,wallstreetbets,Idk why I had to scroll this far to find this. What’s wrong w this sub
2021-06-04 09:00:57,wallstreetbets,Just in case you mean Blackberry
2021-06-04 00:11:13,wallstreetbets,I think that's what he's saying

2021-06-03 23:29:57,wallstreetbets,I thought the distraction was silver?
2021-06-03 23:44:19,wallstreetbets,BB stands for Blastoff for Bonzos
2021-06-04 11:55:10,wallstreetbets,Exactly. They can’t divide and conquer if we don’t start getting overly paranoid like there’s not 11 million degenerates here. Not including people who are subscribed but lurk everyday
2021-06-04 15:50:01,wallstreetbets,A true tard huh
2021-06-04 11:14:08,wallstreetbets,No I’ve noticed it too no ones wants to mention amc

2021-06-03 22:45:18,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for saying that, BB got left in the dust and we're finally back. It really was the OG second option and musk, portnoy, all those fucking idiots talked about literally every stock besides it and us BB bagholders got fucked"
2021-06-03 21:28:08,wallstreetbets,If we’re being honest $BBBY was the 2nd option to $GME. It was the 2nd most shorted stock leading up to January and followed GMEs movement since last year around summer to a tee but very few people played it
2021-06-04 03:53:59,wallstreetbets,The float of BB is too big. GME is the way.
2021-06-03 21:12:32,wallstreetbets,"Yeah idk what people are talking about. BB apes were ALWAYS HERE we just had nothing to talk about other than moan about how it dips constantly whenever there's GOOD news.

No shit we all come out of  the woodworks when it suddenly spiked."
2021-06-03 20:04:52,wallstreetbets,"We knew the dilution was coming, it was announced in April.

The company needs to raise money right now, and mgmt is making the right choice."
2021-06-03 22:32:40,wallstreetbets,I hope so. I bought in at 40 and am planning to sell tomorrow.
2021-06-04 00:56:41,wallstreetbets,The same AMC people who were spamming during GME’s saga and claiming they are not bots are now accusing the BB people of doing the same
2021-06-03 23:46:21,wallstreetbets,"Well played in that case, you can see the matrix $BB 🚀🛸🛰"
2021-06-03 23:36:47,wallstreetbets,"DFV has a motive he realized, which was getting all you GME folks to raise the price of his massive shares. He had huge influence over GME’s price... I got in and right out with a profit. BB, I believe in their actual future (like GME honestly, but GME is far overvalued for that potential future)"
2021-06-04 00:15:14,wallstreetbets,This is it for me. I came along only a few days ago and AMC was already at 50. I bought a few but sucks thinking I missed out on it for cheaper. Now with BB coming up I was able to get in before it hopefully blows up. Bought 4k of it.
2021-06-04 05:00:25,wallstreetbets,NOK was/is definitely the middle child
2021-06-04 05:49:59,wallstreetbets,"dude, SLV, I 'memba! worst FUD attempt so far. Nobody bought."
2021-06-03 21:47:09,wallstreetbets,This long term bag holder jumped out with both feet soon as it hit $57 this AM. I started to regret and almost FOMOD back in when it started to crawl back up but I resisted lol. The shit is at $47 now. I don’t trust the management at all and that’s the biggest reason I hopped out.
2021-06-03 20:53:58,wallstreetbets,"Agreed hardly any posts very unusual,
AMC is just starting to be fun.
The squeeze can happen if your here for a few dollars fine but I will let it ride."
2021-06-04 11:13:18,wallstreetbets,"Bro, exactly this.

BB doesn't even have the same amount of short interest as AMC or GME.  There is little to no risk for the hedge funds of a BB squeeze if they can get people to move to BB.

Getting people to exit their positions from AMC or GME, stocks which people have been pumping money into for weeks and months, would definitely help mitigate hedge fund losses when either of those two DO squeeze."
2021-06-03 22:00:57,wallstreetbets,"I sold at 12,000% lmao. Well most, kept some for the memories."
2021-06-04 02:13:52,wallstreetbets,"I remember when GME ran up the first time. You had AMC, BB, and NOK as the others listed. AMC was another squeeze, but the DD on BB and NOK was a long term play. I see BB going up I'm 1-2 years. I don't understand why it is rising with AMC and GME."
2021-06-03 23:27:33,wallstreetbets,Ding ding
2021-06-04 05:45:20,wallstreetbets,In January all the posts were saying that AMC was the distraction

2021-06-03 21:36:02,wallstreetbets,Because this isn’t r/AMC we don’t need 500 posts a day repeating the exact same thing.
2021-06-04 06:18:02,wallstreetbets,"Because the idiots dont follow the rules when it comes to posting. Period. 

It has nothing to do with censorship and everything to do with dumbasses who cant read the rules, who then violate the rules, and cry about it being some conspiracy theory."

2021-06-04 04:34:08,wallstreetbets,If you notice the media pushes this sub hard af. It’s all an elaborate set up to gain control of dumb tourists new to gme amc

2021-06-04 07:16:52,wallstreetbets,Where do we go now? I am down to leave. These mods suck fat dick. I want freedom.

2021-06-04 16:39:16,wallstreetbets,"Good, maybe now the upvote circle jerk of spam will be over with. Repeating the same tired jokes in every thread with no readable content and fake DD to lure bag holders isn’t something I want to read."

2021-06-03 21:07:47,wallstreetbets,this comment is the way. even motley fool sad BB was undervalued and has pushed it as a buy because they make product that doesn't suck.

Also many of the US film producers have been bought by streaming platforms leading to a stronger trend of watching things at home in the future years, you either need a genious idea or a second miracle after this one to adjust the business with the times"

Still im no one to tell you guys what to do so just prove me wrong and stick the middle finger to us too but somehow i still got a worse feeling on AMC than on other meme stocks and i think it relates to being only a short term play in my head."

It could be amc (which I think everyone should be holding) and it could be BB (which is also a good play) but to think someone is signing on here to change the direction we’re heading in is bullshit. we just like the Stonks."
2021-06-04 03:45:50,wallstreetbets,">There is definitely something up, you included. Autist wasnt used in that way before the 9mil extras joined WSB, it wouldve been retards. Autists were the wrinkle brained, retards are the smooth brains.

It's a tragedy that of this sub's 10 Million members 95-97% is clearly half people who came from the rest of Reddit and the other half who came from Twitter after seeing a meme stock trending and went ""someone making money?? ooh i'll join"". I'm no WSB member and before this year i didn't even know how stocks work, but pre-2021 i'd visited here at least once, and it was people posting big red numbers, i'd go ""wtf why are these guys cheering about losing money"" then leave lol.

But i hate to see culture die and a sub devolve into video meme-crap spam and no serious discussion, it's majorly a normie hotspot, post replies are all ""(ape/rocket/diamond/hand emoji)"" and ""to the moon!!"" and literally nothing else, it's mindnumbing, same thing with replies to an Elon Musk tweet and trying to find one that isn't garbage/meme/spam/bot/loser asking for money. 

""Wallstreetbets: Like 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal"" is gone, should be called Meme Stocks or something, since any who came from 4chan are certainly outnumbered by normies who probably don't even know that what that is or what being an autist means."

2021-06-03 23:27:22,wallstreetbets,maybe if we start our own cult people would respect us more...
2021-06-03 22:00:40,wallstreetbets,"AMC ape: it's not about the fundamentals, it's about the squeeze!

AMC ape after share dilution: yeah, but it's good for the fundamentals!

I swear, any news is good news to an AMC ape, no criticism is allowed and nothing bad ever happens."
2021-06-03 20:10:26,wallstreetbets,"I agree, they have to pay debt or there will be no company.  I am holding."

2021-06-03 21:29:19,wallstreetbets,Our brains cuz we were there when it happened
2021-06-03 20:39:17,wallstreetbets,Search the sub that far back if you want. Why do you think so many people went off and made their own subs to not get bought off.
2021-06-03 22:25:22,wallstreetbets,"I get that, but I’m referring to BB bags"
2021-06-04 00:38:13,wallstreetbets,"I bought AMC during the first run when it was $4.50, it shot up to $25 the next morning in pre-market. It was 400% gains with a $20,000 profit. I didn’t sell because I thought it would go even higher and I wanted house money not a cheap car money. Regrets."
2021-06-03 21:17:34,wallstreetbets,I get that we're on WSB but 4% up is pretty good. We can't be expecting 400% everyday lol.
2021-06-04 05:58:39,wallstreetbets,"I remember.  Okay, let me rephrase.  BB maybe ahead of it's time, maybe it has legs.  That's a good point."
2021-06-04 06:35:13,wallstreetbets,"I actually want to say one more thing: I got off WSB and joined the AMC sub specifically because of wsb hyper lameness EVERYTHING GME.  And now I'm doing it!  Lol.  Listen, I apologize!  BB might be good.  Let's not fracture into groups again.  Pick your target.  Build your support.  And help the other communities!  This is the fucking way RIGHT HERE"

2021-06-04 02:25:39,wallstreetbets,I think its the bot deleting mine. What can I do?
2021-06-03 23:31:01,wallstreetbets,but im always high
2021-06-03 23:54:53,wallstreetbets,"Oh crap, I had it backwards. I was doing pretty well selling low and buying high."
2021-06-03 23:22:07,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m with you now. My ape brain couldn’t understand red at first though.
2021-06-04 00:00:39,wallstreetbets,No sir you have it backtards
2021-06-04 00:08:36,wallstreetbets,"buy low, get high."

2021-06-04 03:44:16,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought more at high!"

2021-06-03 23:10:31,wallstreetbets,"So, truth be told, it was the start of a functional strategy for me. That, with some written rules that I follow, and we’re gravy now. You don’t want to do it blindly, and pour money into a loser, but assuming you DD’d correctly then the more you look at lower prices as sales of you favorite stock vs bad choices and loses, the more you actually start putting emotions aside. Anyways, that’s way too long of an answer for WSB…so…YOLO calls and stuff I think. Leave em uncovered too. For bonus points, don’t hedge lol."
2021-06-04 08:24:20,wallstreetbets,Extra bananas for you!
2021-06-04 11:00:35,wallstreetbets,I'm buying.
2021-06-03 23:45:02,wallstreetbets,"Yea, what he said!"
2021-06-04 03:48:22,wallstreetbets,Yep. I literally browse this sub so I know exactly what the opposite of what i should be doing is. Any negative sentiment towards the stocks I own here is literally confirmation bias for me lol.
2021-06-04 01:59:35,wallstreetbets,For real. This sub was awesome way back like last year. After the gme run it just got filled with bots PnD
2021-06-03 23:51:20,wallstreetbets,That and people just trying to push *their* meme stock to be the top meme with every single post
2021-06-04 07:59:32,wallstreetbets,SO how come they're letting the BB street bots run wild?
2021-06-04 04:31:24,wallstreetbets,"When gme took off and a movie was on the table, the old mods came back. More than likely sold out and gave control of the sub over."
2021-06-04 10:52:41,wallstreetbets,Amen... WSB wall street bots
2021-06-04 13:45:56,wallstreetbets,"We need a new WSB, a la wild wild west style."
2021-06-04 19:37:55,wallstreetbets,Damn this hits close to home. Sad but true.
2021-06-04 01:24:17,wallstreetbets,I concur.. beep boop
2021-06-04 10:13:25,wallstreetbets,Or maybe guys on WSB are sick of seeing the same stupid post over and over again about a shitty pump and dump stock that won't squeeze.
2021-06-04 00:17:00,wallstreetbets,"yeah my post on GME from early december got voted down after like 20 minutes, theyve been attacking posts for a while"
2021-06-04 07:34:02,wallstreetbets,Some of you legitimately sound mentally ill.
2021-06-04 11:44:49,wallstreetbets,"As an actual smooth brained noob, what are other good subs?"
2021-06-03 20:37:47,wallstreetbets,"Damn, even zjz & watercup?"
2021-06-03 23:52:18,wallstreetbets,People really come into the comments here and just start shouting accusations at everything and everyone whether something good or bad happens lmaooo
2021-06-04 03:09:42,wallstreetbets,obv mods are getting paid more than any PL they make in the market.
2021-06-03 23:21:45,wallstreetbets,Confirmed. Mods are gay and cucked.
2021-06-03 22:12:44,wallstreetbets,Dis iz dah whey.
2021-06-03 21:39:20,wallstreetbets,then why are there 30x BB posts on the home page...
2021-06-04 01:07:16,wallstreetbets,Great! I just got into cars because of you. Thanks for the new expensive hobby
2021-06-03 21:59:20,wallstreetbets,"Okay tell that to $BB, and what about all the GME hype earlier this year? You just hate the stock."
2021-06-04 08:44:53,wallstreetbets,No my gain porn was blocked for no reseon.
2021-06-04 03:08:09,wallstreetbets,bop beep
2021-06-04 10:23:43,wallstreetbets,There’s an explanation to all of it; and honestly I feel like you’ll notice most of the replies on the daily thread follow the template
2021-06-03 22:27:39,wallstreetbets,It's never coming back
2021-06-04 09:54:54,wallstreetbets,I wish. But this sub is dead. Flooded with a bunch of peasant communists who jizzed their pants over their only chance to 'get rich' and now think they're part of some social movement. It's a disgrace
2021-06-03 23:54:01,wallstreetbets,I don't think you can have one company that's owned 80% by retail investors and have this sub back to the way it was.
2021-06-03 22:36:42,wallstreetbets,"I see where you're coming from. But BB is caught up in the same shit at AMC and GME, aggressive short selling by big money. If you're going long on BB, you're in the same boat as anyone long on the stocks you don't want to see in WSB. One difference is BB doesn't have the same squeeze potential, if that's your play."
2021-06-04 09:14:55,wallstreetbets,AMD OOM calls again? VOO?
2021-06-03 22:32:39,wallstreetbets,"In the eyes of the media, BB is a memestock. 

BB, GME, AMC, BBBY, KOSS, EXPR... the list goes on. ""Memestock"" is media speak for ""stocks with heavy institutional short positions"". But they won't come out and say it. Instead they try to smear the stock and the people who hold it. If you think WSB and BB are any different from the other subreddits and their memestocks, you're kidding yourself. 

I know this sounds dramatic to say, but I believe there's a class war happening right now, and it's happening in the stock market."
2021-06-03 23:04:59,wallstreetbets,I hardly see any gme posts on here anymore
2021-06-03 23:13:15,wallstreetbets,Facts

2021-06-04 07:44:15,wallstreetbets,The victim complex is out of control.
2021-06-03 21:42:19,wallstreetbets,"You can keep links to deleted posts. How can you expect anybody to believe you or verify if you don't actually have any examples? Like, what do you want to happen?"
2021-06-04 10:41:10,wallstreetbets,That one was auto-removed by visualmod. Let me see what's up with it.
2021-06-03 22:17:56,wallstreetbets,"Right now? Yeah, probably. People said these exact same things a few days ago when AMC posts overtook GME posts.

It's the circle of ~~life~~ memestocks"
2021-06-04 07:28:54,wallstreetbets,does this explain it? https://preview.redd.it/cssaht2sd6371.jpg?width=1024&auto=webp&s=da734c69117ba6f4435708a32e462ada15e5af77

2021-06-03 21:59:11,wallstreetbets,Very convincing.
2021-06-04 00:24:59,wallstreetbets,">That's a lot of accusation

Accusation is singular in my comment. Your powers of observation continue to be demonstrated."
2021-06-03 20:26:21,wallstreetbets,"Because it generates more shares that were accounted for already to start a squeeze. Basically, if retail owns 80% of the shares, then they throw 50million into the market, well then the percentage we own at that time drops quite a lot and then HF’s can cover.

This is why I sold amc at a small loss and don’t regret it too much and it’s because I didn’t trust the ceo as it seemed he was trying to dilute shares every chance he got. Which is exactly what he is trying to do."
2021-06-03 20:20:33,wallstreetbets,It certainly makes it much more difficult to gamma or short squeeze!
2021-06-03 20:42:46,wallstreetbets,The CEO has said many things that turned out to be lies so far.  Didn't he just say 2 weeks ago he wouldn't dillute anymore? I on the other hand bring you SEC filings which are facts.
2021-06-03 20:54:56,wallstreetbets,Cmon even you have at least one wrinkle up there?
2021-06-04 00:30:11,wallstreetbets,i do own it :D
2021-06-04 08:17:11,wallstreetbets,✌ I am not a crook! ✌
2021-06-03 22:15:36,wallstreetbets,And what’s wrong with a thumb typing phone???
2021-06-03 22:53:24,wallstreetbets,Doesn't BB have a price target of $5?
2021-06-04 02:58:26,wallstreetbets,"Plot twist, it’s 1 mill Vietnamese Dong."
2021-06-04 00:26:16,wallstreetbets,everybody starts somewhere
2021-06-04 02:50:38,wallstreetbets,He started with two million.
2021-06-04 09:29:41,wallstreetbets,One day your portfolio will become a mill :) I have faith!
2021-06-04 03:19:38,wallstreetbets,Them beans is magic though
2021-06-03 23:32:27,wallstreetbets,"BB10 is QNX and it was the best mobile operating system and the most feature filled out of the box. App developers can't justify spending on development for a new OS unless they know they can make returns from the user base. But it couldn't build a user base without app developers, death cycle."
2021-06-03 20:54:42,wallstreetbets,"$PLTR brought in $1.1B of revenue and is currently valued at $45B. That's a 41:1 P/S ratio. Although PLTR has interesting technology and potential to capture lots of lucrative govt contracts, the company is quite overvalued when considering current stock price. That's my personal take."
2021-06-04 02:21:07,wallstreetbets,Oh I agree... But they will have a squueze most likely a solid resurgence in this next year and probably another after. They will also adopt the old movie approach. I would kill to go see saving private Ryan on a big screen.
2021-06-04 00:18:16,wallstreetbets,"I…didn’t know that, thank you. 

I wonder what drove them to that move, is it truly because of their debts, or, if one were paranoid, was that part of something bigger."
2021-06-03 21:39:43,wallstreetbets,I guess time will tell :)
2021-06-03 23:00:20,wallstreetbets,"Lol sure thing. I was just sent that as a CEO's interview to make a point, I feel like there is misunderstanding on management and IMO they are doing great. Not trying to convince anyone LMAO.Play responsibly its a casino."
2021-06-04 00:54:49,wallstreetbets,"Really depends. If they get QNX into all EVs in the future like they’re promising, the outer reaches of the Milky Way is the limit. 

Realistically they’re ahead of the competition but EVs are only expected to boom in 2030 so BB really needs to get themselves firmly positioned with companies by then. It’s a pretty long term play tbf

I know they have other tech but right now most DD I see covers QNX"
2021-06-04 01:15:16,wallstreetbets,"I can't really say because I'm personally holding for a good 5-10 years and the market is a bit choppy at the moment. If you compare other security software's though, it sort of speaks for itself, there are companies valued WAY more than BB which are underperforming in comparison, BB is building momentum on their products during this turnaround, eventually their revenue will pick up quite a bit because of how solid and trusted their security is. A lot of people are waiting for IVY and a few of their other brand new products to show revenue growth, but it's hard to time the market so that's why I prefer to buy low and hold."
2021-06-04 05:03:37,wallstreetbets,"BB went from like $10 to $25 to $10 overnight. GME at least lasted a few weeks and never really died, while AMC at least took a few weeks to get back to around $5 before quickly rebounding.  

I agree with u/Youaresuperneat. BB was the least memey of the meme stocks. That might have been its downfall. It wasn't just some nostalgic piece of shit stock like AMC that has no real future and nothing but a corrupt and shitty CEO. It's a real company in an amazing industry, so it just wasn't memey enough to hang with the big boys."
2021-06-04 02:24:07,wallstreetbets,GameStop has a solid business plan though. Specially with top quality management and a cult willing to buy from them like crazy
2021-06-04 02:06:42,wallstreetbets,"it isnt being shorted the same, it literally cant move the same"
2021-06-04 12:40:20,wallstreetbets,Also valid! Good point
2021-06-03 22:10:50,wallstreetbets,Because it already went from $5 to $450... amc only went to $72 so by comparison gme is already way bigger
2021-06-03 21:41:49,wallstreetbets,"larp mostly

edit:
@me in 1 month when nothing happens. 
also, anyone using their crystal ball and stating arbitrary made up imaginary time frames is a snake oil salesman trying to sell you their bags."
2021-06-03 20:13:07,wallstreetbets,"Yup, which is why we need to be smarter. This AMC situation is tricky though, and the CEO is doing retail no favors right now."
2021-06-03 20:34:50,wallstreetbets,I only invest money I'm willing to lose. Once again i hold both don't care if they go to zero but when they moon I'll be glad i didn't sell on earth
2021-06-03 21:54:40,wallstreetbets,$BBBY was shorted over 40% of float going into Jan. It was around $20 at the time
2021-06-03 20:07:04,wallstreetbets,"I’m posting one in an hour, I can DM to you."
2021-06-04 00:19:46,wallstreetbets,"The DD is that movie theater attendance has been shrinking constantly for the past 10 years, so AMC will continue to show declining sales and higher debt. The CEO will also continue to create new shares and dilute existing shareholders. This will render the stock worthless in the future. But we live in a world where a worthless piece of code is priced at $1 trillion dollars, so I guess AMC could also reach the same valuation."
2021-06-03 20:26:19,wallstreetbets,"\~80% of the shares are owned by retail. 20% shorted. Economy is bouncing back like wildfire, people are going back to theaters, theres future applications to theaters: Virtual Reality, immersive experiences etc. Many other theaters went out of business, AMC is now more likely to be the theater of choice for others."
2021-06-03 20:39:52,wallstreetbets,None. Every single sign is pointing to it about to fucking tank.
2021-06-03 22:49:48,wallstreetbets,They transitioned to software a decade ago and went all in on cyber security 5 years ago. Since then they have laid off 75% of their employees made a string of bad acquisitions. They'll never be a major player in the field.
2021-06-04 05:19:17,wallstreetbets,"I work in cybersecurity and it already IS a massive industry and RAPIDLY growing. Last I checked, there were > 1 million open job opportunities.  

Facebook reached out to me a few years ago about job interviews and they said that they had 30+ open slots for Application Security Engineer, 30+ open slots for Security Engineer, 10-20+ slots for some other shit I forget like Security Analyst, and were newly (at the time) creating their Security Red Team.  

That's like 100+ open positions, all paying 200k+ per year, and do not cover all of the domains of cybersecurity that they are hiring (just the ones they thought might apply to me based on my resume).  

Long story short: there are MILLIONS of open cybersecurity jobs. Its perceived importance is GROWING YoY. You make 300k/year after about 10 years in the industry. You make 500k+/year after 15 years in the industry. It is an explosive industry and every company involved in it has thick ass margins."
2021-06-04 02:59:48,wallstreetbets,"BB is the way, don’t let all the negative comments change that 🦍attitude"
2021-06-03 22:03:30,wallstreetbets,I don’t believe in a squeeze. I’m fundamentals all the way tbh.
2021-06-03 20:13:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly! I don’t get why people complain about dilution. Do you want the company to just... not company?

This is good for $AMC."
2021-06-03 23:51:01,wallstreetbets,Eh. It's getting kinda old. Thought I'd mix it up this time.
2021-06-03 23:10:13,wallstreetbets,Thank you very much
2021-06-03 21:25:01,wallstreetbets,How long have you been on WSBs the you don't recognize the current mods?

2021-06-04 10:01:34,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but it is a bit rewarding sometimes to be able to help the community thrive and hang out with other mods.  I tried to leave a week and a bit ago to focus on my life but came back because it’s hard to see your people struggling when there’s something you can do to help"

2021-06-04 02:16:16,wallstreetbets,Doing better than some of us.... LOL.
2021-06-04 02:35:01,wallstreetbets,"So with the post you made, the bot did kill it and recognized it as spam. It was correct on several levels. The post was not a TA post. We usually want to see some chart work on TA posts.

In this case it likely would have been removed manually and a temp ban issued had the bot not touched it. This is due to what you said toward the end of the post. Attempting to influence the price of a security to induce the buying or selling of the security by another is market manipulation.

Section 9.2 of the SEC act of 1934 talks about this. It's textbook market manipulation."
2021-06-04 02:31:53,wallstreetbets,Suck the bots dick.
2021-06-03 23:51:09,wallstreetbets,But low sell high. Get high lol
2021-06-03 23:47:30,wallstreetbets,You can be high while looking for lows to turn into highs so that you can turn those into more highs while making you higher to keep finding more highs. Boom.
2021-06-04 00:05:53,wallstreetbets,Stick to r/weedstocks then

2021-06-03 21:20:32,wallstreetbets,"AMC CEO is playing retail investors like a fiddle lmao. I remember reading an article a few days ago about how he’s so enthusiastic about retail, and how he even joined Twitter to interact with them, was affectionately nicknamed “Silverback”, even giving out free popcorn to investors!!! ....And then he turns around and drops 10M+ new shares on the market (TWICE) as soon as the price starts to jump. 

The only reason he gives a shit about retail (or at least pretends to) is that he recognizes they’re the only reason the company is still alive. He doesn’t *care* about the people trying to destroy shorts, he just recognizes how easily he can milk them.

Edit: [they’re thinking of issuing ANOTHER 25 MILLION SHARES.](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/amc-looks-issue-25-million-232035401.html) It’s like the CEO is actively trying to avoid a short squeeze."
2021-06-03 20:32:04,wallstreetbets,Yep.  AMC is capitalizing to the fullest.  Large share dilution and CEO got a huge pay bonus.  GME minimized their initial amount of shares to add and capitalized to pay off their debt and help the transformation to an online gaming powerhouse. Legendary CEO Ryan Cohen is not taking any pay and is leading the way to transform GME.  What exactly is AMC doing?
2021-06-04 01:01:55,wallstreetbets,"Hell, I'm actually investing in gme. C-execs are getting paid in stock rather than actual cash and they're actively trying to overhaul the executives and business. Also helps that gme is in an industry that seems to be growing exponentially. Tbh the IV is fun and nice for theta gainz but I'm actually seeing gme as an investment opportunity. But that's just me"

2021-06-04 05:14:04,wallstreetbets,"> a worthless piece of code is priced at $1 trillion dollars, so I guess AMC could also reach the same valuation.

Not really. The worthless piece of code represents freedom to many.  

Whether you think it's all bullshit and will never happen, don't forget what people are willing to do for the belief of choice and freedom.  

AMC is nothing but an illusion of rebellion. It's decent, but not as tempting as the appearance of freedom.  

These two aren't comparable."
2021-06-03 21:00:21,wallstreetbets,"Black berry made deals with the following companies:

AWS

Volvo heavy vehicles

Audi, BMW, Ford, GM, Honda, Hyundai, Jaguar Land Rover, KIA, Maserati, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, Toyota, and Volkswagen

Something like 70% of the EV market by volume is currently using QNX and with the AWS and Baidu partnerships this definitely isn't going down.

BB is positioned to profit massively from the EV revolution happening across the major manufacturers."

Most people can see that as of right now, AMC is moving purely due to retail hype, with a CEO that’s happy to dilute and make retail hold the bag for his stock."
2021-06-03 20:29:59,wallstreetbets,"Because these apes pretend to know what the fuck they're talking about when most of them don't. Also, all these same apes acting like one multi-multi-million dollar company is more ""trustworthy"" than the other is a joke."

2021-06-03 20:39:34,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Completely different animals. I’m not a gay bear and I’m not Anti AMC. AMC was/is a squeeze play. Stock get shorted, options become cheap, then goes up, shorts cover and reshort or new bears short. Stock goes down, and let the process repeat. Is amc bringing in new leadership like GME? No. They are offering free popcorn to retail traders because their money prevented amc bankruptcy- or more so, delayed it for a few years. Unless there is a major change in AMC or they become a monopoly in cinema they will continue to be on the decline because streaming services are fucking them in the ass without lube. GME is fundamentally changing. AMC hasn’t clearly done this yet. In all reality they are turning the company into a penny stock long term unless they can change their business model or make some big acquisitions to have more control"

2021-06-04 07:57:48,wallstreetbets,"Back when BB was called RIM and Jim Balsillie and Mike Lazardis were running the company, they let WAY too many (AT&T) telecom execs into the company.  Blackberry had a window, but like everyone else, missed it with bad decisions like the fruity Blackberry Pearl that tried to be everything to everyone.

Damn shame, because the Z30 and Passport were incredible Android phones.  But by then, it was too late. I agree with you that the lion was loose by this point.  Some of that the fault of BB, most of that the changing winds.  As you said, if Microsoft couldn't pull it off, then this wasn't the easiest of tasks.

The Cylance acquisition is so-so.  Cylance wasn't the greatest company to begin with, but they had a serviceable platform and a very good consulting arm.  If BB focuses on secure platforms, beefs up their consulting and services arm to really focus on Fed/Govt/G2000, and bug-hunting, then the security division has a shot. But that space is like a shotgun fight in a closet.  You can't half-ass and dip your toe in the water.  Either all-in or all-out."

2021-06-04 01:10:52,wallstreetbets,"And he's going to sell them directly to the hedgiies per the sec filing that states that option, once again to screw retail investors.  AMC mgmt deserves every single AMC holder to sell tomorrow and let them sleep in the bed they made for themselves."
2021-06-04 01:39:48,wallstreetbets,"I don't think /r/WSB understands what ""investing"" really means. The shares you buy on the market are *meant to go up*, but the company doesn't make any money from that *unless they sell shares*.

If you believe in the company long-term, you should be happy they are raising capital because you trust that they are using the money to improve the company, and therefore its valuation and hence stonk go up. Try not to become a bagholder on GME or AMC if you're not an investor. If you're in this to make money, you have better chances making money in the long term."
2021-06-03 21:41:14,wallstreetbets,"I could be mistaken, and I’m honestly a bit too lazy to dig (although if you really don’t believe me, and won’t look it up yourself, I will dig) but I’m 99% sure he already lined his pockets with a share offering earlier in the year. I remember there was a lot of controversy about him getting a multi-million dollar bonus “because of the pandemic” or some other nonsense. 

So yeah, he’s already has his pay day. And sure, *now* he’s bolstering the company’s balance sheet. But he’s actively pushing against the grain for a short squeeze. All this liquidation (and the popcorn offer lol) only helps long-term investors. Which is likely a very, very small minority of AMC retail holders."
2021-06-03 21:46:31,wallstreetbets,">I think the better way to put it is that AA is focusing on the strength of the company, and not a short squeeze.

I’d also like to point out that this isn’t mutually exclusive from taking advantage of retail investors who are (obviously) only buying shares in the hopes of a short squeeze. Because really, the fundamentals of a company don’t matter in a short squeeze. And he has to know that a vast majority of retail is only buying in the hopes of a short squeeze. 

He’s pretending to be retail’s best bud, but he’s also knowingly doing things that are entirely against the interests of a majority of retail shareholders."
2021-06-03 21:41:17,wallstreetbets,What have they actually been doing with the money though? I fully expect their Senior management to just be raising these funds to get themselves fat bonuses for the rest of the year while the actual company gets fucked.

2021-06-03 21:47:44,wallstreetbets,"Do you genuinely not know basic economics? I said ""If demand remains the same and supply increases, price goes down."" Ofcourse if demand increases while more shares are added, then the market cap goes up. 

To put it simple: In a city of 100 people, where everybody eats 1 bread every day, a total of 100 breads are made by one baker every day. They sell for $1 a piece. 

A second person in this town watches this and says 'Wow, $100 every day, I want that too!' So he also starts selling 100 breads every day. Logically the price of bread will start falling. Demand remains the same, while supply has risen. Price will fall until the 'invisible hand' has found the new market price. Maybe when the price has fallen enough, people will decide to eat 2 breads per day, because it has become so cheap compared to other food. 

This is very simplified, and in reality food like bread is sort of a special case, but you understand the principle? Right?!

The same applies to stocks. Issuing more shares does not automatically increase market cap. It does not automatically decrease market cap either. But when supply increases while demand remains the same, the price per product will fall. 

Anybody who downvoted me has no more than 3 active brain cells in their head."
2021-06-03 20:05:13,wallstreetbets,"The only thing that “crashes” market cap is the stock price declining if the number of shares stays the same.

Market cap is strictly the value of the company based on its number of shares and its price for each one of  those shares.

That’s why when a company does a stock split, the shares and share price are split to the exact same extent. Same with a ruction in shares through a reverse split. You do a reverse split. Go from 100 shares to 50 and the stock price will double to accommodate.  (Just an example) the part which makes the market cap change is the share price moving from events like this bringing in new buyers to inflate the stocks price"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Amateur DD on American Airlines (AAL) Ok,  first time doing DD for public consumption so, be gentle with me, I  want my first time to be special. I expect cuddling afterward too.

First, the general vibe of airlines these days broken into different segments:

Leisure  Travel is up to pre-pandemic levels which is great. Most people in the  US book holiday travel for Thanksgiving/Christmas in the late summer  (around Labor Day). To me, this means there’s probably another bump  coming in a few months, especially for those who chose not to see family  during last year’s holidays.

TSA  reported almost 2M passengers screened on May 28 2021, the most since  March 7 2020. You can see the lovely chart below that shows the gap  closing in the difference between 2019 and 2021 screenings.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/6prqdlj2e4371.png?width=1440&format=png&auto=webp&s=2468a9ccd08b709e3ebc3cf74633b741b1690dca

There  seems to be room to run in that this is all great for domestic  bookings, but European travel from the US is still way down as  restrictions are still in place. BUT, website data has shown countries  that have eased restrictions (Iceland, Greece, Italy, Croatia) are  getting more searches and bookings.

Finally,  planes don’t just cart people around, all that crap under the plane is  cargo that someone pays to ship. Cargo revenues are expected to be $152B  this year compared with $128B in 2020 and $101B in 2019.

**Why AAL?**

AAL  was back to 90% of pre-pandemic (2019) bookings as of the Memorial Day  weekend. We all know about pent up demand, blah, blah. Leisure travel is  up, but business travel is still catching up. Of AAL’s top 50 corporate  accounts, 47 have said that they intend to return to full business  travel by the end of the year. I guess these folks are tired of looking  at themselves on Zoom. Interestingly, business travelers are only 12% of  passengers but about 75% of revenue. AAL also reported that premium  cabins are selling better than economy with more people booking economy  then choosing to pay for the upgrade.

An  AI market research company just released a report on travelers  returning to the skies. The broke up travelers into two groups and  compared “Eager” travelers (those returning to travel sooner) to  “Cautious” travelers (pussies who like sitting at home). Eager travelers  are more likely to take 4-6 international trips per year compared to  Cautious. Also, Eagers tend to book with AAL (and Southwest; LUV). Oh,  and the Cautious peeps…AAL too (along with Delta; DAL).

AAL  was also the first to figure out that people don’t like standing around  the airport with their dicks in their hands (well, most people; stay  out of the bathroom at O’Hare). They partnered with a group called eMed  to provide rapid COVID tests (15 minutes) with results uploaded to the  VeriFLY app allowing for easier/faster passage. It’s not free, but may  be worth it to those who want less hassle and easier airport  experiences. UAL also came up with something similar after AAL  implemented theirs. DAL still hasn’t come up with one.

Finally,  some recent share performance numbers. Each of these major airlines has  seen stock price come up in the past few months. Here is how each ranks  in the past month and last six months respectively. Does this mean AAL  will continue to lead? I don’t know, it’s possible that it’s shot its  wad and is close to done, but I don’t think so given the other travel  trends.

AAL +16.39%,  +52.01%

UAL + 9.34%, +17.24%

DAL +  3.29%,  +  8.9%

Downsides?

Like  I said, it may be that AAL peaked in high school and will spend the  next few years reliving the glory days. Also, jet fuel costs are back up  to the January 2020 levels, so this renewed travel isn’t coming at a  discount to the airlines themselves. And, AAL is unique in that it  furloughed pilots and are now spending time/money on training new pilots  (or at least, new to AAL). Not sure what else I may have missed, but  probably something.

There you have it. Thanks for reading.

2021-06-03 20:48:38,wallstreetbets,"Good DD.  
Couple notes based on my opinion:  Should have bought in earlier this year or ideally last year, cause the stock price is already back up and within a few dollars of pre-pandemic levels.  And as someone else mentioned, business travel will pick up but I doubt it will be back to pre-pandemic levels anytime soon (lots of companies saved a bunch of money without travel and I imagine some will be looking to keep unnecessary travel lower than prepandemic now that they've had a taste of the cost savings)."

At the time of me writing this, VIAC's market cap is $27 billion, yet the asset value of their company is worth over $54.7 billion! VIAC is worth less than half of what its physical assets are worth! Now some people may say that their debt is what justifies a $41.50 price, yet the debt is $17.8 billion. If you subtract the debt from the asset value ($54.7B-$17.8B) you get a value of $36.9 Billion. THIS IS 27% BELOW THE PHYSICAL VALUE OF THE COMPANY (more than 50% if you ignore debt).   On top of that, VIAC's debt has been decreasing quickly. A month ago, VIAC had a debt of $19 billion. If VIAC had a proper valuation based on assets alone, the share price would be $53, and about $100 if debt is out of the picture, which will happen soon.

It's not just the undervaluation of assets, VIAC has a price to book ratio of 1.4x, compared to the industry average of 2x. VIAC also has a PE ratio of only 9.7! Compared to similar media companies, NFLX has a PE ratio of 59 and DIS had a ratio of 89. Now, why am I comparing streaming stocks to Viacom, the old TV network that nobody gives a shit about? It's because VIAC is now a streaming company. In the last few earnings reports we've had, VIAC has crushed every estimate, and that is due to their rapidly increasing Paramount+ subscriptions. Their streaming revenue is now making up a huge part of revenue, and it's projected to keep growing. The CEO projects $7 billion in streaming revenues alone by 2024. They already have a ton of classics such as Spongebob and Fairly Oddparents, and as the contracts they have with other shows they own with other streaming companies expire, more popular shows will end up on Paramount+ and drag more people in.

If you look at the chart, you'll see that a few months ago, VIAC was trading at $100 a share, before plummeting into the low 40's and even high 30's. Why? VIAC jumped up quite a bit in the last year, a large part of which is because of  hedge fund called Archegos. Archegos took a long position on the stock, shooting it into the 100's. VIAC took this opportunity to issue shares in order to pay off debt, causing a dip down to $80 (this is what I believe is the fair value of the company is, as well as my price target). Archegos got screwed over and had to liquidate all their shares of VIAC, making it plummet down to the low $40's. Because of the liquidation, VIAC has a fairly high short interest as well, but this number has been increasing since the Archegos selloff.

Lastly, VIAC has a solid dividend of 2.25%, and this stock will likely stay in my portfolio for years to come.

Positions: 20 shares at $42 a share, will probably add more after my next paycheck comes.

TL;DR, VIAC is one of the most undervalued stocks on the market right now, and is moving into a new part of their business model that is generating a ton of cash, and is on a fire sale do to a hedge fund liquidation. Has many bull factors as well. Price target $80 EOY"

2021-06-04 13:10:01,wallstreetbets,GME is a good play I agree. But if this goes to $250 a share I have over 3 mil. Less upside for GME in my opinion at $250 price point atm. Should have got in around $130 again but didn’t.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Some advice to new traders Over the last couple days, the hype over AMC, BB, GME, whatever, has been exciting but there are some important things to note. 

Some of you may have never been fortunate to make the amount of money that you have so far, and some of you may be trying to hop on the train in hopes of a get-rich-quick-scheme.

With that being said, I want to leave everyone new here with two pieces of advice: As much as I enjoy getting off to some loss porn, I know the amount of money some of you may be losing is life changing and financially destructive. The big thing to take away is something my dad had told me a long time ago (and something I’ve learned the hard way) - **You haven’t made a penny until you sell.**

The hype is all fun and games, but don’t let it disillusion you. That $1,000 you made is $1,000 you didn’t have before. Sure, there are people who made $100,000+ but those are rare cases. Don’t fall for the peer pressure of “paper hands” or whatever people are saying. Take your profits when you have profit, the stock market is speculative and wild and you may lose it all in an instant, just like that.

Stay safe everyone!"

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Corsair $CRSR is set up for a massive move and shorts are getting despreate I'll keep this short sweet and simple. Corsair is set up for a massive move, is a great long hold, and is in a opportunistic entry point.

Corsair is oversold and is getting beat down by shorts that expected gaming to die off and insiders to sell of (which they didn't). So sold off in fact that CRSR is a value play with a 15 forward PE with a dominate market share in an industry that is set to grow massively. I think plenty of posts that have covered the fundamentals so I won't really get into it. What I want to talk about is what is going on right now.

As far as TA goes the stock has been consolidating nicely in the $30-35 range. A close over $35 would be extremely bullish and would leave little resistant until $40. Shorts are defending this position heavily and even engaging in blatant stock manipulation. Most analyst have price targets in the 45-55 dollar range so you can imagine if shorts loose control this could move massively.

A short attack after the close today had a trader using a low volume of share to wreck the stock price. Most likely to kill sentiment. If you are looking for an entry and have access to after hours now is your chance. The public float is low so some sustained buying pressure could send CRSR flying.

2021-06-03 21:43:47,wallstreetbets,I bought this because my mouse told me to.
2021-06-04 10:58:05,wallstreetbets,"I am long CRSR, but I have some concern about the chip shortage limiting production...."
2021-06-04 15:16:07,wallstreetbets,"I've been sitting on 100 shares for several months now. $35.54 average. I was reluctant to accept that the stock was being manipulated but after the past 2 days is pretty clear that it is. The upside of this stock is huge, but it could take a while to pay off with what's currently going on."
2021-06-03 21:04:40,wallstreetbets,"I like this stock and the company makes good products.  The PE ratio isn't as great as you make it seem (kinda normal for this market I guess, but that is also why I'm a little worried for the market in general), but I assume that is why you used the lower forward PE... and the fact that you mentioned a short as the reasoning it could pop off actually makes me more worried than just posting normal DD not relying on some short pressure bs.

I have a bit of CRSR with an average price of $35 tho, so I'm hoping you're right.  Just not confident enough about the stock taking off to put in more money just to average down."
2021-06-03 22:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Corsair is an interesting stock, I did attempt to invest in it before Q1 earnings and made a decent amount on it, but found that swing trading it was more profitable after Q1 earnings as it tends to stay range-bound (28-35). Additionally, it tends to trade opposite of QQQ, can almost always get an easy 50c-$1 play when QQQ's start to dump in the morning. Been playing it like this for 5 months. I personally love CRSR products and that's why I was so drawn to it, I have many of their products, but as they're a company that is currently working on expanding their position and spending money to do it, I just don't know if it's a buy and hold just yet."

2021-06-03 21:13:02,wallstreetbets,Ha gottemmmm
2021-06-03 21:14:02,wallstreetbets,"I’ve done a lot more research and the short interest isn’t what attracted me to Corsair. Making my whole rationale would be too long for a Reddit post. I think that its the best pure play on gaming for a reasonable valuation. Either corsair is undervalued or it’s peers are massively overvalued. I think their product diversity is by far the best. Their margins are increasing and they are using cash flows to pay down debt. I think the management is very competent, if you look at the history of the company they have navigated their space about as well as they could have. Long term I have a lot of conviction in this company and feel the upside by far outweighs the potential downside."
2021-06-03 21:53:51,wallstreetbets,🤔🤭🤦
2021-06-04 06:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Crsr had been talked about in wsb for a long time.  Just didn't get the AMC, GME treatment.

This isn't out off place.....  Well maybe now it is but you can look at history on the sub."
2021-06-03 21:33:14,wallstreetbets,Yeah actually I agree with everything you said here.  Most of my concerns with CRSR apply to nearly every stock that could even remotely be considered tech or a meme stock.
2021-06-04 08:46:41,wallstreetbets,CRSR has definitely been mentioned here. It came up on my radar when /u/sir_jack_a_lot  went all in last summer or fall. I can't quite remember.
2021-06-04 08:49:24,wallstreetbets,Had to be fall I think.  I think that's when it listed.  I've been in since a week after launch and reupped at $33.  I like it but it's a damned head scratcher at times.
2021-06-04 08:57:08,wallstreetbets,"I picked the worst time to jump in and bought high and sold low. Took a $6k loss and moved my money into BB, TELL and CLOV. Sometimes noticing tickers mentioned here actually pays off."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"My analysis of AMC 11m share sale news This morning news about AMC selling 11m shares in open market sent mixed signal and affected AMC stock trading during the first half of the day. As far as I understand 11m shares were  part of 
Sec filing on 4/27/2021 for  43m shares sale, correct?

The actual sale of 11m seem to have happened between 9:36-9:54AM as it seems to coincide with ~$50 per share sale price that was in the news.

Now the news came before market open that caused FUD amongst retail buyers and that caused further price drop from retail sellers. 

So all this was to push the price down? Am I missing something here?

Also I do know this kind of sale can happen anytime as long as there are shares that can be released to market. It does cause dilution but we don’t care about that do we?

2021-06-03 20:20:37,wallstreetbets,"BB has almost no short interest. 

If you want another play, it's probably CLOV. Not a great company, but can rocket easily and doesn't dilute every 2 minutes."
2021-06-03 20:26:31,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with CLOV. Any play is a better play than AMC at this point.

And it has never been about the short interest, regardless of what the conspiracy theorist say."
2021-06-03 20:21:07,wallstreetbets,Why does anyone do anything?
2021-06-03 20:31:26,wallstreetbets,"I think BB has the potential to be good, but the previous exec team was awful at making money. If that changes then I might thinking about buying."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC will sell more shares AMC filed to sell up to 43 million shares in late April. They sold 8.5m to Murdick, and another 11.5m today. They still have 23 million shares left to sell. We saw the damage they did today, and they can still do DOUBLE that at any time.. and why wouldnt they? It's free money to them and they need it. 

That's another BILLION dollars we'd have to come up with just to hold the line where it's at right now. I know a lot of you will downvote this, paper hands, etc. But I'm seriously trying to help everyone here. Don't get left holding the bag and donating your winnings to the corporation. Cash out, be happy, move to the next play.

Maybe once they sell the remaining 23 million shares, we can take a look at short interest again and go from there, perhaps buy the dip if the opportunity presents. For now, please don't get caught holding the bag. AMC ceo literally said it himself, he warned you this was coming."
2021-06-04 04:17:44,wallstreetbets,"Dude go back to your bosses at the Wall Street firm and tell them we ain’t listening. We get it, you all have to try and get us to sell so you’ll make some money on this bet but we are Apes and we are fking holding!"

2021-06-04 05:54:12,wallstreetbets,Probably right.  But on the other hand money might just move as it did from GME to AMC from AMC to BB. If the pattern continues NOK and WKHS eat a little before they burn out too.
2021-06-03 20:30:42,wallstreetbets,"Thought I was still replying to OP who said 23m. Yeah 46k. Which is pretty dam insignificant. CEO also said very plainly ""we're done""
Are you saying the 46k is a concern? Cuz even without his commitment. 
46k against 500k daily volume isn't gonna do too much. 
Fwiw I was pissed this morning"
2021-06-03 20:41:27,wallstreetbets,"46k?    Oh I see I put that as well since you did, but it is actually 46-50 MILLION.

Magic Mushrooms are native to the African savannah, just as early humans were! Omnivorous hunter gatherer hominids sniff out any food they could get their hands on, and would often target cow pies due to the bugs that may be found underneath; Wouldn't you know it, wiggle wiggle mushies happen to love the cow pies too. Psilocybin mushrooms affect the parts of the brain associated with speech and imagination, and have been shown to promote neural networking. Rapid expansion of the human brain is still an unexplained anomaly.

Psychedelics are bubbling up into the public eye, all new research shows nothing but good things. The Psychedelic Renaissance is soon to dawn on humanity and bring with it elevated consciousness and the end of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. A funny mushie that makes the room go wiggle wiggle is about to give the whole  pharmaceutical industry a run for its money. Psychedelics have worked miracles in myself, my family, and friends, and I'd wager they would for others too. Hop on this hype train before it leaves the station, because this stock is soon to explode.

Those in power will see the error of criminalizing nature's forbidden fruit. Remember what happened in the 60's lads. Hell, it's happening right now with GME against Wallstreet."

  Every logical synapse on the planet would say “it’ll never work” or “it’s not the time”. Until millions get on board and make it happen despite logic. 

  The stock market is an untouched frontier as far as change goes. And at the very least I will make a small contribution by participating in the idea. But I also know I’ll make some money. I’m under no delusion it’ll make me millions. Though, some people will get lucky. Unfortunately I think the whole point gets lost with those people. 

  Most will say it failed because “it dumped before people could sell for a profit”, or “it never went past $xxx.xx”... 

  While people like me will say “no, it actually worked. We controlled the outcome”.

  But most importantly we all agreed on mutual success, at the expense of any large, protected, criminal entity willing to step in between US and OUR mutual decision. Instead of wasting that collective energy on something stupid, like ripping down statues, or slandering the latest/greatest puppet for no reason. Things like this SHOULD prove to all of us: 

This is the power we have. 

  The people that are not in balance or control of their emotions will lose. But being unprepared for that opportunity doesn’t exclude them from other ones. There’s always more. Just learn from this one, and be ready for the next one. But don’t lie to yourself and others. Don’t perpetuate the perspective that it was a disaster, just because you failed to see the opportunity yourself.

As far as this one goes. I’ve already won, cleared & withdrew my investment plus 50% profit, and put the rest back on black! I’ve learned a lot already. And I’ll have some scars but regardless of what happens, I’ll have 0 regrets.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Walgreens getting ready to buy the rest of Rite Aid? Good afternoon folks,

In my last post I mentioned somebody who had said Amazon might buy Rite Aid, but I now think they are wrong. I think it will be Walgreens, not Amazon who gets Rite Aid.

Walgreen's has just put 6.5 billion in their pocket, and their US head is the former CEO of Rite Aid.

Also, someone is accumulating Rite Aid stock, it's been going up the last two days. So somebody might know something; otherwise, I can see no other explanation for why Rite Aid stock has risen so much in just two days. There is no other news, and I think someone is front-running an announcement of an acquisition of Rite Aid by Walgreens.

EDIT: Rite Aid's next earnings announcement is on 6/24 before market open. It will be very interesting to see if anything happens before then. The annual company meeting is in July. 

Here is the info on Walgreens:

[https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/walgreens-completes-divestiture-of-alliance-healthcare-to-amerisourcebergen-for-%246.5b-2021)

""""Walgreens Completes Divestiture of Alliance Healthcare to AmerisourceBergen for $6.5BContributor Jun 3, 2021 11:06AM EDT

Walgreens Boots Alliance, Inc. (WBA) completed the sale of its Alliance Healthcare businesses to AmerisourceBergen (ABC) for $6.5 billion in a cash and stock deal.

Walgreens is a global leader in retail pharmacies, providing medicines and accessible high-quality care.

The total consideration comprises $6.275 billion in cash after adjustments and 2 million shares of AmerisourceBergen.

Walgreens intends to utilize the sale proceeds to bring down the company’s debt levels, and focus on the growth of its core retail pharmacy and healthcare businesses.

Notably, the company has already reduced the debt by $3.3 billion with the repayment of the outstanding amount owed on a $3.8 billion term loan. (See Walgreens stock analysis on TipRanks)

Furthermore, the company will also use the proceeds to fund strategic initiatives announced earlier, which include the opening of 600 - 700 Village Medical at Walgreens primary care clinics and taking over a major stake in iA, a pioneer of software-enabled pharmacy automation solutions.

Walgreens Boots Alliance CEO Rosalind Brewer commented, “Completion of this transaction represents a significant step forward in our transformation and will fuel investments to grow WBA’s core retail pharmacy and healthcare businesses.”

Brewer further added, “Through these and other investments, WBA looks to bring even more innovative healthcare offerings to our customers and patients, as we further accelerate our strategic priorities.”"""
2021-06-03 22:28:02,wallstreetbets,3 yrs ago it was worth 180 a share. I know their Financials suck but let's face it there is no way a company loses 90% in 3 yrs.
2021-06-03 20:47:23,wallstreetbets,There is also a West Coast component to the equation. WBA can grow their presence on the West Coast and block Amazon in the process. If WBA presents a deal. It would likely be a Cash/Stock deal with the offer. I think it would take $120 or better on the terms. $120 cash or 2 WBA shares for each  share of RAD. That's doable with RAD having only 55 million shares outstanding. So shareholders could go for the mix offer. RAD's PBM alone is worth $20 so a lowballed offer won't get approved. Funds would take shares likely.
2021-06-03 23:06:12,wallstreetbets,"They only bought a little more than 1900 of RAD's poorest performing stores. RAD kept the best performing stores. To prove this. Before those stores were sold. RAD did $32 Billion in revenue annually. After the sale of those stores RAD did $22 Billion in revenue. So the  kept 2/3rds of the revenue. There is another long story behind that botched deal. RAD's old CEO, who now works for WBA, pulled the deal from WBA buying all the stores. What no one knew at the time was that Cerberus offered Standley the CEO job of a newly combined merger of ACI and RAD. Part of the stores sold even favored a futured ACI and RAD combination. Standley began worked with Cerberus Shorts buy sandbagging earnings to help gain approval of a very lowballed offer. That's how Shorts ended up getting trapped in RAD. We Retail shareholders along with a few larger institutions voted no and then gave Standley the boot. This could be taught in business school one day. This is why RAD has three components for a successful major squeeze. 1) Equity that's under valued. 2) A potential buyout candidate. 3) Trapped Shorts that have been trapped for 3yrs now."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Is rolling over actually smart with $BB (40x return in 3 days) Hey all so for short I bought a single option on BB at a 11.5 strike price expiring June 11th. It was a measly 20$ back in March which turned into 130$ 2 days ago.

 I proceeded to sell it and reinvested in 2 9/17 call options strike price 25$ for 50$ a piece.
They quickly rose to 5x and I took that on one. 

Now today I sold my final 25$ strike for 525$ today 

Awesome I turned 20$ into 775$. But the greed took over. I rolled once more into a 37$ call option expiring December. Funnily enough this happened to be when it ticked into the red today. 

Ofc I'm not degening everything on BB (sorry fellow apes). I snagged myself a year long pltr and hasbro call for free in my eyes."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE and the future DD

Joe Biden loves clean energy.

Mr. Biden himself even proposed a 2 Trillian dollar infrastructure revision.

What's one of the leading forefronts of this? You guessed it.

Clean renewable energy.

As i'm writing this, CLNE is trading at 9.38. Amazon has announced a partnership with CLNE and is buying back 50 million shares at 13.48 YES. You read correctly, there is 50 million shares that are going to be bought back at 13.48

"" Separately, Clean Energy has issued to Amazon warrants to buy up to 53.14 million shares of common stock, with the first tranche of 13.28 million warrant shares vested in connection with the fuel supply agreement. Subsequent tranches will vest, based on fuel purchases reaching up to $500 million"" 

A whole $4 higher than the price right now. Get in gentleman. Remember this play is with shares NOT OPTIONS.

you can buy options, but shares will trigger the gamma squeeze.

EDIT: wen squeeze? wen? GAMMA HAPPENS AFTER MID 13'S LET THIS STOCK FIGHT FOR YOU. IT WINS BATTLES BY ITSELF. THIS THING GROWS. CALL A DOCTOR.

See you at 6/18 when this is riding 20's.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Feel bearish about AAPL Today is the first time I feel bearish about AAPL. It's a money making machine but stock goes higher because of future earning / innovation potential and not because of how successful the company in the past. The headwinds include: epic trial, chip shortage leading to reduced iPad shipment and reduced future revenue, and possibly reduced iPhone 13 shipment due to no breaking changes. 

In addition to all these, already highest market cap in the market and inflation fear looming the tech sector. Since AAPL is such a big part of many indexes, the downward of indexes will affect AAPL a lot. Also, three top car division executives just left AAPL and it does not seem AAPL has made much progress in the car business which could be next big growth area for AAPL. 

Among a dozen of professional analysts, only 2 are bearish and last week New Street’s Pierre Ferragu gave a $90 price target EOY. No major banks have downgraded their outlook for AAPL and the consensus median is $160, average is $157.10, high is $185. 

What do you think about AAPL?"

2021-06-04 14:26:20,wallstreetbets,"I was stating a fact lol. Though if I only had $76k at 57, I’d probably yolo the entire thing too. His choice is actually simpler than if he was younger. At his age with that amount, the choices are

1) Work till death, because $76k is enough to retire you for like 2 years, or

2) Yolo everything anyways because even if he loses it all it makes no difference to the outcome of working till death, so why not take a chance and have a better than zero chance at an actual retirement?

If he was younger, yolo’ing is more of a retard move than it is now. Because potentially that $76k can become millions with time. What he did is actually far less retarded than it seems on the surface, at least at his age."

2021-06-04 14:31:59,wallstreetbets,"Even if stretched out, you’re not gonna survive more than 5 years on $75k lol. That’s $15k a year at 5 years. That’s not a retirement.

This guy is actually smart to yolo it. It gives him a chance at a real retirement rather than just surviving the last 5 years of his life.

Edit: in fact if I was dropped into his position, I’d trade super aggressively, maybe even take out loans. I would have otherwise been working till death anyways so what difference does it actually make to quality of life? Trading aggressively is pretty much the only way out of the situation.

I’d argue trading aggressively is most dangerous around midlife. Doing it early is risk free, doing it late life doesn’t change your end results if you didn’t have much to begin with. But doing it midlife can determine, and set your path forever."
2021-06-04 14:38:59,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don’t fully disagree, I’m half aggressive trading at 22 with 25k. Shitty start but I lost 10k with some unfortunate weed stocks and a few other things.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why short-sellers aren't inherently ""greedy"". Hear me out. (I'm not a short-seller) Hopefully this doesn't get me banned. I'm not out to get anybody here, just trying to offer an alternative perspective.

&#x200B;

Credentials:

I'm a professional analyst. My undergrad is in Economics from Ole Miss. I have an MBA from Southern Methodist University.  I'm about to begin the CFA exam/study process. I started as a credit analyst for commercial banks, I worked briefly as a loan officer (I'm an awful salesman!), I've worked in portfolio credit risk management, and as a corporate financial analyst. I've analyzed the financial statements of thousands of companies. At work, I'm known as the guy who's not afraid to offer my view, regardless who might disagree. I've been the nail that stuck out and gotten hammered before. But for the most part, I've found my honesty to be deeply appreciated.

&#x200B;

Context:

I pick value-stocks. I'm not a short-seller. For one thing, I don't have that kind of capital; and two, short-selling is HARD. REALLY HARD. I've talked with short-sellers who've been in that game for 30+ years. A wise one told me he was ""right"" about the direction about 80% of the time, but only gets the timing right about half the time.

I'm not here to talk down to anyone. I'm not here to convince you what you should or shouldn't do with your money. And I'm not here to convince you to ""like"" hedge funds or anything of the sort. I'm here to try to convey what I believe to be true.

&#x200B;

Argument:

The way I see it, most short-sellers aren't ""greedy"" just because they bet against companies. Think about this. Short-selling has finite/limited up-side risks, and (theoretically) infinite/unlimited down-side risks. Stock prices can only fall closer and closer to zero, but as this sub has shown several times, there is no limit to the upper-bound of an equity-share price.

If I were incredibly greedy, why would I want to take that kind of bet? A rational greedy investor would only buy stocks because as the mantra here goes, stock prices have unlimited potential to move upwards ""to the MOON!"".

In my financial statement analysis classes, perhaps my smartest professor advised ""Short-sellers are ARBITERS OF TRUTH in the market-place. If you're analyzing a stock and you think you like it a lot, but it's heavily shorted, you NEED TO KEEP DIGGING, until you understand why it's being shorted. Short-sellers have to be the best analysts of them all. You need to be supremely confident in your analysis, and too, the timing (which is 100x harder to get right). The question for those going long on heavily shorted stocks should be ""What are the short investors telling us about this security?"".

See Michael J. Burry's \~$530M puts betting against TSLA here:

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921010281/xslForm13F\_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1649339/000156761921010281/xslForm13F_X01/form13fInfoTable.xml)

I'm happy to debate here and answer any questions you might have.

P.S. For those still debating the AMC-sale happening in April vs. June: You're both kind of right. They filed the shelf offering back in April which was advising their INTENT to sell additional shares in the future. They didn't act on that till today, which IS new. So, we've been capable of being aware of the fact they will sell additional shares in the future since April, but it didn't actually occur till today."
2021-06-03 21:09:26,wallstreetbets,"This all started because of extreme greed on the short seller’s side obviously there’s appropriate times to short something, (Tesla at 900) but the biggest short sellers do engage in manipulative tactics and are known to short companies in order to make it impossible to raise equity through offering and have to resort to predatory high interest convertible loans that are not feasible to pay off from the same short sellers themselves. Once default happens the company is taken over and stripped for parts"

2021-06-03 21:20:35,wallstreetbets,"Yes of course. My argument isn't a blanket-statement. This is an excellent paper about your point, which I dug up from my school readings. A variety of scenarios are possible. I'm not arguing all short sellers are good. I am arguing they aren't all bad though.

2021-06-04 00:28:50,wallstreetbets,"I'm a financial analyst. I've never worked as ""an economist"". I don't make any of my stock picks based on macro-economics. Like trying to pick-up a specific girl at a bar based on the signage out front. I agree. It doesn't work. 

I wouldn't dream of picking stocks that way. The only way is to investigate the nitty-gritty details of the security. 

""Top-down"" analysis in general doesn't work, not just for securities but for most anything really. E.g. if you were a doctor conducting a lung-condition diagnosis, you couldn't possibly specify the diagnosis, based on the fact the individual is from a certain country where a lot of people are smokers, so they must have lung cancer. It doesn't make any sense. You have to do an x-ray, and a bunch of other tests I don't know anything about. You MUST know the details. 

However, with that said, you CAN start from the bottom and apply economic concepts to ask specific questions, like ""What will your cash-flow leverage look like if interest rates begin rising?"". (And the borrower/company has floating-rate debt.) As another example, you might be interested in the price-elasticity of a borrowers clients, given the industry they're situated in. It must always be bottoms-up though.

In credit-analysis, if you're often wrong, I can assure you that you won't stick around long on a good team. I'm also not into forecasting on a macro-level, as again I agree, too many variables at play to be accurate."
2021-06-04 09:24:17,wallstreetbets,"I’d think you’d be Nervus. Well; on the one hand, if it makes you feel any better, I’m sure there’s plenty of greedy short-sellers left over to bully. On the other, sometimes I think it’s easy to get so entrenched in a certain understanding that we try to apply it to all situations. Which is just rarely the right way to go."

2021-06-03 23:17:51,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is a great company, that happens to be wildly over-priced right now, in my opinion."
2021-06-03 21:20:56,wallstreetbets,"I disagree. I recall last year with tesla, short sellers were shorting the stock because they thought it was too profitable too quickly. Same thing with others. But in reality, the idea of ev actually gave rise to more innovation and economics, which short sellers don't really want to see."
2021-06-04 00:49:07,wallstreetbets,"My apologies, I took you for an economist. Thank you for clarifying that."
2021-06-04 11:12:00,wallstreetbets,Ha ! You spelt nervous wrong. Only idiots cant spell. \*laughs nervously\*
2021-06-03 23:42:44,wallstreetbets,yep; Naked shorting has been illegal for over 10 years.
2021-06-03 22:09:26,wallstreetbets,"For Tesla, I don’t think most short sellers (some might) were shorting the concept of EV and the innovation. The problem with Tesla, from what I gathered, lies in the difference in opinion of its stock valuation. Some think it’s worth a market cap of $1 trillion while others think it was worth $50B. The wide range then led to people taking short position because their thesis showed the current valuation was overvalued and thus presented an opportunity to make money.

If Tesla traded at a 1B valuation, you would have barely any shorts since there’s very few who think it’s over valued. If it trades at $500B, there are more shorts since more people will believe it is worth substantially less and would make a decision to initiate a short since they believe the price will go down eventually. 

Ultimately, everyone just wants to make money. Both longs and shorts."
2021-06-04 00:51:33,wallstreetbets,No problem.
2021-06-03 22:14:36,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree with you consensus overall. I also agree with your final lines. My issue is the way hedge funds do it also. Like with the robinhood, where they paused trading completely, that was totally not ok. On top of that, with hedge funds, their primary belief seems to be around, we have money, u don't, go fuck yourself because we will stop you from gaining any. As far as i know, long investors don't do that short of tactics, its usually people who decide they dont want others to gain happiness, so they fuck with their money."
2021-06-03 21:36:49,wallstreetbets,"Well I can say they do serve me a great purpose. I ALWAYS check short-interest, and if it's over 2% I will pass on that investment. It's impossible to lose your principal by not investing in something. Conversely, disagreeing with short-sellers and buying would convey that you know more than they do. Given that they have a lot more to lose than I would, I defer to their judgement in those cases. If anything, I thank short-sellers for doing all that hard work of uncovering and then notifying me of risks I can't ""see"". Short-sellers make it very easy for me to pass on a potential investment without requiring me to do all that hard work uncovering the more obscure risks."

2021-06-04 10:45:58,wallstreetbets,Still posts from amc and I think gme aswell are getting deleted. And this wasn’t even close to being the squeeze.
2021-06-04 18:05:00,wallstreetbets,"GME started before AMC back in janurary. Agte GME AMC, Nokia and BB came in.
The focus has for many months been GME with some holding on AMC, which now is rising and getting more talk."

2021-06-04 11:25:04,wallstreetbets,Time will tell. But I feel like going from 10 to 70 was the biggest squeeze AMC is going to have.

2021-06-04 11:40:35,wallstreetbets,"You are missing the point. People getting in at $45-50 per share would need it to skyrocket well past 200 to see the kinds of gains that have already occurred (and for it to be a bigger squeeze than from 10-70). If people want a home run for 5x their money or more, buying BB at $15 a share is far more likely.

Everybody acts like people talking about the stock got in at the very beginning. Damn dude it's really not that complicated."

I wish you the best of luck either way, but if you’re going to quit, maybe you could consider scaling back on your time spent at your employer instead, work part time say 30 hours+ or whatever your employer allows as the minimum to qualify for benefits and then focus more on the market. 

I support your dream and I’m rooting for you, but think about all your options."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Sell AMC calls if your holding a large amount of shares (cc)   I'm giving you this information, don't come in here say some dumb shit like *""ill never sell*"". 

   First of all EVERYONE has a price.  Look at AMC CEO, didn't even bat an eye. Its business. 

  ""What is a covered call?"" Your 'ape' dumbass may wonder this. 
  
  Well for every 100 shares you own you can put those up for collateral basically your selling call options.    
 
   At levels now PICK A NUMBER YOU WOULD SELL YOUR STOCK FOR, MAYBE EVEN HIGHER, or you can pick a strike price you don't even think it'll get to.     Now instead of 'buy' you'll do 'sell' .  

  Heres an example for all the morons that just jump at ticker symbols whenever this sub shoots them out its ass... 

You have 600 shares of AMC bought at $30/ share

A call option  $70 strike price 6/4 expiry sells for 
$335 a contract...

If you would sell AMC at $70 or don't think it'll get to $70 by 6/4.    And you had any sort of fucking brain.      You would sell 6 of those contracts and make $2k in your pocket TODAY.  

Now.... if AMC price drops next morning, you can buy those same contracts back at a lower price and you keep the difference and obviously the shares.   
  
  Or just let the contract expire and you would keep the shares.

  If AMC hits $70 you would basically sell at $70 and still profit.    

  If it goes higher than that you sold at $70 it doesn't matter (everyone sells sometime, name your price) 


  This strategy is also used by banks, hedge funds, people that have rolex watches and girlfriends with fake boobs.  

  Waiting for : ""ban"", "" im not reading all that"", ""paper handed bitch"", ""ill never sell"", and ""these crayons taste weird""  go ahead....

Edit:::: technically you can borrow the shares and do this also.   Everybody is playing chess and r/wallstreetbets be playing checkers"
2021-06-03 21:11:11,wallstreetbets,Damn a whole page to explain a covered call you’d think we were brain dead and not just greedy

I have no idea what I am doing so I went to [Shareholderproposals.com](https://Shareholderproposal.com) and it has a lot of legal talk I don't understand because I got my masters in social work but it sounds like this is something we can do as shareholders if one of the apes here has 1% or 2k worth of AMC and has held the stock for the past year and will hold it until the next shareholders meeting, where the proposal would get voted on.

AMC Networks

Josh Sapan, CEO of AMC Networks, saw his total compensation last year dip to $11.8 million from $20.2 million the year before.
The pay included a base salary of $2 million, unchanged, a stock grant of $5.5 million — down from $13.3 million the year before — and $4.2 million in non-equity incentive pay (like a cash bonus).
Chairman emeritus Charles Dolan, whose family controls the company, dipped to $1.8 million from $2.7 million. Chief operating officer Ed Carroll earned $6.9 million, down from $8.4 million

What have any of them done to deserve those salaries?"

2021-06-03 23:55:10,wallstreetbets,"At some point, the shorts will need to cover by buying back their shares at some price. 

If they need to buy back 20% of the shares, that means that only 20% of you are actually going to be able to profit from this trade. From that point of view, for the 80% of you who are going to be bag holders, the best thing that could happen is that the company collects money for you to share with all the people who like the stock. Not just the paper handed gamblers."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The ultimate reopening stock **ABNB** is the ultimate reopening play: Q1 21 gross booking value increases over 50% (imagine what is going to happen the rest of the year with vaccination and reopening everywhere), gross profit at 75%, scalable like no other hospitality company, great MOAT.  


But the kicker is 24% of bookings in Q1 were for stays longer than 28 days. So, not only ABNB will be the world leader in short term stays, it has also captured the longer rentals market. People are gonna continue working from home so why not work the summer from a beach house?  
  
Also, they introduced the biggest revamp of the platform and with close to $3Bn of R&D expenditure, you bet this will turn into a juggernaut: From data on guests preferences to adding services (breakfast included in an ABNB? Why not?). The experiences packages has increased 30% over Q1 202 and they are introducing flexible date bookings.  
  
  
  
And by the way... the company has $4Bn in net cash, the lockup period effect has passed and it rebounded nice and clean on the IPO price yesterday. Volume increased in the rebound, MACD and RSI turned bullish, crossed the 20day moving average.   


I'm loaded on ABNB calls and shares. Today was a blood red day but that’s fine. I’m doubling down if it touches $140 and again at $130. 

Positions:  


$37k in shares

$60k in July 180C and 200C

$60k in October 190C and 200C

$21k in 250C LEAP"
2021-06-03 20:04:47,wallstreetbets,Yup. 300 shares here. Eating popcorn for now and listening politely to all the haters. Sometimes buying more. La la la
2021-06-03 20:12:52,wallstreetbets,I would also look at SABR and COTY as the ultimate reopening stocks that are still 30% below pre-covid levels.
2021-06-03 20:24:19,wallstreetbets,"I was going to wait for the drop when lockup ends, i think next week . Get it even cheaper than it already is"

2021-06-03 21:35:51,wallstreetbets,Didnt zoom already have a large corporate base before dominating due to covid?
2021-06-04 05:28:29,wallstreetbets,"I welcome divergent opinion, unless it's just an idiotic ramble (""being in the market first don't mean jack squat""). FYI, Zoom pre-covid had something like 15% market share and gained to around 40% now. The real winner tho was Google Meet that had a market share of 1.5% and now has around 20%. And why did Skype lost their grip? Because it's the same product it was 10 years ago - no reinvestment, limited R&D and it was a secondary business of Microsoft.   


ABNB has something special to offer - offering of adjacent ""verticals"" (experiences, plus & beyond packages for luxury and high-end customers, adventures, flexible booking dates), **super strong brand worldwide** (vrbo is local and a niche play - lots of investment needed to take it to ABNB's level), unexplored TAMs (do you think ABNB won't tap into the full lodging experience / market?), vast streams of integrated data.  


ABNB is vision, execution and passion - the management team has a stellar performance - even when covid hit, they quickly launched ABNB online experiences: it has thousands of users today selling all kinds of online experiences. It's obviously bullshit revenue wise but shows what they are capable of.   


  
Lastly, I don't care about diamond hands. **I care about MAKING MONEY**. And if you think retail traders don't care for ABNB because the price is above $100, you're dead wrong (remember TSLA?) People invest in what they know and an investment in the brand is also an investment in a lower cost of capital."
2021-06-04 08:39:03,wallstreetbets,So they're all creaming it.
2021-06-04 05:31:00,wallstreetbets,I agree regulatory pressure is probably the biggest risk for ABNB but changed a bit with Covid. Tourism is like 10% of the world GDP and governments got hit very hard last year - they are not in a rush to push for regulation against the sector
2021-06-04 05:32:05,wallstreetbets,"Like 50% of their customers were customer that paid over $100,000 per year. Zoom was built to serve the big corporations and compete against Cisco"
2021-06-04 10:04:40,wallstreetbets,"1 being first to market does not mean anything in fact most times it doesn't end well for them since they basically groundbreak for others to follow a much easier and cheaper path 

2 your downplaying the paradigm shift in public perception with the zoom example when you wanted to video call someone you used to say ""i'll skype you"" now they say ""let's do a zoom"" that is the equivalent of everyone switching from calling searches ""googling"" to bing 

3 comparing TSLA and airbnb just isn't even in the ballpark airbnb isn't ""disrupting"" anymore they are the target now tsla is still overtaking legacy auto airbnb ""IS"" legacy micro timeshare, your argument is basically the argument people make for ford that they have a ""super strong brand"" and are worldwide exporters  ( guess poor tsla is just a niche local play right?

also i don't agree the management is good for airbnb but thats is personal preference"
2021-06-04 12:42:46,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, so if anything the pandemic and the corporate world forced zoom on regular users. Idk, i still havent used zoom."

Retards are people buying shit at the tippy top or bears yoloing on puts while the money printer was on blast last year. Sometimes they get lucky and got in the ticker of autist DD and didn’t think twice or even know what the company did.

Blackberry is not a hardware company anymore, they do not sell phones anymore (well... very few). They decided a couple of years ago to shift their focus on software, especially in the realms of cyberspace, IoT and EV.  
  
This company is very undervalued! They bought Cylance some time ago, which is a AI based software to secure your environment. On top of that they create software for EVs (QNX and IVY). QNX is found in +150m vehicles. IVY is a collaboration with Amazon (AWS)"

You pussy paper hand bitches throw in the towel because of a minor dip? If you’re going to rally against the shorts, then fucking rally. 


Anyway let’s do this BB and TLRY! Lol. Best of luck to you amc folk. We’ve seen retard strength a few times now. Keep your foot on the gas

2021-06-04 04:58:51,wallstreetbets,"Late night fun with third-order options derivatives:

Charm: the change in options delta in relation to time. As time passes, the delta lowers as the option becomes proportionally more otm as the theta bleeds out.

Color: the change in options *gamma* in relation to time. As time passes, the gamma lowers as the option becomes proportionally more otm as the theta bleeds out.

Theta has an increasing decay half-life of 2sqrt2, so for every 50% time remaining, theta decays 1.41x faster.

During a gamma squeeze, the increase in underlying value pushes the options deeper itm, causing delta to increase, but also causing gamma to increase. This creates an exponential effect on the rate of forced buying due to hedging which is self feeding.

So what about charm and color? If delta and gamma are bleeding out along with theta because the majority of options are expiring, while at the same time people are panicking and taking profits instead of contributing more money into adding additional deltas and gammas into the system, the underlying will crash exponentially faster than it gained until the delta/gamma feedback loop is completely deleveraged."

It will bring you extreme wealth, make you feel like you are part of a greater community, and it will also cause great financial destruction to the elusive hedge fund short selling devils.  Every other stock is a distraction from the promised land, and is probably being secretly promoted by the hedge funds.  After you purchase my stock just make sure to never under any circumstance attempt to sell it, because that would betray our glorious struggle."

2021-06-03 20:13:38,wallstreetbets,"My thoughts after the mess today:

1. CEO of AMC made a smart move for himself, but it burned us. We can and should expect that in the future as we continue to boost and profit.

2. We rallied hard! As a result, we all own over 80% of AMC stock, at last count.

3. We should make an example. Boost AMC high enough for those who bought in at $70 to make a profit, then all make a call to cut it loose. 

4. We all profit, big gains, we tank AMC and show the ""big shots"" the power we wield, and the consequence of screwing us on future deals.

Am I way off? Close? 🤷‍♂️"

78F Sunny

The most interesting/weird date I've been on was probably 3 years ago in NYC. In the middle of a completely unrelated discussion about music, the girl asked if I had any job opening and whipped out a print out of her CV (so certainly pre-planned for the date). I respected her hustle, so there we sat in the middle of The Aviary solving brain teasers and stochastic calculus problems together. She didn't get the job, not because of her unconventional application submission, but because she couldn't derive Breeden-Litzenberger densities and didn't know how to apply Fatou's Lemma properly. When people tell you to think outside the box or be creative in your job search, I'm pretty fucking sure they didn't mean to use Tinder as LinkedIn. I advise you to not use this approach, as the next person will most likely not be as generous, and I certainly won't be."

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls closed yesterday at **100.40** which gives us a total value of:

2021-06-03 21:22:03,wallstreetbets,"I think the most annoying thing about all these “squeezes” is there are so many idiots in here not just jumping on one at a time. As soon as one rallies idiots jump out with BB, NOK, etc... ya’ll do realize if you are dividing peoples money between so many things the chance of them really squeezing it less don’t you? Or is that too over your heads?

If you want a real GME OG squeeze that could go into over a thousand per share (as long as there’s no RH buying restriction debacle). Then all you need to do is look up the tickers with the highest short interest. Then divide their market cap by their current share price. The one with the lowest number after that calculation is the easiest, fastest, and best squeeze target. Grab some cheap OTM calls, load up on shares, mention in the stock groups like this with your DD, and with any luck enough people with an IQ above the double digits will confirm your DD and jump on board. Also hopefully they’re smart enough to ignore all the idiots dropping random tickers that aren’t gonna squeeze just because there’s some short interest.

Right now WKHS is the only one with both high short interest and lowest share price/market cap. The rest are garbage."
2021-06-03 22:32:43,wallstreetbets,"wtf do you AMC bagholders think will happen to the business long term? There literally is no strategy. Their business was already caving in before and now their business is even worse. There is no hope. 

At least the GME apes have the ""Mr Cohen will change everything"" narrative.

***GM To Increase Vehicle Deliveries To Customers In U.S., Canada - PR Newswire***

""Today, General Motors outlined steps it is taking to increase deliveries to dealers and customers in the United States and Canada to meet strong consumer demand for Chevrolet, Buick , GMC and Cadillac vehicles.

As announced in May, GM will return full-size pickup production to Oshawa Assembly in Canada during the fourth quarter of 2021. The new accelerated timeline and incremental volume are expected to make an impact in 2022, as production ramps up.

As a result of GM's ongoing efforts to prioritize semiconductor usage, its success engineering solutions that maximize the utilization of chips as well as the pull-ahead of some projected semiconductor deliveries into the second quarter, the company now expects its first-half financial results to be significantly better than the first-half guidance previously provided.  GM is optimistic about the full year and expects to share additional information during its second-quarter earnings conference call on Aug. 4.  GM Chair and CEO Mary Barra and Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson will also participate in a Virtual Fireside Chat with Credit Suisse  today, beginning at 1 p.m. EDT ...""  

***GM Lifts Forecast As Chip Shortage Eases, Stock Hits Record - Associated Press***

""...Made engineering changes, prioritized semiconductor use and pulled some potential deliveries into the second quarter. So now the first-half earnings will be significantly better than forecasts it issued earlier in the year.

GM had predicted a first-half pretax profit of around $5.5 billion when it released first-quarter earnings in May. The company also said it's optimistic about the full year, but gave no further details.

GM previously forecast a full-year pretax profit of $10 billion to $11 billion and said earnings would be at the high end of the range. Full-year net income is expected to be between $6.8 billion and $7.6 billion...""

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB 🍇🍇🍇 If anyone is wondering about BlackBerry's future plans should take note of it's forward thinking and QNX's depth in the automotive industry. QNX has been installed and used in vehicles since 2004 and prior to that being utilized in telematics before it was purchased by Harman International Industries. 🚀

Blackberry acquired the company in 2010 from Harman and has continued leveraging QNX's assets in embedded systems for transportation, defense, medical, grids, robotics, and mobile devices. 🚀

In 2012 BlackBerry released forward vision videos on what they believed to be the future of QNX and the automotive industry. In recent years this vision is coming to fruition no pun intended. Video linked below.🚀

An example of this forward looking mentality of the automotive industry is BlackBerry's recently awarded patent for methods and systems for autonomous vehicle refueling. Article linked below. 🚀

For anyone that doesn't already know, Apple CarPlay and Android Auto are applications built atop of QNX OS. And even Android Automotive will utilize QNX's components for securing the vehicle even if it's not directly used for infotainment. 🚀

3 months ago, I spent so much time on part 1 and after posting it, I sadly realized that people are lazy 😂 Apes don't want to read mountains of DD, They just want a 5th grade level TLDR. This Ape got you and this DD will basically be a Long version of a TLDR! I'll try to make it concise and to the point as much as possible.(5 hours later, I failed at this objective lol)

**Though, if you are interested in my initial DD which took 2 days of research here's the** [**link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lsh9fh/ev_play_buying_leap_calls_on_america_for_the_next/)

FYI, I will not include any points mentioned in part one, like for example why it's grossly undervalued, etc... Spoiler Alert, it predicted F-150 EV pump!

Let's jump into it:

“Our ambition is to lead the electric vehicle revolution” \~ CEO Jim Farley

**1- Ford's secret weapon unleashed:**

For the last **44 consecutive years**, the F-150 has been Americas **best selling Truck**. In 2019, the Ford F-Series was **second only to the Apple iPhone**, which  raked in **$55 billion**, in terms of **total revenue** generated. The F-Series **generated more revenue than the NFL, MLB, NBA, and the NHL combined**, Just something to think about.

On May 19, Ford has unveiled its EV F-150 after Biden had driven it a week prior. The EV's features are mind blowing exceeding all expectations (Watch MKBHD review or Fords 5 min video). It has all the features crucial for it's target buyers (Construction workers, Farmers, Free-lance delivery drivers, Basically hardworking Blue-collar Americans...) and it's a Truck which actually looks like a Truck. “Ford knows what pickup owners want,” IHS Markit senior analyst Stephanie Brinley said. More importantly, it's an F-150 first, an EV second, Ford didn't abandon the F-150 core design which has been successful for 44 consecutive years.

Now Ford's EVs are targeting middle class value buyers (High quality, cheap EVs to compete with TESLA and they are destroying Tesla right now with sales, more on this on #5). The F-150 starts at  $32,500 after Federal tax credit!! Cheaper than any of **""Potential(because they don't exist yet)""** competitors with superior car features. Moreover, on May 26, it was announced that 70,000 Trucks were already reserved!

As Ford promised, F-150 Lightning will deliver more features, and cost less...

^(Don't forget about potential upcoming Ford SUVs, and a Bronco EV which might be announced this year.)

**2- Ford Rivian Partnership:**

Ford-Backed EV Automaker Rivian is planning to IPO as soon as September. It's looking for a valuation of 70Billion which is valued more than Ford Right now 😂(Ford is 62.50B at 14.94$). Ford has initially invested 500$ million in Rivian, but it added much more of an undisclosed amount.

Farley is quick to say Ford did not invest in the Michigan startup to make money in the stock market. **As more companies continue to invest in Rivian, Ford benefits from the increased value of its shares,** ""but that's not why we invested,"" Farley said in an interview with MotorTrend.

Farley with his 3D chess moves is probably investing in it to make a move to dominate the EV-SUV market too with a Lincoln or Explorer-Rivian car. He understands that the first move is the most important one in the EV territory and until now with the Mach-E and F-150 Ford execute the mission perfectly! Farley wants to take as much of the market share as possible with low prices and high quality. Ford can do that due to their international factories and cheap oversees labor mentioned in Part 1.

**3- Ford-SK Recent Partnership:**

On May 20, Ford and SK Innovation announced that they have signed a MOU for a joint venture(to be called BlueOvalSK) to manufacture battery cells and arrays in the U.S.

BlueOvalSK to produce approximately 60 gigawatt hours (GWh) **annually with potential to expand.** To put that into perspective, By 2030, Ford expects annual energy demand for its vehicles to be up to **140 GWh annually** in North America and up **to 240 GWh globally.**

They are Taking the Battery development seriously from now and preparing to eat the EV market share.

**4- Ford-Government contracts:**

“Ford clearly has business and government fleets in mind,” Autotrader executive analyst Michelle Krebs said.

Ford revealed details of a less powerful version of its upcoming 2022 F-150 Lightning electric pickup for business and government fleets on Monday. Called the Lightning Pro, it’s equipped with a standard battery that’s good for an estimated 230 miles and costs $39,974, the same as the base price for retail F-150 Lightnings.

Ford's vision to lead the EV market has a “no-brainer” component Elon Musk lacks: a vast base of business and government fleet customers it’s targeting with new battery-powered trucks and vans.  Ford’s focus on converting fleet buyers to electric models “builds on the company’s existing strengths and takes advantage of an opportunity created by Federal tax cuts.

^(Ford is in bed with the government and they could easily scoop up most EV vehicle related contracts with their connections.)

**5- Recent EV sales:**

Today, Ford has reported a 184% jump in electric vehicle (EV) sales in May. Overall total sales for May, including EVs and non-electric vehicles, grew 4.1% year on year. Total sales were up 11.3% for the year to date.

Now for the surprising Mach-E(Ford's first EV this year) sales, The Mach-E is eating up Tesla sales. Morgan Stanley shows that Tesla's share of the US EV market fell to 69% in February, down from 81% a year ago. ""Mach-E accounted for nearly 100% of the (Tesla) share loss,"" said Adam  Jonas, Morgan Stanley's auto analyst.

Now for international sales, Mustang Mach-E was the best-selling vehicle of any kind in Norway in May, the first full month of sales. On the other hand, Tesla Model 3 was sixth on the sales list.

Ford is not Fucking Around and they are doing it right in the EV space...

**6- Price Target:**

For the price target details, refer to Part 1.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CRSR about to break through its 3 month sideways cycle. A value-loaded rocket waiting for a little more retail volume to pop. bla bla apes bla bla stupid idiots bla bla not financial advice bla bla intro meme

Real talk, I'd like to reintroduce you to the deep value gaming market stock the world seems to have forgot about (something institutional bears & short sellers have taken full advantage of...and I will explain why)

I've been bleeding out on FDs in sideways trading hell on this for too many months and its about time everybody opens their eyes to the reality this play...and start reaping the inevitable rewards.

In the shadow of the $AMC mega-gains, you might overlook $CRSR's respectable 7% lift this week.  But this movement is actually the sign of a fuse thats just been lit.

I shouldn't have to give most of you too much introduction on the company itself. Corsair was founded in 1994, and has since become one of the global leaders in PC gaming hardware and peripherals.  The company IPO'd last September at \~$15 and made a heroic run up to almost $51 before retreating into a seemingly never-ending sideways cycle. 

The company is 100% legit, it has a proven track record in an exploding industry. Yet…it’s been almost completely overlooked for sexier tech plays. And the institutional bears have been taking full advantage of that. 

This stock is a red-hot ember being pissed on by bears artificially holding the price down, just waiting for kindling to light. That kindling is volume. When it makes a run, it is going to double  almost instantly. 

# Rockstar Fundamentals

Whether you care about the F-word or not, Corsair has been an incredible buy opportunity. Even before the pandemic their revenues and profits were growing.

CRSR is on track to exceed $2bln revenue this year, more than doubling 2019 sales.  Profitability margins have been increasing every year since IPO

They have plenty of cash in the tank, and have been paying down debts. Its held 5% by Insiders, and a whopping 77% by institutional investors.

https://preview.redd.it/r6tc7coxn3371.png?width=836&format=png&auto=webp&s=26e7364054a60f1b492cfcbd2b1fb672c1a77ab6

https://preview.redd.it/8wfy4lwyn3371.png?width=821&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b9bbdf6f4a9971648fa7799d8bcf1b2680e1828

&#x200B;

The company isn't a one-trick pony. Aside from dominating some hardware sectors like Memory, Corsair has been making strategic acquisitions in the streaming space (most notably scooping up Elgato.)

By all accounts, Corsair is making all the right moves and is currently firmly in undervalued territory.

# Months of sideways strangulation by FUD-bears and Shorts.

$CRSR investors have endured many months of maddening sideways trading. For the first few months it seemed like it was trading with the market...and that investors were just waiting to see what happened with some upcoming news.

But after releasing good news after good news, the stock has continued to stagnate, and bounce around in completely unnatural intraday boom/bust cycles. Almost on queue swinging -2% to +2% to -2%  every day.

The reason for this is due to a mix of a very **low float and ridiculously low volume.** These two factors have allowed swing traders and institutional short sellers to play this stock like a fiddle.

CRSR has just **92 M** shares outstanding, and  **26.51M** shares in the float.  Most of the shares are held by institutions.

Short interest has been hovering around 20%. Which is high on its own...but doesn't tell the full story. Big pocket institutions have been selling tens of thousands of shares short in the AM, then covering intraday.

With the low volume, it doesn't take much to push the price down substantially without much ammo.

The big boys have been writing calls / buying puts, and then using shorts and their own holdings to push  the price down before exercise.

Meanwhile, bears have been spreading FUD throughout the investment world about CRSR on 3 primary points. None of which have actually come to fruition.

1. **CRSR is a ""Pandemic Play"", and gaming will magically disappear after things return to normal.**   This is the biggest boomer bs. The pc gaming and esports industries have been absolutely exploding over the last few years. Not to mention the streaming space which has been growing independently of it.  CRSR sales are cyclical like every retail company, but Q1 sales showed no signs of slowing.   Gaming is not going anywhere.
2. **THE SPOOOOKY Lockup period will cause millions of shares to flood the market.** There was tons of FUD spreading about 14 million IPO shares that would become unrestricted for sale back in March. People were convinced that these shares would flood the market instantly and tank the price.  But the lockup period came and went, almost no shares were actually sold.
3. **The global supply chain shortages means CRSR will not be able to grow.**  True, the microchip shortage is a threat to CRSR, but its also a threat to every other company in that space. What they've announced in their reports is that they had MORE DEMAND THAN THEY COULD FULFILL. That is not a bearish signal.  Despite the supply chain woes, CRSR sales dramatically beat expectations...showing they adapted and overcame this issue.

You may also be interested that the latest to join the short party is our good friends at Shita-del, making a short play at the end of May.

# The 59% Earning Beat everybody ignored

While some were expecting lackluster Q1 21 results as the pandemic wanes and supply chain issues rage on, in the May 2021 earnings release CRSR subverted all expectations. They beat estimates by an incredible 59%.  If anybody needed proof positive CRSR could weather the FUD, this was it.

But despite the stellar report, the stock actually DROPPED on the earnings report, and never recovered.

You might be saying ""of course the stock dropped, every tech stock drops on earnings"". Yes, this is true, IF there is a runup in the share price before the announcement. But in this case, there was no runup...the stock had been stagnant and even declining before the announcement.

This is when every retail CRSR holder knew this stock was not making natural movements, it was being intentionally held down.

By every logical account, the stock should have lifted in the weeks following the Q1 results. And because it didn't, the market has been ignoring CRSR due to the very effective FUD campaigns and short seller.

But this also means that the stock has entered deep into undervalued territory.

# LOW FLOAT VOLUME ROCKET

Given all the drama, why should you be looking at this stock? Because the same factors that bears have been using to hold this stock down are exactly what will cause it to take off.

**ALL $CRSR NEEDS TO BLOW IS A LITTLE MORE VOLUME**

The big bears have written calls and puts stacked around the $30-$35 strikes out through the EOY

https://preview.redd.it/t0ujqgdnn3371.png?width=973&format=png&auto=webp&s=1a506a07911ed26f5cbef6624b56a4717068089c

As soon as there is enough positive momentum on this thing from retail, the bearish trading strategies will become ineffective. They will lose a ton of money.

# Breaking Out

CRSR just hit $35/shr today for the first time since early March. This might not seem like much, but its the spark we needed.

I will reiterate, all this stock needs to pop is slightly more positive volume. This stock is poised to blow up fast and hard.  The float is too small, the short-selling tactics will not work when this thing makes a run.

At the moment it can be moved with only about 50k shares volume....averaging under 2 million total volume per day. If the volume increases >2 million or so in a multi day period, its going to run.

As CRSR continues its exceptional performance, it's only a matter of time before it breaks free from the cycle, and it looks like it will happen sooner than later. When it does happen....the shorts will crumble.

\*\*TL;DR\*\* A few thousand more people buy $CRSR the rocket gonna go Pop

If you look at the chart it's been on a slow decline and suddenly hit a solid floor at $31. I don't have Level 2 but I suspect that's the price point for a large investor where it can't seem to pierce that level (zoom in and see it trades almost perfectly flat for hours).  I don't have any insight beyond that speculation, buy maybe someone here can replay with ToS and Level 2 to give us some insight?"

I've been building a value portfolio that tends to have alot of lower volume micro, small and mid cap stocks and I see this across alot of tickers. It makes finding buy points easy but it's nauseating to see a stock price manipulated so freely. For example, UNFI had the same kind of intraday swings you see in CRSR but UNFI seems to have broken out with a little bit better volume as of late. Maybe a sign of hope for CRSR."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Housing Market plays Hey guys, I’ve been trying to come up with ways to make some money off of the impending doom that is on the way for housing. I’m in a unique spot because I can’t really trade options or short term due to my job. I have a 30 day hold as well. So I’ve been thinking about what is coming in the housing market long term as prices are sky high and stock in new homes continues to be built at a rate that I don’t see as sustainable (at least near me) once the prices in new homes taper off. I’m thinking that I should be buying home improvement stores (I’m already deep on LOW) and mortgage companies (TREE maybe?). But these all sound like a housing boom play. Really what I expect is just a lot of people moving around. Not necessarily defaulting, just shuffling. What are you guys thinking? 

I’m also investing in CLEAN infrastructure (NUE) since I think there is big money coming out of Washington soon so if you’ve got any ideas on that LMK."

2021-06-03 23:12:45,wallstreetbets,"Zillow has been on a mission to take over the industry for a long time now. When the National Association of Realtors and local associations allowed Zillow to syndicate from the MLS they were essentially selling their agents out. Agents pay good money for their MLS access every year and by allowing Zillow to get their foot in the door it was a huge mistake in my opinion. 

Now Zillow has brokerage status in a number of states, they are buying/flipping properties, and they are in the process of buying up all of the tools/apps that Realtors depend on to do business. They recently purchased ShowingTime, a showing scheduling tool that is used by most agents, for $500 Million. Who knows what their intentions are, but they have a lot of skin in the game now. 

It could be 10 years, it could more or less. But I believe it is trending in an automated direction where Zillow would like to phase out the agent. Maybe Zillow will have some bullshit salaried ""premier agent"" position like Redfin does which appeals largely to mediocre agents who are okay making a salary and being capped but who knows. 

 In this scenario, you would see a house you like on Zillow, schedule a showing online, show up to the door and scan a QR code on your phone to access the property. An agent wouldn't even be needed to open the door at that point. 

There are a number of ethical questions about that without an agent bound by a code of ethics in the mix but it is definitely something that scares a lot of agents out there."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Tesla Model S Plaid + major delays. I just got a phone call from a Tesla representative over their new vehicle deliveries.  He told me they were experiencing major delays on building the Model S Plaid +.  He said they were specifically having issues with the new battery packs being used for the extended mileage.  He DID NOT say it was a chip shortage issue. Edit:  Delayed deliveries from 2021 to mid year 2022.  1 year delay.  

This leads me to believe the following. 
1. Recent recalls while small are big if they have any fatal accidents from break or tire issues. 
2.  NIO & Fisker are hot on their trails about to release they extended mileage vehicles. 
3.  GM and Ford are both about to get major govt help with funding EV vehicles and we are not sure if Tsla will get any of that cheese.  My assumption is that the left hates Musk. 
4. If Tesla is having extended battery pack manufacturing issues how does this impact their sales, especially with their market share drop today?   

I for one have now canceled my Tesla Plaid + order and will be looking instead to hurry and take advantage of the 179 tax incentive.  

Moral of the story... With the above, should you be holding Tsla?   Let’s discuss."

2021-06-03 20:10:55,wallstreetbets,I lost so much money I started a YT channel to make a shit ton of money to blow on AMC. Need some QPR love https://youtu.be/LYV6-7xraPY
2021-06-03 20:24:08,wallstreetbets,I feel like AMC is going to issue like 5:1 new shares or something to just fuuuuuck everyone. Hope I'm wrong but AMC seems crooked AF.
2021-06-03 21:27:25,wallstreetbets,"That's just speculation.  They are simply taking short interest and stock price at a data point and extrapolating it.  They have no idea what price they shorted at or how many are shorted currently.  And again, they didn't lose anything but interest on the margin until they close their position.  The shorters can actually be profiting if they closed early and reshorted at a higher price.  You guys just assume you caught people that are smarter than you with their pants down again."
2021-06-03 23:13:06,wallstreetbets,So I bought 2 shares of AMC just for the free popcorn. 🤣 I figured how bad could it do? I’m an a-list member already. In at 40. Made some cash. I should dump 1 share. Don’t really care. Wasn’t a big bet.
2021-06-04 11:37:21,wallstreetbets,"Fisker's $FSR CEO has learned from his past and is designing a keeper for next gen EV.   
He duplicating Apple ultra successful business model which realizes the real value add is IP, Design and Strategy. In fact Foxconn Apple manufacturer has signed Fisker up to produce their cars. What is next Apple and Fisker signing a partnership?   
Fisker has billion cash and very flexible and well thought out business model that unlike Tesla $TSLA which has huge fixed costs FSR keep most of their overhead in variable form, just like Apple $AAPL.   
The above may explain why CitiBank, Bank of America, Morgan Stanley tag $FSR with price targets ranging 31 to 40/share. The outlier is Goldman Sachs that published hit piece. Their only logic was to many peers. This published analysis by Goldman should be investigated as it is likely Goldman HF clients maybe the idiots that have shorted 19% of $FSR as much as AMC is shorted.

2021-06-03 20:02:18,wallstreetbets,They only lost 5 billion so far!

Thus killing off firms in the process and their competition. We are all just along for the ride and the cover store.
2021-06-03 22:40:11,wallstreetbets,They are only unrealized losses. They don’t actual lose until they have to cover the shorts with shares that they have to buy. They don’t even want to say GME. 20 mill or bust Kenny boy.

2021-06-03 22:58:40,wallstreetbets,It's all unrealized losses. They are trying to make you think that they've lost and you'll sell but they haven't lost anything until they buy the shares back. Losses on paper don't mean anything.

2021-06-03 23:13:34,wallstreetbets,Is there an alternate world subreddit where everyone is shorting GME and calling themselves diamond hands for not going long?

2021-06-03 23:22:06,wallstreetbets,$5 billion? That's like $5 dollars to hedge funds. They havent bled enough. That's just  a scrape
2021-06-03 23:25:43,wallstreetbets,They only lost 5 billion if they covered. They haven’t covered. This is deceptive and underhanded reporting. What do you expect I guess 🤷‍♂️ this company is owned by the shorts.

2021-06-03 23:42:51,wallstreetbets,Hi Kristina!
2021-06-03 23:43:04,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'll never understand Shorts. It reminds me of the time I was running a crane on a job, I watched a carpenter swinging his hammer pounding in a nail. He missed once and hit his thumb, his hammer stayed in motion and came down and struck his thumb a second time. Then the screaming began. Over the course of several months on the job, I'm surprised he still has a thumb left. I think he hit his thumb more than the nails. DAMN."

2021-06-04 00:11:14,wallstreetbets,Anyone give a guess how much the shirt sellers made in one day though today since both amc and gamestop took biggish falls today after two days of huuuge gains? Need someone smarter or more in the field to explain
2021-06-04 00:13:13,wallstreetbets,I thrown in the towel last time they ran the short squeeze. No point of fighting with the”retarded“ (not my word).
2021-06-04 00:13:29,wallstreetbets,So you’re not gonna put a NSFW flair for these rich people getting fucked?

2021-06-04 00:20:11,wallstreetbets,I don't know how this works but it is fascinating to me.  I hope what it means is the people of reddit  are driving the stock up and rich assholes are losing money.
2021-06-04 00:20:47,wallstreetbets,I like the sound of her tapping her fingers on the table.

2021-06-04 06:22:27,wallstreetbets,"those are paper losses and dont take into consideration indirect shorting like long puts, short calls, stripped etfs, unreported naked shorts, and many more, and does not discount hedge positions.

2021-06-04 08:01:06,wallstreetbets,"you guys do realize whats going on here?

short sellers learned quick from GME, they went long on AMC which was a dying business and has no reason to be mooning

2 birds 1 stone you guys are doing all the work for them, they are using your own tools against you"

Genuine question ive only got $5 dollars how much ramen can i get?  😂"
2021-06-04 02:56:25,wallstreetbets,You think using a social media platform to manipulate a stock price is cool? You shouldn't mess with market fundamentals. I wish this page actually tried to promote reason and investing in value stocks rather than meme stock idiocy. Short sellers aren't the only ones losing billions. You autists are.
2021-06-04 12:19:46,wallstreetbets,"Something’s wrong here… why is this on mainstream news? Mainstream news doesn’t report this kinda stuff. I think we’re being duped here in some capacity.

Maybe there are no more short sellers. Maybe all those hedge funds have actually bought AMC at this point and the news is fabricating reports about “sticking it to short sellers” in order to rally/manipulate the price of AMC"

2021-06-03 22:38:36,wallstreetbets,yep. They'd be stupid to cover. It would be cheaper to pay fees and try to raise capital funds. At this rate it seems like they can borrow infinity moneys.
2021-06-03 21:02:28,wallstreetbets,I wonder why this is not the top post...

Now THIS. THIS is a common goal and we are watching the slow freakout up on their pedastal as their tricks just aren't working on you guys. 

THIS is how you get their attention and THIS is how you stay in their heads rent free. Playing their own shell game against them. It's beautiful.

The laws are meaningless to them because they are rich with all-powerful lobbies and are ""too big to fail"". The social and class order of the United States depends on the rules being malleable to the point of being meaningless to the rich, so there is no guarantee whatsoever that you can expect anything other than to have the entire floor pulled out from under you if you stand on the opposite side of an illegal trade that they are perpetrating such as naked shorting stocks and creating synthetic shares."

However, even if that’s not the case, the interest is trivial in comparison to the 5B they’re talking about in this newscast.

They are not hurting unless they are forced to liquidate."
2021-06-03 21:33:14,wallstreetbets,"As someone who has no idea: They can go as long as their collateral is enough to cover the float. As soon as the margin gets too big they get called and account goea to zero.

2021-06-04 08:04:03,wallstreetbets,"You're not the first person to say this, and you may be right about the premiums.

But maybe, these premiums, for SHFs, go into their ledger and they aren't expected to pay them back until after they close out of the position.  I'm not sure, I'm not a SHF.

If you can show proof of the fact that SHF are actually paying billions of dollars daily in interest, I'd love to see it.  I'd love to know the SHF are losing 5B a day in interest.

We are just snagging some scraps along the way. They said the hedge funds lost 5 billion in a day. Well I seriously doubt that more than a 5th ot that went to retail.

What happened with now in Reddit is bunch of retail cornering, rather than outsmarting, *some* very rich folks who got hubris themselves.
In the process, some other slightly smarted very rich folks, are neither betting on or against these stocks, but are surely already making billions in profit from options and other ways of riding the wild volatility.

The price getting exponentially higher basically turns the play into a value short.

I can't tell you what to do with your money, but replace AMC with GME in that sentence and that's exactly where I was on January 29th. There was a lot of hype but I like to think I can recognize bullshit when I see it, and I was seeing a lot of bullshit. So I cashed out. Of course you already know what happened in the days after the 29th.

At the time in January people were just repeating the same talking points and the only hard evidence they could produce was outdated data. They constantly spread false or misleading info. Like this very thread where unrealized losses are trying to be passed off as real losses. At the time everyone was citing outdated short interest figures despite the fact that the only official data available completely contradicted them. 

They're not doing it on purpose, they're doing it because 99% of people you see on this website are absolutely clueless and have no real idea what is happening. But they are very very confident when they say it. Because they are hearing the same thing from 1000 other people who sound like they know what they're talking about. Someone somewhere read some ""really solid DD"" which of course can't be wrong or outdated or misleading in any way. Notice how people will say ""this feeds my confirmation bias"" on DD posts. Sure, it's supposed to be a joke, but think about it. People believe what they want to hear.

A credit spread can also refer to a type of options strategy where the trader buys and sells options of same type and expiration but with different strike prices. The premiums received should be greater than the premiums paid resulting in a net credit for the trader. The net credit is the maximum profit that trader can make. Two such strategies are the bull put spread, where the trader expects the underlying security to go up, and the bear call spread, where the trader expects the underlying security to go down."

Well, it opened at $20. This pullback is normal and falls in place with expectations. Two major things I'd like to put out that I made in my post last evening:  
"" Tomorrow should if everything is reoccurring and following the trend, be a 30%+ day and probably the highest volume we've ever seen. ""  
We did just that. We hit $20 USD and the highest volume we've ever seen on a daily chart and there's still 1.5 hours left of trading left in the day. Expect a large momentum swing upwards during power hour.  
For all of you that are thinking about pulling out, don't. We haven't even lifted off yet, but we certainly are close.  
The majority of shares were traded at open, this means a large portion of people are sitting $18-$20 USD and will likely be accumulating more on this dip if they are wise.  
Tomorrow's expectation stands. The range will anywhere between $24.75 USD to $33 USD but it is impossible to tell at this point in the game.

Other things I would like to point out on the chart is whenever we've had large openings we have a strong tendency to trade lower than we opened.  
This is of the recent bull (crab) run:

So what I'm trying to say here is, don't be scared of the short term from what you see at open and what happens the rest of the day. The charts will look uncannily similar and so will our movements. BB has not reached its critical mass yet but god damn are these charts looking similar except we are exceeding volume and institutions have put a LOT more money in $BB under the $10 USD price point.

BB's pincer has only begun to take shape. BB still has a lot of room to grow.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"CLNE is taking off!! 🚀🚀🚀🪐🪐🪐 Edit: re submitting with links in comments so autobot doesn’t remove 

Alright smooth brains. You might've seen this weird little ticker called CLNE picking up some steam around here and wondered why. Back in March/April there was a very solid DD done about why this company is poised to grow. Will post link in comments 

However there's been a couple of things that have happened since then that turned this from a solid play into a potential gamma squeeze based off OI that won't send us to the moon...but to Saturn!!! 🪐 🪐 🪐

Amazon (yes that Amazon), made a deal with CLNE to fuel their trucks....and the best part? THEY ALSO AGREED TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY 50 MILLION SHARES (about 5%) AT $13.49 PER SHARE. EDIT: As /u/dazedstate pointed out I completely forgot to add that they ingeniously built their fuel stations next to Amazon warehouses. 

The stock has low daily trading volume. This allowed certain institutions to hammer it down and keep it there (You know which ones they are). But it's also very easy to push around. How easy? Nrdrage was able to send the price up $1 by himself for under 250K as a demonstration.

The Median PT is $20!!!! that's literally double what it is right now!


SO WHAT ABOUT THE GAMMA SQUEEZE?

Based off that DD the OI for June 16C's @13 has reached 25.22K!! This stock has low volume so 2.5 Million shares reaching ITM would send it shooting up even further. Okay but the average volume is 6M...how does 2.5 million in the money drive it up? Because there would be so much demand at one strike price that there wouldn't be enough stock available at that price which would result in HF's and IB's having to do sweep orders to make up for all the calls they sold.....for those of you with more than one wrinkle... that means the price would keep going up and up until they had enough shares to cover their calls!! And once it hit's that level there's so much momentum it'll keep sky rocketing!!

Here's a chart for those of you who like crayons. (In comments)

Thanks to some apes today it has broken out of consolidation. It's tough to see on the chart but the 3EMA has crossed the 8EMA also (stock go up). 

Positions: 60 shares @9.35
4 6/18 13C (picture in comments)

Edit: just to elaborate: you’ll own 100 shares at whatever strike price you bought (if the stock hits 15 and your strike is 13 you buy 100 shares @13)"
2021-06-03 23:43:40,wallstreetbets,Options arent shares. It's a contract to BUY shares at the strike price. So if the contract expires and you don't have the the money to buy the underlying shares you get nothing. If you have the $1300 per contract you can buy the shares @$13 even if the market price is higher.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Navigating this shit without being completely retarded. First off, I don't want to dive into complicated shit because you guys will start staring at the screen and just go look for a post with a rocket and moon emoji.

So many retards are making more than their IQ, it makes me happy as well to know that there are always a revolving door of wives for my wife's boyfriend to choose from. Hopefully I get mine back soon. Until then,

here's a few pointers from a fellow cuck;

If you're going to YOLO, YOLO with a percentage of your money, not all of it. Seriously, please. I've lost a lot of money, when you go on here, you're seeing the 3-4 people a day that made ridiculous money. There are 10,000,000 fucking people on this subreddit. Don't think it's normal to make crazy amounts of money every day. Most people with losses do not post. I for one have lost a lot and I don't post them because fuck that. If I don't take a pic it didn't happen.

***However, let's say you did YOLO, and you lost your dad's retirement.***

Once your dick shrivels and you've come down to Earth you can look at the stock market for what it is....complete degenerate gambling. There is no rhyme or reason. You wish you could have only known AMC would jump 100% yesterday. The people that had all of that money on it probably didn't know what the fuck happened. No one does. While not unforeseeable, the timing is nearly impossible to predict.

Instead of following the weekly trend, the best way to have your moment is to ZERO IN ON ONE STOCK. that means buy shares and a few long options. Once you see the trend start to pick up, put more money in. It's better to learn everything about one quality stock than 1 thing about 1,463 stocks. Humans aren't computers and we don't have the bandwidth to be fucking Zoltar....Unless we're rich enough to make our own waves.

For me that one stock is BABA. I like it, it's true not just for retail investors but for institutional investors as well. There are so many people that haven't touched this stock and it's not a matter of if, it is simply a matter of when. This is broader than a one DD post, you can find a million DD's but this one is fucking easy money. BABA is so underpriced it's embarrassing, it's about the only value stock left, and once people realize it then it'll go nuts. I can't tell you to buy it though, that's just what I'm doing.

I find that a lot of people are learning about stocks so you'll have younger investors mature to look for stocks with more true potential from a wider perspective. This one is one that people will realize as they graduate from the glory days of meme stocks and so forth.

However, I  don't want to get bored.

***SO IN THE MEANTIME***

With a percentage of my portfolio/coloring book, I can play the trends and learn more to keep a vested interest and be in the loop. The trends are great because I find a lot of good moves to profit from quickly. But I get too excited in the mornings.

A little about premarket. 

I Don't buy right at the open, I usually wait a minute.

The premarket doesn't always dictate what happens when the market opens. From my experience, if the premarket is WAY up then when it opens the people will take their profits before waiting for the next dip. The market usually steadies after the first hour and a half or so, if we hit a decline, it tends to jump back up at around midday.

[https://www.thebalance.com/common-intra-day-stock-market-patterns-1031456](https://www.thebalance.com/common-intra-day-stock-market-patterns-1031456)

It's a bit different now since most trading isn't done in New York, however, Market Makers are still a thing and most of them are older and have this shit locked in and a consistent schedule.

&amp;#x200B;

So when you see BB is up 37% premarket, expect some profit-taking before you start buying the top. I've made this mistake COUNTLESS times. 

In terms of AMC and other sentimental stocks, I have no clue, but a good fucking rule of thumb is just to know that if it can go up THAT FAST it can **go down** JUST AS FUCKING FAST.

TAKE PROFITS.

The best way to make money is to sell when shit is going crazy, way up way fast. A good rule of thumb is to make a conscious effort to know what your entry and exit points are. Just as if you'd create a stop loss, create an exit point with what you're willing to part with some of your shares or some of your options.

Don't just wait for the top because you don't fucking know it. You can look at the chart, see how it fluctuates then try and anticipate reasonable entry and exit points.

When an option goes up 4,000.00% the greater fool theory CAN prevail but it doesn't always. I had a NOK option go up 4,000% but there was no buyer. Not everyone is that stupid. Sell at a price that you might be stupid enough to buy it at. Think against your natural reaction. The market moves off of reactions. but it's the ones who push their fear aside that make the dough.

&amp;#x200B;

Ok, done here. Not a financial advisor. 

&amp;#x200B;

K dude, I will see you when you get home from work, btw I moved my Ferrari into your garage next to your wife's Corolla.

**TLDR: don’t YOLO all ur money at once, don’t follow premarket, be careful with meme stonks and have an exit point because you don’t know the top and BABA is a solid buy...for me atleast.**"

2021-06-03 22:22:36,wallstreetbets,"What app is this? Looks better than the app I'm using. 

22 seems a bit of a high ended call. You always need to consider your break even share price, and your time range. At 22, your break even share cost due to the cost you paid for your contract is roughly in the 25.76 area. If you believe it will easily go up above that before then, then kudos. Sometimes, buying a lower dollar call, even though more expensive can be a safer bet for profit, and also a hedge against losses. If you buy close to current stock price, even if it does not go up much, it still won't expire worthless, and if it goes down, you have the ability to sell it before it expires worthless and minimize some of your losses. 

The cost ratio of the contract will slowly go down over the course of time on the contract, even if share price goes up. In example: the cost of the contract at 18 dollars in the morning, will be a better sell price than the cost of the contract at 18 dollars by the end of the day. Even though the share price is the same. This must also be considered. If you intend on a long contract, best to go ones that are months long. Weeklies are better for snap profit and best if purchased on the Friday just before close due to power hours. 

It's difficult to predict what is going to happen 2 weeks out, but it's hard to imagine stock in a good company only going down over the course of say 5 or 6 months, even with bad news. 

That's why I always see people posting either weeklies, or months long contracts, one or the other. DFV made his millions on long term contracts and even exercised several of them to hold more stock in GME, I think at around 150 dollars a share. 

Not financial advise. Do your own research, but as far as BB goes I will say....I like the stock."
2021-06-03 20:19:13,wallstreetbets,"You should be selling option calls on your shares weekly with this enormous volatility. Even the $28 strikes for next week are $2 ($200 per contract). You'd get that plus a 90% gain. I'm about maxing shit out. With 1000 shares, I let

2021-06-03 20:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you sell naked. If you own 100 shares and it sky rockets then you missed out on those gains, cuz you have to sell your shares. But if it doesn't sky rocket then you get the money for that sweet sweet premium when the contract expires.

They've signed some super promising contracts in the past 6 months and are boumcing back after being dropped from Fords infotainment systems. And, Ford still uses Blackberry/QNX software in theor cars, just not for their infotainment systems! 

BB is a legitimate long play that will go to the moon, especially considering they're going to be a major player in the autonomous market, They're already signed with one of Chinas largest car manufacturers!
Blackberry will go to the moooooon by the end of the year, but unlike other meme stonks, it won't fall back to earth."

TLDR: They aren't a phone company. They haven't been for ages. Thinking of them like that is like thinking of Amazon and going ""What, those guys that sell books on the internet?"" 

They do have revenue from a bunch of patents, but the big investment theories in that DD are in cybersecurity. Basically they've been practically *giving away* some of their product to the auto industry for ages; pulling a Microsoft and tossing software around until everyone depends on their shit.

This also gives them money to make the company stronger. These shares as well as the 8m or whatever that was sold the other day were already going into the outstanding share count because they were for the executives of the company. Instead they Sold these shares to the market and are using it to strengthen AMC. I am not sure how that is fucking us.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Anyone know anything about Clovis (CLVS)? I’ve just started looking into them. Haven’t been able to find much out about how they’re running things, but I’m still early on in my research. They are trying to improve cancer treatments and are apparently having some decent success with one of their developments, but apparently shorts have been doing damage. I’ve also seen some posts on other subreddits that some people are thinking squeeze, but I’d rather not jump on board a meme stock that is purely for the memes. I’d still like to see fundamental based evidence that the stock is actually undervalued."

2021-06-04 11:57:54,wallstreetbets,"I have been following this stock recently also. I was looking up $CLOV and came on this accidentally (lol).  
Since I am an oncology pharmacist it caught my eye. Their main money-maker is   
rucaparib (Rubraca), a PARP inhibitor used in ovarian cancer. The competition  
in this space is olaparib (Lynparza, $AZN). In clinical studies they are  
equally effective, however olaparib has lower side effects/better tolerated,  
and thus is preferred product. Rubraca is a solid product nonetheless. Also, researchers  
are finding PARP inhibitors may be useful for other types of cancer so, new  
indications for use will increase sales. Clovis’ market cap is low, and in my  
experience, small companies with a successful product are ripe for  
take-over/buyout by larger firms. I note that even tho analist sentiment is  
negative, calls vastly outnumber puts and OI is very high. If a buyout is in  
the works shorting would be dumb because you will get 3rd degree  
burned; unless it is to depress the price on purpose and you are actually buy  
large quantities of the stock/options simultaneously (note high volume days  
recently) -full disclosure, I am a retard and I don’t know how this would work-  
Also, the ASCO meeting is this week and Clovis is presenting new research, so  
note that a lot company execs for the major oncology players will be together in  
one place."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$RKT options & call sweeps... Hey Peeps,

It's me again. The guy who got lucky with BYND and SNDL. I've taken a lot of profit from $SNDL but I still hold 250 1.5 strikes on the Jun 18 exp. I've sold calendar spreads to lock in gains and managed to pull off a hefty return at 225%. I sold the Jun 11 1.5s and the Jun 18 $2s (spread it on!) to do this. It's an easy way to still allow some upside, but take some money off the table. Do I think $SNDL may continue to grind higher, yes. But I'm down 24k on the year to date, so I've learned the hard way you have to lock in gains when they are given to you. I encourage you all to learn that, but it's usually an expensive lesson to learn.

Let's talk $RKT really quick... I have a scanner that looks for odd options activity and for stocks that have the ***potential*** to gamma squeeze. To do this means looking at options chains for lots of OI and volume. What I want to see is high OI (open interest) and lots of volume on the chain. Another metric is for the short interest to be greater than 15% ($RKT's around 18%, while $SNDL was at 15%). Sadly I'm poor so I have to use [finviz](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=rkt) to find the Short Interest and compare that to my scanner results in ThinkorSwim. It's not horrible, just time consuming.

$RKT meets a lot of these metrics. If you look at the data in ToS you'll see that call sweeps have been happening on the Jun 4th strike, Jun 11, July 16, and more. The options chain and the put to call ratio is a little high at .2, but the short interest is better than $SNDL by a few percent. It's also coming off the bottom of its low point for the year.

Even today there have been a few call sweeps near the ask which is usually a bullish indicator. Given that pretty much every day for the past three days there have been a number of call sweeps I think someone knows what's up. The low float on this one at only 106M (with institutions holding >50% of the float) and the options chains says yes to me.

Finally the gap fill has begun and will likely push up to $22 based on that alone. I'm in for 20 Jun 11th $20 calls. Good luck to you all!

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"OTRK... Can someone smarter than me tell me if I'm retarded? K, so its one of the most shorted stocks out there right now (top 10). It just had a really solid quarter and is in the green and beat expectations. They have a 52 week high in the $90's and are currently trading lows 30's. Most groups have them targeted at 40 to 50.

But the kicker for me is that it has super high short interest AND a very high short ratio of 3.1. For my fellow autists, that is basically how many outstanding shorts divided by the daily volume. Meaning, it would take 3.1 days for shorts to buy enough to cover, and that would require them to buy 100% of the daily volume.

I'm salivating at buying this in hopes of a squeeze. Everything I'm looking at is showing me it could HUGE since the shorts would be fucked in trying to cover.

I'm not even good with this tech analysis stuff, but I am absolutely certain you are all just reading the comments in the Daily jawn and buying what everyone else is..... FINE! I do the same thing..... 

BUT, if we are going to play this ""stock is primed for short squeeze, Apes jump about,"" however you talk about the subject, then please can you choose the right jawn to throw out into the ether?!

INO..... By all the metrics you apply to any of these other memes, this stock makes the most sense. 

You need a stock to be shorted, which this one is. You need low daily volume (this matters because it influences the Days to cover, which I will explain in a moment). You need a small amount of shares to be outstanding, which this one has. This isn't even like insider info, this all on Yahoo Finance right now. 

""Days to Cover"" matters because this means, if someone who shorted this stock needs to purchase shares to cover their positions, they need to go out into the market and purchase those shares. The days to cover metric means, the longer it takes for them to do this, the tighter the ""squeeze"". 

If we want to play this meme game, you want stocks that are shorted, have low volume, have few shares outstanding, and as a result, have longer ""days to cover"" figures. 

INO IS JUST THAT, right now. Long DTC values than any of the others by daaaays. AMCs is at 1, INOs is at 5.9!! You see a guy on the front cover who made $800K in the most random way, and here is your chance.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"WKHS is the most heavily shorted stock, 6/3/21 Workhorse Group (WKHS) As of today, it is shorted at nearly 42% of float. This seems to me to be the next runner from AMC and GME. 

Both GME and AMC were hugely shorted previously when the rallies started, and now that short interest has decreased. It still is there but has decreased and that's why I think we've seen momentum change.

Today, AMC took a massive hit due to the company offering nearly 12 million stocks for purchase which hurt many peoples wins and likely some that hasn't invested sooner. 
Edit: this above paragraph apparently is inaccurate, it was misinformation posted on a news article today that was misleading. Apparently there was no selloff.
Edit 2: renig here. Apparently it is confirmed that the 11.5millipn shares were selling today, which naturally would've contributed to the amc sell off. Multiple news outlets I've found state the same not referencing any April date. This is a discussion post. This is the most up to date and accurate info I can seem to find.

I expect GME and AMC will likely both continue to increase if stocks are held. But based on short interest alone, it would seem to me that WKHS is next in line for the biggest squeeze meaning it has the biggest short term gains to be had.

WKHS was trading for around $10-$11 yesterday and is nearly $15/share currently.

I may be misreading the data. Is the percentage of the float shorted significantly different than volume shorted? When going to Naked Short Report it lists several companies as being lost shorted, for NASDAQ and NYSE, and WKHS is not on the top at all. 

For instance, here’s the data for the past month on Tilray and the volume Tuesday alone was 59.14% shorted. (https://nakedshortreport.com/company/TLRY)

>It makes no sense how BB is so popular with a 7.98% short float

It's almost like short squeezes aren't the only way a stock price can go up. BB is a solid long term play with good fundamentals, it doesn't need a large short float to be a good play.

These are both good plays but it makes no sense to compare the two. They're both looking good for totally different reasons."

If you search WKHS it shows it is shorted at 60% which is high, AMC is less but close at like 59%> I didn't bother looking at many others to comment on.

Overall, the float is what stocks are available for trade (I e. Stocks that can actually be traded, they aren't held by the company or otherwise restricted from trading... They cannot be shorted against). 

So the float volume is what is most significant since it represents how much is shorted relative to how much can be traded. 

Does that answer your question?"

I agree, their dataset seems a bit spurious at times in regards to percentage, but the volume of sold vs bought shares through the day seems to track with data from my brokerage. I'm waiting for a few plays to work out before investing in something like Ortex, and using free sources until then to research new strategies.

I appreciate the response!"
2021-06-04 03:22:47,wallstreetbets,"Simpleish explanation:

In a short, you essentially “borrow” a stock assuming that the price will go down. You sell the borrowed stock immediately, and then, when the price goes down, you buy it back for the new, lower price, and then return it. Pocket the difference. This is usually done in large quantities by hedge funds - which is what people mean when they say “10% of a stock is shorted”. It means that hedge funds have borrowed and sold 10% of the total shares assuming that they will drop in price.

Basically, the funds are betting that a stock will go down. If they borrow and sell, and price goes up instead of down, they must buy it back at a loss. Usually, that doesn’t happen, because they do their due diligence and “short” stocks for companies that are failing. Failing companies usually have lower prices per stock, so a lower barrier to entry for “retail” (individual) investors.

SHORT SQUEEZE: If everyone on Wall Street Bets (10,000,000+ people) realizes that a stock worth only $5 is being “shorted” (assumed to fail) and they all start buying the stock, the price increases. When it starts to increase a little, and it’s cheap, and everyone is talking about it and buying more, it starts to increase a lot. The higher it goes, the more money the “short” stocks are losing (because they have to buy back the stocks at higher and higher prices). Eventually, those hedge funds can’t afford to lose any more money so they start buying stock and closing their short positions, which drives the price even higher, just like when anyone buys stock (price goes up).

Now you have an artificially inflated stock price that will surely go down soon. So those same hedge funds turn around and short the stock again, because if the price is $400 but it should only be $5 based on business fundamentals, they stand to make $395 per share by shorting it. And so, the cycle continues until the retail investors give up, or the hedge funds give up."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BB short interest and potential At this point we all either own $AMC $BB or $GME. We're well aware of the ~21% short interest on AMC and that the squeeze hasn't yet taken place. One of the big criticisms of $BB was a relatively low short interest compared to $AMC. Despite the fact that we all just like the stock I'm interested in the up tick in short interest on $BB. It's gone from 8.6% to 9.7% in a month. In some research today, 21% of the shares traded yesterday 6/2 were short. 

While I like $BB as a company, the Ape in me says this has much more potential than some are giving it. No $BB is not the new golden child that $AMC is and for good reason. But it appears to be the next best suited as short interest is growing and Ape Nation is organized behind hit.

10. Do you like rollercoasters or porch chairs? If you like the latter don't trade

2021-06-04 04:07:58,wallstreetbets,"well here is one reason. You can google the rest. Remember that the premarket trend and price range can take a different course after the opening bell. Getting caught up in a position that backfires ferociously after the open is one of the worst situations.

There tend to be many stop orders during premarket session that are ready to trigger prices after market opens.

The orders can result in tidal waves of momentum against existing positions, which is why investors should close their positions before opening bell.

Think of it like trying to swim in a Tsunami. One min the water is calm and next?  The waves are large, in charge and overwhelming ( like my mom ). This is especially dangerous with volatile positions."

If he holds these contracts until July and the share price is $16.00 he will have lost everything if he doesn't sell. The way to make money on options is to spot a good entry point with low volatility, and sell once the volatility is high.  the best way to learn is to buy options right before earnings reports, and then watch your entire intrinsic value disappear due to volatility decrease.  keep doing that until you've lost like 2 years of income, and then you should have figured out how to work with options."

1. Natural gas is UNBELIEVABLY abundant
2. USA has overcapacity of natural gas 
   1.  DOESN""T rely on foreign nations 
   2. No supply demand imbalance
3. Don't like fossil based CNG> Then there's RNG -  the RENEWABLE form of NG!!!
4. Truckers are waking up to the fact: NG is a more eco-friendly and economical fuel:  
   1. UPS bought 175mm gallons of RNG and have 12,000+ trucks running on NG
   2. Amazon  announced a HUGE NG truck buy last month
   3. MANY others are getting in on this tech because......
5. TRUCKERS WILL NEED TO WAIT AT LEAST 10 YEARS FOR  HYDROGEN OR ELECTRICITY!!!
   1. H2 and EV equipment is still not commercialized
   2. When it will eventually be ready/developed, it will be MASSIVELY expensive 
   3. Fuel (H2) is not cheap enough yet and there is NO infrastructure for H2
   4. EV is ""cheaper"" (if you charge off peak) but you can't get that volume of electricity w/o burning up the current grid, and ....wait for it:
   5. In MOST STATES the  MAJORITY of their electricity IS SOURCED FROM FOSSIL FUELS!

Electric motors are better than ICE, so it doesn't make sense to go NG, then electric in 15 years. Best answer is prep the grid and supply to meet electric demand, as that is absolutely the future. We've got some engineering challenges before Electric becomes the true default, but once those challenges are solved there is no better solution."

Let's talk about a greasy oil company. $VET this mofo was a Canadian junior bellwether that trades on the nasdaq. Saw highs 60$+ before the oil crash in 2016. It has euro natgas as well. It's last earnings beat the streets number to the upside by 10000%

With a running oil price and the likelihood we see 70$+ WTI by end of the month this could be your next big buy. This isn't a meme, so buy long dated calls. I just bought 120x 10c for July. ($0.23) I plan to buy more as we move.

Remember this only takes one big sell side upgrade to get it running. JPM CITI etc. As oil is working, I expect the banks to start filling their positions and then putting out price targets.

The recent turmoil with Iran is ultra bullish, but even if Iran comes back online, this player is still making money.

2021-06-03 22:20:58,wallstreetbets,I’m confused. How do you guys make money if you don’t sell?
2021-06-03 23:10:25,wallstreetbets,If this is true then the vote on june 16th will be a NO and then AMC will skyrocket into 100$

2021-06-04 00:17:16,wallstreetbets,"How much is this 80% in dollar figures?
Do they have different types of shares?  So maybe potentially 80% of class C is owned by retailers, but class A are still with the big firms."
2021-06-04 00:21:31,wallstreetbets,And they are owned by the Chinese and after taking the opportunity to sell more shares to profit from the Hysteria in their shares price

2021-06-03 20:59:38,wallstreetbets,"AMCs CEO is a joke, don’t see why you peasants are cheering him. He’ll get some huge multi multi million dollar bonus for diluting the shares and not helping us one bit (but but we’re getting a free popcorn?!!?). Dumped my shares earlier today as this rides over folks. Move along."
2021-06-04 00:17:46,wallstreetbets,CEO and board is raping y’all w/o the lube doing those capital raises 🥺
2021-06-03 22:52:53,wallstreetbets," So if 80% is owned by retail, how can there be anymore of a squeeze? Sorry guys but $70 was the top."
2021-06-04 04:02:49,wallstreetbets,Please sell at a profit this time. 80% of all shareholders ending up as bagholders being retail investors? That’s sad

2021-06-03 22:07:03,wallstreetbets,I hear AMC is issuing free popcorn to stock holders.  Will it come in the mail or do I have to leave my mom’s basement to get it?
2021-06-04 03:01:23,wallstreetbets,ThTs a horrible state of affairs for AMC. 0 stability.
2021-06-04 01:18:35,wallstreetbets,False its actually institutional ownership. Doesnt take much to do the research.

2021-06-03 20:15:26,wallstreetbets,Hey. Smooth brain here. Im annoyed w the CNBC interview today with the prick from Miller Tabak talking about how AMC is unhealthy? I’m on Twitter now looking for Matt Maley from Miller Tabak and he is nowhere to be found. But I did find the Delano guy tho. But Matt keeps talking about AMC’s RSI and how it hit 100 twice this year and it won’t do it again (or something to that effect) and how this phenomenon is unhealthy for the market. What say you?
2021-06-03 20:25:05,wallstreetbets,Where we thinking it’s gonna go
2021-06-03 20:34:17,wallstreetbets,What you meant was more than 40% of amc shares are owned by option dealers who sold call options to  retail ‘investors’. Another 40% are owned by retail.
2021-06-03 20:53:07,wallstreetbets,Elon need to come and grab that 20% shares and then to da moon guaranteed.
2021-06-03 20:56:40,wallstreetbets,"Owned by the people, for the people!"

2021-06-03 21:26:06,wallstreetbets,"I love to hear it.  Being late on getting in, I hope you diamond hands hold while it drops a bit more to make it more appealing.  I think its going to match the initial climb and drop of GME.  I bought on that high, but have managed to average out for a gain.  So I'll see what happens tomorrow and maybe Monday.  Sold some other stuff to give me cash to buy.  If I truly understand how like limit orders and options worked I might look into it too."

2021-06-03 23:33:13,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip and am waiting on the chips
2021-06-04 07:56:01,wallstreetbets,I bought 5 on the dip yesterday!

2021-06-04 02:21:09,wallstreetbets,I would if I didn’t go all in today
2021-06-04 02:41:38,wallstreetbets,I just said I had a share. They aren’t checking.  This is advertising and to get you to sign up to their emails.

2021-06-03 23:26:56,wallstreetbets,I sold my 40k shares I got at $2 at $10. Damn did I miss out
2021-06-04 00:32:02,wallstreetbets,I did the same but got back in. Today was stressful to say the least.
2021-06-03 22:49:47,wallstreetbets,If fellow investors caused the dip why does our chart look almost identical to GME?
2021-06-04 02:59:30,wallstreetbets,"Already sold, in the first 3 hours this morning."

2021-06-04 11:10:22,wallstreetbets,This didn’t age well
2021-06-04 03:20:55,wallstreetbets,Went to the drive in a lot when I was a kid. I remember every movie I saw at one. My favorites being a double screening of the Muppets take Manhatten followed by Krull. Also watching the last starfighter with a clear star filled night sky behind the screen.
2021-06-04 07:05:04,wallstreetbets,I saw Jurassic park at a drive in. I really can't describe how powerful an experience it was.
2021-06-04 08:36:56,wallstreetbets,Yes!!!! I used to live in Fort Lauderdale and they have this amazing drive thru theatre there’s a crazy flea market farmers market and arcade there. You pull in You tune in to the sound via radio and you can watch in your car or bring seats and sit outside.
2021-06-04 09:46:48,wallstreetbets,Finally get some damn recliners in the theaters too. They still have the old seats that are uncomfortable as hell
2021-06-04 06:42:26,wallstreetbets,AMC should also acquire LiveNation while they're at it. I would love to see AMC become a big name in live events.

2021-06-04 08:20:58,wallstreetbets,"Hold tight,  I wanna buy more but I'm all in too!"
2021-06-03 20:20:25,wallstreetbets,So this I don’t understand...why would hedge funds keep shorting the stock? Are they doubling down on their greed in hopes retailers sell? That seems like a big gamble to save face if thats the answer.
2021-06-04 02:33:31,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-06-03 22:02:46,wallstreetbets,There are 417 million in the float not 417 million short.
2021-06-04 00:13:03,wallstreetbets,It's over 500 million shares
2021-06-04 00:15:07,wallstreetbets,"Can you explain to me what a short on a share is and how continuous holding our shares can cause the stock to rise, I’m newer here and don’t understand, but I’m holding lol"
2021-06-03 20:04:26,wallstreetbets,"Popcorn in the movie theater is expensive, no? If we get that for free, then we get to keep our BIG BUCKS!"

2021-06-03 21:46:21,wallstreetbets,I guess it depends how hard people want to raise that middle finger to the hegies.
2021-06-03 21:48:31,wallstreetbets,Speak for yourself. Because of amc I’m proud to say I made 6 figures. I have the ability to hold for quite awhile and I’m content to do so.
2021-06-03 23:19:51,wallstreetbets,"""People will sell""

GameStop called, they want the last 6 months back lmaoooo"
2021-06-03 22:27:29,wallstreetbets,"It's just smart investing. There's an obvious pattern. Gamma squeeze shoots it shot. If you're lucky you might catch the second shot. After that it's just water circling the drain. AMC shot it's second load and likely won't recover. GME is a great example. After it's second shot it's been oscillating. All you can do is try to ride to wave to a potential 3rd spike, but until goldfish memory investors jump on board it will just slowly trickle down."
2021-06-03 22:41:53,wallstreetbets,"I know retail who sold 7 figures worth today then bought back. Just gotta play the game, don't just hold this shit."
2021-06-03 23:38:39,wallstreetbets,People will but I think that's why it was smart to set the bar ridiculously high at 500k. No way it gets to that level but if you set the bar super high the hope is people hold a bit longer so the stock has more room to grow. Aim high and maybe give the stock more of a chance than gamestop had.
2021-06-04 12:38:43,wallstreetbets,I don't know - look at GME. Been bouncing up and down for months and right now it's still 240+ *for gamestop* Ridiculous.
2021-06-03 22:16:17,wallstreetbets,Nope
2021-06-03 21:45:38,wallstreetbets,"If no one sells, then how do you plan to profit?"
2021-06-03 21:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Waits for dip, dip comes, ape convinced dip means the stock is crap again, invests money in lottery tickets, price rebounds and hits high, ape sees other apes raking, ape grabs grocery money and runs to square box with buttons and hits buy, price drops, ape sells so there is a little grocery money left, ape buys lottery tickets."
2021-06-04 09:49:57,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock, yes this is not sustainable price. But sir this is a casino"
2021-06-03 21:26:26,wallstreetbets,"I think it's lowkey bullish. It's a signal to institutional investors who are long that they don't need to dump their shares, since some of the value of the current shareprice has been captured for them. If the shares were to drop back down now, AMC could buy the offering back for a huge profit, so if you're vanguard or whomever it makes less sense to sell at <40 than it did without the offering."
2021-06-03 20:05:31,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see a random redditor proxy voted onto the board.
2021-06-04 04:38:31,wallstreetbets,"Issuing new shares is the worst thing that can happen for shorters.

It lowers the ceiling on how high the stock can go but it also raises the floor on how low it can go. And the difference in between the floor and the ceiling is all the shorters care about. That is where they make their money."
2021-06-03 22:21:40,wallstreetbets,"Lmao bro we all sold last week. 
I needed some extra cash figure AMC wasn’t making any solid moves anytime soon.. 
story of my life LOL"
2021-06-03 22:22:48,wallstreetbets,But atleast you still made a solid return

Don’t forget short sellers need to buy back all those shares lol"

2021-06-03 21:36:06,wallstreetbets,No. Movies are dead because of streaming
2021-06-03 20:38:37,wallstreetbets,"I don’t want it to be this way but honestly I think this is more people wanting to get rich on few shares and willing the stock to hit whatever arbitrary number they like, versus actual data. It’s still possible of course and might even squeeze but I’m just seeing a lot of wildly untethered expectations."
2021-06-04 14:45:20,wallstreetbets,Have you done any research into the movie theatre business over the last 5 years? Or done any research on their abysmal streaming service? My guess is no. This stock can be manipulated the way it is because it’s a junk company with a lot of attention. That’s a fact
2021-06-04 03:23:55,wallstreetbets,This sounds so beautiful! Imagine playing Initial D on a drive in screen.

Thinking this through to the end makes it really obvious that it's pure BS, almost no one will actually pull out at a high price and make the money they're seeing in their depot, because asks at the top will be insanely thin."
2021-06-04 08:36:28,wallstreetbets,Because no one new will want to buy it once the shorts are covered?  The value will be entirely theoretical at that point: no one wants to buy and no one who has it wants to sell.  What is it worth?

2021-06-04 00:42:03,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street borrows 80% of the shares to short sell them. Retail buys all of those. Retail owns 80% of the shares, Wall Street owes 80% of the shares to the people they were borrowed from. I’m not saying this is what happened, just explaining what that guy meant."
2021-06-04 00:45:22,wallstreetbets,"Edited for more concise information.

Disclaimer : I'm a dumb monkey as well. Not financial advice. Super dumb summary.

TL;DR In stocks normally the more the companies stock increases, the more value your investment stock is. So when you sell it, you got more than what you used buying that stock.

Shorting is the opposite, you buy stocks hoping that the stock value drops. You do this by ""borrowing"" a stock then selling it, then once the stock price goes down, you buy the same stock and return it to the person you borrowed from. Thereby getting income from the initial sell.

So why did meme stock happen? To TL;DR badly, some people here heard the news that an investment company will try to short Gamestop and AMC (To bankrupcy if possible) so to counter it, a lot of people convinced other people to buy Gamestop and AMC stock.

So the stock price goes up. This is a bad scenario for the short(er) because they will need eventually to buy the shares they sold. So its a loss for them. So they will try to do anything to convince people to sell those stocks so the price will go down. (This one is much more complicated.)

So its a downward spiral for these shorters if the stock price keeps getting higher.

> In Investopedia's words :

> An investor borrows a stock, sells the stock, and then buys the stock back to return it to the lender.

> Short sellers are betting that the stock they sell will drop in price. If the stock does drop after selling, the short seller buys it back at a lower price and returns it to the lender. The difference between the sell price and the buy price is the profit."
2021-06-04 08:39:50,wallstreetbets,I think what you're describing is happening right now.  $50 for a with no future and no where to pivot?  There's already a squeeze going on for it to be this high.
2021-06-03 22:49:32,wallstreetbets,Everyone’s a genius in a bull market.

2021-06-03 22:50:36,wallstreetbets,For sure. I'm pretty sure half the cheerleaders actually believe in a moon shot and the rest are just hoping to get back to the peak they fomo'd into.
2021-06-03 22:57:37,wallstreetbets,"That's how it starts. Once people get the bright idea to trade back and forth, those profits gotta come from somewhere. Amateur traders get burned and drop out and the price falls into dips that burn more traders who weren't prepared and end up holding the bag on something they were expecting to flip."
2021-06-04 16:02:19,wallstreetbets,Game Stop wasn't a failing business so much as a declining model with a management team that was happy to funnel profits to shareholders until it was ready to close up shop. Cohen came along and shook things up. 240+ is certainly way above what it should be but at least GME has a real future out of all the meme stocks.

2021-06-04 06:22:49,wallstreetbets,"What’s worst is- 
I sold all my GME last week too at around 190$

2021-06-03 20:29:07,wallstreetbets,"They issued 20m shares this week that were already going to be in the outstanding share count because they were going to executives. They instead sold on the market on a day with way above average volume. Everyone is thinking that this is super bad when it has such a small impact on price. This also raises money for them to strengthen the company. Also they are literally out of shares to issue, yes they are calling a vote for 25m shares but also will LEGALY not be able to use them until next year if they even choose too, and we would have to vote yes to give them the shares to issue anyway. If we walk out now it would be even more sus, Yes there are other investments that look really good ATM but AMC is looking the best imo.

2021-06-03 21:12:14,wallstreetbets,Many people live in big cities right? Those people like movies right? Some of them may even appreciate a big screen and excellent sound quality right? Because when you live in the city even if you could afford to dedicate a room to be the home theater room you can't turn up the sound without annoying the neighbors. Movie theaters aren't going away. No one wants to stream the next Avatar or Star Wars. Families need to take the kids out of the house. AMC isn't going anywhere.
2021-06-03 22:24:09,wallstreetbets,They can make dating great again. Movie theaters are awesome. Just need to make those popcorns and drinks cheaper.
2021-06-03 20:07:18,wallstreetbets,They're making that up. They dont know if the % different than what's reported. They have no concrete proof

2021-06-03 22:25:11,wallstreetbets,"So you think people just sell and what they just don’t trade? Lmfao you’re funny dawg you and all them other fudders. You’re smoking crack if you don’t think hella people made 6 figs yesterday, sold, and then bought today’s dip. You’re silly as shit. Many people are content to hold now cuz they’ve gotten a piece of that pie."

Is it possible?"
2021-06-03 21:56:41,wallstreetbets,I think they should ride the post covid reopening wave wit in person dating type promo. Maybe do somthing with one of the apps. Steal and rebrand Netflix and chill as somthing better and safer at theaters. Make the home stream seem low effort broke ass date. Date night at the movies seems so old it could be new again.

2021-06-03 20:16:24,wallstreetbets,No stock is reported to be over 50% shorted. Where do they get this secret info that proves its 140%. They would need inside info from every HF involved to prove that HFs were lying in a report to the federal government.

I'm here for the stock and the return of epic movie theater popcorn I don't care what everyone else does buy or sell, but AMC hasn't been anywhere near $40 for your scenario to have ever played out."
2021-06-03 23:31:44,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. They're getting a ton of free advertising right now. They need to capitalize with those type of marketing campaigns while they still have some buzz, and keep their name in the headlines for as long as possible... They were given a rare opportunity, we'll see soon enough if they have some fight in 'em like GME, or if they roll over and die a slow death over time under the same model... Early signs lean to the latter, but we'll see."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$BABA - Unbiased Technical Analysis - Wen Moon? ***TL;DR -*** BABA is stuck in a mid-term downtrend - but it's still holding onto it's long term uptrend.

Upon a weekly close above **228.50** \- I would like to enter targeting **245.85 --> 277.04 --> 300.00 -** but until then it **isn't safe.**

\-----

Lots of people everywhere are constantly asking when it's finally time to buy back into BABA - so I figured I would provide a quick roadmap:

[$BABA 1Y 1D](https://preview.redd.it/hp17ldzet2371.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=7c421bd711380e9ade6936bd654839e1b03ee12c)

It's been stuck in the same **descending channel** for nearly a year now (\~10 months). The fact of the matter is - until it breaks this **the trend is clearly down** and in my opinion - longs are not favorable.

But - because this trend has extended for so long - we need to zoom out some more:

[$BABA 5Y 1W](https://preview.redd.it/louay53ot2371.png?width=2225&format=png&auto=webp&s=5991348de2ff0df29ad4825bd7284843649209a5)

On the 5 year weekly chart - we are actually still in an **uptrend** dating back to 2019 or so. We tested this the week of **5/10** and caught a nice bounce - although we are rejecting now. 

This is important because - for the entry I'm giving - we **need to be above this yellow line.** It's sitting around this key level @ **208.88 -** so keep an eye on that. 

If we do lose that line first - expect a much larger drop to **192 --> 176.**

For an entry - we are looking for a **weekly close above the teal line -** it's **sitting around 228.50** currently - and will slope down each day (by about \~**0.90**).

From there I would target **245.85 --> 277.04 --> 300.00.**

The timeframe on this move would be **3 - 6 months** \- but I expect the uptrend to persist for some time if we get the reversal."

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$TELL Short Float, Squeeze Incoming?  I'm seeing more and more posts about $TELL on WSBs recently. I think it is noteworthy that in spite of $24billion in deals signed in the past week, the price does not reflect the contracts signed.

[TELL Deal News](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tellurian-signs-10-lng-agreement-114604537.html)

If you look at the chart for $TELL pre-covid, you see that it was trading at $8+. This was while the company was in debt, and had no deals. There is absolutely no reason that this should not be trading well above $8 right now.

$TELL is being shorted, and is in prime position for a squeeze. The big boys are trying to manipulate this and make a quick but before the inevitable run to $10+.

Charif Souki is not to be messed with. He brought a lot of staff over from Cheniere ($LNG) to build a competitive company. Tellurian's 5 year plan is to construct a plant to produce 3x the amount of LNG than Cheniere.

This is a golden opportunity stock that is primed and ready for a legendary run. With a little more publicity, and some meme magic, we could not only fuck the Hedgies, but also support the growth of a company that is going to be one of the biggest players in the industry.

I manage a private equity firm and we are all in on $TELL. You can check my post history for proof.

Our PT is $10 by EOM and $30 by EOY.

Get in while its cheap.

Green and renewable energy is all that just about every long haired, guitar playing boyfriend my wife brings home has talked about so if the kids are into it these days, who is in the right place to capitalize on that change? Lets take a look at some of the top sectors that are in the running.

**Solar** \- A million players in the game and the price on installation right now, buyers don't see payout for over a decade.  It is priced over the head of most retail buyers, the government subsidies are expiring by the day, and most politicians aren't gonna be holding office in the same city by then so they hardly give a shit, and neither do the old boomers voting for them. Also highly dependent on battery tech which is a whole other hurdle, and energy density is terrible (read, not ideal for moving things, ie cars/trucks) **Wait for change up.**

**Wind** \- Huge windmills are great, but those things are isolated to the middle of know where and can't get anywhere near the big cities that actually consume any sizable amount of power and are dependent on a stable power grid and if its too windy they have to shut them down anyways because of how fragile they can be. Same battery issue as Solar. **Pass.**

**Hydro** \- Similar problem to wind except even worse because if there isn't a bunch of flowing water near you, shit out of luck. Only so many places hydro is even worth setting up, and most have been tapped into for decades. Same battery issue as Solar and wind. **Hard Pass**.

Have I been edging you along enough?

**Natural gas** \- I know what you are thinking 'BuT tHeRe iS cArBoN iN tHaT!!!1!11' And congrats retard, you must have paid a little bit of attention in Chem 100 and weren't entirely distracted by Stacy's knockers from across the room. Other massive benefit is energy density, meaning it has high viability to heavy shipping, unlike the electrical energy forms mentioned previously.

Here's what is great, natural gas and be produced carbon neutral.  Better yet, it can be produced from literal garbage. Better yet, there is a company doing this already. Better yet they have been doing it and they are doing it at a profit. Not a government subsidized profit like every solar company or like TLSA, but this company actually makes money.

**CLNE**

Clean energy fuels corp is currently sitting around a 3.5B Market cap and trading between $8-10 a share, and the options premiums trail off hard and fasts. ATM options AFTER EARNINGS are going for near $1.50 a contract and earnings are not until September.

Last Earnings Report summary. They beat earnings, raised forward guidance, and increased their profit margin. The other great thing they have going for them, natural gas infrastructure is already in place, and so they are already compatible with any location that has the infrastructure in place, and they can turn their dump into a power source while also remaining carbon neutral today, not 20 years from now. It is a unique company in a unique space that has an established track record for success and plenty of room for growth.

**Technical's**

It has been in a descending channel since February and has met up with the 200 day SMA (Red Line) and bounced off of it. With that there has been a similar crossing of the MACD and steady rise in the RSI, in addition to some serious price consolidation. Daily price candles make Peter Dinklage look like a monster. Nothing too fancy here to be honest, mostly just price consolidation leaving the options dirt cheap, and the underlying ready to explode with a few positive trending signals.

**EDIT** It has exploded since this draft, so the options are no longer dirt cheap, LEAPS (6mo - 1 year) or shares are probably the way to play this. If you're bold and the ape brigade piles on, Jun 18 exp has a shot up to low teen strikes.

**Who else is buying?**

If you aren't already checking Whale Wisdom, and open insider to spot large buys or insider buys, you probably should be since I know your wife isn't distracting you. It's not as fast as a Bloomberg Terminal, but it can put you ahead of most the retail schmucks out there like you that wait for DD from someone else who is nice enough to share it with you.

Sadly, Open insider doesn't give much to work with, but based on share totals, most everyone in the company is Jacked to the tits on shares so I am not too surprised to see them unload since its climb the last year either to get some play money to diversify or to prove to their wives that she doesn't need a boyfriend anymore.

Whale wisdom is showing nothing but buying for the last quarter. And ferocious buying at that,  24% increase in the number of funds holding, 20% increase in 13F ownership to 38% of the float, 50% increase in new positions, 50% increase in growing positions, 70% increase in calls with only a 3% increase in puts. So simply put, institutions are loading the fuck up.

**Price Target**

No specific date, but around $25. Sets it up near a 12B market cap, which considering addressable market with large shipping vehicles seems well attainable. Plus most things are trading miles above what they should be anyways, so a $25 conservative estimate should hold up well.

**Positions**

1100 @ 9.53 w/ limit orders to buy more on dips

20x Jun 18 12c @ 1.03 (sold 6/4 at 1.50)

4x Jan 22 11c @ 2.85 (sold 6/4 at 3.50)

\*(was previously 20x June 18 13c @ .55, sold on AM runup, bought back in a lower strike, depending on price action for the next week or so, planning to trim these for either shares or LEAPs exp Jan 22, 10-14 strike depending on what looks good if/when volatility fades.)

\- First DD post, constructive criticism on stuff would be greatly appreciated. Thanks Retards.

**EDIT**: Position update

**EDIT 2/Update:** In case anyone it watching this post. Sold off calls on the open today (6/4) Converted it all to shares (Previously 800 total), giving up a little leverage to get rid of Theta and didn't want to be long Vega on these options. "

CLNE has no fingers natural gas drilling or land/mineral rights.

Is natural gas the next step to truly green energy? Yes. Is CLNE the right way to go about investing in it? Probably not.

There are definitely bearish factors here as well - CEO is not too big on self-promotion IMO which doesn't play well in today's market for one - but if you're willing to look at some of the non-ape DD on this, there is a lot of smart money on this and the upside IMO far outweighs the downsides both short-term and over the longer time horizons."

That doesn't mean that you can't still gain big gambling on 13s or 12s, it's probably decent given the hype and potential ramp up, but it will cost you real money to gamble - and that's exactly what it is - a gamble."

Personally im insanely bullish on tlry already had become one of the staples in my account due to its insane gains from its 52 week low of 4.41 to a high of 67! I rode the last wave and i think this one will go much higher with the amount of players involved in a sector that doesn’t have may other solid opinions after tlry’s merger.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Technical Analysis of Key Support and Resistance Levels: $69 and $420 &#x200B;

[AMC Technical Analysis](https://reddit.com/link/nrh880/video/ymh0w4an75371/player)

The conflation of key price targets at fibonacci retracement levels have created a VWAP skew that is at least two standard deviations from the slow stochastic indicators.

Technical analysis of the short interest shows us that mass adoption of momentum based options strategies, especially those employing double diagonal straddle-strangle swaps with near-expiration put targets, creates a self fulfilling support level at $69.

Investors may consider hedging positions by selling bear put credit spreads on a rolling expiration basis, while dollar cost averaging into their position to achieve a $69 cost basis.

This position should be held long term, with a high price target of $420.  Would welcome a peer review on my analysis.

2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TELL and SNDL I'm new to the whole stonks game, have very little cash to burn, and have little knowledge of the market.  


I've also bought into TELL, 52 shares @$2.76. Gots a little green + so I'm happy. Looks like this is going to be a good long term investment. They've announced a few new deals, so I hope they'll do some good things. I'm going to buy some more of this in the next little bit.  


SNDL is one that I'm looking at. I worry though about the whole cannabis market. @$1.26/share looks very intriguing, but, some WSB are trying to get it a meme stock. Nothing against gains, I like money. I just worry about investing in stocks because people are ""to the moon"" on everything. Stocks rise and fall, I get that.   


Not sure if this will get deleted because of this question, but, what are your folks take on these two stocks? Good investments? Too early to tell? Or just another ""to the moon"" meme?"

2021-06-03 21:06:57,wallstreetbets,I second this.  It’s a legit good prospect with far more upside than downside.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The $BB resistance is a good sign 🚀 DD refresher BB's climb today hit $20 before slowing down and dropping back to $15, this is only natural when paper handed baka's sell off their positions for a measly profit.

BlackBerry is only beginning its journey, and the fundamentals back this up.

QNX Software - is already being tested out by automakers like Volvo, for use in their industrial vehicles. Where self driving tech is expensive for civilian cars, it could pay for itself when applied to truck convoys and public transport.

IVY - linked in with BlackBerrys autonomous vehicle software, IVY is a way of collecting driver data to further help consumers even after buying their vehicle. Information on thing like acceleration and braking,  safe lane merging etc; drivers that drive safely could be offered discounted insurance prices. This data is also highly promising to help with accident insurance claims proving what driver is to fault.

Cylance + Cyber Sevices - basically SkyNet, proven to be extremely effective in the field, and constantly evolves to prevent threats before they strike.

2021 5G Phone - Not talked about much, but a new BlackBerry mobile phone is slated for a late 2021 release. Only phone releasing with a physical keyboard, runs Android and boasts decent specs at a $500 price point.

**-- TLDR --**

**BB's price is no where near its potential value; and in a market based on prospective sales and market reach, its 3x under its deserved price.**

Edit I - added in IVY potential."

2021-06-03 22:23:59,wallstreetbets,Overnight market buy? True retard right here lol
2021-06-03 22:04:17,wallstreetbets,I did the same thing. I was super annoyed. I should’ve waited and bought it the 13.48 dip this morning.
2021-06-04 00:33:04,wallstreetbets,"two words of advice for next time.

1. go to [nasdaq.com](https://nasdaq.com) or some other site, check the BB ticker for the price or if you use Questrade check the bid/ask price 
2. never use market buy on volatile stocks, or really any stocks for that matter.  If you reeeeeally want a stock at X price then maybe put a limit buy a bit above that price, but it avoids overlimit buys like you had :/"
2021-06-04 02:32:41,wallstreetbets,"Dude, never leave a market order overnight...  If anything, a limit - things happen on wallstreet at light speed."

No big deal. It'll be above $19.5 tomorrow instead. I bought the dip later so I'm actually cost basis $17.5 right now. Easy money tomorrow."
2021-06-03 23:08:15,wallstreetbets,dont shake the baby
2021-06-04 02:34:02,wallstreetbets,"The market buy is moreso just a lesson for always when investing.    But yes my AMC option tanked today.  Down from 2000 to 400 :/.  And after tonights AM, prob 200."
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"It's BATTLING right now boys. If $AMC can break through 55 EMA resistance and remain above there should be an upward continuation! 🚀🚀🚀 (not financial advice) &#x200B;

[15 min chart](https://preview.redd.it/k4hghl5jq2371.png?width=1296&format=png&auto=webp&s=0b6a46bfb4aa7f7b949058cc3b680c425935e3dc)

**EMA (Exponential Moving Average) significance:**

EMAs are one of my favorite indicators that I use to follow ""trends"" of a stock. It is darn near impossible to predict EXACT dates, prices, etc.. but EMA's allow a trader to notice trends and possible reversals. All stocks have a tendency to deviate toward the mean whether it is a crazy upward advance or sell off, and then will draw closer to the mean eventually. And in this case after a huge run up like that the price will settle a bit but as long as it stays above the EMA it will continue up. The stock has been above the 55 EMA on the 15 min chart since $12.44 and if it fights to get back above which it looks to be doing then I am seeing an upward to continuation (hopefully). But remember I am smooth brained, this is not financial advice.

🚀💎✋HOLD STRONG!"
2021-06-03 21:38:44,wallstreetbets,">EMA on the 15 min chart

Christ. So many of you truly retarded smooth-brains are gonna be bag-holding if you think EMA on the 15-min chart means anything whatsoever. Holy fuck."

2021-06-03 21:52:18,wallstreetbets,"Hey dumb butt, after this post the price did explode through the 55 EMA and made a run up to $68 as expected before getting rejected and then continuing back down. The 15 min chart is an effective tool for short term if used correctly."
2021-06-04 19:56:15,wallstreetbets,Read the title carefully. IF the price can break through the resistance. It did for a short time and then fell back below. Wasn’t strong enough to stay over hence the downward movement.
2021-06-04 19:57:54,wallstreetbets,If you were following the post after I posted it the price broke through the resistance at around $46 and it did explode up to $68. If the momentum continued we would be on the moon but it did not. Support fell and here we are.
2021-06-04 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AMC: EVERY ONE SHOULD READ THIS MORNING’S 8-K FILING AMC now down -25% after warning in an 8K filing this morning:

1/ Would issue 11.5M new shares equity (2% dilution) after issuing shares (1.7% dilution) Tues to Mudrick Capital @ $27/share

2/ That AMC’s stock price “reflect market and trading dynamics unrelated to our underlying business….”  

3/ Cautioned against investing in $AMC stock “unless you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.”  

4/ Cautioned against potential losses from a short squeeze “as prices decline once the level of short covering purchases has abated.”  

Companies issue disclosures like this when issuing new equity, especially if they think their stock has become unhinged from fundamentals, to avoid almost certain security fraud class actions if the stock price falls."
2021-06-04 04:19:50,wallstreetbets,Dude go back to your Wall Street firm and tell them we are holding. We get it they sending you college graduates thinking you can persuade us to sell but we ain’t. Nice try.

""On June 3, 2021, AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc. (the “Company”) entered into an equity distribution agreement (the “Equity Distribution Agreement”) with B. Riley Securities, Inc. and Citigroup Global Markets Inc. as sales agents (each, a “Sales Agent” and collectively, the “Sales Agents”), to sell up to 11,550,000 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of the Company (the “Common Stock”), from time to time, through an “at-the-market” offering program (the “Offering”).""

On Citigroup: https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/citadel-securities-acquires-automated-trading-desk-assets-from-citi-300268991.html 

Citadel Securities bought their market making assets years ago, take it what you will but you're playing against the house here.

I'm gonna be real with you retards, it's all fun and games until shit starts blowing up and the game was never made for you to have fun. You can play, but you're not gonna win. Some of you did obviously, but just as many if not more of you are bag-holding. 

CEO Adam Aron of AMC goes on twitter and tries to become Elon Musk for y'all, offering free popcorn and shit, I must be off the deep end. These people are exploiting most of you trying to get rich quick and the other retards with gains are the same. You play at your own risk and there is no cheat code. AMC keeps running the way it do, the institutions will short, dark-pool, create more shares and dump, and at the end of the day it will be you retards left without pay for your mortgage, not the house. 

Just in the last 5 days, AMC has offered 20m+ shares indirectly to retards here, thorugh capital firms and banks, adding over 500m to their balance sheet - while you are left holding bags for memes and free popcorn.

Imagine thinking these people who can create or own hundreds of thousands of shares are not trying to take your money when AMC is anything above $10, and actually care about you in any capacity besides your potential for their profit.

You have been warned. Don't go full retard."

2021-06-04 11:38:08,wallstreetbets,"I used to shit on Roblox for being a shitty game back in the day. Som buddies would play Roblox CSGO during highschool CS classes. It continued to grow despite all the hate it got from people like me. Kids love that shit, my younger sister played Roblox before COVID and will keep playing it afterwards. It's not only children playing Roblox either, there's fun to be had for all ages. 

It doesn't have the best graphics, but there are so many game creations under every genre. It's many kids first introduction to gaming, if your parents don't let you play Valorant or COD or whatever's big at the moment, you can play a similar game in Roblox. The possibilities are endless really. Parents used iPads as a parenting tool before COVID and they'll keep using them after. You can't say it's a fad if it was already big and has only kept growing for years."

2021-06-04 11:35:22,wallstreetbets,"Will the answer to your question on retardstreet  a) help you make a sound and calculated decision to buy in or move on to the next stock, or b) decide the size of your leverage bet on the stock?"
2021-06-04 17:27:37,wallstreetbets,"actually both. i'm trying to see the risk-reward level of investment in general, and with the apes specifically too lol. i understand the concept of investing, you can either grow or lose your money over set amount of time. investment is not a ""if i invested today i will be rich within a week"" kind of thing, that i know. but still i can't help but to try and learn how do people predict the market, know which stock will go up, which to invest in etc. i know my retarded question is too long, and i'm sorry for that, but can't help being a noob haha."

2021-06-04 11:56:15,wallstreetbets,"Share price alone is not what makes something a penny stock. $TELL was founded in 1988, has a market cap of over $2 billion, and has a daily trading volume of over 13 million. Also its share price was over $6 pre-pandemic when a lot of the energy companies tanked. Need I remind you that AMC had a share price under $2 as recently as this January? 

 A penny stock is usually a new, small company with low trading volume and a low share price."

2021-06-04 12:09:44,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-06-04 12:33:09,wallstreetbets,"At open today, it had a share price of $5.33 and with 386.59 million outstanding shares that gave it a market cap of $2.06 billion, which meets the definition of a mid-cap company.  

Penny stocks are loosely defined, yes, however the term is typically used interchangeably with micro-cap company, not small-cap. A micro cap company has a valuation between $50 and $300 million. 

If you only want to consider market cap, AMC met that definition in 2020 because from March to December it had a market cap under $300 million.  Okay, maybe WSB is pushing penny stocks, but that would mean they always did.  I wouldn't have considered AMC a penny stock because by other criteria it doesn't fit the definition -- it was a well established company with decent trading volume and fairly low volatility. 

Penny stocks also are typically marked by lots of price volatility. There's not a whole lot of volatility with $TELL.  Share price fell off a cliff in March 2020 and remained depressed until recently."
2021-06-03 23:00:01,wallstreetbets,what do you do exactly

2021-06-04 05:22:54,wallstreetbets,"What about everything else I just said? What about a key factor in the rise of electric vehicles being a push for greener energy? Surely they would diminish use of NG in the future at some point. 

Seems like you’re targeting little details and ignoring my other points. You’re arguing in bad faith bud."
2021-06-04 09:17:02,wallstreetbets,"The key factor in the rise of electric vehicles isn’t the social demand for green energy (which is entirely top down.) the demand for electric cars is due to the economic and functional advantages that electric cars have over gas cars. 

And even if that were the case that the demand was due to environmentalists, NG is among some of the “cleanest” energy sources out there"
2021-06-04 09:31:51,wallstreetbets,"There are many factors that contribute to the rise of EVs, and I’d argue a demand for greener energy is a large one. Right now, EVs aren’t very economical, but I believe that will soon change. 

NG is a cleaner burning fossil fuel compared to a lot of the other fossil fuels, but it is still non-renewable at this current stage and still produces pollutants. There are greener ways to produce electricity and that increasingly becomes important as our Earth heats and deteriorates from our pollutants. 

My point still stands. I’m willing to bet that in 30-40 years NG will be less in demand than it is currently today. You keep picking at details but seemingly ignore my initial premise."
2021-06-04 13:01:04,wallstreetbets,Calling fossil fuels non renewable is really old science. The world is constantly generating more oil and we’ve hard begun to italics what we have already.
2021-06-04 13:06:41,wallstreetbets,"We keep finding more oil, but no one seems to know when that will run out. It’s non-renewable in the sense that we rely on finding it and we seemingly don’t know when that will run out. 

Another huge con of fossil fuels, arguably the greatest, is their contribution to polluting our planet. 

But I digress. 

You keep commenting on minor details and have yet to argue my original premise in a convincing manner. You can keep arguing in bad faith to yourself if you’d like, but I’m done replying if the conversation doesn’t move forward."

9.20 is a good price. I bought at 9.30 today and felt really good about it.

If the gamma squeeze triggers the price will shoot up. You can either keep your shares as a long term play or sell that price spike and buy back in in a week or too when things settle down."

2021-06-03 21:14:41,wallstreetbets,I was there too! My parents both worked at RIM at the time and brought me there. My first time in the AC Center. We were a first gen immigrant family and RIM basically raised me. Seeing BB moon these days really brings a tear to my eye 😂
2021-06-04 03:48:24,wallstreetbets,"Before I averaged down I was at that exact price basically lol. I averaged down to like $18. Sold for a slight loss, but I went ahead and rebought the stock right before close at like $15 and it’s near $17 on Europe pre market. If it blows up 30% at open again - not only did I save a day trade - but I’ll have made back all my losses too. Which I didn’t foresee happening for sure."
2021-06-04 00:16:14,wallstreetbets,"Ron...Here in Wallstreetbets, they historically focus on options trading.  They are asking “should I buy a call option that expires September 17th with a strike price of $43?” You wouldn’t be able to know it’s going to go up to that share price unless you own a working crystal ball."
2021-06-03 20:36:39,wallstreetbets,Are you talking about THE Heather?
2021-06-03 23:58:15,wallstreetbets,Mm idk
2021-06-03 20:03:38,wallstreetbets,You gave me a cause far greater than money. My wife’s boyfriends ex girlfriend gets half of it anyway.

2021-06-04 06:43:02,wallstreetbets,Probably best to ask someone smart.
2021-06-03 20:28:04,wallstreetbets,My dude I'm sorry. They needed someone better. You understand right?
2021-06-03 22:12:17,wallstreetbets,so many accounts with no posts just randomly posting about $BB 🤔
2021-06-03 23:02:23,wallstreetbets,I’m in at $19 too. Not worried at all

2021-06-03 20:19:27,wallstreetbets,I bought the dip and recovered a ton at $16 im even 7k shares. Liquidated portfolio.

2021-06-04 03:18:55,wallstreetbets,To all of you guys BULLSHITTING here. They used the 20m shares that they allowed to reward to management in April prospectus to sell 8.5 m to Mudrick   And 11.5m to market to raise equity for the company. They could have used it for management rewards but they chose to make the company stronger. YO FUCKER miss the rocket ship just wanna attack.

2021-06-04 10:00:25,wallstreetbets,Yes 25 million represents 5% of the float if the voters vote approve it. They can't use them for another 6 months no matter (can't use any new shares in 2021). It took him 9 years to use the last amount of shares they approved. I'm not even worried about this 25.
2021-06-04 09:58:13,wallstreetbets,Thats next year retard.

2021-06-03 20:32:41,wallstreetbets,Why are you still using Robinhood?
2021-06-03 20:41:49,wallstreetbets,AMC @$50 seem high until it reaches $100 and you regret not buying it @$50
2021-06-03 20:48:29,wallstreetbets,And that's why market orders are for chumps
2021-06-03 20:49:02,wallstreetbets,Retail holders over 80% now hold the line
2021-06-03 20:57:25,wallstreetbets,Volatility is expected
2021-06-03 21:01:55,wallstreetbets,Hold the line.
2021-06-03 21:05:46,wallstreetbets,a way to cover a short is to get a price to move big then double your bet and make it all back. they are rigging the price to make it all back quick. if it goes strait up or down they would go bankrupt.
2021-06-03 21:13:29,wallstreetbets,How does someone know if the stock is only in a dip or on its way down?
2021-06-03 21:34:31,wallstreetbets,open market orders are a bitch when others have limits above yours.

Privateer holdings dissolved and became the Tilray it is now. When I was at leafly, the last ceo that had came in was straight from Amazon. He brought a ton of Amazon employees with him and wiped out a good amount of existing Leafly people. Ever since then I joked that Amazon sent him over to be ceo and see if Leafly was a good business to purchase once it goes federally legal. This news reaffirms my feelings."

2021-06-04 00:22:26,wallstreetbets,OP don’t be a pussy
2021-06-04 02:55:40,wallstreetbets,Thanks. A post like this would have been nice during the first GME run up. I felt like we went absolute cult in January. And I read through the comments when it hit sub 100$ levels... Jikes.
2021-06-04 06:43:53,wallstreetbets,"This.  I've only recently started options trading, this after years of doing long term regular stock buys/sells on a small scale and only with the initial money I put in (which was only a fraction of my livable/needed income).  I had a few lucky spots thanks to you apes but nothing life changing; however enough to start a new phase in my investment journey (still sadly under what is needed to lift PDT restrictions).

Despite investing for almost 9 years, I've only been doing options for maybe 3 weeks; became an act of desperation due to the effects of covid finally hitting my very busy programming career (or to put it more bluntly, my job/client stringing me along over working me and giving me sizable IOUs).  It's been promising (like netting almost my $100,000 salary thus far if calculated out for the year) and damn do I want it to move me to a better work/life balance but you can't throw your life on a whim like that.  For me, I'm using calculated spreads where the max loss is the max I can take for a day/week; do a few and make sure that winners beat losers and exit early out of both good and especially bad trades.

The various brokerages are having a fee war now and it only benefits us.   I still remember when I first opened my TD Ameritrade account in 2012 to buy Nintendo stock and EVERY trade cost $10.  Let the tech improvements / lack of fees now aid you and don't let greed take over.  Yes, for a few it might pay off but for most, it  won't"
2021-06-04 01:07:36,wallstreetbets,"Except it's GME. The key difference is ""speculation"" vs ""facts"".

 *  E.g. AMC is speculation - it might go up, it might go down, it might stay where it is now. Company might do well, might do bad and shares price moves accordingly.
 *  GME is facts - shorts must cover, because after such insane transformation, GME is 100% not going bankrupt. Therefore it's safe to YOLO life savings into GME as long as you can leave them there for at least several months (maximum of several years)."

They want to stick it to those 1% that play with everyone's livelihood anyway. you tell these people not to spend their rent or food money, they will because to them investing in these meme stocks is screwing over those who at any moment could make them lose their home, their jobs, their lives, sky rocket food prices, without even getting to gamble with them on the market. Most regular people in this have lost a lot over the years due to wallstreet negligence and corruption, and continue to do so."

2021-06-03 22:20:48,wallstreetbets,So says you... I bought WKHS $20 calls yesterday for 10k. Woke up and had 70k... I didnt have a retirement. But I do now!
2021-06-03 22:20:51,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for posting this, really. I bought AMC wayyyy before all the meme’s started because it was one I could afford and just bought shares in things I thought might do okay. Sadly, i sold when it hit 10 dollars. I could really use the money that small increase brought in. With a huge move coming up, a baby on the way, and shipping my beloved pet to follow us I couldn’t risk it going back down. I’ve been beating myself up over it and every 5 minutes considered funneling my savings in on the dream of getting enough money to put the stressors behind me. This post brought some reality back in and I feel better about using my money to get by safely instead of praying and waiting. Thanks again."
2021-06-03 22:21:49,wallstreetbets,"I set my limit at $500 at the start of the year. That’s all I put into the market. If I make money, I’ll keep playing until it’s gone, or I stumble into something substantial. Just gonna try to build what I can with that initial $500, and if it’s gone, it’s gone, I accepted that coming in.

I made a little here and there, but ended up losing across various stocks. bought some BB near its peak like a fool a few months ago, and some more recently before it climbed again.

With BB where it sits now, I’m sitting at like $380 net. If BB hits 21 bucks, I will have made everything back, *and* four whole dollars over four months.

*Assuming I sell it at all*"
2021-06-03 22:24:53,wallstreetbets,"As the king of Noobs,

I say the opposite. If you can barely afford rent, you can't afford ***not*** to YOLO all your shoebox money into meme stocks.

But on a serious note, we and my buddy Corn Pop are making WSB the hedge fund. Tired of being an idiot and losing all your money? Give us your money instead so we can lose it for you. Cut out the middle man."

2021-06-04 03:10:30,wallstreetbets,I have to remember this every time I see margin traders trying to get you to sign up for their course and showing clips of their daily gains of 10-100k. So I'm supposed to spend 90% of my current money and use the remaining 10% to trade like you and make .000001% of the gains you're making? HA.
2021-06-04 03:12:43,wallstreetbets,What? Most gains porn I see are akin to people winning a lottery. A couple of grand to a couple hundred.
2021-06-04 03:15:24,wallstreetbets,"I’m a newbie. I can verify that nope won’t become rich overnight. Don’t gamble more than you can afford. It’s been a while, months ago, and I invested 200.00. Only today did it become an extra 250. But I’m not selling. 

For sure the ones making big money know what they are doing and had more money to invest. 

Definitely don’t invest life saving or rent money. I think of it like gambling at a casino… if you wouldn’t spend all your rent money at a casino, don’t do it with the Wall Street bets."
2021-06-04 03:17:12,wallstreetbets,"Also for every gains post by someone, that same person has losses on other stocks that they're not posting."

2021-06-04 18:42:10,wallstreetbets,"You do realize a good portion of Americans live paycheck to paycheck and dont have money to invest right?

So yes it is more risky investing their money instead of using it to buy necessities and pay rent."
2021-06-04 01:05:20,wallstreetbets,"you're misrepresenting AMC enormously though.

>Under the circumstances, **we caution you against investing** in our Class A common stock, **unless** you are prepared to incur the risk of losing all or a substantial portion of your investment.

you're claiming that they're saying ""do not invest with us"" which is only the first part of the sentence. the second part is putting conditions on it: ""UNLESS you are prepared"" 

all it's doing is telling you that this stock is volatile, and you shouldn't be investing in it unless you know what you're doing. this is a basic fiduciary duty. why are they doing it when someone like apple or tesla doesn't? because this is a stock that is going up and down with retail interest, and it has unpredictable market fluctuations compared to something like microsoft which you know will trend upwards."
2021-06-04 01:54:53,wallstreetbets,Always gets my upvotes
2021-06-04 06:23:25,wallstreetbets,"How am I misrepresenting AMC? Do you think they are anywhere close to being in the same league as two of the most innovative tech companies on the planet? You cannot compare these. 

I hope I’m wrong about AMC, but the way I see it it is much more likely than not that this thing will go down in flames at some point in the near future. This isn’t even like GME who wasn’t struggling with near crippling debt or anything of the sort. 

Not you, but I just don’t want to see these very young retards lite their rent money on fire throwing it at some that is certainly not like AAPL, TSLA, or even GME. It seems like these people can’t think more than an hour into the future and I’ve already had a few people post and delete comments because they started losing substantially and I guess couldn’t say “yeah, it’s possible you’re right.”"
2021-06-04 09:07:13,wallstreetbets,"I short, I would feel the same as you if the prospectus said something like, “We always urge caution, investment is inherently risky, etc.” But saying “we caution you AGAINST investing in our class A’s” is a whole different ballgame in my mind."
2021-06-04 09:46:48,wallstreetbets,"you're misrepresenting AMC by implying that they want people to avoid buying their stock when that is explicitly not what they said.

your next two paragraphs show exactly why they are warning people not to buy their stock: they are keenly aware that it is being snapped up by retail investors who think it will be a quick buck, with no understanding of the risks of such a volatile stock that is being driven by hype and enthusiasm rather than business values and achievements.

no one is saying ""do not buy our stock"". they are saying ""do not buy our stock **UNLESS YOU UNDERSTAND THE RISKS AND ARE OK WITH THOSE RISKS**""

is that clear now?"
2021-06-04 09:48:33,wallstreetbets,"again, you're ignoring the **UNLESS** conditional.

that's what matters.

**UNLESS** you're prepared to incur the risk.

it's like saying ""do not get onto this rollercoaster unless you are prepared to incur the risk""

no one would say they're saying don't get on the tightrope, they'd understand you mean read the rules and do your due diligence."

2021-06-03 21:15:45,wallstreetbets,please don't use that word on the internet
2021-06-04 02:40:44,wallstreetbets,🐷🍆💦
2021-06-04 11:54:56,wallstreetbets,Picked me up 600 shares and 5 call contracts 🚀 🚀🚀 🚀🚀 🚀
2021-06-03 21:19:20,wallstreetbets,NOK IS INDESTRUCTIBLE LIKE THE PHONES THEY BUILT IN THEIR PRIME! Seriously though. Let’s take this old bastard to the moon and give it the glory it deserves. I’m in apes.
2021-06-03 21:31:34,wallstreetbets,"NOK also has a $30b market cap.

How do you expect it to get the kind of rising price action AMC and BB got?"
2021-06-03 21:36:14,wallstreetbets,Can we at least wait until next week when my 6c calls I sold expire?!?!
2021-06-03 21:49:45,wallstreetbets,Yo this account is like 12 days old and only has 3 NOK posts. Apes do your own DD. Careful out there.
2021-06-03 22:42:34,wallstreetbets,My life sucks
2021-06-03 23:02:11,wallstreetbets,2500 NOK I feel stupid but having fun
2021-06-03 23:35:45,wallstreetbets,There is no short squeeze on Nokia. Share float is too big. This is wishful thinking.
2021-06-04 00:01:13,wallstreetbets,"OP is a bot.. check his profile out, c'mon guys it's not that hard"
2021-06-04 00:11:51,wallstreetbets,No it is not the last chance. Everyone is welcome to join.
2021-06-04 00:37:11,wallstreetbets,"Careful, this post was made by a new account who has only been spamming about Nokia. (Hopefully this comment doesn't get deleted)"
2021-06-03 23:03:25,wallstreetbets,Now I am convinced NOK will reach 20 in a day
2021-06-03 23:06:14,wallstreetbets,Source?
2021-06-03 20:34:18,wallstreetbets,3320
2021-06-03 23:06:50,wallstreetbets,Everything is relative....one can buy 20 shares of GME for close to 5 grands or 1000 shares of NOK. That being said if a million retail investors buy 1000 shares that quickly dries up the float....them welcome to the moon
2021-06-04 01:27:20,wallstreetbets,Its difficult to short squeeze... because theyre barely shorted... 👏
2021-06-03 22:49:54,wallstreetbets,he was saying it was not heavily shorted.
2021-06-03 23:03:21,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-06-03 20:05:08,wallstreetbets,"I’m not comparing to Tesla, totally different beasts but recognize potential for future earnings is valued differently."
2021-06-03 20:14:10,wallstreetbets,"We will find out next week what the Q1 earnings look like, and im willing to bet they smash it out of the park, even with the console supply issues."
2021-06-03 22:51:26,wallstreetbets,Everybody wins!
2021-06-04 00:51:44,wallstreetbets,So 20% of shares will be sold whoopde fuckin doo

2021-06-03 23:00:22,wallstreetbets,BB to the Moon!
2021-06-03 20:25:39,wallstreetbets,"There is one move only, $BB, hold my beer"
2021-06-03 23:01:04,wallstreetbets,The best part of my day is when I turn my phone off and wander around on my lawn barefoot and smoking a joint like Pablo Escobar all tormented and shit.
2021-06-04 03:01:59,wallstreetbets,Buying Call contracts on $BB for $32 exp 25June

2021-06-03 21:13:01,wallstreetbets,The Sun will come out tomorrow?
2021-06-03 22:57:30,wallstreetbets,Anyone here hard for TLRY or what
2021-06-03 21:29:01,wallstreetbets,Big if true

2021-06-04 03:29:30,wallstreetbets,"What's your position? I'm thinking on going all the way out to December or January, $10 strike"
2021-06-04 01:29:37,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy) that sounds like a no brainer
2021-06-03 21:47:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh no no no, I was assigned at 11 and sold a 12.50 call for tomorrow. I am just bitter."
2021-06-04 11:19:17,wallstreetbets,"Shorts are averaging up like we average down.  As the Short interest increases, the better chance for a short squeeze.  WE need more WSB people on board, but they are pretty busy fighting their AMC and GME battles.  At this point there is much more $$ to be made on WKHS,  IF we get more people on board."
2021-06-03 22:48:15,wallstreetbets,And WKHS has a 10% stake in Lordstown.
2021-06-03 20:03:23,wallstreetbets,This has now enraged me with prosperity. I fully trust apetards.
2021-06-03 20:04:00,wallstreetbets,Disney's sword in the stone is amazing.
2021-06-03 20:18:08,wallstreetbets,"RA Medical Systems Inc (NYSE:RMED) RA Medical Systems designs and sells excimer lasers used to treat dermatologic and cardiovascular diseases.

RA Medical has a tiny float of 2.68 million shares and a 39.7% short percent of float, highest of the three stocks mentioned. The stock also has a history of extreme volatility. On a single day in early May, the stock traded as low as $3.50 and as high as $6.37 before closing back below $4."

2021-06-04 10:23:57,wallstreetbets,_Probably?_
2021-06-04 12:57:13,wallstreetbets,I'm looking into interactive broker here is Oz. You can also do it through various banks. Need to do your own DD as fee's and trading options vary.
2021-06-04 03:39:32,wallstreetbets,From a statistical standpoint there has been more UFO sightings than people who has seen you in real life. The probability of you existing is lower than aliens racing saucers in the sky.
2021-06-04 12:54:01,wallstreetbets,"From a statistical standpoint, I would still get rekt buying calls for SPCE and PLTR."

2021-06-04 17:48:04,wallstreetbets,Since amc is getting diluted with shares let’s short squeeze palantir😵
2021-06-04 10:29:33,wallstreetbets,"Weren't we supposed to sell in May and go away?

2021-06-04 00:26:21,wallstreetbets,"I'm not doubting that BB is gonna moon, but this kind of BS TA is what makes people think TA is BS, and its not. Stick to supports/resistances and trendlines and you are gonna do a lot better."
2021-06-04 19:13:15,wallstreetbets,u/Philbertan any thoughts on today’s price action.
2021-06-03 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"Who gives a shit about the “bigger picture”. Shits dumb af you can’t squeeze literally everything that’s shorted a little bit. 

If you think it’ll keep going up buy in and make some money."
2021-06-04 09:57:13,wallstreetbets,And you have my bow
2021-06-03 20:22:29,wallstreetbets,"Good summation, glad I trusted the semi-homeless man in Berlin that I sat down for a pint every afternoon at the corner shop!  I stayed at a 13th century abby, in a monks quarters, then camped by a river for a few days.  I even got a personal tour of the war museum when I told the WW2 vet I was an American vet, so here I am in admiration of this old man that is laying out the red carpet and feeding my nerd hunger about all things for like 2.5 hours.  Then there was the farmers market, the museums, they guys playing that game with the steel ball in the sand, walking through the vineyard and picking wild flowers, camping and cooking on the small canal; oh and they giant medieval fortress, can't foget that!  Such a wonderful place!"
2021-06-03 21:56:20,wallstreetbets,"That's absolutely what im talking about.
This is the real french spirit. If you go in Nice, is cocky and more showy etc...
Carcassonne will make you feel the warmth of the south, same mentality as folks from mediteranean coast of italy, spain, etc."
2021-06-03 22:15:20,wallstreetbets,"My APE!  Yes, it was awesome, my tendies will be more travel.  I plan to do a month stay in a remote mountian chillage in Albania to start writing a book!


You are spot on Frenchi!  Fuck Paris and get down to the mountians and vinyards!  I mean Paris is okay, but as a Yankee I would not direct people to New York City;  Go to West Virgina and eat at diners in the mountains and hollers, hit up the upper P of Michigan, go to Colorado where the world build skyscrapers!


I don't know how you feel about Strousborg, but that was a nice city for a few days!  And fellow retard, I would be dissapointed if you have not trekked in Iceland yet, it is such a short flight for you frog eaters!(We eat frog here in the US, I am kinda from a ""redneck"" area, so we eat anything, including stuff that kinda might kill you, like pig brains.)"
2021-06-04 02:29:19,wallstreetbets,"If you like to est, go for ""cuisine du terroir"" it is traditional cuisine from each region of France. Every région got specialties. It's cuisine from country folks unlike gastronomy. (i dont get gastronomy) 
Sud ouest, Savoie, Normandie, Bourgogne, Alsace (the region os Strasbourg), ""terroirs"" are 🥺🥺🥺

And funky animal part here are called ""abats"" or ""tripes"". But i sound like her when talking about it :

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KikI_ttYzC4
I aint gonna eat no abats, no todayyy.

I always dream about eating some crazy barbecue the american way. Here we totally dont have this barbecue culture. It's basically putting things on fire but no preparation, sauce or anything. The way they prepare ribs etc when i Watch stuff online or in movie looks like witchcraft. 🤤 

Alabania or countries from eastern Europe from Prague 😳😳😳 to the one of the south (balkan area) sometimes looks like my idea of the ""glennraven"" à fantasy book marion zimmer Bradley. Just like Carcassonne, there is something authentic about them, you can feel that every rock and wall has a story to tell. 

Wrtite that book in Europe while i eat funky crawlers in West virginia 😂"
2021-06-03 20:51:23,wallstreetbets,Let’s go!
2021-06-04 19:23:00,wallstreetbets,Cramer would shit a brick first.
2021-06-03 21:57:52,wallstreetbets,I’d rather lose money than do that..at least that might make me change strategy...
2021-06-03 20:34:18,wallstreetbets,"You know, those two concepts combined actually makes perfect sense.

Eat the rich; you are what you eat."
2021-06-04 07:21:46,wallstreetbets,Like a coconut
2021-06-03 21:21:33,wallstreetbets,And yet the very reason the show is on FX is because they let Rob have more creative control than any other network...
2021-06-03 22:13:27,wallstreetbets,Let's FUCKING go APES!!
2021-06-03 21:53:03,wallstreetbets,Please hold. I just got put into the negative by this drop for my overall trades. My grandpa gave me like 1K to invest in stocks so I'm hopefully going to the moon with y'all
2021-06-04 18:05:28,wallstreetbets,"Feels real good

This is really a movement and I like the stock

AMC to the mother Franklin moon boiii"
2021-06-04 00:15:58,wallstreetbets,I would sell those calls and get some out of the money. It’s hard to find a buyer for calls so ITM.
2021-06-03 22:04:57,wallstreetbets,"Next stop, game changing."
2021-06-03 21:11:28,wallstreetbets,This aged well

Bottom line AMC can’t be trusted"
2021-06-04 12:24:39,wallstreetbets,"Nah, I like swimming with the big sharks. Would rather bitch about my $900,000 condo then live in Nebraska. Good weather, amazing food (don’t know where you’ve eaten) Lots of smart people, lots of diversity, endless opportunities and activities. Plus if you’re the type with kids some of the best schools in the country. And your kid is going to grow up around motivated smart tech savvy people. What you don’t take into account is the income level out here counteracts the expense. Sure milk is 10 bucks a gallon but when you get used to it it’s not a big deal. Plus an entry-level job out here is 150K Seasoned pros make 250, and you’re married to a mid level executive at a tech company that makes 400K a year you’re doing pretty good. And we haven’t even touched IPOs. Let’s just say you’ve worked for three companies that Have gone public, 20,000 options at $70 - 150000 options at $13 and 50000 at $42. Well, now you’re in the 2%. And you still don’t live in"
2021-06-03 21:15:44,wallstreetbets,".....and look where you have your money?

As I've said before, you will have to take profit at some point, probably a local top here.

Still waiting on GME to squeeze to 10k 🤔🧐 when's that gonna happen?"
2021-06-04 13:46:24,wallstreetbets,"400k.  Nah. Little more than half that. Milk is a buck forty and I paid less than. 100k for ny house 7 years ago.  Tradesman who got lucky providing services for middle america. I'm just lucky to be one of the go to guys in our little area. 

I wonder how many of those making 400 k are in debt millions and couldn't stop working for a month if they wanted to.  I bet most need until 60 to make it work. I want out at 50. 

To each their own. I like space and the farm type life.  I wouldn't pay a dollar a square foot for a condo so enjoy!"
2021-06-04 15:45:46,wallstreetbets,Dang wtf your whole comment has me convinced that I need to move to Silicon Valley and rethink my life choices. Upvoted
2021-06-03 21:21:34,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have GME
I took my profit on that one"
2021-06-03 21:22:57,wallstreetbets,"Also my big long term play is in NVTA
The next amazon"
2021-06-04 03:04:29,wallstreetbets,Thank you for an actual answer. Lots of know-it-all’s here I guess. I’m just starting to learn about stocks so I appreciate it.
2021-06-04 13:47:46,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I would buy a condo for a buck a square. 

Sell it to you for 1k lol."
2021-06-04 14:43:11,wallstreetbets,I paid 450K for my condo and it’s worth 1.2m four years later. Definitely a good retirement for when I’m ready to leave Silicon Valley. Among other things. I’m not saying it’s great here. If it wasn’t for a kid I’d be out ha ha. But I’d still go somewhere expensive like Los Angeles or New York city or Europe
2021-06-04 10:58:06,wallstreetbets,"No worries sir, we all gotta start somewhere, investopedia and YouTube helped me a lot though take the YouTubers who talk about day trading and what not with a grain of salt, end of the day stocks is ideally your money making you money, but you’re still putting your money on the line to some extent especially if a stock drops to pennies...options trading that amount becomes all of it no pennies left your contract expires out of the money you have 0$"
2021-06-03 20:46:02,wallstreetbets,U think they are experienced? Rathan dabbling and slamming a big bet one time for the one time?
2021-06-04 19:50:23,wallstreetbets,"Market is crazy. Our 100k house is now a 400k house.  I run my business on the back 1/4 acre so rent is cheap lol. 

Bro, we definitely won't be in each other's way for real estate lol.  Northern Idaho, pushing into Canada is my dream. I want a spot of land backed into forest and or blm so I can grab a cooler of beer and a few dozen firearms and go blast away on the side by side on millions of acres and rarely see a soul. 

You be down at the club and all chilling on some pavement where all the people are.  Just, make sure they stay there..all of them lol."

The company didn’t have to liquidate “because of hedge funds”. They’re liquidating because the share price is incredibly inflated, so they’re milking retail for all it’s worth.

Telling me *I’m* incredibly ignorant.. what a joke."

When I hear of a new U.S. state getting legalized and what not shouldn’t that mainly be effecting U.S. based companies? I’m not trying to hate on SNDL by any means I am just trying to learn because i’ve been wondering for awhile!

2021-06-04 18:20:41,wallstreetbets,You bought RKT high. So did I. RKT sank big so I doubled my investment at the bottom sinking my average share price from $26 to $20. 3 times already this week RKT hit above $20 before it fell back below it but I held for the next big dip to buy more and lower my average more so the next time it goes up I'm green green green anytime it goes up near $20. I only wish I'd doubled it again before it rose a lot this week.

They were in the top 5, lost out when their shit caught fire. So, they bought a partnership with someone that didn't lose out and lost again.

Pay attention to why they dropped and you might learn something.

Not everyone who tries to keep you retards from wasting money is a short."
2021-06-03 22:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Lol. Whatever you want to think bud. Feel free to bag hold WKHS. Find me a contract they've COMPLETED.

You won't."
2021-06-04 09:29:47,wallstreetbets,They now partnered with JB Poindexter to help with production.  Everything you mention was factored into the price up until a few days ago.  There is an outstanding amount of demand for their product.  Only one way to go from here.  I'm diamond-handing this one.
2021-06-03 23:02:31,wallstreetbets,"So how is their product a continual failure? Tell me one other commercial EV on the road...

That whole truck catching on fire and injuring the driver was a lie that was put out on a short report.

They have a backlog of over 8k trucks. Some of their customers are UPS, FedEx, Pride group and possibly IKEA."
2021-06-04 17:18:58,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I remain skeptical.
2021-06-03 23:07:18,wallstreetbets,"It's not on the fucking road. Between 2007 and 2020 they've made a total of 365 vehicles. Most of which are not on the road because they were failed prototypes and test models. They shipped them to those companies who then DECIDED NOT TO USE THEM. In 2015 they got in trouble for trying to sell trucks that were unsafe and they swept that under the rug as ""production faults."" What production? 

Of the contracts they have signed, they have fulfilled a grand total of zero of them.

You're betting on a company selling you a bill of goods, dude."
2021-06-04 17:29:48,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals are one thing but that flies out the window if a squeeze happens and this stock has squeeze potential.  Word just needs to get out and it is.

I would say take the money out and go and buy a nice little bit of property in a good area where house prices will always be on the increase. Find a place you can buy outright that you can immediately rent out and then have an instant salary coming in every month - this will be super beneficial to someone at your age and with the entire world at their feet! 

Your money will keep growing PLUS ..Consistent money every month! You could take a year out and go travelling and just be able to afford to keep going for as long as you want - just as an example. Either way, fair play to you you absolute bastard of an 18 year old and fuck you!"

Not to scare you, but instead to give some insight to a new options trader, it is important to keep up with the Greeks. Your current contracts have a couple of factors that could contribute to them being worth less even if the stock stays at this increased $9.50 range for the next week. As Theta (time decay) and Implied Volitility (rapid price swings) starts dwindling down, they'll lose a little bit of value. I tell you this not to scare you, but lead you in the right direction and not to freak out if you see that happen. Congrats on your first time in options, you've done incredibly well!

Let's say sometime next week, CLNE climbs to $19. Do my $13c become even more valuable because I have the option of exorcising the contracts at my $13 price when the shares are worth $6 more? I guess what I'm asking is, does the value of my contracts increase as the value of the stocks further increases over $13?"

2021-06-03 23:37:48,wallstreetbets,"Glad you're learning. I've learned a lot from this subreddit as well, sometimes all it takes is getting to the newer or less popular threads.

You'll absolutely keep making more as the price continues to increase. I'll use one call contract to explain. We'll begin with the break even price; that is the strike plus the premium you paid for the option. In your specific case that is $13 + $0.05, which means if the value of the stock exceeds $13.05 prior to 06/18, you're making penny for penny what owning 100 stocks would've yielded you. Fortunately for you, you paid $5 ($0.05×100) to control those 100 stocks as opposed to the ~$750 that it would've cost you if you purchased shares at the time. 

There's a concept of intrinsic vs extrinsic values in options, and I'd implore you to look into them more. Simply put, intrinsic value is what the stock is worth to you at the current moment. Extrinsic value is derived from a number of factors including theta and time decay as I outlined previously. Imagine extrinsic value as the ""what ifs."" A lot of retail traders never ""exercise"" their options due to that essentially meaning that you're losing your extrinsic value. Many just buy the option in hopes to sell it at a later point for more money, often times being the days leading up to the expiration. 

If everything goes well and you walk away with good money, I'd suggest taking some of that money and going somewhere chill and reading up on options before getting too crazy into another one. Despite the YOLO mentality on this subreddit, I'm always disheartened when I see someone do well their first time and try to replicate it and lose it due to limited knowledge. I'd recommend starting with ""InTheMoney"" older videos on YouTube. Adam has a great way of teaching without being dull like some others. 

Any other questions, don't hesitate. I'll try and answer when I can."
2021-06-04 15:57:08,wallstreetbets,"Sweet appreciate the info. I sold half of my call, but kept 18 of them open! Thanks again"
2021-06-04 00:51:33,wallstreetbets,"At the same time the deal further cements the company as the serious player we believe it to be and brings more visibility and more companies on board. 1/4 of the shares immediately go, does 13 million shares bring $13.40 down to or below the current price? The rest of the shares don’t go unless business grows 5.5x (?) If business grows that much the dilution would be offset not to mention CLNE would get the money for the shares which given what I know about them they are keen to re-invest. 

I get dilution is not good but this is a company that appears to do the smart/right thing and spend on their business and not like that other company who is giving out bonuses and patting each other on the back."

2021-06-03 23:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they still deal in conventional natural gas. They bill fracked gas as ""clean"" but if you've lived in Pennsylvania where is extracted you'd now you are supporting one of the worst environmental practices. They've permanently destroyed the ground water in so many communities. This stock is evil."
2021-06-04 00:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Hah, sometimes it just takes some skin in the game to have a new take on something. 

Wish that I would've seen this thread sooner. I only allocated 3% of my portfolio this morning towards it. Might stock up on some shares early next week depending on the situation because I believe that it's a pretty good mid/long term stock after reading up more on it today."
2021-06-04 00:22:54,wallstreetbets,I got very lucky seeing this thread when I did and getting the info from other users helped me pull the trigger. Wish I put more into it but hindsight is 20/20 my friend.

The transaction says a take profit was filled but I didn't have one set, they also sold the block of shares in 2 separate transactions which seems a bit odd"

2021-06-04 15:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Imagine believing the financial data that comes out of Ehang. And even if true, they just realized how stupid people were and that they could take them for even more. Government on board as well with ""support"", as always."
2021-06-04 15:21:21,wallstreetbets,"Joby is LIGHT YEARS ahead of Ehang, and I don't like them either. Airframe certification started in 2018. Where is Ehang with this process? Oh that is right, they literally use hobby grade electric motors, not one single part of that pile of junk would pass any kind of certification. They have not even started. Ehang is a complete joke. It's a meme stock for people who see a DJI drone and think ""oh, we should just scale that up and use it for humans"". Also, we will make it electric, even though it is less efficient than a heli and far worse than a fixed wing, which barely are starting to use electric. AND we will make it an AAV!! At least Joby has an actual pilot. 

It's not happening. The CAAC is worse than the FAA about rules, they will not certify that ""aircraft"" to fly even with a pilot. They are literally doing ""test flights"" of an aircraft they have already internally completely scrapped. Look at the old 184 test flights from 2016 vs this model. See any improvement? Five years, and nothing? It's a terrible design."
2021-06-04 15:26:54,wallstreetbets,"Joby is not light years ahead (even if I hold Joby too). Compare the number of Patents - EHang is leading the industry. Compare the number of test flights - EHang is leading (over 10K). Compare the prices of the aircrafts EHang will produce for a mass market, much cheaper. They want to be Volkswagen of the Sky not Mercedes of the Sky. Design doesn’t matter in this case.

And the CAAC will provide the license much faster than the US counterpart as Government of China wants to be leader of EV sector. Possibly they are terrible but it happens what the Government wants.

EHang will be the first Company making eVTOLS a real product !"

2021-06-04 18:19:00,wallstreetbets,Yup. I hated today’s price action and manipulation. But I did add 74 July 16 $20 calls.
