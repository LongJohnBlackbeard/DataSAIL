04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE THE STÖCK!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started with $20k, in GME since sub $12 in November 2020, visible in my history. Switched brokers to go from CFD contracts to physical shares. Average cost now higher than in the last update since I sold a small portion into the flashsale early march and bought back in later.

&#x200B;

Might take around 5k shares off the table at $400-$500 to secure retirement and shit. Holding the rest."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you walk around with nuts that big?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😮

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The catalyst is solving FSD.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean anything is possible.  Personally i wish Tesla dipped lower so i could grab some shares and hodl.  But if my 5 shares turn to $4k each jn 4 years that would be fine too. 🙌💎

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve got 4/16 30 and 35C set for Monday morning LFG
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember last month I got muted and my post deleted for three days because I pointed out crazy movement on ASO.   I guess ASO is ok to talk about now?   

Salty yes.  Good DD though.  Looks like I'll buy in some more."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD I bought 35$ calls for 4.16 this morning and it is printing. What’s your opinion on where it will be in the next month
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, had to buy more shares after hours on WeBull. So excited for Monday LFG!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"🚀🚀 

ASO is heading to fucking Mars"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD and im IN! Monday morning $30 calls it is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought some 4/16 30c  right at MACD crossover at around 28.32. Looking yummy so far
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We all buying Monday morning?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 10 credit spreads at $0.10 on Tuesday for 35 / 40 with an Expiry at 4/16.

I got out once it hit $0.18.  Early, I know....but with the long weekend, I just wasn’t ready to throw caution to the wind and I was happy to take my $80 in profit.

Seemed like a crazy play at the time to make back on Tuesday, hoping it would jump $10+ inside of three weeks, but with the stock closing at $29, maybe it will actually bridge it! I’ll keep my eye on it over the next few days.  

Next time I get nuts like that, I’ll probably choose a closer-to-the money strike price."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All of WSB talking about this recently. Time to short!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y'all buy some shares, when I get my tendies, I'll buy the company.
Then we ride"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy puts?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/deepfuckingvalue here is a value trade for you.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#FU ASO. 😎
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Academy > Dicks

DKS is at $79. I think ASO has plenty of room to run 🚀🚀🚀"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well... I'd like to think the very bullish case which would mean margin calls on the shorts would be somewhere in the $60's to $80's ...

But I'd be pretty happy anywhere over $40 !  


Now...if DFV took that $11mm in cash he has in his etrade account and threw some of it at this trade...it would prolly go to $300 lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I certainly hope so !
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lambo time???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,yes ! and creeping a bit AH. MM's going to feel pressure on this Monday and will likely need to buy shares.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"do whatever you want, it's your money!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s ride
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"good luck, it's 39% short interest as of march 15 and has only gone higher since...."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlike RKT and UWMC, this one will print. And print  handsomely. Shit’s open in Texas. There is no going back. Very much a smart reopening play."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that’s one hell of a prediction actually, just a bit early lmao"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that's a terrible DD though lol it's just someones opinion. I have data backing this up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you're going to buy a multi billion dollar company?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's your money, do whatever you want"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,k
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying more calls Monday for 5/21
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d walk into my brothers house and slap him right in the face if it hit 50
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not everything with short interest is a short squeeze. Plus, not every call option is hedged the day of expiration. In fact, they’re usually already hedged when they’re sold.

That being said, I still like ASO stock. Its just draining to see “SQUEEEZZEEE” on every single DD. Especially from people who just joined after GameStop 😂😂"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You dont understand tendies do you 🦍🖍
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing the same. I see a strong run up to their 5/27 earnings. I’m currently holding shares and 4/16 $30 & $35 calls. Probably going to buy a few $40 5/21 Monday too.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's insane, people keep saying, ""just x more dollars and the squeeze begins"" or some other stupid sht like that, makes me roll my eyes every time"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the short interest...it's 39% and has been that high or every so slightly higher than that in the past few reports...the stock has only gone up and short interest has not dropped hardly at all.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,k
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I was short options because Theta Gang is making a killing on all these OTM high IVs expiring worthless because “the squeeze is on Friday “ 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like that quick BB mention at the top.

“BB still fucked?”

“Yep, still fucked.”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow... GME getting knocked out from top spot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The OG meme stock is back. Thank you Technoking
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Need more PLTR
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wsb turned into ESPN, except instead of LeBron, Harden, Durant, and Westbrook everything is GME, TSLA, AMC, PLTR"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can PLTR go to $100 this month ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I used to come to WSB for ideas.  But all the most-discussed stocks all suck.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at those ASO mentions jump, if ur not getting in on this one idk what to say"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC OVER GME WHAA😳😳 AMC MIGHT GO BRRRRRRRRRR🦧🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol when AMC was like, ""DONT FORGET TO SPAM ME TOO!!!"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do i find these tesla discusions? I only see gme. Or is this only in the discord?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in on Viacom, here’s to hoping"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing to note is that GME had its own megathread I believe, which isn't included here. This has also been the case for all the past animations, but I think it's important to note nonetheless."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank god.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s already peaked . Looks like bagholding
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the video again. I could see ASO an hour ago. Now it's like colors that are kinda blocked out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GTFO such BS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, it's way undervalued. Are you a hedge fund?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it a conflict of interest? The fuck?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that’s the point

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you “accidentally” withdraw it?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir you now owe 1.3m in taxes. April Fools!!! The IRS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda invested it in something going up. They’d probably force a sale from whatever the stock is and you could keep the gains
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The Nigerian prince scam finally worked
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bank error in your favor. Collect 4,900,000."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked at a bank. We've had clients straight up take money and run. Its a write off if the bank fucked up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the opposite of “GUH”? That’s the sound I would make.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You named your account ‘diamond Hands’ 😂

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went to the bank to withdraw a few thousand dollars a while back. Well. The nice teller counted out more cash than I was entitled to and without realizing, I scooped it up and left. I didn’t til later. They called me. They never call after a withdrawal. Asked me how much I had received. Told them I couldnt remember. Net gain in a withdrawal was nice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Get a lawyer and keep it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on your new $GME position
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Something like that happened to me once with Bank of America.  Took them a couple weeks to figure it out.  I don’t remember the amount but I earned $12 interest they never took back.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I wouldda swiped that shit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sheeeesh I know we’re all retarded here, but calling the bank after they gave you free money? You truly are retarded. This is the wsb way."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe the ruling in ""Finders v. Keepers"" sets the precedence for this occurrence.

This is not legal advice, unless you pay me."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I always said if I was going to steal I was going to make it worth my while this qualifies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"<sarcasm>Don't worry, I'm sure the IRS will understand.</sarcasm>"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Throw it into GME real quick and give them a IOU!!! Tell them when the squeeze goes they can have their money!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s quite the stimulus check. Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the fuck didn’t you buy a bunch of calls.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's fine, but how did you change your account name? Mine are stuck at ""Roth IRA"" and ""Rollover IRA"". I can't find any way to rename them!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda right away bought shares so they couldn't reverse the deposit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know if Fidelity issues you a 1099 you are fucked. You bet the IRS will want its share.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t yolo it into FDs and try to triple your money before they audit the books, then you don’t belong here. 

They could legally take the 4.9M but they can’t take the 10M you earned"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember, if you owe the bank $100 thats your problem. 


If you owe the bank $4.9 million, that's THEIR problem. Have fun in Tijuana!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They should've given you 1 milly for being honest
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not just the tip; that was one deep, bottoming out thrust and then they walked away, left you all mind-fucked"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang. And I was excited when my $1400 stimmy showed up in my account!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately go on margin and yolo into some 3x leveraged ETF weeklies.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy monkey balls
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What a freaking tease
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Party at your house!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""yeah you can have it back when you give me that many shares."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on me I always come early. Fuck.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,they took that shit out quick lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d withdraw it, stash it. Do my 10 years in prison and come home rich."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,After you have secured the funds and are gucci dump it all into GME and full fill the prophecy OP cannot go tits up!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stfu lol could you imagine what you’re reaction would be 🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you buy with your new found money?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,what a clown for letting them know. No judge would make you return that money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The amount of retards in here that think they could live off $5 mil is astounding. OP was correct to return it. I’m not going on the run for $5 million and live in some shit hole country fighting off mosquitoes for the rest of my life. While the cocaine may be better the hookers are much worse and that’s not a trade I’m willing to make.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They just wanted to get your nerves ready for the squeeze
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,was that a down payment on ur profits?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Down payment? Trying to get you to paper hand?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"ah, a new infinite leverage hack, and now not on robinhood but on fidelity. You should use all of it on margin spy puts expiring next week. Do itttt. Whats the worst that can happen? Cant loose money thats not yours, and if they want it back and you win... naiiice."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy all GME shares on the market, market order, add margin."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Withdraw!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,they are just making sure they can take out your losses Monday
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They just paid you slightly too early
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CASH THAT SHIT AND DIP YOU DUMB FUCK WTF
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All fun and games until the taxman wants his.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just post an IOU there to hold its place
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They just want to show you what your account is about to look like on the way up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I see they’re trying to get your 1 share of GME at a discount.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Withdraw and flee to some random ass country and retire.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash the fuck out and head to Mexico dude!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gains!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,did they ask you to pay back in best buy gift cards?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just launder 5 mil unbeknownst?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have quickly withdrawn
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How’d it feel to be a millionaire for a few minutes?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was nice margin call, holmes. Good looking out 😉"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why I have a margin call
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,These are obviously profits from your gourds positions
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope ""Fidelity"" isn't asking you to pay them back with Google Play gift cards?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently looking up how to set a Fidelity alert for rogue deposits
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the tsla put and double it！
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sue them for intentional infliction of emotional distress. I’d be f@@@ked up after that.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If only those fingers of yours had been a little faster, you'd be the next GME whale for us to rally around"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you take it personally?...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,use it to buy gme you wont
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Withdraw and fuck them over with it ASAP.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have put it all in GME before they caught the mistake
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity did this to me a while back as well. Sent my money to some random account. I got it all back, but what is going on over there?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😮😮😮😮😮
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol oops
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Possession is 90% of the law. (Till is isn’t)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit.  I dream about this everyday and how I'd sue.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,are you sure you didn't sell 1 share of GME to early?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone is probably missing that half a share of GME.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you react when you saw this?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder what they would do if you withdrew $100 from that.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy stock in gme. Maybe it will slow or delay them taking it back?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,wooops
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity thought you were DFV 🤣🤣🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AAAANNDDD.... it’s gone!! 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Invest it in GME and double it, then when they ask for it back your up $4.9m"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Put it all in GME and see what Fidelity do
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What the Frick!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would have had 4.9 mil in gme within 10 seconds
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Their was that recent story of the bank wiring money to the other bank by accident and the court favored the recipient and the bank got to keep the money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol why would you give it back you massive dumbcunt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That was not accidental. These are payments for your 4 gme shares in advance for the upcoming MOASS. Fidelity is just trying to provide its customers best customer service.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I took a screenshot.  That's the closest I'll be.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey same here.
Now my account is $4.89999m in the negative"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hwang... is that you?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How illegal is that...exactly? Asking for a friend.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Sorry, I already YOLO'ed it all into GME."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.  This is posted from my throw-away account.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,*MUSTAGE*
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it really worth giving up a share?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly if I woke up to this before open I would've yolod spy calls for this reason. 200% gain on the 399 call today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard ornamental gourd futures are hot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How could one take this money and run? Seems like they reversed the wire pretty quickly. Just curious.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""If you owe the bank $100 that's your problem. If you owe the bank $100 million, that's the bank's problem."" 

J P Getty."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. 

Go ahead and take me to court, cancel my account if they like. 

4.9 million in cash? You'd never hear from me again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't think quickly enough.  But tbh, I wouldn't have anyway.  I called Fidelity to let them know."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,As they should have 🔥
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Citibank accidentally sent 900m out to some customers. Some customers sent the money back, no questions and others kept it. A judge ruled that citibank can fuck off and they lost 500m"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They probably have to leave the country, pretty sure the bank would track them down otherwise"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't even know what a write off is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you go this far in the other direction you end up back at guh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup had this happen to me when I was 16 with my first bank, a smaller local one. Got $300 for free and I was making $7 an hour back then so it was like I hit the lottery. They asked about it and I just played dumb, never asked for it back."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,...mAh emOtionAl dAmAges!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the gloves don't fit, you must acquit"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,WUH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would have been about 25,000 shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would have invested it all. Then immediately initiated a brokerage transfer.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And you would’ve gone to jail 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am really, really retarded."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The cash would of had to settle first, before making an options play at least. He could have YOLO’d a stock fasho"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right???

What I could do with $4.6mm and three minutes…"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The option is in your profile I think. You can group accounts and chance nickname
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please sign my petition.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven’t even received mine yet!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I've moved.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I definitely woke me up when I saw it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just ask the OP if he could imagine what his own reaction was?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$GME, of course."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you can’t live off 100k year for the next 50 years then u must really like your nose beers
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How could u withdraw 5 million fast enough tho?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,until GME moons
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,One of you is pulling my leg.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends what country you’ve already fled to.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's bad. You're supposed to not touch any money you know to be deposited by mistake. Now if you happened to be expecting a large deposit for reason...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"um you got millions just fucking dip

its. that. simple."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well FWIW we noticed a $30,000 business deposit was not in our account. The person they gave it to went to a shit ton of ATM's and withdrew about $16,000. We got our deposit credited back pretty quickly - don't know what happened to the other guy. Probably nothing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty illegal. Although that might be enough to not care compared to this guy

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Like 7/10
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well if you're a fan of free housing then not at all
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before sqooze, yes. After, no."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking lol can you imagine just getting pretty much 12 million dollars in a day?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m more of a Egyptian rabbit futures kind of guy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had maybe a couple hours window before it was yanked back.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"go to the atm, obviously"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except not really in this case, they'll just reverse this shit QUICK."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the people here who think they can like, go to the bank and withdrawal $4 million in cash and run. You’d make out with like, $5k? $5k and run!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What. The. Fuck.

MODS!!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Fidelity, you accidentally wired $3.9M to my account”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,100% Tergridy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Later in life, you will realize that this great virtue won't get you any lambos."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should have sent them a fidelity letter.  You have lost $4.9m, greater than normal. Etc"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a better man than I. I would have transferred that money out and called a lawyer to see my options.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,TIL that FDIC payouts to banks do not come from taxpayer money.. MODS! Fuck this guy for trying to do the right thing but ending up helping people I don’t like
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would have honestly made no trades and just let that money sit in my account for a few days to see what happens
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably don’t belong here with those ethics
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Open new account at same bank, wire money to it. Do again and again. Every time they call just say “yea, you made a mistake, I wired it back to you guys so I didn’t spend any by accident, the account number is XXXX-XXXXXX (The next account number in line)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. Can we get you a flair that says actually retarded.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods this person needs a flair
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,At the VERY least you could've let you bank pay you interest on that.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You do NOT belong here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope not even close.

They already owed them, just paid back ""early"" due to computer fuckup. Once you pay a debt, no backsies - pretty easy case law tbh."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was different ! 
as Citibank owed the ppl they “ accidentally “ paid so that’s why the judge ruled against Citibank getting the money back lol ooooops"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's legal precedent that if you already owe money to someone and you deliver money to them, its too late to take it back from them after they already have it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah they wanna get you used to watching almost $5M disappear from your account cause you're on this sub
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wells Fargo did the opposite. I loaned $50k to a friend and he paid back $20k. I went in to deposit $5000. Teller counted 2 times in front of me and asked if I am making deposit for $6000. I thought I miscounted so I told them yes. How can she miscount 2 times in front of me, it didn’t make sense. I got receipt for $6000 deposit and went my way. Later they just subtracted $1000 from deposit and said I deposited $5000. When I asked I have receipt for $6000 deposit and teller counted 2 times, but even teller was lying and said I deposited $5k. I left with a funny taste in my mouth. I don’t know what exactly happened. I had so much cash on me and didn’t have account for how much I deposited."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, I’m feeling a little empty now that they took it back.  I’m sad..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CC weeklies for life. Live like a king.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A measly quarter of what DFV has. Really puts it in perspective.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of the people would go to jail for that price ;)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to find you first.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How if it was their mistake
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,if it's a cash wire transaction you technically aren't liable for anything even if you take it.  if you take it before they correct it they have to sue to even attempt to get it back.  Bank transactions (not wires) are different and you can't take that money...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, he wouldn't have even been penalized. The bank would just refuse to work with them again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,4.6mm in 0DTE SPY calls could do some serious damage in just a few minutes...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yesss! Now my boomer ass has custom names! Thanks!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  You can assign nicknames.  ""Diamond Hands"" sounded good."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I was really talking to everyone else... he just so happened to be the only one to answer me lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my mind, my reactions to events are often way better than my actual reaction.   They’re not necessarily in tandem."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Split it between them nobody loses.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And just like that, *poof*, he was gone."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Catch me if -
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's the list of countries without extradition to the western world, and also without assassins cheap enough for the bank to just expense it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They could just look at his trading history though and see he's too dumb to realize the money got there by mistake.  Easy defense.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, can I just say that I expect millions of dollars to be deposited into my account any day, I’m good? Can I post this statement on my Facebook feed as proof? “I, Genuine-user, expect millions of dollars to be sent to me at a moments notice”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean... theyre the ones who fucked up, right?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably in jail.  That amount is over the “petty crime” limit in all states and trying to withdraw quickly over many many ATMs is easily provable intent to defraud.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope but would've had to try lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, I’m not DFV"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Plenty of time to wire it offshore and head to Argentina. THEN you call yet lawyers and negotiate... or not.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Enough to swing by your bank, open an account and buy yourself another day."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait a second, you want to tell me we don't have a million dollar bill so he can get 4 bills and some changes, and run??!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, no one thinks that. 

But in the unlikely event you call and make the necessary  arrangements with the bank and they still have not noticed the error, and you actually get the cash in hand?!?!?! 

The next question becomes how much jail tile a person is willing to do. Next where and how does that person hide $5 million in cash.

People are overly confident in our institutions. They make mistakes. Not a lot because otherwise the public would lose confidence, but they make them."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Brilliant!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This should be OPs flair
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m already realizing that right now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd take a short prison sentence for a few million...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was exactly my plan.   Within three hours, it was gone.   :("
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just for shits and giggles those debtors should hit Citi with an early payment penalty.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In what scenario would a bank owe a customer that much money?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tomaytos, tomahtos

Edit: sarcasm"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aaaaaaaaaaaand it’s gone.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Brilliant ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have accidentally withdrawn it because you know mistakes happen and then just ask for a good reason to give it back and then just flee the country
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wife's boyfriends a lucky guy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For 5 million in a max federal prison??? 

That's tough. Even if that 5 were tax free."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Coz it's their game. They can't lose.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because many places have laws (guess who wanted them) that if you intentionally spend money mistaken put into your account you are a thief and can be prosecuted. If something like that happens to you and you are determined to try keeping it, you better lawyer up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The real DD is always in the comments
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Source? Cause I don't believe you. What law would say that you are entitled to money that isn't yours?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't have shed much a of a tear.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He would be. It is theft
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're either really high or really old.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just gonna hold it in the interest of fairness (to me).
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash me outside
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You can...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh yeah no if they took it back (lol good luck im out by then) im suing the shit out of them since its mine after they give it to me, fuck up or not

if you give someone something it isnt youres then, no matter what it is fuck up or not

shit I had to check my account lmao"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You get to arg with those kind of usd and the gov will be happy to releive you of it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that go the terms of use agreement you sign when you open the accounts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Which bank just accidentally wired $500 million back in January and judge ruled they couldn’t try to collect?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask yourself.. what would Goldman Sachs have done?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,‚A fee may apply if you pay everything back at once‘
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its the difference between giving a random guy on the street $1M by accident, and giving your loan shark $1M by accident and then demanding it back.

Its not really approximately close at all."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Financial crimes is min security. More like a lockdown vacation or at worst a rehab center.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most accurate comment I've ever read.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlucky, missed the ultimate stimmy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No its not. In fact, many court cases have already made it standardized that the people receiving money are not at fault and can keep the money if they were able to get it during the mistake."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah good play.  I can tell you're a very bright guy.  Can I interest you in any snake oil?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash out!!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am selling the greatest clothes in the world. Only the super smartest of all people can see it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically you can cash them out and make it look like your account has been hacked... don’t login in next hours till you cash them out from a burner laptop and use RDP of course...and when you login back from your laptop contact them and let them know that are some transaction on your account what you don’t know about. If you don’t know how to make these moves hmu
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I said offshore. Was thinking Malta Nobody says I gotta be where the money is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, you're 10000% going to jail for this. 

The question is how much time are you willing to sell your time for and how well you can hide the cash. 

$5 mil is more than enough to live comfortably off of."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aye just watch who went in jail @2008 and what kind of ridicolous fine(275k to citadel if im right)  SEC for marker corruption
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Citation? I worked in finance and saw it happen only once. The guy was charged with theft after he refused to return the money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 6000 beanie babies, they'll be worth 6 million in two years I swear"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or maybe an Apple product?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uve clearly put a LOT of thought into this... 🌝

But what about bank account? Fidelity would see the wire and just get the funds from that bank. You couldnt cash out $4.9 mill fast enough, imo. U would need a fence or network to split it all up and send it everywhere. Just one transfer of $4.9 would b stupid easy to trace and recover."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now you tell me.   If it happens again, I’ll reach out to you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Rdp to what... he still needs a remote host
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"HSBC did it with me when I was a student, £450. I was dirt poor so just withdrew it and never used the account again. They chased me for a while then gave up, and I recently got a cheque from them because ""they reviewed their correspondence and found it to be in breach of regulation"" or something like that.

  


Another £45, the gift that keeps on giving."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"~~the recipient never gets to keep the money~~ the recipients were retarded and didnt cash out and disappear then got fucked

whoops you missed this autist"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the 4.9M was for the beanie babies and now he has to deliver them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah I had to read that one twice.  Who still thinks if beanie babies?  Very impressive.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a Derek Jeter World Series MVP beanie baby in the bag. They’re going for $10 on eBay
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe 7 mil.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohh they already got the money back ? Next time hmu I’ll teach you how to get away with all money and innocent.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe cos all frauds are made from RDP’s. 🤔 and to hide your actual identity,location and fingerprints... and what remote host are you talking about? You just need to make it look like your account got hacked hackers get your login, pass and cookies for mail access...."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we might be talking about different rdp's
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I should have probably added that it was stupid of me to spend it and they could have easily applied for a CCJ against me. At the time I already had one from an unpaid phone bill and was in no place to be worrying about my credit score anyway so took the irresponsible route.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the US, they had 30 days to fix the error before you could legally keep it.

I think it's been legally extended to 60 days due to banking pressure."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But sometimes the math doesnt check out.

How much does it cost bank to chase $450? Probably more than the $450. So the formula is simple: send some free/easy notices a few times, then dont bother paying collection agency, private detective, whatever to find u. 

For poor people, this also applies: Target store cancelled a preorder and I had to repurchase item at higher price. $7-8 difference. Do I call them up and spend a half hour on phone or just let it go?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"...yes that is what I said. 

Unless you're implying that they do have mixer, which they don't. A classic cocktail is made with spirits, bitters, citrus, and sometimes sugar. If it has anything else in it it's just a mixed drink, not a cocktail."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the FT article mentions Vestas as one of the companies they would have to buy, but they already have over $200 million in Vestas.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, love that as an ICLN holder. My biggest concern was how concentrated it was in such a small amount of companies such as Plug.

Might have to try some deep OTM may puts on PLUG to see if this completely tanks it, the 4/23 25p is going for about 0.30 right now."

>S&P has already signalled its intention to conduct a further consultation after the April revamp to potentially expand the Clean Energy index into fields such as marine energy, alternative fuels, energy storage, energy efficiency and smart grids.

and

>Lamont said. “This is the first of these quite narrow thematic funds that is having these issues but it won’t be the last.”"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will ICLN go up tho, asking for myself"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling that ~8% plug and 5% enph isn’t going to be good for either of those stocks lol hopefully this doesn’t wreck plug too much.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good work OP, you plan on buying any calls on the companies getting added?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great find, thanks for sharing. Can't wait for the details!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write up, OP. The underlying companies would have to be aware that this is happening, right? I mean it’s public info at this point so they HAVE to know their companies are about to get pounded (PLUG), assuming PLUG will drop from 8% to something more logical and balanced.

How do you plan on playing this? Puts on PLUG for April or May?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,nice.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Great find.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,PLUG is one of the higher weightings in the Russell2000. So maybe short IWM which is the ETF that tracks R2000?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed I always enjoy reading your DDs though I don’t always comment KUDOS. Since I own some ICLN I’m def curious once the rebalance happens how things shake out in the coming months esp if a bunch of apes start playing options on its holdings ::smirk at:: those of you thinking up trade ideas right now. I’m too scaredy cat to mess with options. Somebody YOLO for me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not doubting but would proceed with caution because yes they have to get those shares off the books but doesn’t mean they haven’t started but maybe more importantly.. we see so many huge block sales that go under the radar in dark pools or just massive sells that end up having little to no effect on the price. Because why would they want to take a loss ever? Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They actually have a note in the article where holdings can still be capped at 8% if they score the highest for green energy impact, so it's not like *the worst* although it likely will be bad. Seems like they dont mind some concentrated holdings."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm maybe priced in. Could explain the sell off this month
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"“On March 29, 2021, Chris R. Homeister, Executive Vice President and Chief Merchandising Officer of GameStop Corp.

The Company and Mr. Homeister have commenced discussions for a transition of Mr. Homeister’s responsibilities to other executives with an expectation that Mr. Homeister’s employment will terminate during the Company’s second fiscal quarter of 2021. Mr. Homeister’s resignation will be treated as a resignation for Good Reason (as defined in his Employment Agreement, a copy of which is an exhibit to the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 30, 2019).”

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's possibly room for both, but those of us in on RKT are there for the fintech side. They've already disrupted mortgages enough UWMC issued an ultimatum, and are working to do the same to auto and personal.

UWMC is a nice safe stock, pay a little dividend, and unless mortgage rates go above 6%, should likely trade near where it is at, maybe up 5-10% once shorts move on."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked for both of these companies. As an LO for QL (RKT) and an AE for UWM(C). Both companies are good companies and always out perform their competition. But now that they're actually competing against each other... it's interesting. One thing I will say is, QL definitely trains its employees better and have much more knowledgeable members. If I was a betting man, Dan Gilbert will win against the Ishbia's.

Not to mention that RKT double dipped these deals in the past (not sure if they still do). But typically RKT retail would refinance their brokers loans later on. Allowing them to originate a loan for the same consumer twice in a relatively short time."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since you are so eager, here - I’ll give you my downvote"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s a lot of ways to play gme. Holding LONG is honestly a good play and plenty of good DD supports that.

The squeeze is the other side of gme and the best way to make that happen is to keep as much of the float locked up possible. For the 8 million noobs who just showed up here it’s probably the best strategy to just HODL. For the >200 buy-in bag holders it’s the only strategy. 

For me personally, I’m selling weekly covered calls and reinvesting the premium into shares. I’m LONG gme but I’m hedging the risk a little. If my call is assigned I will just sell a put at the money and again buy more shares with the premium. 

The upside: my gme position is growing without adding any more cash.

The downside: not all of my shares will ride the rocket when it goes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s no squeeze because you keep day trading it...

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously, especially the trades he's mentioned: buying 175, selling 177, also buy 205 selling 206? Like sure if you invested $1m+ that's substantial, but if u can only buy a few shares why bother."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I would not try to do that if you don't have enough to day trade. If you don't have the freedom to get in or out whenever you want, it's easy to get stuck with a terrible position that continues to get worse while your hands are tied. Day trade rule is bs if you ask me, but gotta play with the tools you have"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sibling comments is actually good.

Look what's not pictured here is that I started day trading in 2019 with 25k. It's hard to get to that point but once you do the world is your oyster. It's literal math, and I'm a spreadsheet freak, so I set goals for myself.

I have 25k. I want to get to 30k. That's 5k. So I'll gamble with $1,000. If I hold in one stock, maybe I can turn that into $100. Do that again and again and again and yeah, you'll get to 30k. That's all I did. The pandemic let me work from home, and with vaccines coming out, I probably won't have as much time to sit and trade as I would like. But it's about taking baby risks over and over.

There's also NO shame in taking money out and just buying yourself nice shit! Holy hell. Let it squeeze, I don't care, I can pay rent for the year without thinking about it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he losing money to the point he can’t write it off?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you turned 50k into 3 mil and instead of posting a single gain porn post, you post shit like this. Seems legit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah cool. I was guessing mostly trading shares.  Good job dude. How about your options play?  Looks like a nice profit.  Was that purchased while back?  

I only ask because you didn’t explain and I like to see what else I can do to make more also.  And you can’t just tell everyone there wrong. They might just be poor and not educated as well to play stocks.  

But there’s nothing wrong with what your doing. It’s a good job.  I’ve been in and out 3 times and made back everything I lost on tech stocks. Selling CC and buying more and buying back my cc’s. 
Poor man way because I’m limited funds."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I plan on doing next week. It’s free money with a juicy premium. Plus I can add to my position.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you are welcome :)

I want the old WSB back."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So what's the math? The strategy is buying volatile stocks cheaply? What's your exit strategy if it picks up momentum?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"nah i think this is a retarded look at me post.

no one asked for advice. or for you specifically to teach them anything. in fact your not teaching shit but just saying hey guys look at me. look what i can do.

no one cares. what you can do or make. if you're frustrated with the atmosphere in this sub, you don't have to be a part of it. you can do the mature thing and trade and keep your financials to yourself.

Many traders don't have as high capital as you do now. Even 25k on such sideway days is pretty much nothing, and it's still risky play in case GME go tits up (playing for long squeeze is risky too, but at least you are not playing for peanuts).

Your post was massively assholeish, and I pity you because of that. There are much better ways to convey ""how to make money"" than jumping in and throwing shit. Hope your money brings you happiness."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is your right to keep taking ""baby risks"" and making 100 there and 100 here. The rest of us will hold until each share is worth 10x as much. Let's hope you aren't on the wrong side of the aisle when that happens."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol!!!!!   I asked nicely guys. And even said it’s a good job and didn’t get down voted.  I’m just curious how everyone’s making so much money.  Aren’t you guys!?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that's what i was thinking. i didn't see him teaching anything.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"> keep your financials to yourself.

You are one dumb fuck. This sub used to be about showing your gains and losses. There's fucking FLAIR for it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's already made 120x his initial investment. Take your per-share cost basis, multiply by 120, and then actually SELL when it hits that price and you will have done as well as he has. 

Every short squeeze (basically by definition) is fast-moving and drops just as fast. Its almost like something that happened back in January. 

What he is trying to point out in the OP is that it is obvious to anyone playing the market that a big percentage of the float owned by retail is essentially non-tradable. Therefore, price can move significantly (down AND UP) due to the low volume. Smart money (i.e. the hedge funds you all think are simultaneously genius-level diabolical and apparently unable to read posts in a public forum) is not hoping to profit from a bankruptcy or tank in share price; they're profiting from the guaranteed swings of a stock that has insane levels of bull sentiment in retail and also low volume. 

The guys you think you are bankrupting are making tons of money off of you and giggling ""Diamond Hands"" and ""YOLO"" to themselves every time yet another trade turns a profit."

If I would have done SPX put spread writing in the morning and just let it ride, I would have made $12K with a lot less effort.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, im going to be so pissed when I’m on the other side of this fence.  But I gotta tell you coming into this thread every day and seeing people go “I was sure it was all going to crash this week! There is no way we aren’t going to bleed red next week.” Ever single week is not getting old. I love checking the daily threads and every single hour of every day you can find someone saying “Better get out before it crashes in 30 minutes.”

I didn‘t believe it the first 12 times I read it this morning. If your 0 DTE puts are going to get sold back by Robinhood at 3:00 I gotta tell you trying to panic WSB is not going to help you. Everyone here knows everyone here is an idiot. I would honestly spread baseless optimism rather than FUD.

I did almost buy puts after seeing so much “$X going give it to ya”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried buying back a covered call in my cash account and realized I'm now restricted to settled funds only because of too many Good Faith violations.  Joke is on the SEC though, I had enough settled cash in my margin account to send to my cash account and close that call, and I initiated a transfer of 28k of AAPL shares and LEAPs to my margin account and ETrade already has me squared away.

But yeah cash accounts generally suck.  You could have a million bucks and if you buy with unsettled funds and sell it while those funds are still unsettled, they'll slam you with PDT-style restrictions"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in my personal opinion, the price action for Nasdaq this week was extremely bullish, and it all has to do with the 13,000 level that is successfully closed above.

**First we look at the monthly chart:**

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/yn94LL6V/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/yn94LL6V/)

In January and February, even though we traded above 13,000, we ended up falling below it by end of month. For March, up until this week, we were holding the same pattern. We traded above it at some point, but we were below it going into Monday. So with the month-end yesterday, we successfully crossed it and closed above it. In other words, also having the best monthly close on Nasdaq.

**Then we look at the weekly chart:**

[https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGw7x8vS/](https://www.tradingview.com/x/BGw7x8vS/)

Ever since the tech correction, for fourth weeks straight, we also traded above 13,000, but closed below it by week end. Well, with today's close, we have also successfully closed above 13,000 on the weekly chart ever since the correction began.

Moving forward, I expect Nasdaq to make a run to its prior ATHs."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's that about?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont make sense of it cause it doesnt.  Nothing makes sense.  Fundamentals dont matter nothing matters.  We will be buying bread with 10k Bills but as long as thay printer stays on doesnt matter
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I regret almost every play I make. Almost...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some 4/16 calls I’ve been regretting for 2 months - but market keeps hitting new ATH. Guess I should just drop everything to fucking trade SPY.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,After it sat at 399 for a couple hours lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP SPY $400 Puts. Crying till monday.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My poor 400 puts on spy for 4/7... didn’t expect it to break eod
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CPNG
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Comment of the day right here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah curious to see if we get any follow through on monday or they are like woo printed SPY 400, cya bitches. Feel like they may push it a bit further, but we have some gaps left open down below."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You deserve some attention
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, OR.... none of that happens and SPY just keeps going up and bears get raped as usual"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I agree I got some spy weeklies 400/399 puts at the bell.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The hell are you talking about? We closed above $400 today. What resistance?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Too easy!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,too auspicious.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that what killed its progress today?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It does this all the time so now I know when I get close enough to my cost average, I’m dumping it before 10 am on a good day"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a craving for hunny
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ur moms anus

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking theta gang cleaning up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hm... I’ll allow it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Im fresh. Not even a month in. My porrfolio in 3 weeks has gone from up 25 percent to down 35 percent to now up 2 percent. Its been a roller coaster 3 weeks thanks to this sub.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold at open and rolled out to next week
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"thx 🥰 how nice of you, so nice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like sprite
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🥲nice of you to think I get a paycheck
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Mac, there's absolutely zero chance that Spy will gamma squeeze to 420."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on my bias
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just be gone by the time Joe Rogan dies and you’ll be fine
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes great hair gel.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Will oil fall as well?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,January 2021
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad I (maybe) saved you some money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes me too fuck the mitten state
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at u/trainwreck001 ‘s recent comments. He might just be LARPing though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I missed out on so much money because I stayed bear, even into May"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi. Erm, see pinned posts."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, she’s a hog, but she ain’t lean."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I eat crayons
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought two $40s today too, cause why the fuck not they were cheap."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah just trying not to get banned. Fuck it I’ll dispute it all and just switch to TD
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just get a refund?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,really.. you think we want to get it on the dip?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's nice but I couldn't watch a baseball game if you paid me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean short interest is high, today was almost a quarter short volume. 100k left available.

I think they might be on to something, but I bet it's more likely to be periodic squeezes like the one to 350 that last a few days until a short covers and then someone else steps up to sling those shares short at a higher price. Thing is people will just buy the dip last week was the prime example. Down 40% one day and then up 50% the next.

I'm not in it but it's nuts watching. Next dip I wanna grab a leap and use it to sell poor man cc's. The premiums are absolutely disgusting."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yuppp
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,His titty has a boo boo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"this week nasdaq closed above 13300, that's above fib 61.8% means trend reversal. Also price action today is very bullish"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's on my radar but looking for a good entry
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta join theta gang when things get choppy like the last 2 months.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that EOD run was crazy. It just hit $401 in AH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve posted it in the wrong thread twice now so I go for round 3 lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,qqq has gaps above that it might want to close to push spy higher too

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe it will maybe it won't. No big deal to me, it's just money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well isn’t that a kick in the nads.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Can't stop myself lol. wendys or lambo!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"She's made a career of that, she probably won't even know you're there"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,40 on her anus
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Proud of you 👏
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes!!! They will print
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes. Well played.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a chuckle
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not loss porn without photographic evidence
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This the way! Now imagine we see a MOASS Monday 🤯
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would’ve been last week or two when it was at like 50
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn't mean it the way you are thinking of it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad you enjoyed the joke. It must've struck a nerve with the salty bag holders because idk why I got downvoted for that lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He has to post it. Please. I need to see it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m optimistic. DD I’ve read is extremely solid. I live in Texas. Everyone buys their outdoor shit at Academy. Sports apparel, football cleats for 7on7, HS football, and fall sports for girls and guys, not to mention guns, fishing gear, tailgate items for NFL, College and High School. It really is a great play long term if you have shares. And it’s a great play short term given short interest."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I missed it unfortunately...was focused on loading up on JMIA
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think you’ll be fine xD
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me, sir? That is not an index mutual fund."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm slowly building a position, wish I could just do this instead"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying stocks isn't a yolo.  Get tits deep in OTM options that expire in a week and post that shit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#boomer does not know how to comment on WSB🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are these listed as separate entities? Are these options? What are the specifics?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"GS Analysts recommended a buy rating but we already bought before that ! Cos we like the stonk 
💎🖐💎"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"WTF is with $PLTR??  It just ran up 20% in like 4 days then it lost 25% in 5 days.

Everyday, except yesterday for some reason, at the open where there is a lot of volume it goes down.  Then the littles guys drive it up all day then at the close, again with a lot of volume it gets crushed.  Then after-hours it goes up, rise and repeat.

WTF is going on?  I get this was a meme stock for like 5 minutes, but this is actually a good company.

I'm pissed cause I'm a bag holder at $29 with more than this boomer posted.

What is it?  Do the Hegies just hate Cathie Wood?  Or do they still think this is a meme stock?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Old head Ape here!! How do I find chats on the stock root?? Frustrated Ape
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that’s what I’m talking about.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where the Fuck is PLTR going to take us to? I meant this shit hit $40 and drop back to $25. Shit is going to take 10 years to get maybe $100+, but hell, I'm in with 200 share for 10 years to ride this out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta start somewhere. I have a small position in it right now. 500 shares but I might fuck around and buy some more
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Learning about it 👍😜
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I finally could with 50+ karma pts 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like stocks on Fidelity separate accounts LOL....boomer to the max😂

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuuuuckkkk. Well done. When did you buy those AMD calls?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow someone making money on AMD didn’t think it was possible besides puts. Lost 5 grand on calls a month ago.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My man. 10x on a 1DTE call play. You sonofabitch
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When did you buy those Amd options?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you do ? Buy the option yesterday for close today ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Better being lucky than good is what I always say
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What made you buy them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably two days ago
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's finally time I buy AMD calls
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, you belong here. You are very good at this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,the fed always wins
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too good, I might have to leave and start my own following. 2 days into opening this contract I was up 160% diamond handed it all the way to the mattress factory.
This year I've made 100k then lost 110k playing with 15k."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Beware of taxes man. I just read some shit about some dude who made 45k trading idk how much but he ended up owing 800K
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How many trades ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s heavy. It would mean that if you made losses during a year, you still should pay taxes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s cause the idiot didn’t know about wash sale rules. Hopefully OP didn’t trigger wash sales...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get it while you can at these low prices. People still don’t know dick about shit when it comes to the future of autonomous driving /security. Autonomous driving will be worth trillions in the not so distant future. There’s a reason Uber is investing in that field. I hate to see it dip this low but hey, this is the business we’ve chosen."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. It's been driving me nuts seeing everyone freak out without understanding what they will become.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought more shares. Sold covered calls. Won’t be upset if I get assigned. Gonna be a long slow climb I think so not sure if I am 🌈🧸 or not.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought last October and held through the insane highs of January even though my friends and family told me to sell. 💎 🙌🏼 

I still believe in BB!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I didn't jump in huge, but I did dip a toe in the water... lets go BB"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is Blackberry a meme stock? Is this also a Moon contender?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Held my shares, no reason to sell when I’m down and the company has good direction."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of ppl here buying every stock they see and selling after some little losses/wins..  
I mean, people are freaked out.. If they are freaked out, why dont they just buy some random boomer stock and check their portfolio 1 year later? Wtf..  


Same shit is happening with all stocks here, damn, i dare to say even GME has those problems. People cant understand that if they sell PART of their stake and keep adding every time the stock dips, it will skyrocket...  


Looks like its quantum physics for some..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to load up to the gills boiz stock on sale🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip holding long term 🙌🏼
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in and got a seat for the ride.. how long it takes im not in a rush 🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought a couple hundred more today and sold some $7/8 puts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get fucking enraged watching L2 on BB. It's like PLTR, it has regular bear attacks; 4-5 chunks of 40,000-50,000 shares appear in the ask for a split second then the price drops 0.10."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,170 shares and of BB.  Got back to break even a few days back.  Bought in part cuz mutiple etfs have it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GARBOOOOOOOPOOP
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought at 18. Glad I sold at 12 rather than iron handing down to 8.

I lost 20k between this and pltr.

When it hits 1$ I'll trust it again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just don't believe in the company.  I'm never going to buy a phone from them and I don't know anyone who has
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have owned Blackberry in the past for less than the value of the cash on the balance sheet and the charts says I might get my chance again.

All the best talent in Waterloo has left to create a very dynamic economy. Once the Bay Street die hardship give up on this look out below"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t mind - Great deal on BB because of it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They cheaper the stock, the more I can buy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The absolute numb nuts that were talking about selling and that it was going to hit $4 don't know shit about fuck. It was always going to go down after the earnings call. There was practically no way, due to Covid, for them to up. What the fuck were these goobers thinking?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry was one of the companies heavily shorted, so that’s why it got bundled into the meme stocks. Also like AMC and GameStop, they are a former major company that fell on hard times that is trying to turn it around. BB has totally changed their strategy and are going into cyber security more than phones. I feel that they have the proper staffing and experience to right the ship and turn blackberry into a powerhouse again. However, I fully expect it to take 3+ years to reach that, but when they do I expect the stock to be $100+. I don’t think we will see the sudden moonshot like we did with GME (though I’m unaware of the current short situation) but I do think we will see linear growth with explosive potential"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ez 2 to 3 bagger. And thats by conservative boomer estimates.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,absolute retard right here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No more phones my guy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless your heart
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Everytime I see a comment like this I’m like oh damn that’s not good I’m balls deep in BB and this guy is saying it’s a no good stock! Then I think better read it so I get a balanced view...as soon as they mention mobile phones you realise why this stock is so undervalued 😂😂 that more than any DD is the reason I’m bullish
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"hurr durr   
blackberry = phones  
Kellog's = cereals  
apple = macintosh  
microsoft = windows..  


dude.. get out of your little box.."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm willing to bet we're hovering right around $30 by EOY. I think that the patent sale will bring it to $15, and then immediately analysts will dump all over them, as per usual, and it'll maybe hover around $12-$14. Three good quarters, a few more big name partnerships and then IVY released in October, we'll get there.

By the end of 2022, I fully agree and expect to be heading towards $100+. Essentially, BB gave up trying to compete in the billion dollar smartphone industry and instead bet it all on the (what will be) trillion dollar iot/autonomous driving industry."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We are all retarded here but this guy definitely takes aim at top retard
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,there exists two worlds: a world that is full on retarded and a world that is just full of retards. guess which world this ape belongs?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're welcome
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s got my vote
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, do yourself a favor and read up a little on BB and what they're doing. Its actually disturbing me how blind you come across with your comments. Either way, good luck n bless up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're a little late to the party.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone called yu retarded. I didn't becuase that was said. I said to read up on it, becuase no one else told you to read up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,PSFE is going to be a beast. Better get in now before the 🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The numbers Mason...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you say more interest in either side infers that the market favors one side? I.e 2x calls than puts = bullish?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fuck it why not. $35 4/16 Call, I'll pick up more on Monday or next week"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They smashed cause everyone wanted stuff for home to sate boredom

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shiiiit hope I can still get in on monday.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 and 5/21 gang!! 🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Still got my 10/15 $40c option. Big spike today for me 🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought my first 750 shares yesterday after waiting a month on the lockup.
Hesitated on buying 1500 instead, already regretting I haven't"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucked up selling this one but I am a retard after all. DD is solid this one is a buy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Great little earner so far. Wish I could buy options but have been holding stock since Dec so can’t complain. Strong results coming out recently show the strength of company
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, always enjoy my daily dose of confirmation bias."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol my 4/16 calls  are coming back from the dead
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got in early, sold my 4/16 30c and bought a lot of 35c, ASO is the fucking play right now you tards."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"30c 4/16, , 6/21, and 7/16 + 200 shares.

I love Academy, been going there my whole life.  Other than Bass Pro it really is the best outdoors store.  Dicks is just a city slicker wannabe that's worse than REI.  But we all know Wall Street loves dicks.

Edit: just added 5/21 30c, because it was the only expiry date I was missing.  Now my collection is complete."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got some shares, wish my broker would get around to enabling options on my account already, it's been a fucking month."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it be dumb to buy rn if I’m not doing options trading
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,30c 4/16 checking in I LIKE IT
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've got 4/16 30/35/40 at the moment, mostly 30 though. Looking for this to run after such solid earnings and the great position the company is in."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, sure. I'm in for 5 shares and a 5/21 $35c"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"35c 4/16 over here, I’m getting in while I still can"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 4/16 $30 strikes today in one account...  


In another account I've had $25c's for a few days now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Academy is a shoe store that sells guns. Buy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking wish you posted this a week ago if i’m honest
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In at $28 with 0.001 shares, let's go babe!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What you think of those May 40c?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha shouldn’t have paper traded but thanks for the ticker
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If the ammo shortage continues it will help
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in. 10 30c 4/16  and 1 25c 4/16. Great store. Great stock.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got contracts that break even at 37.10
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re over $29 now
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Academy is the shit - the store and now the stock too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wdym 9.1 days to cover?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damnit, I've got their jingle stuck in my head now, fuck you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would love to see them grow and come to Colorado. Unfortunately Bass Pro is cornering the retail outdoors market here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So price prediction?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm amazed that a regional brick and mortar sporting goods store is an up and coming stock?  What exactly am I missing here?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,hate to point out errors here but it might be untrue that every short is underwater - there might be new ones coming in since the last SI report. feeling  greedy just thinking about what actual SI is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I belive in ASO as a ""value play"", I thank all the DD's I saw WEEKS ago for the profits I made (when it was 23ish), but I'm not sure if whoever isn't IN already lost the timing. How much more upside it'll see short term??Short term 30C calls will probably print though.

But again, if you are going in NOW, meh, maybe theres other options with more upside potential out there for quicker profits? Of course if you want to go long it seems a solid choice, lots of going things going on with ASO (check all the recent DDs!)

Personally I'm betting on APHA for this month, but I'm sure theres lots of other opportunities out there that might see larger crayons"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny how pretty much all the posts about $ASO during the past two months coming from accounts younger than 1 year, with pretty much no other posts except other ""this gonna squeeze!"" type of crap."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,brick n mortar eww?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why no one mentions the end of share lockup? Dont get too excited. PLTR also went up before slowly going down.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Here I am thinking I was retarded for picking up 30 $30 4/16 calls in January lol glad to see wsb is coming back for me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely can
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Also holding a small amount of shares at $23.97
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not too late
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely not too late
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo same lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t agree more hopefully I can pick up more calls before it pops 🤞🏾
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to get a different broker than my guy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had that issue as well. I ended up just reapplying but this time saying that I had years and years of options experience. WOrked like a charm and got approval right away.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me guess. Fidelity?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I left Fidelity   


Took a month to approve options and only approved me for fucking CC and CSP. Instantly switched to Ameritrade"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Macd rsi reversing and EMA and sma just crossed also reversing upwards
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also they issued guidance that EBITDA margin would only come down by half a percent in the coming year (due to full staffing versus COVID staffing) so they project to continue being an ultra efficient machine.

As they said on the call, there were days in 2020 when they sold ZERO cleats and they got nothing from licensed gear, both of which will come back big time as the sports world reopens.  Texas and other southern states do youth sports year round.  No breaks."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I have no idea but with all the proponents in play if shorts choose to cover, which if they arent fucking retarded they will, then for sure $100+"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It IPO'd with a lot of long term debt on their balance sheet in the middle of COVID.  But they restructured all their LTD, paid it down by 50%, and paid their operating line to zero from half a billion.  Their debt to assets were a concern but not really the case anymore.  Meanwhile they increased cash on hand to $900 million.

The only thing I remain concerned about is KKR, the private equity firm that brought then public, divesting further as they did in January.  It's non-dilutive but it would still add to the float and volume hasn't been high enough until this week to eat it up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Very big in the south. Dicks not as popular here as in certain parts of the nation.  Cabela’s/Bass Pro longer drives to visit.  People still like to walk into a business. I don’t believe this is an ammo availability issue. No one has ammo.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price never was so high so they are all underwater. Well I guess, I'm stupid so idk much about it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the price of the stock, EVERY SINGLE ONE IS UNDERWATER CURRENTLY"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look into aso. This actually might have some sort of squeeze. Better chance than gme currently. And the stock is undervalued and had massive earnings. Can't go wrong with this one it feels like
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was yesterday. Many, like myself, waited till that. Reason it's going up now I think"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yesterday.  It opened down 8% and closed up 1.5%.  That was lockup expiration day.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for reassuring me fellow ape.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I almost paper handed when we got that baby volatility bump pre eps so glad I didnt !
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,By 4/16 ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,haha i suppose technically that's always the case when a stock's at ATH isnt it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"where can you check this? or simply because it's near its top price right now, meaning all shorts done beforehand are OTM"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Better chance than gme currently

Why is that?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good shit bro lets get it!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m optimistic, if you’d like to give yourself more time the May or July calls aren’t that expensive"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah took me a second, but figured it out on my own. wow. am i high level trader now"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorts done beforehand are all OTM due to it being at all time high. Just like you said. There was anticipation for a huge drop after share lock up expired on Tuesday... it looks like some guy sold just a couple hundred thousand and the rest are letting their shares ride.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme has 10m shorts, 22% of float while aso is at 48% of float I see on yahoo. Idk if it's true though.
What we do know is all aso shorts are negative now, while gme shorts might have opened at 300+

Sure there is speculation about wrong numbers on GME shorts, but I don't believe in that

Anyways I think aso is just a good stock since it's undervalued"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The GME short is over. There aren't even that many shorts and the ones that exist have tons of liquidity to ride it out and largely established their shorts in the 200-300+ range; not even underwater
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Alrighttt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,advanced ape
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin Sick.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for sharing your thoughts!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your source on this?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck it i'm gonna buy a batch of $30 calls at market open next week. i'm feeling proud.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're welcome, but I might be wrong though. Like I said, I do think it's a good stock"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Reality.  Shorted shares are way down per every source and what remains is both hedged and in the green.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, reality. You a dummy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There's no squeeze coming buddy.  Sorry.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC has a track record since November of issuing these sorts of announcements and then issuing shares as quickly as they can. They went from 80 some million shares to 450 million through issuing new shares for sale on the public and diluting the existing shareholders.

Why on Earth would we believe them now when they say we just need the rights to sell them we're not going to.

They have a history of doubling the number of outstanding shares, and that is exactly what they're doing right now. 


https://www.sharesoutstandinghistory.com/amc/"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Feel like AMC is taking advantage of us instead of the other way around. Not a fan, stocks are dropping. So I bought some more to maximize my loss."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re right, it is not going to dilute you on may 4th just the right to dilute you up to 50% whenever they feel like it. Sounds good for shareholders..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"With close to 80% retail holding that stock, if that dilution vote does go through - it would mean a massive crash of stock price considering retail will bail out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, those AMC puts were printing today 😳"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before close I'm considering of taking profits. I was hoping for more, but now I definitely hope they go down under for the memes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hopped off it, missed the 14$ window before they all started giving each other bonuses."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dumb apes ignore the fact that they’ve already done several offerings in the last few months. It literally went from 105 million in shares outstanding to 450 million incrementally since January. Like they’ve been slowly turning up the heat in hopes that retail doesn’t jump out of the pool before they sell more debt at a premium. Short % of float was at like 11% last reported, and they still think it’s ripe for a squeeze."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a reason why both amc and gme started with 2-4 dollars but amc's max was 19$. That boomer board gives no shits about you guys. They pay themselves millions while their employees are struggling to pay rent. They WANT to dillute (for like the 5th? time in a year) the stock and double the float. They haven't been profitable in ages and have 0 plans of changing that. They will take your stock money and give themselves more payouts while letting the company die. I know i will get downvoted for this but it makes me sad to see gullible apes lose money. Most of you are buying this instead of GME because it's ""cheap"". But i think it will be a lot cheaper and if you buy at 10 and it goes to 5 you still lose half your money. But it IS your money so do whatever the fuck you want, just don't forget to post loss porn."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Regardless, my AMC puts sitting pretty"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold when it 13. The ceo and others gave themselves huge bonuses for doing nothing and didn’t try to hire back employees that had lost jobs due to covid closing. It was like they took a big shit on investors. 
When I voiced my opinion, I was told I was nuts and they deserve the bonus for being a ceo.. 
and today I watched him with Kramer and I’m glad I got out. 
When it drops to $3... I might get back in. 
But, they need to replace those ceo."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC just seems so fucking boring to me so I poured everything into GME. Now that I could wait out for months-years to come.

Edit: AMC is a side bitch when I should be spending all energy towards my wife, GME."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. Once the vote goes in, the news will be reason to sell. So you sell before hand, and now you have a race condition to sell before the sellers sell the news. Queue infinite regression, and you might as well sell now, because fuck math and human psychology."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because this won't happen right away doesn't mean the stock price will go up

I get you are trying to get people to hold because it's mostly retail invested but why would anyone possible buy in now"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock is already down 9%. It seems that AMC is not interested in making the squeeze happen. Unlike GME, AMC hasnt even bothered to show any support for apes on social media or press releases. If anything, AMC is so freaking greedy they are willing to forego the squeeze just to make short-term earnings from a share dilution. At this point, I am thinking if, AMC itself cant be bothered, then why I should keep holding into their stocks and risk my money or even let AMC make more money at my expense. Might as well let HFs short the hell out of them. I personally think that if any price jump happens then it will be some sympathy action during the GME squeeze. I will be sure to get rid of my AMC stocks during that."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gave that a hard NAY!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was long at 1000 @ 7.47. I sold end of last week. 

CEO has come out publicly and said they are for introducing shares. They absolutely mismanaged this opportunity. Can't teach new tricks to and old dog."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shareholder votes don't matter. Think about them like campaign promises. Lol. This squeeze won't happen because you guys don't understand basic stuff like this about stonks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit! Guess I better roll my puts out to June
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t know why you retards are hell bent on trying to turn AMC into GME. The fact that the execs keep telling you they are going to dilute shares and you just shrug it off and keep buying speaks volumes of your retardation. This stock is going back to $1.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts go brrrrr
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You all are missing the point. If they don't do this, then they'll have to raise debt to stay in business and bankruptcy risk is back on the table by year end. They're already paying ridiculous interest rates on their current debt. If the vote fails, this stock may crash. If the vote succeeds, it'll glide down and you're hoping the company does something intelligent with the money to bring the stock up in the future. Some people have the pipe dream that it'll squeeze before the crash. Ask yourself if institutional investors are that eager to try and squeeze a company that may declare bankruptcy before the year is out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait for another AMC rug pull
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Without the squeeze play AMC is a dead investment. At least with GME, squeeze or no squeeze, solid long term investment for dozens of reasons,chief among them they are not 12 billion in debt. Sold all AMC first week of March and never looked back."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never thought I would dislike a board and ceo more than GameStop before Ryan Cohen, but man is amc horrendous."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They are giving us notice that they will screw us.  I'm taking the warning
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol AMC will soon have a float size of the pacific ocean look at NOk that's that AMC future looks like
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the record I DO NOT like AMC's stock. But what they are proposing makes a lot of sense long term. To stay alive during covid (and fund those bullshit $$$ executive bonuses) they took out $400m in loans at credit card 10%+ interest rates. They also owe tons of back rent to their landlords.

By issuing more stock they can pay off their debt effectively cleaning the slate moving forward. It's really going to be that or bankruptcy. They also said they won't sell all 500m shares at once but rather in phases.

For those who were hanging on for the hope of a quick short squeeze seems unlikely but if you ""like the stock"" this is good for you long term. YMMV."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck AMC for even introducing the idea. If GME dips, I’m selling off my AMC and buying GME.

AMC can fuck off for spiting in retails face"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Those bags must be heavy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good news apes! They won't dilute you, they will just have the option to dilute you anytime they want for whatever reason.

AMC has never taken advantage of apes before so I don't have any reason to believe that they will dilute!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, bought 130 AMC."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investors/apes seem to be stuck between a rock and a hard place. If they don’t vote for the offering to go through then AMC will miss an opportunity to raise money. If they vote yes, the share price will go down obviously, but it might help the company stay afloat longer. Another question is how much voting power do the executives and private investors hold? Could they possibly outvote retail investors regardless?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a huge catch 22 for shareholders. Vote no and they run the risk of not covering their debts and going into bankruptcy or vote yes and authorize the company to more than double the float to keep out of financial trouble. Last time I was in this situation myself and the other investors voted no and the company no longer exists...This is a crappy development...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahhh the AMC bashers out in full swing. Lovely.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that they are having a vote for the right to add in the shares at this point is not good in and of itself. Whether they do it or not, I have to question the motive behind why they want to vote on it. Either way I'm a shareholder and I like the stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't shorts need to close their positions and return shares to their owners for anyone wanting to vote on this? Isn't that the squeeze we've all been waiting for? That would be during the run up to the meeting no?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still have a few hundred AMC.  I got in south of $5 and while I coulda got out at 14 easy enough, I need to know a bit more about why the Class A stock increase before I will be willing to sell.  A drop of a couple/three bucks isn't that big of a deal to me considering where I got into AMC.  I still like the movies even if I don't like the current CEO. lol  Holding for more information before I bail out of the movie train."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it get diluted, I'll sell.
Otherwise, nah."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My 10P that I bought last week printed today, I still lost on my 9.5P, but I will probably get more puts on monday.  AMC is not going to recover."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since retail investors, WE APES, own almost 90% AMC, this is not gonna pass it on May 4th."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,wtf is the difference? they still wanna pocket your money by playing the GME squeeze wave.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to buy more puts!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wallstreetbets. We are betting on a short squeeze. Most of these comments should be on r/investors. Stay focused apes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe that today's action is an April Fool's prank.

Expect AMC to open at $15 on Monday..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same fucking shit. Market will react the same regardless of your pedantic PSA.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's correct, but because if valuation and desperately tragic finances they are going to issue them on first few days for sure."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are absolutely right.

What do you think the exec team will do if the request to reserve 500m shares for issuance is approved at the shareholder meeting?

How are they going to deal with their debt obligations?

Can you list what are the positive catalysts coming up that will push the price up, now that all theatres have reopened?

Do you see this 500m stock reserve request as a potential positive or negative catalyst for the price? 

I have written dd on amc in the past with specific price targets mentioned and catalysts etc. but I'd like your opinion on this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is up for vote in May. The short term technicals can still make you money, I say calls after a day like today is ez gains"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Right but the price going down indicates that investors believe the shares will in fact be issued.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the comments, y’all actually convinced me to buy more AMC. When ppl get vaccinated, they are gonna want to REEEE their ass to the movies. Also AMC vip crap looks enticing edit: apes misspell kiss my ass"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont know about AMC though. GMEs the play. At a restaurant why settle for weenies when you can have steak?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodling
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's do a real world test. Raise your hand if you have been on a cruise in the last year.

OK, now raise your hand if you've been to a cinema in that same time.

Nuff said."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias confirmed! Bought 100 more stocks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Executives sell shares and claim tendies knowing they are going to dilute or go into bankruptcy. Also collecting large bonuses when the company is grasping for air. It infuriates me but I guess I would probably do the same if I was in there position. Still going to hold my 100 shares because in all honestly I like the stock and I just want to go back to the fucking movie theaters and watch bad ass movies. I always enjoyed it and I’m sure many others did too.. Do we think it’ll ever be normal again or did covid cause a total paradigm shift in the way we watch new movies now?  I just want to watch new releases in front of a huge screen with lots of shnackssss.. anyways LONG HODL @ $12
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am going to buy the dip and Diamond Hands!  I am voting yes on introducing more shares.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got out at 14 amc taking advantage of us. Papa cohen over at gme takes cares of his investors
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would I like my stock to be worth 0% or 50%?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i might just buy to be able to vote to help all the other apes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I still believe in AMC not because I like the stock but because I LOVE the stock !!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's eye opening to see so many bashers here going against AMC.

I thought GME and AMC are together... you guys get paid by citadel or what? 

&#x200B;

Don't spread the fear, HF feed on our fear. Just because you are in GME, doesn't mean you should talk trash to AMC. 

&#x200B;

Come on guys, we are in this together, where are the spirits? Don't be toxic."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We're not getting screwed on may 4th, this is the dinner before that."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC owners are just bag holders at this point.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not as rich as some of you apes but I got another 100 shares today. LFG
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kinda curious here.... but if i hold AMC shares, does that mean i can vote?

- if yes, how do i do this?
- also does that mean the shares will have to be counted for a voting to take place?
- Would that mean shorts have to cover or this counting will reveal naked shorts?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Either way I added 100 more shares to my portfolio for safekeeping. 💎✋🏼🦍🍌
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of us don't care if AMC flops because the stock is cheap af. I'm holding my 1200 shares!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t matter, stock will still tank on the news"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the same folks are shorting both AMC & GME, don't they get a lot more ammo if everyon sells AMC for GME and AMC ends up dying? 

If it doesn't hurt to hold, maybe continue holding AMC as well? I sold a tiny bit of AMC for profit, to buy a bit more GME - it didn't cross my mind."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is a lost cause. Why even need to vote for the right to issue shares if they don’t actually want to introduce them.

In the midst of a war, the board abandoned the apes for their own bonuses."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This seems to have been debunked hours ago, but the stock is still dumping. Also, no one told me to HODL my crayons. I ate the last of them for lunch"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I think it's a good idea to knockout the debt. If they don't dig out of debt the wsb rally just delays the bankruptcy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would seriously consider exiting before it goes back to 5 a share or worse they are using the hype to dillute and avoid bankruptcy but you will be eating the cost
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been saying that for a while. Its amazing it's at nine bucks.  I'm kind of sad I sold my puts, with cheap calls(because it's a cult stock) and few hours ago, because it wasn't moving fast enough in price.  Starting Monday it's puts and puts only.  Probably too late, but if it stays at nine, there still a lot of fat.  It's status on WSB keeps it from going below seven and easily down below 5 based on the fact they diluted their shares 4 times as of November compared to their pre-Covid number, it's a lot more since then, and more to come.  Ouch.  Me without my puts I feel so helpless.  I always like having low cost puts on a company in case of a market sell off or bad news over the weekend."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is dead bruh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes exactly right sir.

It's only scary fake news if you're a paper handed cu.ck."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So foolish people believe this and the stock drops, creating a buying opportunity for the rest of us who understand it. As long as we really do understand it correctly"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like many, I bought into both companies at the same time. Not because I stand to make a killing on either one of them, but because I want to show support for a business that I enjoyed when I was younger. If they are having to sell off shares to make themselves more solvent, I'm cool with that even if it means my Shares are worth less. At the end of the day, if I make any tendies at all, I am a very happy camper. If I lose everything I invested, no big loss."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My AMC calls are melting down... luckily expiration is in September.  Hopefully things will improve before then
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't see the chances happening right in front of your eyes? Another legacy director announced resignation.  They're opening the path to effective and innovative management... and they're lucky to be doing this turn around on zero interest rate environment.. there's so much liquidity out there that people keep buying any stocks with growth potential.  

How can explain Fisker and Nikola..haven't produced one single vehicle yet and people keep pouring money onto them? 

How much money to you think they cruise companies are burning every day and yet their stocks keep flying high."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Small ball sellers lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,True fact  FUD scare tactics by Hedgies. Fuk them.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that’s good. I’m sure the smart money won’t react to the vote, they’ll probably wait for the actual introduction so whatever they are holding will be diluted and driven down by that time."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't waiting to see amc loss porn.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gtfo of AMC. Got my shares called away with cc's. Couldn't be happier.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL fuck AMC how anyone can still be in this company is beyond me

Theatres are straight up dying with new movies going straight to streaming 

AMC executives are diluting the stock to pay themselves fat bonuses   


AMC will CONTINUE diluting the stock every chance they get 

Imagine holding this trash... just let it die"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anybody jumping back and forth between AMC and GME is a total moron, a simpleton destined to lose."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't trust like that gme is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I already voted.  Do you even have shares bro?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They just want the right the sell after we squeeze they don’t want to be left holding the bag either 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"*I am a meat popsicle*

Vlad the Impaler approves of this post."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So it happens on May 5th. Sweet.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,im actually retarded and very high but couldnt amc issue the shares during the squeeze make $$$ and use that to pay off their debt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you get to do the shareholder voting, I know I get to, Vote NO on may 4th, I will be. If this goes through, I’ll probably never go to an AMC theatre again. They’re taking advantage of us, we must remind them, we are in charge, and it’s because of us they still exist. They can’t just add shares whenever they so please. I understand this isn’t them adding shares, but usually when somebody wants the right to do something, they plan on doing it. They want to use this as a backup plan for if they don’t get revenue in the numbers expected post-Corona. They have a backup plan, and that backup plan is to try and screw us over, fuck that. 

Also May 4th is my birthday, so give this ape a birthday present by Voting NO."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The force is strong with this one
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So when it goes to moon they can sell more stock
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't this exact fact pointed out several thousand times before this latest buttfuck?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the thought I was having.  Retail investors have been buying and propping up the share price,  and AMC wants to dilute and screw everyone? It's not sitting well with me.  I'm considering dumping out of principal"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is so clearly taking advantage of us. There’s only been one stock for awhile and it’s GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like people forget AMC is not their friend and will fuck them over if it means raising capital so the company doesn't go under. 

Look at all the shit the CEO is doing. This isnt hedge funds guys. The company is cucking you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buying shares or calls doesn't functionally benefit the company. All you're doing is buying (minor) ownership in the company from some random other party. 

What does benefit the company is creating more shares that they issue directly. AMC was so heavily shorted because it's in deep shit. AMC was never the same as GME, it just got bundled in with it because it was the next most shorted company on the market. AMC has a collosal debt to finance and this is one of the few ways they can do so."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Your stock won't be worth much if they file chapter 7.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know how this wasn't obvious the first time they diluted.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i tHOugHt yOU GuYS belIeved IN the ComPanY
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bold of you to think a business gives a shit about random retail investors. Enjoy your bag holding
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should write a book on this strategy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What did u retards think was going to happen with AMC? You stupid fucks buy shit without even reading financial statements.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If people haven't realized AMC is taking advantage of them by now....well then they are too stupid to be helped.

I still think the stock has potential, but their leadership is trash.

EDIT: I feel like I am in crazy town. Arguing with someone with no skin in the game who seems to be both bullish and bearish on AMC. What kind of tards are in this sub? Damn new accounts."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC’s job is NOT to cater to us for our greedy game lol. It is solely there to make money and survive and that is all. Especially, with the recovery from Covid hits. If you don’t like that we invest in the company and NOT the other way around, get out of playing with stocks. Moron.

Edit : I love AMC as a company and hold shares in it. I am mostly in GME for obvious reasons but am long in AMC because I love the company. I could care less about them diluting the price if they did(which they HAVEN’T)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we vote not to keep theatres like a cooler?  Went to movie and was freezing inside
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,company may  not exist or be able to operate how it wants without this injection of $$$
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They have no choice but to keep doing share offerings because they are billions in debt and have no other way to pay it off because their business is failing. If you want to pay that debt go for it but you’re only delaying the inevitable.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Roblox brother
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the goddamn way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,company want money??? what the heck???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why I moved all AMC to gme.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it passes!  And if it passes, there will need to be ANOTHER vote in order to actually introduce them."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It'd help the company to sell more shares. Sounds like something you should want if you want the largest movie chain in America to stay afloat.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The company does not care. If it drops to $4 still a $2B lifeline to a company that almost filed for bankruptcy just a few months ago.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they don't dilute, they might have to declare bankruptcy before the year is out so it'll crash even worse because they'll literally go to zero."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"5/21 $3p lookin like a really spicy yolo

edit: Somebody bought like 4,000 contracts yesterday"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"that boomer board doesn't give a shit about you guys. They will dillute the shares to start and pay offsome of that debt. imho opinion this will be a 2$ stock before it's a 20$ stock. If you want to stay on the memestonks i'd roll over as fast as i can (not financial advice), but the gme guys are actually banking on this to moon. Look what they're doing with the whole transformation. They haven't said much openly, but things like those cat in space and on the moon t-shirts, the squeezable cat banana plushy etc. shows they are very aware of what's happening and who is supporting them. They know most of the people making tendies from this whole saga are people who would 100% shop with them and want them to succeed. This is of course all my opinion and you guys should do with your money what you feel is right."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing about their long term business prospects has changed. Now they are literally trying to double the shares outstanding and beg shareholders for more money. It's hertz 2.0
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, at this point the moment it passes my cost basis I'm out. I'm not wasting my money going long on theaters, I was only here for the possibility of a squeeze"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't think AMC was shorted enough that it was going to be a huge squeeze I really was in it for shares cheap enough to have some assuming they get bought at some point. I sold off my position with the intent to buy some more when it gets lower. I'm definitely willing to take the risk that it doesn't.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would AMC care about a squeeze? In what way were shorts hurting them?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. It has more to do with the fact that the CEO is in interviews advertising they -want- the dilution in order to succeed. I imagine long institutions are on board.. I’m not.

We got played."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ceo could literally say: ""fuck all of you, i will 100% offer those 500M shares and i will keep half of it to by a new yacht"" and people would still find a way to tell themselves that amc will squeeze and that the board is with them and would never dilute the shares..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t forget about those totally deserved bonuses that the execs gave themselves after a year of laying employees off. 

Fuck AMC. Let em burn at this point.

(Edit: I sold off my shares of AMC at around $8 so I’ve no more skin in the game. Still fuck em)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you wait to sell until stock dips?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can confirm
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 600 today!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shareholders? 

People should be in AMC for the short squeeze. The company is a failing company with bad financials before the whole short squeeze thing happened. Why on earth would you invest in AMC longterm?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep seeing this said but it boils down to short term vs long term. Short term investors don't want it to pass because it means their shares lose about 50% value. 

Long term investors want it to pass because -50% value is way better than their shares being worth 0%. 

At least if it passes there is more probability they survive long term if they get their shit together. Short term investors gonna jump ship once it drops though. Regardless of vote."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to get it approved. Institutional investors will vote yes as it will improve the companies balance sheets. And this company was literally on the verge of bankruptcy just a few months ago. They have a massive amount of debt and was in decline before covid.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure they don't actually need shareholder approval. They are just asking nicely.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that most people even have votable shares, if your shares are lent out you can't vote, so you have to make sure that your shares aren't lent out so that you can vote. I doubt most people have done that"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If it does I'm folding my paper hands
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s gonna take a lot of Monday’s to get to $15. I will be waving to you from a $1500 mark on GME.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you buy right now good luck getting voting shares for the deadline
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I already voted no
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own shares, they sent me an email about this and allow you to cast your vote. You have until May 3rd."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you buy at 12 and it drops to 6 you still lose half of your money, just saying."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I was emailed the link my amc as a shareholder to cast my vote. It is on the table to dilute shares and I voted no. We just have to wait and see what the vote turnout says.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A link to where it was debunked please. I love reading all the DD on AMC.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It was debunked a couple weeks ago but idiots who can't read or scroll down about 20 something pages on a proxy report for a company they've invested in are fear selling.  Another heads up isn't too much in my opinion.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think $5 is probably too low of a target just due to the WSB effect. I expect it to drop back to around $6-7 and hover there.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"the difference is that one is erasing and rehiring almost their entire board and releasing squeezable banana cat plushies and cat-on-the-moon t-shirts and the other is paying themselves a nice big paycheck and trying to throw 500M shares on the market so they can start paying some of their billions of debt. but it's your money, so do whatever you want lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have 308M in cash.

They burn through 559M every 3 months on fixed expenses.

They have 1.5B of current liabilities and 487M in current assets.

They spend 100M every 3 quarters in interest.

The best they ever and was 500M in operating profit in 2019 and they seem to waste every money they touch.

They have negative equity of -2.8B and are in fact bankrupt.


Please explain to me how is it going to get better 🤣"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Has basically nothing to do with hedges but go on.

Edit: Someone replied something but then deleted it about the hedges. So I'm gonna add this. The CEO of AMC is the saying this is good for the long term of the company. Saying this will help with debt/rent/literally money issues. This isnt some FUD tactic by hedge funds. Its literally the company saying they are thinking of ways to get money. That vote is so they have the option if they need money to dilute again.

And for clarity sake it doesn't mean they'd instantly dilute the shares if it passes. Could be a year and could be never (which is unlikely)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it was, but people have been watching charlatans on youtube like trey's trades and buying into dumb shit. They downvote what they don't want to hear, same shit they do with GME.

But at least GME has potential to survive as a company. It's hella overvalued but not in danger of going bankrupt. AMC, however, is in deep shit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,yes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"After the first share dump they did in January I said fuck it and sold most of my stuff between 18-20. now holding puts. CEO out of principal should have forgone the bonus used it to pay debt or flat out paid it to the employees. Say they have 20,000 employees, $400 may not seem like alot but to the ones making minimum wage thats a weeks wages and would go a long fucking way for them."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if GME issued 10m shares right now to build a stronger balance sheet that would be fine, not an enormous dilution.

AMC wants to take a pair of scissors and cut your shares in half so they don’t go bankrupt. Big difference"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Roll over to GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC execs have taken huge comp packages during this period, yet their company has more short term debt than liquidity.

GME’s not fucking over the SHs for exec comp and are not underwater"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know they already did screw retail right?? AMC and Silver Lake sold 230M shares in the frenzy in January and retail gobbled it up because they don’t read company filings.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's in the best long term interest of the company. how will they pay their 5 billion in debt without issuing shares? their pre-covid revenue cannot even pay the interest. This is all in the Q4 report, go read it if you don't believe me."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you might be having a naughty thought called an ""exit strategy.""  

Reopening is going to take time to fully ramp up revenues, the company has tons of debt and back rent owed, and more and more shares diluting the value.  I'm no expert, but a company doesn't just seek approval to issue 500 million more shares because they don't want to issue them.  Sure, they may not all flood the market on May 4th or June 4th by the time they do the paperwork, but they will be released at some point.  

I'm not telling you to do it, but I've broken up with AMC and am riding dirty with GME... and a bunch of terrible options plays thanks to my brethren apes of WSB."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,sell on monday and use it to buy puts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Principles? This might not be the place for you my friend.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking advantage of you?  You don't give a fuck about AMC...you wanted to get paid.  Get real, man.  Business is business."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Since the start gme > amc
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always has been GME. AMC support is mostly schizo Q larps at this point, getting the pied piper treatment from certain YouTubers for tHe CaUsE."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, moved my shares from AMC to GME. Still pulled out with a profit too (avg at $8)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’re doing what they need to, to stay out of bankruptcy. If they have to file their stock will hit zero eventually anyway

Plus they might actually put the money into getting a strong reopening...if they use it to market right at the right time it could definitely pay for itself by further fixing their terrible balance sheet"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Really? You think GME isn't prepping to cop a squat and shit on the face of you fuckwits? Its likely going to issue new shares to pay the fees for exiting its leases early and build an ecommerce logistics chain. You think that won't tank the price and then leave a gaping hole in cultist portfolios that doesn't get filled until 2025 when the logistics chain investments finally start earning some real profits?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, AMC was just conducting business. Why wouldn't you raise capitol because someone likes the stock? That is the whole purpose. However, if Cohen did that with GME, his house would be torched and his family threatened."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Those additional shares are gonna absolutely fuck anyone in for short term gains. The shorts can cover easily and the dilution is significant. It's not shorted like gamestop is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least with Wanda at the helm, there was some organized equityholder that could exert restraint on actions like this. Now with no organzized controlling interest at the helm AMC can do basically whatever the fuck they want. they don't need shareholder approval, they are just politely asking if shareholders would like to buy their debt before forcing it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. And the pops with AMC were prolly because the same funds short GME were liquidating some of their AMC shorts at the same time. AMC is fucking their shareholders and has demonstrated in no way how they are going to turn it around coming out of the pandemic.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That dilution allowed them to shed their major shareholder who owned controlling interest. They don't have controlling ownership now...

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro issuing new shares is the best thing for the company. Wdym.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If it got close to my buy in I would have done the same ;(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this when GME got tanked to 180 in like 5 minutes, that shit wasn't done because everything is fine in hedgieland. Was able to get out of AMC at 11.75 and put more into GME at 170."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,same I did it last friday. I felt like I was betraying my amc apes but an apes gotta do what an ape does. or whatever.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock prices trade on future values. It doesn't have to be implemented to have a dent. Just the expectation of the dilution is enough.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will probably pass as its best for the company to have that card in their pocket for capital if they need money to help with their debt again in the future. 

Bad for short term investors. Okay/better for long term investors."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if it doesn't pass how will they pay off their 5 Billion debt? their pre-covid revenue can't even pay the interest, look at the Q4 report, they say as much literally in the report lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There will not need to be an additional vote.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't it concern you that it's being put up to vote to begin with?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sort of, if the company is in such dire straights and is either this or bankruptcy. Then you would want this to save your investment. 50% is better then nothing.

However, what you really want is a good company that generates cash flow from operations and RETURNS that to shareholders in the form of increased value, share BUYBACKS or dividends. This is done through a great product and great management. 

AMC is not in the start phase where they need cash to invest and scale from investors. They are getting cash from investors to cover their poor management and declining market. 

This is absolutely taking advantage of a situation and is a smart play by the executive team but make no mistake, this is not good for shareholders short or long."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,True. Might sell and wait for a nice buying opportunity
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope it doesn't tank on monday.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at a 2 year chart. Pretty obvious where it should be post covid. Besides AMC is making sure there is no short squeeze...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way the action is moving right now, I think it will be cheaper in the pre-market on Monday. This hold up at $9.25 is fake.....shorts are scared to drive it under $9"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here.  I already voted no
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mhhh, i own shares too but didn’t get any e-mail so far. Does the broker i use matter? I’m with Degiro and in europe."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you buy GME at 190 and it drops to 40 again you are more fucked. Just saying.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was in deep based on that debunking and the belief the CEO publicly wanted to punish shorts.

Now the CEO is publicly advocating for dilution."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The CEO was literally on CNBC this morning selling the dilution vote. It’s what triggered the decline this morning. They absolutely will dilute this year. They even have another motion to increase the shares available for equity plans. So it makes perfect sense, dilute the shares, need to increase the shares available to not give anyone pay cuts."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the opposite AMC paid off a ton of debt and the movie experience isn't something that is just going to go away especially in a sector that is so consolidated nowadays.

Once the Pandemic is over expect AMC to shoot back up but GME's value is largely dependent on the valiant efforts of WSB."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're truly an Ape or a just an amoeba. Good luck with your purpose.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"people are really weak minded, the first sign of shit comming, they run behind their mom's skirt.

We could go to the moon anytime we want, literally. But at the first sign of profit they paper hand, multiply that by thousands of ppl and the stock tanks like AMC did today.The bears love it.

Edited: Typo i guess? /s. Thanks for the hint Daviroth."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A moment of silencer for our mislead apes in amc and those mortgage companies 🪦
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been saying that for a month lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"serious question, how do I roll over to GME? I have some AMC that's just fizzling away. I'd like to not have to sell it and take a hit on taxes, is there a way? I'm newer to this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Liked amc for avoiding bk.  But now two times more in gme.  I am prone to over divercation  so having more pain with bb.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly - it’s already game over. Anyone with a brain sold a few weeks ago when it was $14 if they were bagholding
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is true. You guys are still getting fucked because of it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,NO! Let's just force the company into bankruptcy! Then our shares will be worth a ton!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might be, but short term investors have kept the stock from tanking. Seems there should be a better option to raise capital"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure the FUD bots have taken over this thread. Why the hell do GME holders care what AMC does? They don't. It's fake news. AMC is doing what they think is in the best interest of SHAREHOLDERS! CEO is a MAJOR shareholder. So weird the ""hate"" on AMC."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn't make it good for the shareholders though.  Anyone who is still in is bagholder
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have the actual math on their debt? Looking at 2018/2019 it looks like their gross income is \~1.3B. Their net income is all over the board. +111M to -490M to +110M to -149M the last 4 years pre covid. An article said that they now have 1B in cash on hand.

I was looking through some numbers as an amateur investor and thought with the first round of raising money they would avoid bankruptcy long enough to open theater. I also assumed a massive 2021 and 2022 with the backlog of movies. I also assumed that with the poor reception of WW84 that all the major movies would still go through the theater. 

With this said, I made some decent money on AMC but sold once it hit $11 as that was much higher than I thought it would be in a rational market in a year. I was looking to get back into it but giving the company the ability to double their shares isn't something I want any part of."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc seems to follow gme around like a lost puppy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like this? 

AMC CEO Pay Rose to $21 Million in 2020 as Covid Ravaged Cinemas 

https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-05/amc-ceo-pay-rose-to-21-million-in-2020-as-covid-ravaged-cinemas

Or did you mean this?

Struggling AMC is giving its CEO a $3.75 million bonus, and paying $8.3 million bonuses in total, for 'extraordinary efforts' during the pandemic

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.com/amc-ceo-adam-aron-pay-bonus-compensation-pandemic-cinema-movie-2021-3%3famp

Edit.

I have no idea how many people they have with full hours but lest just take a random number like 1000. So if they would divide that extra 8.7million between whole staff and not just give it to one, everyone would have extra 8.7k salary.

 I'll bet that there is people who actually needs it to pay bills and get some food. You can do math if they have 10k workers. That wouldn't be so bad, but when whole company is struggling to stay alive and some monkeys decides to gamble and invest in to it and they use that money to pay extra to CEO.. That's not cool. In every culture that's a dick move."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Movies take two to four years to produce, there were a lot of movies in the pipeline, those are mostly finishing. They will have about a year of about 1/2 of the amount of big budget movies they normally had. And then I don't think they're ever going to get a lot of big budget movies back.

No one is green lighting new big budget movies. Big budget movies are what pay the bills. And there is going to be at least a two year Gap with very few big bunch of movies.

You have to have a product to advertise. And by and large movie theaters do not advertise, the movies themselves are advertised. You can't tell people to go to the theaters by telling them you have a nice theater with no movies. You tell people to go to the theater because there's a movie they want to see.

AMC broke even or lost money in 2019 with the greatest money making lineup you could hope for. There will never be a lineup like that again. No one is going to have the confidence that a 300 million Blockbuster is going to make its budget back, and that will be a self-fulfilling prophecy. Because the movies won't be made, there won't be any big budget profitable movies, and so they won't make any. It takes a long time to build up back to those big budget profitable movies."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is completely untrue. They are paying themselves with AMC investor money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's great for people that have AMC puts though!

Now if only my AMC puts could print enough to offset the losses from my GME puts...."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Was paying themselves off with our money the best thing for the company? You got fleeced
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why wait on that? There is no rule you have to win every trade. You should only hold if you would also buy at that prize given that you have the money. Keeping a losing stock until you have made a profit is not a great way to success, especially not when there's basically a free money machine on the other side..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch AMC get bought out though... I'll hate myself until gme shares hit before the 16th
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy gets it. Its about perception first, by the time the company actually dilutes it will be too late.

GME's price keeps popping back up because people believe Cohen won't fuck them by diluting the shares. That is not the same with AMC. They are not GME, they are a boomer ass company with boomer ass executives who will fuck over retail investors at the drop of a hat."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All these naive people especially OP not understanding that just the mention of this is going to scare off any buyers and the stock can easily go back to 5
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tiz the problem now.  Amc was critised for not duluting earlier.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh...I don't know.   
How about by not giving executives millions in bonuses. How many millions did CEO get? Did he deserve any of that bonus? Hell no....considering the problems AMC has."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold everything this month at 14.01 bought in sub 9. Even a retard has a nice entrance and exit every once n a while company is trash.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you really like the stock, just buy 100 shares, then sell covered calls. There is no chance that the stock is going to rocket up with the huge sell pressure that will happen with this stock issuing. She might as well make money selling otm calls to offset the inevitable downward stock movement. The stack stays even or loses a little bit or gains a little bit, you make money every week or two"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep me too.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's not the point. it's the same as if amc drops from 12 to like 2.50. The point is gme actually has the support at 170+. Fundamentals are picking up quick and the future looks very bright. This makes it very difficult for the shorters to stay short. meanwhile you have the amc board that WANTS to straight up double the float so they can have more juicy millions in bonuses. if the float doubles the squeeze is impossible. the point is AMC isn't ""cheap"". if you buy a share at 10 and it goes to 20 (+100%) you make 10$. If you buy gme at 190 and it goes to 200 (+5%) you make 10$. yes obv you can buy way more amc at 10 but personally i dont think amc will ever go to 20. but it's your money and your choice. do what you want."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you I actually saw this in another comment you posted and read it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,how can it go to the moon? it's 10% shorted. 300 million shares were already added this year. AMC has 9% insider ownership and 10% institution ownership. the other 80% is all retail investors. most of the buying and selling of AMC is just retail exchanging with each other.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB boosting any stock they want is the literal definition of market manipulation though lmao.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t buy in at 250$ and sell for 40$ oook ooook okaokoooook
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can anyone write a shanty about the time men sold their AMC shares and bought GME shares and sailed it all the way to the moon ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"take your losses and buy gme is what it means, don't hold on to your losing trade for too long if you already have the idea to sell it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,there's no other way. they already got convertible notes which is why they're in 5 billion in debt anyway - read the Q4 earnings report. they pretty much outline all of this. They would've gone bankrupt like Alamo without retail helpin' them out. In the super longterm you might recoup your investment if you just hold even if they dilute tho
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense, but the interests of short term investors doesn't really matter. Even the government distinguishes between long & short term investors, clearly favoring the long term. And that's fine because in general, short term investors don't add much value to our economy, so why would (or should) a business give priority to short-term investors? 

If you were only in AMC for a short term play or to help prop it up for awhile, why are you still in?  If you got in while AMC was down, you're still up. If you bought it above $11, then that's your fault for getting in at a bad time. 

You mention in a previous comment that you might get out based on principle. So I ask you again, why are you in? If the prospect of a company raising capital offends you so much, perhaps the stock market is not the right place for you.

Not trying to be discouraging, just trying to point out some of the flawed logic that is common on this sub."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The short term investors who kept the stock from tanking were looking for short term gains and expect the company to give a shit about them. 

The short term investors don't give a fuck about long term or they wouldn't be bothered by the dilution. 

Better options or other options? This is one of the better options which gives them a chance to get their shit together."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"A better way which would be what exactly? The only way they make money is to be open showing movies. The majority of theaters still are and have been closed. They barely make anything from the box office sales and cheap fucks that go to movies bitch about the price of popcorn.

I'm not crazy about the dilution myself but it'll make it so I can average down more if they do. This has now become a longer play and that's just what happens st times."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re basically right. Their precovid (Q4 2020 and Q3) net income was negative. They will never pay off their debt. You have to go back pretty far for them to have a solid net income, and like you’ve said even if they did have income that’s just the interest (85M a quarter). 

Buying AMC at the current price is literally retarded"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seemed like GME tried kicking it out of the airlock today for a couple hours.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They want to be GME but don't seem to have the same direction and vision in leadership, at least from the outside. Cohen on the other hand is putting heavy hitters that are proven at every position in the company and investing in the long term."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's like the upper management at the company that laid me off last year. Giving themselves raises for working through a pandemic as they cut hours and eventually shut down the company entirely, the owner going into bankruptcy after pocketing $3m in PPP."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, when you're closing theaters and giving the CEO more pay and giving out bonuses, after mentioning that you will barely survive the year and have to sell stock to ensure that you see 2021. Really leaves a bad taste in your mouth for AMC."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going off their balance sheet. The first dilution was a conversion of debt, so it actually helped them out financially

Figured it would be used to cover debt obligations... cause deleveraging could be a good survival move for them. 

but I didn’t know about the raised pay. You have a point on that"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish AMC has the same management as GME, I hate Adam Aron, he did nothing for the whole year, and getting big bonus, I strongly believe he is on the hedgies side, I still holding 6098 shares of AMC, I will sell them and get more GME."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do they pay back their 5B debt without issuing shares? Lmfao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How does the money you spent on shares of stock go into the pocket of the CEO?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t own AMC, nor would I ever own AMC at this insane price. What the CEO Paid himself is a grain of sand in comparison to the capital raised to keep the company afloat. Don’t respond until you have basic understanding of capital markets."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I do think gme will be bigger sooner, amc might be solid I thought. Idk not in this market for to long since I usually didn't have flushable income, I would rather add more to gme, than convert amc"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I started implementing this today. By by UWMC. By by CODX.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks moon without you all day every day.  A small chance that you miss one opportunity is not a reason to keep bag holding a melting stock.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao who will buy amc? 7 billion total debt.a company being bought doesn’t mean you will get anything.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are GameStop screwing over the people who are trying to put you out of business as long as you have cash flow from sales might be more important than issuing more shares. I don't know what price you would even issue them at. I'm sure you could probably also make an argument that you could raise a lot of capital at an inflated price based on the current share price because the people buying from you would be the people covering.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean the CEOs of AMC gave themselves nice bonuses for doing Dick all year.

And losing tons of money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. I have been feeling like I might have made a mistake getting out of AMC for GME.

You guys are making me realize that I probably made a good choice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't say GME never issue shares, there in such a strong position that say on $200 a share 5-10m shares issued is 1-2b capital raised which bodes well for future growth and not really stopping a short squeeze. They don't need too but i am not sure it's a bad idea at all."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did dilute earlier, had less than 100M shares late last year and are up to just under 500M today

Check out this chart:

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that'd keep the company solvent for all of a day more. Do you understand how much higher the order of magnitude 5 billion is from a few million?

I agree he didn't necessarily deserve a raise but that isn't what's fucking their bottom line."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"sure, but even if they didn't give anyone bonuses they couldn't have paid off $5B in debt."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,These motherfuckers are just bleeding the shareholders. Just like hertz trying to offer shares to pay their bond holders. It's sad.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Arb the cap structure short the stock long the bonds trading at 39 cents on the dollar. The best part is you are front running the poor over worked bankers
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If they want more shares then what about a stock split to give us more shares that way too?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously just in to squeeze shorts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"no offense but youre talking about a billion shares being issued.  How is that good for short or long term investments?   The market cap is currently 4.6 billion with 450M shares outstanding.  Even if the market cap doubles (HUGE IF) then it would still only be worth $9 if they issue 500M shares.

I dont see a short or long term play here

not financial advice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought my math let them get to the other side but wanting to double their shares tells you they are screwed. I want to think the ceo even came on cnbc and said they were fine.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If they were smart they'd try and push for paid streams of box office movies to peoples homes. This feels like Blockbuster all over again.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not just the management but comparing GME and AMC as a companies AMC was doomed even before covid. GME had a chance for survival and they are using it at the moment.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They have enough money to give the CEO an almost 9m $ bonus so this is just even worse if they still aren't paying the debt instead.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a delicate balance way above our pay grades. I'm glad the GME CFO was replaced. Tesla pulled it off and it was a blip for the stock price. It depends on many conditions and most importantly on whether investors see that management have the investor's best interest in mind.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The few million is meaningless as far as their debt is concerned, but it definitely shows how fucked their priorities are."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not about the money. It's about the message. You don't go feasting on lobster when everyone around you is starving. Especially when you're the fishing captain.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not the point, the exec team is trash and they obviously don’t give a fuck

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not the point.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the basis of why I believe the vote WILL pass and they WILL dilute. But hey thats just my retarded opinion. 

And this 100% gives me confirmation bias on my views."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So retarded lmfao. 

Options sold by hedge funds would be covered by buying shares - no squeeze will happen. When gme squeezed it had 140% short interest. AMC has 10%"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hertz is pretty much bankrupt. I don't think you understand why dilution is done. It is dilute or die. In bankruptcy shareholder usually get nothing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They need money. A split just gives us more shares not them money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"A split does basically nothing but make options more cost friendly, especially since most broker apps let you buy fractional shares. This can be bullish or bearish depending on the sentiment, but nobody loses or gains money when 1x $10 stock becomes 10x $1 stocks.  Any losses or gains would be from the way investers see a split with regards to the company's future"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhh nobody tell him
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I picture OP walking around wallstreet, grabbing & squeezing people's pants. 

Meanwhile, fellow apes look on, shaking our heads and think ""Man, I know I'm not supposed to be here, but this guy!.. He's really lost!"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the companies perspective doubling the shares is just more money to pay off their debt and get back to their pre Covid state.

The company is fine because the vote will definitely pass. They don’t even need the vote, they can issue 80MM shares now. The vote is just to increase the limit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,imagine holding shares of a company that paid a 9m bonus to their ceo with 5b debt and then crying about that company raising capital their only way possible.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This ^^^^^
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So what? How can they pay off their debt without issuing shares?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Your welcome for the knowledge. Myself, among many others, don’t like to see people misled. I would rather money stay in your pocket than some mega fund. 
Just please, check yourself for confirmation bias. There’s a lot of horrible DD in here designed to keep you optimistic, and buying shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good shit ape, this is the way"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think it's a fucked up priority to pay your ceo that  keeps your company going during the pandemic when you basically aren't making any money. Sure as an investor I'd prefer to see something different from them but I can't say there's much they can do.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They're captaining a sinking ship and getting paid for that career risk and keeping things afloat while their industry is drowning. Who would do that job for LESS than what they were getting when it was easier?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I feel this is a bullshit analogy considering moves the board made kept the company alive in some capacity during a time when they couldn't generate anything near their normal flow.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock is trading higher because of the squeeze sentiment. So it doesn't actually tell us much.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you not understand a Gamma squeeze. It’s when so many options are purchased otm. MM decide not to purchase the shares because they are that far out of money. When the stock nears itm, it starts a chain reaction of shares being purchased, driving the price up quickly and causing more calls to be itm. Now the shorts would help to increase this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,businesses typically sell shit to their customers to make profits... rather than ask their shareholders for free money @ 0% interest and providing no collateral.   You might be right they have no choice. But the fact the CEO made 9m in 2019 and 20M in 2020 tells me they are shady af.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Difference between issuing to raise capital for expansion investments and raising capital to pay interest payments....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The ceo was on squawk today talking about buying back bonds. There is an asymmetrical volatility play across the AMC capital structure
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But they own shares in the company so gives them more shares too so some could be sold on their end without messing over investors
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro...it is ""you're"".

You are arguing with someone who is criticizing AMC...are you fucking retarded? Go argue with people that are saying AMC is going to moon.

I bought AMC at $2.50 and have been selling CC's because I dont think they will go up much more unless there is some crazy good news.

Diluting the shares is not something I would call great news."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep feeding the pigfucker then. Glad I got out at $14.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol...a CEO risking their career. Cry me a river. 
The only profession where you can totally screw up and still get million $ bonuses.  Boohooo... 
Pretty sure there will be a line of much better people willing to take that job for much less. But you think CEO leeches give up their seats? lol, got a bridge to sell you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Nothing about the company has changed, it was going down before covid due to bad management and a shift in the entertainment market towards streaming at home. 

Where is the bull thesis? That it’s heavily shorted? Wow it’s fucken nothing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like the comment where you called us WallStreetBet donkeys? Again, how much is Citadel paying you per comment?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, decided to sell on a saturday, dropped like a rock monday morning and I held off. Dumped it for a loss at 9.99 this morning."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Except a gamma squeeze can only happen when the stock itself has worth. In the case of GME the stock itself was shorted despite being undervalued. Not to mention a gamma squeeze requires both a high option interest and a large disjunction towards calls. This is not the case for amc - go look at the chain yourself. Lmfao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would AMC even offer shares if not to raise capital? Of course they're going to take a lifeline of just 10% of their debt so they can actually make it through reopening and a return to normalcy.  More debt makes them even riskier and less valuable.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You think AMC is expanding investments?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I heard about that - apparently he’s prepared to issue shares and has something negotiated to buy back most of the bonds they’ve issued at a discount
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A split directly lowers the value of each chair accordingly.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This hurts my head
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I were you I'd focus on selling your AMC bags instead of bridges.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're a donkey. They're gonna dilute their shares. Vote no.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but does it make the shorts now owe more shares having to dip in the market to buy more or does that number stay the same as before is the question.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m retarded but I know that already.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying at the bottom.  Wish I was smart enough to do this.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you all the way 

- April 6 dividend Reinvestment 
- May 5th ER (blow out quarter)
- May 7 Russell preliminarys 
-  5.1% dividend 

🚀🚀"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone is skeptical about the stock because it has been underperforming but wait until their earnings report comes out.... 😄😄
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some pain

https://i.imgur.com/Dt1q17p.jpg"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought in. 3900 shares at 7.75 avg. Let hope i caught it at the bottom!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dibs on his wife
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thesis: 

•Good May 2021 EPS and upcoming earnings
•Summer months, alot of people looking to buy homes
•Still the lowest intrest rate even if it creeps up a little
•senior notes bought by institutional investors in a day(correct me if im wrong)

There is still value in this stock but hey, i may be wrong but below 8 dollars is seriously undervalued. i see this stock is at least 12-15 bucks at least. at the end of the year.

these are my thoughts not a financial advice. i wipe ass for a living.

thank you.😀"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,People seem to love this stock but it doesn't do shit but drop.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just want to thank everyone for buying my covered calls. Ironically you are paying my mortgage.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope this works out. This thing just never moves though and bounces from 7-9
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC 5/21 9c’s are killing me, but I think I’m going to hang on. I think I need to decide soon if I want to roll them."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Love that average cost
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,40 shares @ $8.08 and definitely adding more. Your thesis echoes a lot of my thoughts on it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm down 10% right now but I still have faith long-term
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL you sold your CLF already? That thing is going to go insane on the 22nd when earnings come out!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My shares wish you had bought shares instead of calls...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u r fuk
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc is a dead dogggggggg...betting onnhousing right now when its at its peak is not good idea.....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"RIP, this stock is not going to reverse, wouldn't be shocked if this drops down to $4-$5 in the coming months."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thought about doubling down to lower my average, but it'd only be by a few cents. Still holding, but definitely waiting on buying more right now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I just bought these same calls... gonna have to sell and inverse
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you literally make decisions right after a jerk off session of Mad Money? RKT is the obvious buy, but FUD gets everyone. Good luck you autistic fuck."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy at the top and and watch it plummet is my strategy!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Right!!! Can’t forget about the fact that $UWMC will be included in the Russell index!! I’m buying more on Monday! Thx
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$500 just added 🚀🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When is that happening?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"hold with patience, young son."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[https://imgur.com/o16AD40](https://imgur.com/o16AD40) here's where I'm at.... Think I should hold or close? I'm fuckin stressing out haha.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Start picking out your lambo bro 🚀🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😭😭😭
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait until earnings
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop didn’t move for months until it did.  UWMC was over 11 in February, not that long ago. I like the stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding 100 plus, but damn, this bitch needs to go up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Right! sold clf right when its a confirmed good buy......suspect......
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,OP coming out with the premature sale is probably why his wife found herself a boyfriend.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How on Earth is housing at its peak when the market is short on homes because no one is selling and other people aren't buying because of ridiculous pricing? Peak? Lol good luck timing a peak in a situation like this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Realtors keep sending me letters begging to buy my house as my county has no inventory 🤣 people going to be moving for years to come as urban areas fall into bigger 3rd world shitholes as dems legalize heroin and meth and stop prosecuting crime unless it’s committed by white supremacist only😂😂mortgages = free 💰💰🦍💪
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote for being half right.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This would be like 8-10% dividend.  Won’t happen.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why?

There's no basis for that kind of price movement at this time."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,obvious buy 1 day after sells $1.8 million of his shares lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Will it?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is estimated to announce earnings between Apr 23, 2021 and Apr 26, 2021"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe roll those into May?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such a short time horizon for those to print, your stress is warranted. I don't think your going to be in the money in two weeks. What to do the choice is yours. 

I was eyeing up CSP at strike $7.50 today."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold it’ll rise
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely hope everyone does well, I'll be watching."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know i should have hold it til the earnings im still happy of what i earned. dont worry, if i find a good buying opportunity i will get in. CLF has been a roller coaster for me for the past month still a great stock i am thankful for the r/vitards whom gave me the knowledge of rising commodities."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,At its peak! Look at rocket morgage data...refinance and new loans through the roof..same with this stock data....its why rocket hasnt rocketed...nobody is guessing 6 months from now it will be more successful than it is now...the gains u see now are for the 6 months were in....the stock market always takes gains months ahead...same reason when earnings comes out and its good earning goes down....cause we all took that profit already the week before before the earning call...ie i sold my rocket contracts and stock when it was at 43....so that was huge gains sucked out.....so yea housing at its PEAK compared to the next year.....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is in a free fall again.  That’s what you get when you do an offering just 3 months in. Cash problems are real.
I really don't understand how any of you see this as a value stock.  This is a failed company with a leader who can't shut his mouth.  When he does, he makes bad tweets in the middle the night, he bullies brokers into signing, and does an offering...all the first 3mo's being public. This is a disaster that will end under $5."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool numbers, I'm assuming you also know 1.8m ain't much with 1.5b + outstanding. But.... i like waffles, so wtf do I know. Get your tendies bruh."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes! $UWMC exclusion was only due to being consider by Russell to be Q1 IPO, and has to be in the following quarter for inclusion"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you brudah
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CLF and X will give you ulcers. LoL I went on an MT call buying spree today with some of my CLF gains.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I get it man. If I had those tendies I would have definitely shaved a bunch. But just closing the whole position seems a bit irrational. Hopefully you'll catch some red days to come in before.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,didnt know you were on reddit doug
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,apparently you know something the insiders do not.  They sold off at $24
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm happy to be wrong, good luck homie. I just bought RKT so tf do I know."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. You too.  I hope we both win.  Sorry this bag holding got me bitter today.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME taught me everything I know. This changed everything, find your proof of leverage and never sell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long here with shares and calls at 35 4/16, looking a little squeezy today"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Delta on the Options are climbing.

It is getting close to a tipping point.

Delta on the April 30 calls was .26 yesterday .40 today.   

&#x200B;

I can buy 200 calls and see the MMs cover by buying more shares and push the price up.   

&#x200B;

It wants to squeeze so bad.  Just needs APE support."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We’re definitely in overbought territory across all timeframes right now so we might see a dip back under $28 or even $27 at some point in the next day or so. If shorts are waiting for a better opportunity to cover, that opportunity could come off a dip. 

ASO should be trading above $30 based on the fundamentals so anyone that shorted this under $28 will be SOL if they don’t start covering soon."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I really like the stock!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's mooooning 🚀 🚀 🚀 🌕🌕🌕 not too late lads
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My ASO calls rallied 500% from the low of yesterday’s open. What a fucking roller coaster
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Love this.  Great work.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Better DD than me 👏👏
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"love the company - even before record earnings they're coming off 6% ROA and 30% ROE, massively profitable even if pretty highly levered (but more than half of their LTD is just capitalized leases so who gaf?). i'd like to think the MM's start to cover if the price stays hovering close to $30, which might trigger some stop losses on the shorts who make up almost 50% of float"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought one lotto ticket for 4/16.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I really like the stock!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You ape, I'm in"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am in on this, went in today. Now we ignore this for a bit and go bake a cake!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in...as of 3/15 SI was 39%
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it, but we should also just have 1 guy in wsb with an S3 subscription just post the data for whatever we need"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it not be safe to buy $30c NOW at $28.30-50 to hold over the 3 day weekend into 4/16 ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Saw your DD while sitting in line, waiting on my vaccine shot. Thanks! I need some profitable moves with so much of my money tied up in other spots!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the wave.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down with it. Always liked the store, miss it since I moved north. 10 30c 4/16 and 1 25c 4/16"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Would y’all recommend april or may calls?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You son of a bitch, I’m in"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dicks blows. If you are into outdoor stuff it’s easy to see the difference between ASO and Dicks. Dicks is a wannabe city slickers store. Mine even has a huge golf section. Huge mark up on crap.  You don’t go to there for real outdoors stuff
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I have been seeing this a lot before.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it, just grabbed 100 shares. Will consider more Monday."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,WE LIKE THE STOCK
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"With this weeks volume that short interest may be half. Some may have even switched to the other side of the trade. My software has a switch teams button :) ... However, it should rally on quite naturally with that RSI strength on the WEEKLY sustained for months. Best of luck!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR high short interest and they sell guns in texas

eh"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like too late to get in imo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you look up GME short interest for us bro?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 3 Days
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sold calls, I didn't want them to attack it AHs   we will start the fight again on Monday."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Up 20% on calls already.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every short was sub $28, that was the ath prior to today (about 2.5 weeks ago) and it had ~30-35% si at that time. Every short except intraday scalpers is currently SOL."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets, 🚀 🚀 🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yours was still good!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Saw yours which inspired me to take a closer look!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, I bought more today so I’m with you on it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,got some 30c 4/16 at .90 hope that was the bottom
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,looks they are crashing wait and try the bottom?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,More fuel 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The main play is the catalyst of the earnings leading to a gamma squeeze due to the high OI on 4/16 calls. Short interest is just more fuel for the rocket.

4/16 30C is \~0.90 as I write this so the play itself is also cheapish."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy some calls and he might.

Good luck bro"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still using Margin?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's all you need to do brother. Get ready to buy a space suit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me look at my retard checklist:

* Average cost basis 201.65... Check
* Margin Account.... Check"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, that US number notation always fucks with me, thought you had half a million shares for under 100k usd"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"eh, that doesn't mean he's on margin, just that the transaction got journaled to margin. he could still have 100% margin equity.

this just makes it available.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo could someone actually tell me what’s going on with sherwin Williams? Not seen a single thing abt it they are down 67 percent
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Little nooner-mooner helping the cause right now ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,if you use margin and incur unrealized losses do you have to pay those losses?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride it !!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We need greater beta or volatility.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice trips
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hell yes, $6,000 loss! Love it bro! Keep it up GME cult!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't tell if this position is leveraged or not, just that it was established in a margin account. Fidelity requires a margin account for higher level options trading. 

If all positions are 100% margin equity (no borrowed money) than it's pretty much like a cash account, but without the restrictive rules of a cash account."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then I think... maybe... Potentially... Perhaps... 

You're a fucking retard"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,stock split

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good to know, thanks! I have not yet enabled options in my Fidelity acct so I wasn't aware of the nuance.

Been on this ride a while and newcomers getting burned during fire sales while on margin is an all too regular event.."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Not even a financial crisis would crash SHW 67% in a day
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"so if you get margin called and are down $50,000, do you have to deposit $50k?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you see them down 67%? Seems like it’s been hovering 240-250 for the past year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You pay back what you borrowed plus interest. So if you spend 30k in margin, win or lose, you owe 30k+ interest."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,3:1 stock split. It was at 700+
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"so the max you would pay would just be how much you borrowed plus interest right? So if you borrowed $30k and the losses are $50k, you’d just owe the $30k?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ironic how haupt goes straight to the top after all the ape gang was banned
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Watched the entire thing before checking to see who posted it.  The quality...  I knew it had to be Haupt91.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#Fuck you and I’ll see you when my ban is up!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,RICKY RETARDO that's the most amazing thing I've heard today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,God dam. Another haupt classic.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The legend makes another gem!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bunch of degenerates picking on other degenerates for trying to out degenerate each other in a faked degenerate competition put forth by a bunch of degenerates. 

Bravo for raising the bar."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao.

God, these fuckin things get better & better, I watch them all the way through & laugh everytime.

Fuck me, watching these is the best part of being in this sub"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have lived long enough on wsb to see master memer haupt91 refer to me indirectly. I must be doing something right.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"😂😂😂😂😂😂😭

“Who sets up a trading competition with ppl who only buy one stock” 😂😂😂😭"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,take the award. This and the other one had me laughing so hard people around me thought i was senile. even if i do get banned.. hahahahahah

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well now that you put it that way I feel... I feel kinda foolish that I bought into this whole paper trading charade.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The Legend returns
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always thought it was a bit too professional and competent for there to be a paper trading comp on WSB, but I dismissed it as me just never being active on the sub until January. I was always just an external lurker watching the Attar and Kamikaze Crash style videos on the 'best of' WSB. So I wouldn't have noticed if they'd ever had one before. 

Good thing I'm that bad at trading I didn't even bother signing up for the comp."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It feels refreshing to see one of your vids back on here sir. A beacon of light while in my row boat on a sea of retardation.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I was just messing dude
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Been holding a bag of dildos on this one.  500 @ 9.25.  I don't understand this stock at all and it infuriates me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dividend has nothing to do with the current low share price. It's trading ex-dividend currently. If you buy the stock today, you will not receive the dividend on April 6."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"7.77 seems like a good entry point, I’m in"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This stock has done nothing but eat 💩 since people first started talking about it!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm holding shares, sold CC @11 strike price, plus sold CSP @7.5 strike price. IMO this is the best way to play this stock. It won't be above 15 or below 7 any time soon, so I get the most out of it via option premiums and dividends.

By the way selling May 7.5 seems like a really good deal. Even if you get assigned, the cost basis will be below $7, which would mean 5.8% dividend yield."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your theory about the shorts keeping the share price low to get a bigger dividend because it’s free money makes no sense to me. First of all there is no such thing as free money. Second, if somebody is short a stock on the record date then they are not entitled to a dividend, they in fact are responsible for paying that dividend."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been keeping my eye on UWMC since I am bullish on them long term, but haven’t had the opportunities to jump in yet so figured now was a good entry so just loaded up on 6/18 $8 calls, 12/17 $10 calls, and added 325 shares at 7.77"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, not getting burned on this one again. Twice i jumped in on this and lost hundreds, im not touching this with a 10 foot stick. 
Good luck to you, I hope you make mass gains."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just had a limit order at 7.75$ fill, 20 more. Sitting around a 100 now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why uwmc sucks dick and is stinky:

Ticker name is awful doesn’t have a ring to it, now if it was $UwU it would b better

Dunno anything about the company, therefor it’s bad

Mortgage? More like Mortgay lmao

Price is low so it must suck, I only buy stonks after they’re already up 100% minimum this year

Only goes down apparently, I prefer stocks that only go up"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold UWMC. This is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in on this. I also have $14 calls for May. Not sure those are going to print now but hoping we get some movement in the right direction.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the biggest turd sandwich in the stock market
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep you are so right great long term investment.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where did you get your information that JP Morgan is buying the biggest %

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In the title
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The company sucks? Lmao what? They are absolutely swimming in profits that's why the CEO doesn't want to give up any of his stock
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If it was so bad then why did J.P. Morgan and other large banks buy up the note offering so fast

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me guess you saw gme in the news and bought it and now are losing money and think it’s the only stock to buy because you think the point of this sub is to take down the hedge funds 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey  John,  I was just looking into this and I know nothing.  The bid for a strike of 9 is .10 with exp 4/16  


I mean, 10 bucks is 10 bucks I guess.  But is that normal?  Is it a low bid because it is a low volume stock?  Is is worth sacrificing potential gains for 10 bucks per contract (in your opinion?  


what would you do with 200 shares at 8.56 of this specific stock?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I understand the fundamentals of the company. I don’t understand why the stock continuously drops day after day and trades below 8 dollars
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody understands anything here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yield increases, but it doesn't matter. The dividend is $0.10/share."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,trade that cake in for some
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Which ones aren’t dogshit rn? All I see is dogshit left and right.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hun. Dreds.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I'll send you a post card from the moon. I'll be there a lot sooner than a year. 

Hope you recouped all those losses from buying in high like you clearly did that got you butt hurt. Oh shit now I'm assuming..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is a much better long term investment at barely over $8.50 right now. No thx
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$8 and $9 puts for 6/18 are paying a premium of $125 and $195 respectively. UWMC, imo, will be over $9 by that time, def over $8. Worst case scenario, I get paid a premium to buy shares for a company I am long and bullish on. Win-win really."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t get them to pull up. Thank you though
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He can't anyway until august
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A note offering is very different then shares... look I posted a whole dd on why non gaap accounting irregularities make uwmc look great but its actually driving off a cliff... and I got called all sorts of vulgarities... so I'm not going get into that again...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not original commenter and have no issue with other stocks being discussed here, but every stock that is getting pushed here besides GME(..mostly talking about RKT, UWMC, PLTR) has turned into complete shit the last 2 months."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,More like made shit loads of money still making money . And if you trust the news you probably already sold hence why people are trying to get them back in the shit show other stocks they saw on the news. Nice try tho
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i can afford it, i would sell cash covered puts. selling 8p on 6/18 will get you a premium of $125. at worst you get assigned and have to buy 100 @ 8 which would at least average you down and you still get to keep premium. I have a feeling the stock will be over 8 at least by that date. selling calls could be fruitful but the premiums for selling calls suck ass rn. not worth getting assigned and having to sell 100 shares at 9 for only $10 and then watch it blast off. once the stock gains momentum, then you will see some nice premium prices for calls and you can fully cover at least 2 of them with 200 shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ironically, I own 100 shares at $8.98 and just yesterday I sold a 21MAY $11 call for $25. 

I'd happily sell my shares for $11 each right now but I also wouldn't mind holding the stock for a while and collecting that sweet dividend yield. 

I've been bag holding since it was GHIV. I think this will be a boring boomer stock. I don't think the price will fluctuate much and I don't see it appreciating incredibly either."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Low volume and high daily short volume keep the price low until it can get more volume
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">$0.10/share.

Just a note for people who can't do math, that's $0.10/share per quarter."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh that makes sense now, thanks. You’d think I would have leaned this in class since I’m going to school for finance but I guess I’m retarded"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually I bought in a week ago, but okay still can’t argue with facts. Good luck with gme bruv 😂"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What broker do you use?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s how it should be there shouldn’t be just one stock talked about here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure you did bud 😂but your dumb if you think any stock other than gme is a distraction. And if you rely on the news for selling and buying advice mind as well burn your money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is a no brainer to be invested in right now same with AMC. Anyone saying not to is because they are getting fucked in the millions and billions on the flip coin of that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I seee.  


I thought selling puts was the other way around. My strike price would be less than the current price, and if it falls to that then it gets assigned?  


While that put premium is attractive, I think I'd rather get rid of the stock than buy more of it at this point.  That's a great point about waiting for some momentum to get a better premium."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice.  That makes a lot of sense.  


That same call  fell to $15 today by the way, so nice job there.  I think I'm with you on this.  Thanks for the insight."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Phoenix or Trump University? You'd fail either.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean the easy cash yea for sure... Love to see this revisited in a year just to shit in your mouth 🤣😂🤣😂🤣😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m very new, and still learning. I’m using cashapp stocks. So far day trading I’ve only made 60$. Today’s my first day ever."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, GME shouldn't have a monopoly. I'm just saying the other popular stocks discussed here have utterly failed, like wtf lol. PnD's by whales to leave retail with the bag?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I say that? Nope. There is an obvious 5+ that have been completely related to GME AND AMC if you havnt caught on by now explains the shit talking. 
Don't get me wrong I hope people do score but figure out the other 4 + check the charts and realize the dick slapping you in the face."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither it’s in Indiana guess which one
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too I don’t think it will go well for you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Read about PDT. Only 3 day trades in 5 days if you're less than 25K. Dont fk urself over for 5 dollars
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that you only mention gme and amc shows me how long you’ve been in the stock market and this sub dude. I’m sorry but when did you first start a position in gme because my guess is in feb so I’m sure you don’t know what you are doing if that’s the only 2 stock you talk about or have anything positive to say. Saying shits a distraction is the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Frigging AMC won't stop diluting. I'm confident the company's gonna do alright, but if they're just going to embrace share dilution every time they can, where are my tendies gonna come from?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,IU?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"😂😂😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣😂🤣😂🤣🤣😂🤣🤣😂😂🤣🤣😂 
Oh man stick to video games partner your stock logic is fucked."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude.... I literally just found that out the hard way.... 😭😭😭😭 can you refer me to a good broker for new investors such as myself?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you are still talking. Oh yea and because I'm talking about the 2 most obvious easy payout decision in the market right now.... Fuck you are dumb. Keep talking though work is boring today and listening to you talk is very entertaining.... esp when you know my portfolio so well.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"ah all brokers will do this, i think it's a government rule not a choice. but it's not too hard to avoid - day trade loosely means trading the same security twice the same day. And the only ""penalty"" is that you won't be able to trade stocks so frequently if you are flagged as PDT. it's not like a monetary fine or anything"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Save the extra work and just cashapp me your money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not even shit talking 😂 and why is gme and amc the easiest payout in the market. List the fundamentals and driving factors that they are a easy payout when they are up on hype and sentiment rather than value like uwmc which is undervalued. So yeah I’ll take the one that isn’t up a 1000% based on hype and a short squeeze sorry I’m not retard I like being safe with my money. What’s your avg cost for gme then
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,80 dollars avg. Already got paid on your distraction stocks too. Do I really have to hold your hand explaining this shit I'm not your wife's boyfriend figure it out yourself. Again hope you do get paid too I just saw it for what it was and got out. If you follow this page at all you should know everything you need to know about AMC and GME along with the shit show media propaganda about the stocks.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I thought bud you can’t even say why your invested in it and I’ve been here way longer then you. I see you first post was 8 days ago about gme, post your position on gme then if you are so confident. Ever time you reply just proves my point 😂"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you post your positions here you are a moron so explains why I'm still talking to you and you keep running that mouth. I don't post shit here just comment. Could give a shit what you believe keep dumping all your money in shit stocks I don't care. 

Anything else you want to know and assume? Sorry you can't pay rent don't take it out on me"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your funny bro 😂, sounds like someone is lying about their shit if they are that scared to post their positions. It’s literally in the rules dipshit to post your positions when posting about a stock. Maybe go back and learn more about the sub and the rules so you don’t make a fool of yourself. And Don’t worry ab rent your wife said she would cover this month for me if I blew her back out"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Post your earnings sure posting current positions on volatile stock to help hegies.... You are a moron then. What are you like 18 over there or what man you just keep running that mouth looking like a dumbass all butt hurt cause someone said your stock might be shit. Oh poor baby get all that anger and frustration out... Or masterbate more good lord.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you say uwmc is shit shows me 1. You don’t know how to evaluate a company 2. You don’t have a clue about the stock market and what types of things affect price movement 3. Not everything gains a 100% 2020 was a special year and gme is a special situation that has already passed. News flash it not going to 100,000 10,000 or a 1000 a share. Sorry to break it to you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit do you guys read or just eat crayons? Did I say any of that???? NO!!! Fuck the retards here ........ I could care if you don't see the dick slapping your face or how to follow the money.  Good luck go ahead double down....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your slow, I said I could just tell because of how you talk and the things you say lead to you not knowing jack shit ab stocks and how to evaluate a company. It doesn’t take a genius to figure out how smart someone is by how they talk and communicate bud. And that’s the problem you are follow the crowd and not doing any of your own research or know how to which again for like the 5th proves my point. And why you getting so butt hurt over it calm down, you getting mad at a random person on the internet."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You love hearing yourself talk don't you. Funny how you were the shit talker and me constantly calling it out immediately now I'm the one butt hurt huh cause I got sick of the retarded assumptions and comments you had.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not shit talking dude it just facts you came here saying dumb shit like this is a distraction, like really are you that dumb to think this is a distraction or that it would distract anyone from gme like you seriously can’t be that dumb dude. And second you couldn’t tell me why your in gme and why it’s the easiest way to make money in the market rn. Like do you understand how stupid that sounds like for real. And third your saying uwmc is trash, but one it made 3 billion in profit last year, 2 it just went public, 3 it is way undervalued. I like to talk facts and not some vague shit “like your dumb If you aren’t in gme rn it the easiest way to make money I’m the market”"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sir just lost more then I could hope to win. My suggestion would be to take a step back, maybe volunteer at a soup kitchen and think about how you look at money. But hey that’s just my worthless opinion from the working class. Never the less I wish you the best and hope you get through this and come out on top!!

I’d slap you silly, but instead I’ll just say this.

You could hold for a miracle which MAY happen.
Which congrats! And fuck you!

Or you could sell but be unable to save your loss of massive destruction. It was a bad move putting that much on such a small thing.

Would have bought rental property and got 1,000 a month. Property is always valuable. Anyway, it’s up to you man.

You do you. I’m just a broke chad.

But I’m telling you man. You could play it either way.

Ended up losing 30% before i decided to yolo what i had left and eneded up making it back. i would honestly take the hit and move the call strike price into the money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just invest that 6k into mutual funds and you should be back to 81k in about 30 years

I’m not saying we will reach $500 next week but we should see a healthy jump.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope to tell those tales one day my friend.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That mindset appearing to be reasonable to someone is quite dependent on many factors. Particularly age, physically restrictive ailments, etc which can all greatly impede ones ability to earn investment capital through labor when necessary. Money may come and go when you have the capacity to recover but for many these things are a matter of life and death as well as the security or not of dying with some mild form of dignity. I agree you still have to remove yourself to some degree for sanity, but the length it is being extended to here is downplaying it's mental impact as far as necessary resource allocation goes for many people.

I get the impulse though but for me that's a few steps too far in the other direction to match the reality. But then again, I'm on a gambling subreddit so I understand the appeal of it to some degree haha. Going that far with it is just way more potentially destructive a risk than I'm willing to take. I'll ride a roller coaster but you won't catch me going off any jumps in a dirt bike haha."

I’ll just buy cheap beer and whiskey this month haha. Playing with profits from a similar play a week or so ago. Turned $100 into $1000 but that was a better strike price. I’ll be happy to exit @ $150-$300 and buy another share."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not just the amount of calls, if the influence that the guy have, in the moment that he decide to exercise the calls, millions of people is going to start to buy 😎"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a possibility but No body can know, but the point here is, once the 500 call are executed, that would trigger a snowball, people is fallowing his investment, they will buy, and them, nobody will be able to stop this"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need the full length motion picture, please."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this scene with original audio is too good for meme... didn't read any of the subs!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha nicely done
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It is even better than last years circuit breaker memes during the crash

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So if Robinhood didn’t restrict.. still doesn’t stop circuit breaker days. I had 100 shares of GME and literally shit myself those days. Robinhood is not to blame for any of this.. the circuit breakers can come at anytime and fuk you. Unless you got like barely any money in GME then diamond hands it is..

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you to all users for your participation in the third annual paper trading competition. It's a fun tradition. Out of 17,000 signups, only a few dozen users tried spoiling the surprise! Participants are only *temp banned* but folks who wanted to ruin tradition ended up getting a much, much longer ban than the participants.


Users who signed up for our competition: Don't bother deleting your comments, we logged all your names already. It may take a few hours, days, or weeks to ban them all, but the process is running!

Thanks, and Happy April!

edit: [next friday is hawaiian shirt day](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8p8Ni1sXBLk)"

4/5 stars, will probably participate again next year"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was all bummed out because I was banned for 2 weeks for mentioning a small cap and couldn’t participate. Back today and now I feel like the real winner here!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how you paid this old man to deliver the news. I forget what he said last time but it feels like he genuinely enjoys this. Last time I thought he was actually chainsaw delivering the news lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Awh man getting banned before Hawaiian shirt day is the worst moment of my life
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, I’ll gladly take the ban cuz I deserve it. I should’ve known WSB doesn’t paper trade lmao I waltzed right into this one

Edit: scrolling through there’s a lot of cry babies in here who are vewwy mad they got pwanked 😡 just bend over and take that banhammer on your candy ass 🍑"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wanted to sign up but was too lazy. Finally getting rewarded for that.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂 Never gets old!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My God, in hindsight the signs are all there and so obvious. I truly deserve this ban."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always a fierce competition, glad people keep signing up for these lmao."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you I sign up next year as well
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man I've had a shit day today. Never would've imagined getting banned here would be funny enough to save a crap day like this.

Thanks guys."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen. If I ever met this man in real life, the LAST name I would expect him to use on any social media platform is CHAINSAW VASECTOMY."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well shit.... I thought I might actually get to learn something. Maybe I really do belong* here. Obviously I'm completely fucking retarded.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I reported a guy who gave away the secret in one of the daily threads, hope they got banned as well."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So many new people to this sub this year oh god this is always hilarious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've been bamboozled
They've back stabbed
But most importantly they've been banned."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This fucking figures. Lost before I even knew it was starting. See you next year.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp, damn my crap memory. My dumbass forgot seeing last year's paper trading tomfoolery and signed up like an idiot to get some more options practice.

As soon as I saw the little old dude in the hat it all came back to me and I realized I done fucked up.

Well played, mods.

Getting flaired but then banned within the same 24 hours. WSB giveth, WSB taketh away."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,/u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY please be my grandpa.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck I remember the first year you got him to say subreddits and he went “su-sub ribbits?”
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do all the banned users get prison tats if/when they come back?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is fucking hilarious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank god. The sub might actually have some order now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this what you end up looking like when you trade weeklies for a month?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was close to signing up because you promised flairs on the GME megathread. But just the thought of losing fake money when i could lose real money instead dried me up so much that i didn't even look into the papertrading competition. Thank god i'm retarded lol. RIP paper gang. Also RIP my portfolio, but atleast it's real haha"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"🌈🐻 mods almost got me.  Almost.

Non-committal laziness comes through again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally opened a td Ameritrade account to paper trade options for this. Really just got fooled😔.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t I inverse WSB 🤡
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly the funniest part about this is the fact people are whining about this and that it's unfaaaaair, makes getting banned almost worth it to see those"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,**It's a temporary ban** btw
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,the salty comments are the best. every time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,**CULLING IS GOOD AND NECESSARY FOR CERTAIN SPECIES OF ANIMALS**

Edit: shit

Edit2: I’m banned now can mods unban I deleted Reddit and now have to go on a computer to use it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The funniest thing is going through the original post and seeing all the comments that are deleted 😹
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,At least I won something.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read it, but no specifics so tried to find anything related to previous years but couldn't. Commented anyway as figured nothing to lose. Goddammit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess it's back to lurking for me 😫
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO IM FUCKED
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m dead. I’ve been waiting for this shit since the GME blowup.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well shit. That's what I get for not paying attention to anything. I deserve to be banned like a bitch.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CONGRATS PAPER TRADERS 🤣👋
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this is a funny meme but it's also a good lesson about the sub.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking lost it when I read the comment from AdmiralAckbar; IT'S A CHALLENGE!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did no one read the post before signing up? The second paragraph literally had me rolling on the floor mentioning a few trading tactics
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ughh so I didn’t win this year? Guess I’ll have to sign up next year. Then the year after that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit is always exciting. 17k isn't that bad

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,where did you find this guy he is hilarious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I knew it was weird that there was literally nothing explaining the rules or how anything would be tracked. I also have been here a bit over a year so I should have known better. Bring on the ban-hammer, I can take it, all of it, nice and deep."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No Paper Trading - Paper trading is like jacking off, literally noone wants to hear you talk about it because that's pretty gay. If you dont have the balls to take the trade with real money then do us a favor and don't mention it."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be honest what sealed the last nail of my ban coffin is the handout of flairs. Should have noticed it was suspicious, I mean... Win money with WallStreetBets ? C'mon, me, you know better than that"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,HAHAHA WE LOSE REAL MONEY HERE GTFO
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GME daily thread just lost half its users I ain’t mad.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The paper trading lesson be: do your own DD.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A fresh batch of sacrifices for the paper traitor.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait.. so I’m confused, am I getting banned? :("
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok this is fuckin hilarious.  I just joined WSB earlier this year and when I was reading the contest post that said ""if you dont have money for stocks..."" I was thinking, who the fuck spends time on WSB if they're not investing in stonks?""  This is so, so good.  Love WSB!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so fuckin retarded that I don't even know what paper trading is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine signing up for this 🤣🤣. Rip y’all apes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How am I gonna get to Hawaii to buy a shirt by Friday?!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL I should have known. This cracked me the hell up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what the fuck LMAOOO
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL! Well fuck... looks like I'm an actual retard for not reading the whole post and just signing up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck is it to late to sign up, I thought it was going to last a while"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job **NERDS**!

##🤣"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha well done ya pricks

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that was pretty funny.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I must have missed the original post. Not mad about it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I elect to wear Jorts instead of jeans?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m dumb enough to belong here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"LMAO It‘s THE LEGEND doing it again 

Heads off to you good sir"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,damn who’s that in the video?? 🤤🤤🤤 need an IG fam...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I can't believe I finally won somethin! Imma go tell my parents so they wont be so disappointed in me anymore! Thanks Mods and I cant wait to defend my title next year!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Was the real competition to see who got banned first? 🤣🤣🤣 Cause they deserve some kinda notoriety for their submission.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember bois the first stage is negation.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so it's a permanent ban ? How am I gonna lose money now ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahahahhaha love it. Chainsaw VASECTOMY you are the LAW! 

It never gets old. Love it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol this is the best thing ever. Almost as good as when my wife’s boyfriend let me watch them bang
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Every Friday is Hawaiian shirt Friday.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Chainsaw vasectomy!!! 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that 9m people all agreed not to ruin it is amazing. Lol love the yearly paper trading competition
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is fucking amazing lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So this is what WSB mods look like
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I just bamboozle myself by agreeing without reading the terms and conditions again.

Hate. Cuttlefish"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you fucking newbies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so glad GME brought in so many new tards to fall for it this year lmao.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For my possibly last post before the ban hammer (or not, since it's April 1), I'm just going to say that you got me completely with this paragraph:

> There's so much more to trading than just GameStop! Learn about the  double ratio, the short e-snappin, Time-inverse options, head and  shoulders, the paper trap, the single box rammer, and of course, the  naked tied-up straddle! 

There are so many ridiculous man child names given to strategies and analysis that my eyes just glazed and my mind just told me there's more ridiculousness nomenclature that I'd not yet encountered.

Lesson learnt though - hubris brings a downfall and trust nothing.

\*nods wisely\*"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh fell for it - how long am I out for? Long time lurker that only actually signed for an account a few months ago...guess I deserve it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😎
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll do ANYTHING not to be banned
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"THAT’S IT 
I’ll be selling my GME and taking my business ELSEWHERE 
Wait for my Yelp review! 

MOOOoooOoOooOoOM!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"17,000 newbies fell for it this year. Fucking hell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"y'all got me good. Hot damnit, motherfucker, I am a stupid ape."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,we must protect this man at all cost
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well fuk
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hilarious. I WAS a little disappointed I couldn’t participate since I have a brokerage account. Anyway, back to hoping the airline stocks go to 30,000 feet"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wut


ETA: LOL"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just got honey dicked.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, dammit. Thought I was too old for hazing 😂

Ah, well. I'll still be cheering from the sidelines!!holding my shares to the moon or the grave!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You dirty son of a bitch. I’m in.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All good. Lesson learned. I’ll find a way to keep reading the DD. Thanks for the laugh and the lesson!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I get banned last does that mean I won?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aww man ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|cry)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I wear a Hawaiian shirt, I might be mistaken for a Boogaloo Bois."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtfff
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that was funny lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So did I win then?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets, That will teach me. That will make me sit up and take poultice.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you for pulling this off. Got me good, and the announcer is hilarious!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You fucking legends
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is like an episode of the original ""The Twighlight Zone"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the comp I signed up just curious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll see you all next year and fuk you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lot of upset folks in this comment section.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Here at WSB we are all about education.."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Based on some of the responses here the bans should be made permanent. Y'all can't take a joke for shit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao this thread is way more salty than the previous times. previous times people were just laughing and was pretty light spirited. goes to show that way more normies in here compared to before.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The replies on this years post versus the last two years just goes to show the kinda people that flocked here when GME started bopping. I’m strictly here for the memes and I’m loving it. I also didn’t know that people with such astounding lack of critical thinking skills could even read and type.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is too good.  Love this sub.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking incredible. Ye got me, not even mad.

See ya on the other side of the crash :)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I figured that's what it was as there were literally no specifics and it was aimed at new users. That's OK. Not posting and just reading will be good for me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"#SIKE!!!

The best part of these are the follow-up video"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well played, u/chainsaw_vasectomy"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so that would be why I never heard anything else about it. 

Fair enough."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that sucks, I actually liked hanging around here.  I guess I will just crawl back into my hole."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Get banned “apes”. Looks like tendies are back on the menu bois!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Rofl. Paper trading competition... I knew that sounded like some BS.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#LMFAOOOOOO
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"NOT FUNNY   
MY FEELINGS ARE HURT  
I WANT TO SPEAK TO THE MANAGER"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the dumbest thing ever, I happily accept my ban."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok fair. This makes sense.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"omg, I'm so dumb, I knew this from last year."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao this is our fate, and I’m totally ok with it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,HA! GOT EEM!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We still get a cool ban flair coming out the other side though, right?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting banned is the new getting mod status. Fuck yeah 🤟🦧
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much like everything else in this sub, I have no idea what's going on. Lol

I couldn't figure it out then, still can't figure it out now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was starting to enjoy the conversations around here once i learned to just avoid all the tickers.  Guess its back to drinking and snorting coke off my AA instructors ass
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just pulled all of my positions out of GME because of this

# SIKE!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a fucking april fool's joke you absolute retards
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Join wsb and follows all the trends.  Buys AMC. Buys GME.  Sees paper trading post. ""Lol cool. Yolo."" 

I guess I'm just happy to be included."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't around for the last one, but I read the rules when joined and knew talk about paper trading was banned. When the vets called for another paper trading competition its was fairly easy to deduce the outcome. Can't wait to see less ape posts"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Are mods actually this old ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I knew damn well this was a joke and I still signed up, I feel like an even greater idiot than everyone else now

oh well, I was lurking most of the time anyway, be seeing you in some other reality I suppose"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well fml. I'm 36 and thought I could actually learn something about options. Or is this an elaborate April fools and I'm not going to be banned? I'm so confused. Well, if I do get banned it was nice hanging with you apes. I'll keep holding my GME regardless.

Edit: I really wish this had gotten less attention. It is what it is everyone. I have to decide a stopping point or I'll reply to everyone more or less, so this is my stopping point. Good night and good luck with stuff and whatnot internet ppls."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if this is the end of my two year career in WSB, then so be it. Fuck all y’all cunts, I’ll see you in Valhalla"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats great. Just got enough Karma to post. The competition sounded like fun.

Fuck you and happy trails. You will have to jack off without my loss porn. That shit was hot too."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that this guys username is u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY doesn’t sit right with me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha never gets old 😆
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,BAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Swear ill be this old by the time we finally moon 😂 I definitely feel it right now!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You got me. I just like the shenanigans.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jeans? Jokes on you... I haven’t worn pants since Feb 2019
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aww man, forced to sit here and learn for a whole year"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The future is now Grandpa. See you in Valhalla🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😆
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm really excited for Hawaiian shirt day!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,anyone knows where i can get a sweet deal on hawaiian shirts?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best thing iv seen all week
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just when I think i can't love this sub more  I get bitch slapped because I was so damn wrong.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a great character actor you found for the video.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got bamboozled
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I did not see that coming.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't know what any of this means but I like it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Had to finally comment and let ya know how weak I was. 

Shit was funny."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Real Question though. Who won the pee martini?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know I thought it was weird that you said you were experts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I retarded? :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you based mods
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban me grandpa.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,wait so I'm banned? tightttttt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m gonna get bannered?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Free vasectomy for you guys
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I at least be flared for the honor that is being publicly this retarded?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d like to say, “welcome to all the new banned mods”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,can i get temp banned too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I deserve that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This was the BEST one yet!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow my first ban! Thanks mods!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was banned last year and I didn’t realize it was an April Fools joke until today.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk this man but he looks like he keeps all the good candy in his wallet
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I’ll be damned lol, I’ve been had. A win, is a win though! Lesson learned to read thoroughly next time. 

For all those bitching, man/woman/they up and take the ban, you earned it lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You fuckers. Well played. The pre April 1st set up got me... Classic.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The worst part is I've been on this sub long enough to know you get banned but I forgot.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck all you new fucking people have no clue what this sub is really about.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for your service mods. The paper trading competition is what I look forward to the most every year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only thing better than the video is the auto sort of the comments to controversial 🤣🤣

Hoes be mad."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I did this amazing thing called DD and decided not to sign up. I love how nobody that knew about past paper trading competitions said a word. This is the greatest community in the history of online communities. Period.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just my opinion, but bans should be permanent.  GME was fun, but we need to get back to ridiculing anyone who even mentions the word ""shares""."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck y'all whiners I'm getting banned and I think it's hilarious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please stop crying about how mean WSB is. The ban is temporary for fucks sakes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's hard to tell if the mod is an old fart trying to operate a camera or this is their grandpa.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk if I can comment if im banned, but I gotta say..Not much will make me laugh out loud while im on my phone but this elicited an instinctual chortle out of me. This is so fuckin funny."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,who the fuck is this lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy is a fucking mod? Make this make sense!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t believe I didn’t sign up for this in time fuckkkkjjjkkkk
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp, got me too. Been subscribed for a long time, sad to be bannhammered."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol and fuck you.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait so there's not actually going to be one? Fuck, I was hoping to learn to do math finally."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, fuck me I guess I won't be able to test my algo bot to throw my big brain dick around, sTILL in the GME hold. I shall see you apes soon enough. Gamble your shit and fuck you all"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This dude made me 🤣😂🤣😹😹then 😭my grandpa was funny too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny thing is, as a new person here. I came across the paper trading competition on Youtube some time back so I was just chuckling the whole time I saw this appear."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s Watchu get for not learning your retarded history. Paper trading bitches
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, maybe I'll have a life for the next year at least. Probably not. See ya'll on the moon."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait... it already happened? I just signed up the other day. Some info on how it actually works would have been real cool. Dang.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao this sub rocks. Ima get banned and couldn’t be more proud of you apes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just got enough karma to post here this week. fml.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Duck yeah Hawaiian Shirt here I come baby
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i knew it was a trap but i just wanted a flair :/
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not gonna lie I needed a new account anyways, this one started getting too recognizable if someone wanted to piece together who I am. 

Am still retarded though"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure got me! Wanted to use it as an opportunity to learn options Trading via an Environment that motivates me. Still pushed mw to do that so i got what i wanted out of it 😁
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Creeeeeepy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All I wanted was a fuckin flair I was lied to damnit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I knew I should I signed up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A ban for giving my username and doing nothing else? Love it. Would do again.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just started reading some recommendation books rip
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha this is great.  Nice to know you fuckers!  I'll still check in though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bazinga! Cheers to old man chainsaw. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)

Looking forward to doing this thing that I signed up for that time"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best thing I've seen in a long time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read ""paper trading"" and thought, that doesn't sound like something this sub would promote. The idea of trading without consequence sounded fun and informative though, so my smooth brain didn't listen to my diamond balls and I signed up.

Fuck you very much! I will take my ban with pride."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i am so f\*\*\*ng confused. what the heck is the competition all about anyway?? do we record ourselves while paper day trading and uploading on here or something?

I have signed up but have zero clue what to do next."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait this is the guy behind most of these posts?  No wonder WSBers are called apes, autists, retards, etc"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See you guys next year when I have my GME tendies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's definitely you and not a fiverr commission.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I’m not mistaken the paper trading comp rules said that those with a real market account would be banned. So either you don’t invest or you don’t read; either way getting banned from an investing subreddit smells like justice.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Need 📄 trader flair /u/zjz
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,ALL IN!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao got ‘em

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hawaiian shirt day!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, Chainsaw Vasectomy. I told my mother about this, you crazy old bastard"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, I was supposed to read the whole post? Oops"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes finally some air in here. I swear it smelt more like fart everyday it was difficult to breath
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I fucking loved that video
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this fucking guy. ""Next Friday is Hawaiian shirt day..."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How long is the ban for?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,HAHAHA Classic!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuckin got me, never even seen it coming"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhhhh fuck, here was me thinking I was actually gonna learn some shit!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got on my freshest pair of hawaiian jeans
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I only read the smoothbrain edition of the rules and paper trades weren't mentioned in that one :p
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess i need an hawaian shirts to survive this ban
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The power's gone to his head 🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Noooooooooo!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got me! Face palm!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"ITT: Newbs learn about the WSB rules.

Edit: And then cry."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I deserve to be banned. I don't even know what paper trading is! Haha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is such high quality. thank you.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This shows how many people are fucking new blood here. You literally could have just searched and seen last time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,As someome who has lurked this subreddit for ~3 years the paper trading competition days are by far my favorite days to visit. Love this guy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone who is bitching about getting banned... We all deserve it. just take it like a champ. on all fours with lots of lube.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I nearly spat out my crayon
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watching all the new people sweating is fucking hilarious. Enjoy your ban, paper hands."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was waiting for this pay off.   

&#x200B;

Those of yall who feel burned should go back and really read that post you signed your name to, and reflect upon what went wrong in your head to lead you to this moment. 

395p 4/7"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Btw Chainsaw_Vasectomy is only 23. 

Thats what trading FD’s does to you kids"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad I have low self-confidence. I saw the word competition and shriveled.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this whole year when i kept reading ppl talk about the old paper trading competition, i thought it was real. See you after the ban"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do this every year, its hilarious (or it will be to you next year if it isn't now)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait it’s over? I didn’t even know it started, I should read more next time."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait a sec... did this dude actually get a vasectomy using a chain saw???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can really tell by the comments who wasn’t here for paper trading contests #1 and #2
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This has got to be the only sub where something like this works every fucking time on these apes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When I saw the post for the comp I laughed for around 30 minutes. I know all too well how the paper trading comp works and usually chortle but seeing the growth of WSB this year made this one special.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I will take this ban like a man and come back wiser and stronger. You guys are seriously the best
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to get in
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck yeah!! Hawaiian shirt day is coming up!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember when we used to ban people for holding shares. Good times
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes to you being banned is my fetish
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Even the Dian Fossey Fund couldn't save these apes from being culled
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so happy to have people like this as my unofficial financial advisors.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My favorite part about this years competition? Allowing the dunces that fell for time to make butt hurt comments about it being mean before they actually get banned.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We need to get back to people ruining their lives or retiring by buying OTM SPY weeklies. 

This sub use to be about different plays not involving like 6 different meme stocks."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just excited for Hawaiian shirt day
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless 7 million people signed up than this community still sucks ass. I am glad I was around as long as I was, but this place will never be the same again. R.I.P Wallstreetbets"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a participant of the first competition, it brings me joy to see the tradition carried on"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao all the newbies still sad they got temp ban, I just want to know the body count from each year, especially this year with how much attention we have gotten."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paper trading for paper hands, diamond trading for diamond hands"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got ‘em
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Plot twist: it is DFV sending a message from the future. And he is hiding his red bandana under that hat.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's awshum 

# Lesson #1: Paper = BAD.

# Lesson #2: You don't need to know anything about the market.  Just buy and hodl.

Not financial advice, just MY personal strategy. I like the stock!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,idiots
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if I spoiled the surprise I would have been banned?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let’s be honest, we all deserve a ban. At least we hopefully get a cool flair too"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just need some sort of GMEtard competition next and get things back to normal.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And here I was waiting for the fun to begin...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My intern signed me up. I swear. She's a monkey and just bashes keys on the keyboard.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I fell for it , I was finally able to comment on a post last night and get my very first award . 

Well played ..... for an ape ...."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,April Fools
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol is this guy actually a mod? At first I thought they paid someone from cameo.

anyway, ive only been here a little over a year.. I was confused when the paper trading thing was posted cause wasnt the previous paper trading competition idea done by the old WSB owner who was ousted? I remember it being advertised as some sort of LAN esports competition around the same time as the WSBgod fiasco and then he was kicked outta here by the mods or something lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I should have paper trading immunity just for my  Jim Cramer jokes. But we still get banned? BANNING IS LAME. So MODS are just GAY BEARS? I got it. Apes attack Apes? Chin straps ripping off chin straps? Only bought shares so really no paper hand trading at all. I buy all over the board so not just one stock but I happen to like said stock.With that said though do you really think close to 10 million people on here are just trading options? Talk about golden chin strap award! Really all the people on here right now buying 5 shares of any stock doesn't help your options play or DD? Talk about GET THE F OUTTA HERE. Oh I agree completely keep the GME stuff in the daily mega threads. I like seeing DD out there as well on other stonks. To some of you talking your yacht boy talk one has only to look in your profile comments to see you talking about finally getting your unemployment check fun coupons to YOLO on GME $800 calls. LMAO! This sub has been good for my mental health I like the humor and camaraderie and DD on here. And yet you retards are posting comments on here right now like I can even reply. ERE BANNED! Can't even give you a good Cramer joke like Jim Cramer thinks putting his dirty socks in warm water makes Hot Sake. Jim Cramer thinks Vicks Vaporub is a men's cologne. That's pure gold Morty. Oh well banned it is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This makes more sense, but I can't say I'm not a little disappointed that I won't get to see a bunch of retards compete

Edit: Banned ;)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dumbass didn't read the details of the post, just read the concept of a trading competition and thought it would be fun"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Who let /u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY let his grandpa near the computer?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it. Most fun old guy I can think of. Glad I wasn't able to compete.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Any saving grace that I was here for the HTZ fun we had last year? No? Well fuck me... see you next year in my Hawaiian shirt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For realz is this your grandad? He’s adorable 💕❤️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i ain’t got time for no paper trading. diamond tendies or bust. sorry y’all got banned 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper Hands.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dammit I actually thought that shit was real, like it's the only wsb-sanctioned paper trading since rules don't allow it otherwise. OH WELL"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how old I’ll be when GME moons:
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol tf

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit! Steve!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ban, what ban?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So over 17,000 people seem unfamiliar with rule 7 and never questioned it if they were ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol i fuckin knew it'd be some shit like this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So good lol. Got me and I’ve been around for a while. I just thought you were being funny to poke fun at the newbies with 2 delta options 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,“PSYCHED! ....YOU GOT BANNED!”
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What seems to be a big deal? They said it's temporary. The joke that is being pulled was perfect for April Fools. This is you earning your wings now in WSB. Enjoy the ban and wait next year for the annual paper trading competition. Watch others get ban, then make fun of them. 

Good prank overall. Loved it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,who's man's is this? smh I got GOT
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, better start an OnlyFans account then."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So next Friday Hawaiian shirts? Got it.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only way you ""learn"" how to trade options is by losing your entire net worth buying SPY FDs."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This guys grandpa is fucking awesome
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on you. Am already wearing hawaiian shirt.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfaooo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit is absolutely hilarious!! I read that shit when they posted about the paper competition and I just thought that shit sounds boring as fuck. And also when I read it I was thinking to myself this does not sound like WSB. This sounds like some coddling bs.lol And also see rule 7.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never been banned before lol; can I still lurk on the sub as per usual, just not post/comment?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the first sub I have been banned from. I'll take it with pride.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering why there were absolutely no details about the paper trading thing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Going back to read the responses it really makes sense now smh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dudes hilarious, what can I say"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit I though he had a stroke in the middle of this video 😳
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dear, I'll be waiting with my Hawaiian shirt"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL I’ve been laughing at this shit since the competition last year.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs to be perma ban.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the strangest delivery ever. Well done.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GME thread down to 5 ppl now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd rather get a Chainsaw Vasectomy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaaooo I saw the paper trading comp and really thought WSB had lost its edge and that was the final nail
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, this thread is saltier than r/CumDump"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, in hindsight the original post is so obvious, it hurts. Well deserved I guess. 😅"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would die for this man
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We truly are a special, special group of people."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In b4 dumb apes claiming mods were paid off by Melvin to do this to prevent all the ""A+ DD"" from being posted"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn gramps, I was worried you had a stroke about 35 seconds in, but you played me 👍🏼"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the dinosaur park going to open?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is his Hawaiian Shirt Day a reference to Office Space?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaoo 😂😂 the comments on the competition thread were so wholesome too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hawaiian shirt Friday has me fucking rolling
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The paper trading competition is my favourite part of wsb I remember almost signing up for the first one a few years back but I chose to lose real money not fake money!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lotta new cigarettes in here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone that’s spent any time here should’ve seen this coming with how overly nice everyone in the sign up was being. I’m a lurker and have never posted or commented, but I was reading those comments and knew something was up immediately lmfao."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are my favorite posts every year, thanks mods!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So I won?! Gotta work on my acceptance speech now... Thank you!!!!! u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim 25 year old day trader
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy is a champ among'st youngsters and should be celebrated. If your feeling cheeky then why not set a life goal to have a portfolio that's awesome and the time out of your day to be a Moderator on your favorite forum. Strive to have everything paid off and get to do what you love with those that you enjoy while being financial able to make crazy yolo's, riding around on your lawn mower screaming at people to ""GET OFF YOUR LAWN""

He's a Legend."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn Gen Z'ers and their tomfoolery...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the Office Space reference. :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,whats wrong with hawaiiian shirts and jeans? i feel personally attacked
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Of all the april fools joke this hurt the worst
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All right! 😎

Elder Haiwian Shirt Day *here we come*."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanna thank the mods and wsb for this, never saw it coming and I totally deserve the ban. I was wondering why I couldn’t find the old paper trading threads... lesson learned. Can’t wait to fall for it again next year!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel better about myself, because I thought I just hadn't heard of all of those strategies and was farther behind the ball than I thought. At the same time, I feel worse about myself, because I should have known those don't exist, or at least looked them up when I was so unfamiliar. What an interesting quandary. And, I might add, brilliantly played. +1 wsb"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He is actually 28 with a serious Meth Problem
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This shit is pretty funny considering it was spammed on the GME megathread, was marketed to newbies like ""New to trading?? Join us for the fun and learn!"", there were like testimonials from past winners, and no real details whatsoever. In hindsight it was all very suspicious and pretty damn obvious lmfao."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I get banned?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to believe this is actually /u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the mods here were 45 years old bimbos. I'm really disappointed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this uncle Bruce
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What a fucking legend I almost spit my coffee out when he said his username
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This man is a downtrend away from death
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m just confused man. I’m glad other people enjoy the prank, but personally I don’t even know that THIS isn’t the prank. 

I’m not even mad, but I’m not really laughing because I don’t get the joke I guess. Glad other people are having fun with it though. Guess I’m gonna get banned or something. Oh well. It’s been a cool 6 months."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I start a new job next week, I’m definitely calling people out for not wearing a Hawaiian shirt next friday."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He's younger than I expected.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub is going down the drain

......

And so is my bank account"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That dude is only 32 you should have seen him before he joined this sub
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on Hawaiian shirts. Game on!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg I just laughed so hard I coughed mucus all over my phone
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahahaha hahahahahahaha I'm so fucking glad I don't participate in anything
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it seemed wildly out of character for this sub, but a few posters planted the seeds of paper competition months back.

This is what we get for not doing our own DD. Valuable lesson learned!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh I saw this and thought ""paper trading, why the hell would I do that I'm not in 7th grade again.... makes more sense now lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bill Lumbergh says Hawaiian shirt day, you do what you're told. Not sure what this paper tradings all about but we're going Hawaiian Punch level."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Man what the fuck is going on in this subreddit lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy had the goat vines , ""I got me a peanut butter sandwich, I'm set for the day"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We need more shit posts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may be relatively new here, but im not retarded enough to believe that stonk 4chan would ever give you anything but shit, even if you make $$$.  Look at when DFV first got on GME if you don't believe me."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You really get to see who the new retards on the short bus are with paper trading competitions.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got my first award here yesterday and banned today. This sub is as up and down as GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Am Hawaiian. Any shirt I put on is a Hawaiian shirt.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh god, when he said: ""Psych!  You get banned!"", I was crying from laughing so hard!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this so wholesome?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in tears , holy shit. Who the fuck wears jeans with a Hawaiian shirt. That’s ridiculous."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That smile is contagious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seeing the annual culling of retards really brings out my smooth brain :')
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that hat... What is that hat called and where can I get one?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,love the office space homage at the end
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This... this is why I came here in the first place. Can’t wait for next year! Hopefully we’ll be able to increase the roster!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why temporary
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we do another purg— I mean, competition for minors?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, is this some dude you found on fiver?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did he get paid to do this 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That look off camera at 1:05 is telling u/Chainsaw_Vasectomy stop tormenting your grandpa😭
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was waiting for this with excitement lmao great turn out! Im glad to see the same dude again doing the ban announcements lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been fucking bamboozled to the highest degree
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I thought this made no sense. Coming here to learn is like going to the casino to get wendy's chicken tenders."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao never ceases to be funny
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp fuck, I’ll be holding and diversifying from the sidelines then. To the Moon or bust"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this a deep fake?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a temporary ban. Why are some folks so butt-hurt? LOL!

Also... sooo...who won last year?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please share this guy's fiverr.. what a treasure
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The mods we need, but not the mods we deserve.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I better get that sick flair for this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ban me first dammit! But let me back in eventually. I need a sub to grow old with. also, I promise I will always be a retard who doesn't read the rules good enough. and I promise to never think about paper-trading again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey mods when Friday comes can I put a Hawaiian shirt on and some jeans and post it here?? Will that give me the MODD package finally??
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why can't this kind of stuff make the news
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a newly-minted, freshly banned moderator doubling as clueless retardant ape, I’d like to thank you all for playing, and u/zjz I will take my winnings and maybe we do a super rad community poll and decide where to donate.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I kept wondering how the hell the competition was supposed to work. Man, so bamboozled. I’d rather get a free vasectomy than get banned. Womp womp."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Jc..eve shoulda swallowed...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How payd u?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was worried chainsaws fiver voice got the rona and went to the Devine Treasury. Glad to see he all right.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone clarify what this is all about? 

My guess (which is probably very incorrect) is that the moderators are trying to catch amateur investors who are only paper trading so that they can ban them... but surely that's not the case so I'm wondering what I missed. 

Remember... I'm retarded."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So mods, you do know that GME thread will be completely dead without all of us retards, right?!! Wait to ban us after GME moons, may be?

&#x200B;

Regardless, honored to be banned by legends"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy needs to just end it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You look like the guy from the tv show Pappy’s Land
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This might be the dumbest thing ive ever seen, why bait your own members into something like this just to ban them.  Like hey we have this cool game anyone want to play we have prizes too!  Oh btw now your banned👌🏿"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought it was for fun. Now some douche is gonna ban me from his moms basement.... Y'all are worse than Kramer.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How bout a fuck you thread before we depart lads
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How can I tell how long I’ve been a member of a sub? My accounts like 5yrs old and I’m pretty sure I made it just to follow this /r
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all remember it’s April first right?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Who is that?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a real hoot!  Thank you for your service!  

j/k  April fools"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you kidding me? This sub is a fucking joke now lol. Good riddance, assholes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that’s a little extra. I thought the idea of a mock trading type learning scenario would be a good learning opportunity. I think etoro has a similar mock trading functionality. Might try that while I’m reading about the different concepts and fundamentals. No sense in trying with real money before I know what I am doing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck is this guy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes no difference. If I could, I’d completely ban this sub. But I’m me. They’re them. You’re you. Who gives a f"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, do you have extra moth balls?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh. His username really is chainsaw_vasectomy isn’t it. That combined with the video is...unsettling.

(Admiral Ackbar's famous line is ""ITS A TRAP"")

Literally my post history wasn't even hidden. Everyone should analyze a user's post history. Whether it's buying a stock they recommend, or signing up for a ""competition,"" thats a huge lesson here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You got me, the comments there looked so nice. I joined a year ago and thought oh learning tactics sound good.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's too fucking funny.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the username, the dude is trolling."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rip, he didn't get the karma"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that guy knew about the paper trade competition based on his username and the other subreddits he’s in. Gives off old wsb vibes. Probably an alt account
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Upping their Karma scores just to get BANNED!! Oh my goodness that's incredibly hilarious! 🤣🤣🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Obvious troll if you look at his post history
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reminds me of Richard Attenborough

That same enthusiasm when he first introduces Jurassic Park"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He looks like a Pokémon disguised as a person.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that’s a 3 year ban for you then
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm banning people as fast as I can. It's slow though.

Wait your turn in line, we'll get to you when we can.

**It's temporary BTW**"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"17,000 isn’t even close to 6.5 million...what a shame"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So fucking stoked for Hawaiian shirt day.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Phenomenal to post this on April 1 and further confuse the hell out of those kids who think it's just a joke.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had posted a comment to add me, never heard back, and... It's over already?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's amazing, so how long is the ban for?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait... mod is a boomer?!?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Y'all got me for a second there until i realized the damn day

EDIT: Now due to further analysis apparently this is not an April fool's joke and we will actually get banned, I don't have much to say other then, I enjoy eating crayons and I'm a complete smooth brain"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bigger man than me. They used a very small scalpel to do my vasectomy. I did watch though. The tubes look fake. Like something you would buy at the store.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm seriously surprised so few tried to spoil the contest.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this some kind of April Fool's Joke I'm too autistic to understand?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well fuck me

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought for sure I was getting Rick rolled with the Hawaiian Shirt day
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, you got me.  

But... my post in reply only contained my username and did not technically violate the rules.  I made no mention of the thing not to be mentioned.  Only the announcement post did, so only you should be banned.  

See you when my ban expires."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See you in a year!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Flair checks out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I got got p bad. Been here before the GME squeeze, but I guess I deserve this for missing one line in the rules.

I have seen some comments here recommending paper trading before as a way to start out, though. And in teaching posts, before this became a meme sub, too.

Oh well tho."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just 17k
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, this changes nothing (posting for maybe the last time before the ban)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been trading weeklies for 2 months and I can confirm that you will not look like this. I can also confirm that you will look homeless bc you will be.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just saw when your cake day is 😂, you had no chance, welcome to WSB and Reddit"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How long is their ban lmao?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Will I be unbanned in time to participate next year?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wanna be that old dude when I grow up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Like PLTR temporarily dipping under $30... or more like GME dipping $170 temporary?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we have an official participant count? That would be fun to know
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Should make it a perm ban tbh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo wtf? Why temporary? This is fucking bullshit. Ban all the damn noobs who think wsb is only about GME

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods are super gay. Can't even perma ban these retarded pc apes anymore. WSB has just become the same sad echo chamber circle jerk the rest of reddit has always been. It's dead af.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,1 year bans are still considered temporary right?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would call a year ban temporary...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not ban till the next one?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Testing 1... 2... 3...

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is my ban?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MODS ARE GODS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a permaban before all bans were lifted last year and this mfs get to have a temp?? REEEEE.

I should've joined this year's competition"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I’m reading this have I been banned??
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,(X) Doubt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"zjz should know, he fucks wives. So whose wife did you fuck to get banned in the first place? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|flip_out)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i signed up last minute please ban me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want you to know before the ban that I find this hilarious. Actually made me laugh and that's what I get for ignoring the paper trading comps in the past.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just make mine permanent. I hate April Fools and the mod team lost my respect with this bullshit.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The real competition was seeing if you did your DD on the person posting :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I always act first then read later.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I assumed the mods posting it meant it was sanctioned. This is essentially entrapment, just not serious in any way."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think medical professionals are heroes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The word dick stains comes to mind. The world is truly soulless.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Slow mods!! Ban me already so I can be done with it lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just those were jokes and signed up anyways
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally didn’t lol just liked the idea of loads of apes going ham with fake money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously if you don’t know about trading you won’t know if something is a made up word or not. I signed up so my kid and I could learn together. 🤷‍♀️ he’s 13 and really getting into it but doesn’t have access to his own money yet.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read it, I just though it was satire."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Facts I need to read the stories?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do they get banned??
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Su Bae is my mommy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So...no Hawaiian shirts tomorrow? :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the subreddit rules and the ""competition"" rules and realize that signing up by definition broke subreddit rules."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I maybe wrong. But it Paper Trading Competition, and if you are dumb enough to participate  you get banned? So that is just aftermatch message i guess."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have ""Paper Trading"" competitions pretty regularly when the sub fills up with retards; anyone who signs up gets banned. Looks like it caught a ton of the new GME only traders, so worked as intended"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I banned?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Who tf is this guy fr.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol a year from now you would have signed up again lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The year is 2033 and some of you are still bag holding GME and unable to read the rules.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Going through the sign up and seeing the thousands of people signing up definitely made me chuckle
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t know, but I knew, you know?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The best part is that I read the sub rules and still fell for it. I truly am retarded.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought it was pretty obvious those weren't real but I thought it was a joke so I joined. Oh well
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Watching the video of the first Paper trade competition was the highlight of my year. Though IIRC it was just users too young to trade that were lured in.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's actually him.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think people would just go on the internet, and lie?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Rule 7 bud. No paper trades.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah go paper trade in the bathroom of a 7-11 we want the real deal.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO get owned
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine actually signing up for a paper trading competition lmfao.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to WSB and fuck you!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this place. Unfortunately only 17k means it won't put much of a dent in the 7 million bots.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So it’s good that the people who didn’t can’t post anymore.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Anyone except a literal retard could see it coming from a mile away XD

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you so stupid?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to be 84 before your eligible for the role.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the mod's grandson
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He's not old. He's just been trading fds and spy weeklies and that's taken a toll on him
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you actually a 16 year old kid who just heard of this whole shebang and threw your lunch money into it?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Net's been around since the 90s, only makes sense all the dudes who were in their late 20s-30s would start to get up there. Only gonna become more and more common over the years. Soon enough I too will be this old."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah it's CGI. That's actually DFV
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No he is the youngest
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends. You into that kind of thing?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you’re pretty goddamn dumb, but I love you"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol me too. I just sign up for all the giveaways on reddit to hopefully win one just once. Looks like I finally won.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has happened multiple times in the past. Every paper trading competition on wsb is a way to get rid of the noobs who don’t belong, otherwise they’d remember the last time. I’m honestly surprised it still works and everyone kept their mouth shut. 

Probably speaks to how far this place has fallen recently that anyone here over a year is a small percentage now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isnt an investing subreddit. This is a dumbass gambling degenerate subreddit. You want to learn from people that regularly drink their own piss?


Actual advice: read investopedia for specific technical understanding. Read the business sections or websites for general understanding. Read books like Barbarians at the Gate and other similar books for narratives about it and if you want some value investing advice read The Intelligent Investor. Whatever you do, dont read someone telling you about the next big thing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re not learning anything from this bunch of retards.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should've looked at the mod's submission history (like the signup post hinted at).

This is done on a regular basis here to purge the pansies that aren't proper gambling degenerates."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn you are retarded. Guess you belong here, even though you have zero sense of humor or awareness"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll be Banned for a year. Watch and learn. And you should have read the post properly as it said it was for people who can't trade. This reading skill will also help you follow through with thesis level DDs that'd be posted here by autists. 

This is done to shake off people who can't hold positions."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You pussy. WSB is about Yolo fat stacks of cash regardless of consequences or risk management. Think we'd let a virigin like you in here? Frig off. Time to clean out the riff raff. Goodbye commie GME scum. Go take your 'revolution' to the snowflake subreddits

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, we are definitely getting banned for being retards. It's not perma though. it's a great april fools day joke, because it's true."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How can all of you be this...I'm actually starting to wonder if I'm the dumb one.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"... you .. you can still learn about options, retard? This paper trading contest was not holding the key to secrets of options, what?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s like a Snipe Hunt when you were a kid, 

don’t worry about it

You get to be in on it next year"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have fun with that!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao i remember the first time this happened and it was the funniest shit ever.

you are from the age of 4chan, stileproject, and og cs.  Don't give me that sob story.

you will be fine grandpa"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub has always been aggressive in a joking manner. But to be fair when I first joined I didnt learn from the community I learned on my own and then I was able to enjoy the community. This sub has so many new members that it seems to of lost the magic that was once here because people don't understand the true nature of r/WSB
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t an education sub



Unless you’re learning to buy Tesla calls, The easiest stock to trade"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. Started learning about the market in December, missed first GME wave. I'll be holding 7 shares along with you. Fuck I hate being poor."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol.  If you want some advice on options I’ll give you some.  Just PM me.  The paper trading competition is the best part of this sub.  :).
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same I’m so confused, but whatever. I guess we broke a rule? Idk. Clearly I’m too dumb for this.
Edit: yeah no we’re just dumb. Byeee!

Edit since I can no longer reply: I’m cool with the ban, I obviously deserve it, I just think this a mean spirited way to weed out idiots like myself. It’s very effective though, because I really do now understand that this sub is not for me. 
No harm no foul."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck my favorite sub is dead. Jesus Christ get the fuck out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How dare you not know something
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The best way to learn is through example. Sign up for robinhood, they won't ask any questions and then pour your life savings into the next meme stock. 

**This is not financial advice**"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. I didn't really know what they were talking about but I thought it was a sign-up to learn more about trading. This is really isn't funny or even entertaining, it's just mean."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,how have you been around for two years but somehow missed the thing that happens every year lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1 year old account, “2 year career at WSB” yep he can’t do math. He belongs."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had been here for more than a year you'd know what this is. This paper trading banfest is a time honored tradition.

What people who flooded into WSB in the last year / last two months don't realize is that WSB is not for pussies and it isn't a place to learn how to trade.  It's a place where valuable information is shared and legends are made / tragedies are made.  And a place of dank memes of course."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve been here two years and fell for paper trading competition? How fucking dumb are you?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How have you been here for two years and still managed to get yourself honeypot’ed? This is the third time they’ve done this.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro if you’ve been here two years how did you not immediately recognize the paper trading comp from previous years
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You deserve the ban for not knowing about the paper trading competition even though you subbed 2 years ago
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If youd been here that long youd know what the paper trading contest is..

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao “long time”. If you were here for that long you would’ve known about the paper trading competition
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly not long enough to have been around for the first ruse

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ll be back and better than ever! This shit is just comedic, and I like that you’re not being an ass about it like a lot of people on here.

Saw a guy saying this below, but he was right. Last time, I feel like most people had your reaction. This time it’s more actual outrage, which is fuckin ridiculous"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope this is actually the guy who goes by chainsaw_vasectomy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""paper trading competition"" is talked up heavily by the mods every time and every time the mods just ban whoever signs up for it. There has never actually been a real paper trading competition."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s Martin shkreli after a few years in the clink
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the problem...  this is a sub for options traders.  Not for people who just hold shares in one company.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off.. There are no apes. Only Retards and autists.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you use this sub to improve mental health you need to work out some better strategies with your Psychologist.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This comment is so gay.  “Apes attack apes?!” Fuck outta here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we have an actual competition? Gosh.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty solid 3-part lesson, though, if you think about it:

1. Always do your due diligence.
2. Trust no one but yourself. Anyone trying to tell you how to make money is likely trying to make money off of you.
3. Nobody, especially the folks here, owe you anything. We can stand together on certain issues or movements, but at the end of the day, we have to cover our own asses."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This just isn’t true.  But new traders should learn to lurk instead of trying to take over with their bullshit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe that's how Wall Street feels about us?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah there's also legit teaching on here now and then. Since GME has been blowing up it's not as often. And paper trading is recommended now and then in comments, for starting out.

I got got p bad tho, since there's a line in the rules about no posting paper trades."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I regret fighting for you to get back on this subreddit

Just kidding I love you and probably deserve a ban, I might enjoy a weekend for once"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,God I love you guys.  This is the WSB we know and love.  :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was new to WSB, I got a perma ban for accidentally commenting on it because it was a stickied post; when I meant to comment on the daily thread.

Y'all are really tame compared to before, which is nice."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"well shit lmaoooo, before I go 

🦍🚀💎✊

🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️ Sayonara bitches"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I won a free ban! Better than reading GME, BB, AMC for the next few months on WSB anyways! See you on the other side with some loss porn."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha you forgot me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no, i thought it was a legit competition and didn't wanted to get in D: can i still sign into it?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,how long is temporary
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys wouldn't have to do these competitions as often if you would stop letting posts from here show up on r/all. You guys did it for like a day last year and then reverted back.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the line for concert tickets to AC/DC?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dang props to you guys. I thought something was up when the users you mentioned were either fake or inactive - especially u/AdmiralAckbar but my curiosity got the best of me. Should've known better.

How long is the ban for? A year?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I got queue jump
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This is really shitty of you.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 17x what we did last year, so we're projecting to ban about 1.4 billion users in 2025."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm 36 and confused but I'm gathering, slowly, that im legit going to be banned for not understanding a star wars reference or checking two years of post history. I thought it was going to be a real thing to learn from."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Eternity
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See you after your ban?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There were a few. The one that sold be that it was genuine though was someone pointing out a somewhat common flair as being a result of participating in the 2019 one.

I await my fate with pride knowing that I am now certifiably retarded."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets, Ban
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sure not to ban this ape. He has wrinkle brain
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,yep and he’s like 32 give or take
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,people complaining about the sub being ruined by newcomers in that one too lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you're a good sport, I'm sure you'll be back sooner than you think"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole post was obviously a joke. Has nothing to do with “one line in the rules.” 

Any combo of common sense, street smarts, or critical thinking in context of wsb would’ve told a few brain cells the thread was making fun of new investors."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof! Same! And so much to take in here, it's at times overwhelming and to miss something."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, same here, they got us good, I didn't really think and i thought this was some sort of actual competition, oh well, time to turn into a lurker instead of posting my ape and rocket emojis on the daily gme thread, wsb you're missing out 😤😤😤"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So like are we perma banned lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol just make an alt it’s not that serious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I never could even find the rules 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,69 days
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope I will
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just suck a dick and you’ll become a mod too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah seriously. 


Jesus Christ, I am so fucking tired of the ""ape"" bullshit.

It was always retard or autist. 

These cunts are bringing their PC and no-fun allowed bullshit to this sub."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No one was ever perma banned in previous comps
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What, no love for Su Bae?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We call this game ""spot the guy who didn't buy in time and missed out"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"everything is only about GME, bitch"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoa whoa whoa now. I'm only a 2 month account because my other one got banned..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,an elitest who only has a 9 month account? fun stuff. We all gotta start somewhere bud.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seconded
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, still here 🤤"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for my awards as well. They will be used well.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro I'm worse than that I didn't understand what it was but participated anyways for no reason at all
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The paper trading comps were never perma bans
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah man perma ban everyone. It's the internet, mofos be too serious about it. I've got a few different burner accounts anyway so will still be trolling on here lmao"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Forever
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,8 inches.   why?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They always have been
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it’s funny.
Like gay bears and autists.
It’d be elitist if it wasn’t funny.
Bans on WSB are done with love."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see your comment
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you joined late enough to have never heard about what the paper trading competition on wsb means, you still deserve to be banned"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,PLEASE ASSUME THE PUNISHMENT POSITION
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoes mad ‼️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not as bad as April Fools hates you apparently. You’re still here you crybaby. Think it through....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol you keep saying this, but if you wanted to leave, you would’ve left already. Tells me you just want the smoke for some reason"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,benisban
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol don't take it so personal. You fell for it. Own up to your mistakes. And get better. Use this as a learning opportunity.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. This retard.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"LMFAOOOO

https://youtu.be/HWDTtDwRqs0"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cope 🤗
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,someone needs a hug :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,definitely incoming.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is, that's the point."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's your prerogative, and in general is a great way to live, but on this sub I guarantee you will get fucked. That's why the lesson is on and about this sub, people were trying to trick us out of money BEFORE all of wall street had their eyes plastered onto WSB, it'll only get worse from here on out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit rate limits it to about 1 ban per second, the bot is moving as fast as it can, but don’t worry, you’ll be banned soon enough."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What type of ban do we get?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should not be using r/WSB to teach your kid anything. Well I guess you could teach him about not trusting people on the internet.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Now your son can learn another valuable lesson: Everyone gets cucked eventually.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well it was 🤣 and so was the competition but you didn’t make that link somehow?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper trading pussy ass bitches don’t belong in wsb
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,well it's funny. think of it as population control.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they are pussies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We don’t do paper round here boi
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY bro, u need me to sign u up for the competition too? 😳"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely a possibility
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My favourite part was the “partnered with admin & Amazon” for prizes lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damnit lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didnt sign or anything, but isnt rule 7 ""No Bullshitting""? I don't see a listed rule that says ""no paper trades""."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I GOT DESTROYED
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yep, I admit to being blinded by hubris."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You would think so right? 😭maybe this is a sign to take a break from weeklies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We should've magically known the mods deliberately set people up to get banned?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Make him delete reddit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,While banned we can still lurk? If that's the case it was even more enjoyable being banned lmao I just don't want to lose my biggest tool
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was mostly directed at all the crybabies who can't handle the ban.

I have lurked on reddit for a long time, saw this happen the last two years, and still fucking signed up like a moron. Can't believe I forgot, I wanted a flair lol. oh well, honestly my wallet will probably thank me"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is indeed the joke.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this answer
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a community of retards so I guess that's your answer. Now if you excuse me those crayons are not going to eat themselves.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does nobody pay attention to the date, y’think?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had the same question. What’s the answer :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my Iq test of 150
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cringe
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I came here to learn the fine art of YOLOn  insanely OTM options that expire on Friday sir. Not the safest place to invest my 401k.

 The guy that drank his piss is a fucking legend in my book. Now that's a good honest man there. Word is bond  son!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Untrue. I have learned stuff, not tons and I've had to search it out but some of these folks have great insights and analysis into their stocks."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or even that last year's winner was admiralackbar lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Truthfully? It was a mod post. I didnt catch the star wars reference. I didnt check the mods post history. Thought it was a learning experience. I did learn but not the intended lesson only.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have fun with what part? Holding? Easily. My hands have been holding so hard I couldn't let go if I wanted. If it's the banned part then no, not so much fun there. Makes it hard to converse when you cant...well, conversate."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tout*

I wasnt aware that facts were pleas for sympathy...huh. I guess I should just try and stop aging so it isnt inconvenient for folks like you. I promise to do my best.

 As a side note I was never on 4chan or stile project. Icq, aim, facebook until two years ago (fuck Zuckerberg) and I guess xbox live kinda counts. Still, thanks for letting me know I'll be fine, sport. Enjoy your day, champ. Oh, and thanks for the conversation, tiger."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it's a temporary ban just for fun. It's been a tradition around here for years, you'll be back shortly and next year when the paper trading competition post comes up you can make a post explaining how much you enjoyed it this year. Then you can sit back and lol with the rest of us"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. I dont understand the point in banning people who are trying to learn. I'm trying to get up to 25k so I can day trade and I've been delving into stuff. I mean, at least we can still read the DD's but not being able to ask questions is going to hurt."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The rule is to use real money not paper.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's an annual tradition and its April Fools Day... plus, it was just a temp ban. Don't take it so hard. I signed up for it, too and laughed my ass off at the  video posted today.

r/investing is pretty helpful, so is youttube... I watched a 3 1/2 hr video on options trading for beginners a couple weeks ago and the guy explained everything multiple times step by step.  It's a good resource to learn from."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's an annual tradition for the lulz
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The only rule you broke was being too poor to use real money.  Last year's video explains that this sub is not a paper trading subreddit: https://v.redd.it/6ufwu4ugpig41
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,unbanned
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are all banned for good reason. This isn’t a forum for fake trades or teaching anything. This is real high stakes gambling. If you are playing around go somewhere else. This is the get rich or die trying forum and you can’t do that with fake money and fake profits. Can you go to a high stakes poker table in Vegas with Monopoly money? Get your shit together.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too it seems. I'd think they'd want us to get better but I guess banning is a better alternative.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll tell you how I dare! Withing unflinching endless questions about how badly I'm fucking up and not knowing how to fix it! That's how!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to WSB idiot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's hilarious lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s incredibly funny if you knew what was going on. They do it every year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're in the wrong place. This is a Wendy's sir
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you're welcome to leave... or use the greatest informational tool society has ever known and teach yourself...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't say I disagree. I'm honestly quite pissed but it is what it is. I'll find other subreddits to learn more and I'll keep checking the DD here but I'm doing my best not to be an uber dick about it. My username was chosen specifically and has been on many platforms for years now because I have a temper problem. I've gotten much better as I've gotten older but it still wins out sometimes. Regardless, yeah, I'm unhappy as well but I can't do shit about it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because he knew if he said ""4 months"" everyone would realize he's an ape"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He does MAtH lIKe mE 🦍🍌. 1 = 2 = eating crayons.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, some people switch accounts every few months to be anonymous. I’ve got 2 accounts that have followed this subreddit for 1-3 years."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,1 + 2 = 🐠
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a joke they do each year. I missed it the last two so here I go into the deep beyond
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the joke
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause we don't trade no fookin paper
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody tell them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a WSB tradition lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This whole post lit asf feels like the good days of WSB are coming back lmao 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoes mad x3
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re the hero this sub needs and deserves.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah he must have
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at where we are
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have had millions of people leaving comments saying they are retarded and now they're coming here to confirm it.

Guys how hard is it to look at the date?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No he isn't that is the actually mod
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For a minute I started thinking it was someone's grandpa after how long he's been doing these reads for.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Link?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,or the second
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been a lurker until January and even I knew about it. Think I was around for the second one.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">if you don't learned reading

I know we joke about learning impediments here, but some of you really are mid-functioning lobotomy patients."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,*sitting here with Shaq level anticipation*
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[I'm sick of your shit Todd](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oo8CrY_ZfFk)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,His kid is 39 and lost all his money on $TSLA FD’s he’s trying to learn to not lose money 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ain’t everyday your greasy grandpappy visits
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the name was quite endearing.  Love that an old man can have a twisted sense of humor like this.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because you’re new here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First time?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why because he’s old?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when you get a CHAINSAW VESECTOMY
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,DeepFuckingCreepy. I love it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You spelled out sexiest wrong
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what WSB is all about, This is pretty PG compared to other stuff on here. You’ll get used to old men jokes. Cheers kiss kiss
-your bf’s bf’s gf’s bf"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, in the best way possible. If you don't watch this and want to down some whiskey with this retard, then you are no ape sir."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So many downvotes lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a honey pot. Papers traders or others not taking real risks can gtfo of the sub.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For real?? XD i though they were joking? lol. is it so that we dont communicate with previous winners of the competition while trading. will the trading be held in a private r/ channel?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn imagine this guy for a second. No affiliation to WSB whatsoever, reads this every April Fools day because someone pays him to."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad they didn’t this time too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Spy has been on an upward trend tho
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"First: sir this is a Wendy’s 

Second: wsb is and always has been options true but any retarded play is welcome here. The point of this degenerate knuckle dragging moshpit of idiots is to share loss and gain porn and mock each other. 

As long as this sub never starts advocating boring shit like “buy lots of X because fundamentals and hold for like a decade or two” we will be fine.   

For example: if you YOLO everything on a Chinese penny stock you belong here. Even though it’s not an option it’s stupid AF most likely will ruin you and the red will appease the loss porn gods"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And we don’t ""paper trade"". What ever that means. Money is just paper already"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Problem is, the vast majority of people here are only here because of GME. So the vast majority are definitely not options traders. By a long LONG way. At the beginning of 2020 the membership was under 1 million.

Also seems a bit unfair given the boom in the market since march 2020 doubled the size of the sub wayyyy before gme started taking over.  Bit of an ego play by the 10% of the sub that have been around over a year  imho but fair enough if that's the game the old guard retards play I guess people will have to live with it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless it’s gme
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone should be allowed to place bets within their personal risk tolerence
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah!  Douche.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We already are having a competition every day. It’s called loss porn.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah it's a good lesson, just hope I won't be banned from my favorite sub for too long"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,None of these 3 points apply to a paper trading competition tho...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a SPACE STATION!!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,what was the comment you scared him off
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What was the comment?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nowhere did I say anything was wrong with it. Reading is fundamental
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are calling the people who replied to me saying it is true liars?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But reading is, like, so hard. How about you just whisper the rules softly into my ear in a sexy voice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait for Taco Tuesday
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy Retard Day to you also
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You can call it whatever you choose. This boner won’t rub itself
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love this shit, look forward to it every year! FUCKIN GOTTEM!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,FINISH HIM
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Love this haha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No no no, he’s right. Everyone knows that it’s the responsibility of a community that you join, especially when no one asked you to, to assimilate to you and not the other way around."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve only been here for several months but can confidently say that this is the best thing to happen to the sub since I’ve joined
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,so fucking true. couldnt have said it better myself LOL
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"good news, he is probably already in the list"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/zjz is a floppy chode
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That shit is hilarious. Guess who’s wife and wife’s boyfriend are going to get a message on their anniversary from high grandpa?!  This guy ;)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like what, $11?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For real, fuck normie invaders."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,bro imagine if we get the old WSB back and its not just retarded GME memes by a bunch of 15 year olds
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This brings me so much joy every single time it happens lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmaoooo.

I thought you were making that shit up but it's actually true."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol. I'm 5 hours past a 12 hour shift. Took me a minute. lol.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oops...too late.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All this newbie salt is my favorite thing I’ve seen all day tbh. We’ve got, what, 7 million users who weren’t here for the last paper trading contest? It’s what Papa Darwin would want."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did they announce in the GME daily thread? Fuck that would’ve been amazing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No politics #5
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Narrator: He did.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you get banned I’m good
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo this guys a cunt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So what this idiot gets to make this post and get like hundreds of thousands of people ban and he gets to keep his account and not get banned
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you guys own a house?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What'd it say
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sometimes if you want to a be a *real* trader you have to take the *big* risks and go against all common sense and experience and go with your *heart*. Otherwise you might actually make a profit. Anyway, when is the next big political fundraiser happening?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO link that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is too fucking good.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know what they say about the definition of insanity
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait till you hear about u/unclremy69x secret to buying calls with a delta of 2
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually your brain is too smooth and you don’t belong here. Lol.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I played myself, it is what it is."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is what it is, luckily though.. I thought I signed up but apparently I didn't put a post. 

But in general, I know the whole culture on this subreddit and I love it. I just did not expect this lol"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rule is basically “Don’t post hypothetical free brackets, only the brackets u bet (2.5k+) on”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I signed up hoping they’d reveal how to buy calls with a delta of 2 like announcement post hinted at :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You did well this year. Can’t wait to see how you do next year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,good bot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,THANK you for your service <3 I miss the old days where you got shit on for owning shares instead of options
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome. Might I offer you some of our finest FDs? Perhaps a TSLA 4/9 880c. Tesla was recently around 880 and I hear the chance of break even is almost 34%, so it’s practically a coin flip 50%, which, is only 1% away from being a majority, and a majority wins."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🔥 the burn is real 🔥
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't bother commenting here unless you know what you're talking about buddy. Smh so many new people who don't know shit about this sub.

And this fucker trying to pose as a mod too, without even taking the initiation of a 12 inch dildo up the ass? It's utter disrespect of the mods title."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please make the bans permanent
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus if you paper trade call debit spreads, every trade is profit.  paper trading is garbage.  Learn by YOLO'ing everything on 0DTE spy calls."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean 2 million new users is still substantial.. it will never be the same I just don’t think that a large majority of those who joined are frequenting here as much as people think but that’s me you’re obviously entitled to your opinion as well.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"He might be late, but he’s got the right spirit"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Leathered?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you get banned for using the term for selling a call that isn't covered? Why?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Especially with all the retards who think this guy is one of the mods.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does this guy remember you each year?

I assume he's a guy you found on Fiverr or something?

Edit: Or rather, do ""you"" remember this each year? You can blame the dementia if not."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well it takes time to ban 17’000 people and they probably want everyone to get a few last words in as well

Soon come I guess."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I preferred being snapped. Didn't know what to do when they un-blipped me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow this is a blast from the past. Which sub did the snap again?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For what it’s worth, it is annual so you know - next time you can watch and laugh"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's hilarious ngl. Favorite time of the year.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hilariously, my 8 year old account was permanently banned for telling spez he was a coward for banning zjz. Now this account is about to get banned..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mate I'm getting banned too and I think it's fucking hilarious. You really need a sense of humour
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see why you'd think that but it's the culture of the sub. If you take anything on here too seriously (except for maybe some DD) you'll have a bad time.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bans only go up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm so confused. I signed up expecting a later post with rules, but now I'm just seeing a winners post saying participants are ban? Help a smoothbrain out. What's going on?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you too are long GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So wait, if I trade with real money but signed up for this, incoming ban? I am le sad."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Higher CAGR than my latest SPAC investment’s business plan
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bans only go up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn inflation.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It used to be a perma ban lol. You're lucky it's temp.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The mods intentionally created a vague post for the sole purpose of banning people. Apparently this is suppose to be amusing, but it's really not."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what you look like after a few years of options trading.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being this upset about slang changing lmfao

E: “hey quit having fun calling each other apes, it’s NOT fun!” lmao I needed this today. Shouldn’t be surprised someone going to wallstreetbetOGs can’t stand the idea of new people and change."

Hope you still can receive this. Should have stayed lurking. Haha. Guess you'll need a 1 day old account now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Get double fucked. Hope they ban everyone who hasn't posted gains or losses
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"FFFUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK I should have known, and I just joined for the flair because a mod told me I would get one. Guh."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,so... fuck everyone but the very first members? got it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that the same thing as a reach around??
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a hoe and I’m not mad. \#notallhoes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I want my fucking perma ban before I go.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not about taking something personal. I fucking hate April Fools and all the idiots who think their stupid pranks are funny.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but you said to read the rules. Reading the rules doesn’t help if you think that the mods being the ones posting it means it’s ok, and it’s kinda silly to assume people will collectively go “well clearly the mods are breaking the rules and this is a trap”

It’s whatever. I don’t even know what is an isn’t legit in here at this point. I’m not mad, it just seems like a meh prank."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh got it. See ya in 2022 my man
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean it will take roughly 4 hours and 43 minutes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,1 year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Never trust anyone and never let your guard down. People are not your friends. Stick to dogs.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Figured it was just shenanigans.  Didn't think it would be shenanigans at my expense lol.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only trade real money... *looks at account* wait where did it all go, it was just here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I is new but thankfully didn’t sign up. Pls dont ban me.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, what's legendary is that people fall for this every year and it purges all the new accounts who drown out potentially good DD with garbage posts."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Just like last year. And the year before that.

And just like last year's post, the one only 4 spots down in this mod's post history and visible immediately, said."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MODSSS!!!!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if you have drink your own pee?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody tell them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of the mods are young only this one is old, he's guidin' us younguns towards bountiful tendies"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,holy fuck the apes are dumb
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah as the other guy sad unlike the others this mod is a bit old, but he's still young at heart!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a seniority thing. The oldest people in the sub get to moderate. It's sorta like politics.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Never too old to hodl.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Learning on this sub is figuring out what is real and what is meme. You fell for the meme. This exact thing has happened twice in years prior. So now you learn to do some of your own DD and not just rely on a post with a bunch of words on it. IMO this is a nicer lesson than going all in on a ridiculous options play that'll leave you broke.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not a gain until you sell. Get fukd nerd😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"where's my werther's original?  


\> I wasnt aware that facts were pleas for sympathy..   
 you stated your age for a reason, dont play dumb"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I plan on it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There are a million learning resources on the internet. Why you would pick a sub about gambling on options to demand learning is beyond me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You got into the stock market because of GME and now you want to daytrade? You're gonna get fucking wrecked lmao. Don't forget to post your loss porn here.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are other subs like ""investing, daytrading, options, etc."" where you can go to try and learn. Here is where a bunch of degenerates gamble."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not a subreddit for beginners.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a casino. Learn by doing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And it's actually a rule here. Just gets ignored a lot.

"" Paper trades don't count as real trades and are forbidden. Nobody gives a shit about your preschool's trading competition. """
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it weeds out the sensitive ones from the thick skinned apes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nicer to ban you and tell you to figure out what the fuck you're doing than to encourage you to hang around and lose your life's savings in some distributed simian MLM scam
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really tbh. Don't take it personally.

It's a bit like not wanting to have a bunch of kids or teenagers around the grown ups table. Learning is cool and all, but the expectation is you already know the basics here.

And based on some of the ""DD"" that's been getting posted the past few months, it's very clear that the ""grown up"" portion of the sub is getting more and more drowned out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao hoes mad
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol why would we care if you got better?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point is that all the new people on this sub are annoying as fuck, and anyone who’s been around a while knows what the paper trading competition is"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye Felicia
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man, don't listen to that other dude.  It's an april fools joke.  They've done it for 3 years.  Stick around and laugh and next years newbies.  fuck these people that shit on newcomers.  It's a temporary ban."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We want your loss porn and that's it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh it's fucking hilarious bc these reactions are the same each year lol. Mod even hinted in the main post to look at his history, you would have gotten it lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. I hate April Fools and this shit just pisses me off.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stfu pussy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I only signed up because it was the mods hosting it. This is an abuse of moderator privilege's to intentionally mislead people with the intention of banning them.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,To be extra fair.. someone whose been a member of this community that long would be aware of the paper trading competition and not volunteer for it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If he had an alt account then the ban wouldn’t matter and the comment would be null so my point still stands.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i traded paper how the fuck would i know the GUH feels like? I wouldn't. 

like kids describing boobies with sandwich bags full of mom's boyfriend's bullchuck."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I just lurk and I know what’s goin on. These are hilarious every time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yessss what a good way to weed out the newfs.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I look forward to a year from now when one of us comes back for ""or the third."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah lol. A lot of Retards think *this* is the prank.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this grandpa is a very old poster here, but I think he’s an actor hired by the mod for shits and giggles."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, first day on the internet? Crazy, we don't get to see that all too often!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It not OP its oldmansteve from fiver
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're too pure for this world. There wasn't a competition. Never has been. Mods do this every year and temp ban anyone who comments on the post as a joke.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No paper, just ban loool"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is exactly why"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,ohhhhhhhhh i fucking get it now. i am so retarded. hahahahah gg mods!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry, it's only a two year ban.  You'll be back making tendies in no time.  Just consider it a time out for being a paper-handed bitch."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahahah you stupid bastard thank you so much!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,dawg it was under one million members 2 and 1/2 months ago. This shit went from 800k members to 8 million in one week after gme squeeze
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Especially GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you have been holding a company for 4 months then you should be in r/investing rather than r/wallstreetbets
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"and your personal risk tolerance should involve at least 100x leverage over the underlying

goddamn the minimum loss porn you could post used to be like $50k this place has gotten so pathetic its unbelievable"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No but I wanna see a bunch of people start at the same time with the same amount. Not random posts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's about a year long, so I've heard. Just in time for the next crazy scheme!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point is more about trading on WSB in general. A bunch of folks hopped on board thinking it was something free and easy, and got slapped on the ass for it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you read rule 8 on this sub sidebar?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something along the lines of ""Mods temp banning people? Not suspicious at all..."""

*Don't paper trade on WSB.*"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen very closely:  CHORTLE MY DONGUS!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this was a much needed competition. I stepped away from the sub for a bit because of all the dumb questions. Don't join this sub if you don't even know what an option is..."

Edit: that and the gourds, and the dude asking if there was a refund for trading stocks."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey now, we were all new at some point. Even I got banned for asking stupid questions back in the day. It’s up to us, and the community to help assimilate or haze new users into functioning WSBers."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you still are getting banned. The ""competition"" just gets exposed today."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm one of the dumbasses that walked into the impending ban and even I'm enjoying the salt. Its weird how some people get so butthurt over an inconvenience they brought on themselves.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't say anything remotely political
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re making a mountain out of a mole hill. It’s a running joke at this point. Also, it’s a temp ban.
But even if it wasn’t, just make another fuckin account man.

I have 3-4 (and a porn account of course) ready to go for when I inevitably get banned somewhere. 

I honestly just don’t get why you care so much"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yassssss
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Updated the comment with correction and 2 other cases I found of users almost realizing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have to go dig through my mod logs to find it, I remember removing it, give me a few"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can still get enough fun from the sub just watching. Looking forward to coming back in 2022 lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So you know the culture but you still signed up to get banned? Lol shhhh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy a call contract with a delta of 1 and then buy a second one retard
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Unclothed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean grandpa chainsaw vyesectomy?? That’s absolutely him and no one will ever convince me otherwise
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you talking about that's chainsaw vasectomy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh true... I'm sure ppl are happy about banning noobs but to be honest the noobs that are being banned are the ones who are actually trying to participate... Ban the other 9mil noobs who aren't lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"thanosdidnothingwrong or something like that, IIRC"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would prefer if they double down
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent timing
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think liars are funny.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah. It's not funny for the mods to abuse their positions and mislead people to intentionally ban them. It's just mean and I've lost all respect for this sub. Even if I hadn't signed up I'd still think this was a shitty move.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And your pp
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"it is a yearly tradition to have a ""paper trading competition"" and ban everyone who signs up"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally don't know what paper trading is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, well I deserve the incoming ban. Signed up just to see how the hell you run a paper trading competition via reddit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was the first rule i noticed like months back, then it happens to be scheduled for April 1st.

Wasn't sure what was going to happen,  but expected something. Glad i wasn't disappointed. 

WSB, stay you. Most fun I've had in years."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Its ceartinly taught me not to trust the mods.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha get banned.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah it's pretty funny. The mods here have a long history of trolling.

If you want a wholesome takeaway, look at it this way: If you're gullible enough to fall for a WSB paper trading competition, you're gullible enough to fall for a pump and dump scam. Learn the lesson from harmless mod trolling instead of from losing money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy your ban newb
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine actually signing up for a paper-trading competition lmao.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Found the butt hurt one that needs to be permabanned.

You don't belong here."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong dick

Yeah, please leave."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've started reading r/stocks a lot more since it's less about GME but also not very serious
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$1400 to $156k screen shot, damn you just slapped that dude in the face with your dick."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What did aunty Karen want?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol well you may not be taking it personal but it does indeed sound like a personal problem to me that you might should take personally. Only to get better.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buddy I'm saying that's the point. It's good that you doubt what is and isn't legit now, because a staggering amount of shit in here (and all over, frankly) is not, either because people act more knowledgeable than they are or because they want your money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Roughly, yes"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. Am I allowed to lurk or is it a post ban?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We only lose real money here we’re not a bunch of cucks

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I been here since summer 2020 tho....

Edit: I still support banning my retarded ass tho"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not amused. I browse this sub during my downtime for the occasional DD and don't have the tolerance for the mods intentionally lying for the sole purpose of banning people who didn't do a deep dive into their post history.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And away from paper trading newbies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes he is. This dude is cooler than everyone I know in real life
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf are you even talking about? Your comment has zero to do with anything I said lol.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In my pocket. Just reach in and get it. Careful you don't grab my Riesens though! I don't share them. They're my favorites.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know goddamn well why they pick this sub


Gme, the best thing to happen to OG wsb users and the worst thing to happen to wsb sub"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I'm poor so day trading is something to work towards. Learning along the way. I'm not quite halfway to the cash part and I'm roughly a quarter of the way on the required knowledge. For clarity though, I was aware the stock market existed before gamestop. I wasnt aware I could personally trade and was under the impression that was still some through brokerage firms.  I've learned quite a bit already but I'm just smart enough to know I need to learn more before I make myself homeless. So, if the time for loss porn comes and I'm not banned and I've made enough money to actually do that I'll gladly post my shame. Until then, here I am."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a false comparison when it comes to learning. I do get what you mean but that's a bad way to say it. ""We learn by doing"" has always been a horrible teaching method to all but a specific type of person who does learn best in that manner. Still, why makes knowledge something locked behind a door? It should flow like water."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao for real had to weed them out. 
Some people aren’t even aware of the basics and haven’t educated themselves."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been reading some. It seems difficult to find much of anything besides GME. It's where I'm currently situated but that seems to be the current strongest play. I do want to expand from here though.

I'd be nicer in my mind to get rid of the bots tbh. I get your analogy of the kids table but personally dont agree with the mentality even if I do understand where it's coming from."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The username and flair would imply that this emotional state would be a constant for me...so both yes and no.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly. The floor is made of floor. Now we've shared obvious information with eachother.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then leave WSB instead of complaining or learn the culture of the sub.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your report. We take these reports very seriously. After a painstaking investigation, myself and my team have found no evidence of moderator abuse. Thank you for reaching out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you just whining throughout this entire thread? You aren't welcome here so you're getting banned. You can't take a joke at your own expense and you came to this sub for reasons opposed to the spirit of the sub.

You're exactly the kind of person this is intended to get rid of."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"guh

welcome to wsb"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you get perma banned :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You're obviously new here. The abusive mods are part of WSB's pizzazz.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've only been a member here since January and I thought paper-trading competition sounded sketch. I wasn't thinking April Fools Joke, don't know what I was thinking, but sketchy fo sho."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit itself would issue ban for circumventing initial ban if the accounts are connected.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just new enough to get caught up in the first one, but the mods were chill enough to let me back in much later on. I had to ask though lmao"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The massive influx of new users recently is really showing in this thread.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Common sense

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This comment is low key adorable
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was always done to enforce positions or ban rule as this exposed kids who can't gamble.

This time they extended it to GMEtards."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u seem cool lol. see u soon!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hold shares so I can cash premiums on new retards
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds like a long bet
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it technically would be. There's no guarantee that a stock will make you money if you buy shares in it. It's like comparing someone who only bets on red or black on a roulette table to someone who puts all their money on one number. One bet has a higher guarantee to net income with patience, but the ceiling for earnings is infinitely higher if you land a max bet on double zeroes. Anyways, I just opened up a tasty banana. Ape out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not you, bro.  I'm talking about that other guy who doesn't trade options the same way you do but still wants to enjoy the WSB community.  What an asshole."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"damn I feel so dumb for this, but oh well. See you guys next year hopefully I'll have more money to use after the GME saga"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When is their bam effective from or are they already?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're referring to number 7

""Paper trades don't count as real trades and are forbidden. Nobody gives a shit about your preschool's trading competition. ""

&#x200B;

Real edgy rule. Yet half of the gain (and loss\*) porn that's posted here is probably from a paper portfolio."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I know. I can’t believe that guy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I see you can backpedal when it’s called for
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. That made me squirt

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being new isn't the issue. Being new and changing the culture is.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am old with bad memory.  Will prob fall for it next year too.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, for a ""community"" to do this...that's impressive. So much for apes strong together huh?

Edit: fuck me then. Forget the apes thing that apparently so many of you hate. I may be new but I came to learn. Some of you are just straight up assholes though. Quite disheartening to be honest. When I know something others dont I enjoy teaching them. Not everyone is like that clearly but to see some folks so dead set on the whole ""sink or swim"" and ""lmao get ban"" is just crummy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not amused by the mods lying for the purpose of banning people. It has nothing to do with being gullible.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but what did we actually 'fall' for....there was nothing to fall for...ppl were saying 'we need a paper trading comp.' for months and then mods said to sign up...why read anything beyond that...theres no money involved

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a new paid team called **Anti-Evil Operations** which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Some are bad and some are sad.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't appreciate being threatened with a temporary ban over a prank. Either the mods can perma ban me or stop wasting my fucking time with their April Fools bullshit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re confused or I’m not doing a good job explaining. 

I already don’t trust anyone here, except I do trust that the mods aren’t just gonna lie arbitrarily (especially considering how dope zjz is and how much we all praise him)

So it’s just...teaching people that not even mods are trustworthy? Which if that’s the point then ok, just isn’t that funny of a prank imo. I’m glad others are enjoying it though."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean all they can do is ban your account. So if you log out and go to the sub you can see it all.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't have the *tolerance* for? That's funny. Especially coming from someone who very clearly wasn't supposed to be here in the first place. If you just want the Bloomberg Terminal part of ""If 4chan found a Bloomberg Terminal"", try /r/investing or /r/options or something.

And a ""deep dive""? You mean even bothering look at? Even though you must have noticed how fucking fishy it was?

Jeez dude. It wasn't for no reason. It's to filter out shit like this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re one of the GMEanon apes. You know exactly what I’m talking about. 🦍r fuk
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, serious talk. If you are poor then do not day trade. I know you have seen the massive gains posted from GME but that is not normal and it is definitely not easy. If you made money off of GME then realize that you got lucky. If you're still holding GME then do some reading of your own, try to rationalise what price is realistic for GME and then make a decision on if you want to keep it or not. Do not get caught up in the hype here, you will get burnt badly.

If you don't want to be poor anymore then jumping straight into day trading 2 months after learning that you are even allowed to trade at the stock market is not it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you're in the wrong sub if you think this is a classroom. we're not here to help you win. we want to see your loss porn, not your comments about holding 2.6 shares of GME on RH and 'wHeRe CaN i BuY iV CrUsH, GuYs'. swing for the fences, retard."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The knowledge is all out there. If you lurk and use google, you will learn over time.

You’re wrong about calling what i said a false comparison. Just like a doctor can only learn so much before working with patients, you can only learn so much without having money on the table."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then go to a school to learn?

You're demanding the *real* casino let you play for no stakes in order to learn. There are other places to learn, you're welcome to go there."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have no *desire* to educate themselves, either"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I've been reading some. It seems difficult to find much of anything besides GME.

Which is exactly why the sub needed to be culled of all the new people."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The paper trading tradition started with the intent of filtering *literal* children out of the subreddit. It's not an analogy. It is illegal for minors to trade stocks, hence why they are banned annually."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't become a special Olympic athlete just by playing the sport once.  And if you show up somehow, pretty sure the Olympic athletes that busted their asses to get where they are would be salty and pretty gay about it.

So, mods are gay.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the whole GME thing made this sub blow up, I'd say less than 10% of users here have seen this before. Going by the comments that seems about right, 90% of them are confused as hell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir r/thetagang is that way 👉🏻.

Jk luv u bb."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really the same. Shares never expire, sure you lose a percentage but if in 10 years the price of the stock goes up so does the share price. Options is really playing roulette. Not only do you have to be right about the company but time is against you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP WSB
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that you’re making a decision after researching and weighing options based on a given information makes it not betting, but investing. There’s more to the decision and the action you’re taking when investing than mere luck. It’s really how you see it, that helps in how it appeals to you and, hence how you approach it. Even if there’s probability and statistics involved with both, the information on the statistics of investing far outweighs that given of a roulette game in that it’s more realistic and reliable. Also, you can become better and better at your decision making with investing than you can with playing roulette."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol right?

Happy sidelining!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just use another account duh.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you get a notification. There's a lot of folks to go through this time around, so it could even take days."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I meant 7. There's nothing edgy about it, people used to post their million dollar paper trades 100x a day, it was a pain in the ass. At this point wsb vets most of the paper shit out."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I didn’t even know you were suppose to not have a brokerage account to enter. I don’t read I just saw competition and I immediately thought, if I can win I can get a flair."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There have been two mod coups in the past year over exploiting members for money and the FOUNDER was complicit and removed by reddit Admins. Trust people like zjz on their past actions (like comment history) not on their status. The dude who made this competition has done it before.

Also, you could call it a prank but the intent isn't really to be funny, it's to make this exact point and they usually do it after a huge surge in new members. Also, the bans are real."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh ok
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's called lying and I'm not amused.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I do now because of the ape reference. Let me clue you in though...I'm here to make money and enjoy the community. One of those things are occurring at present.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, you aren't wrong but I'm doing what I must along the way. I wont do it without understanding how it works. I'm not a complete idiot. Just a standard half idiot. So I'm aware enough. I appreciate the advice and wish you well."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's no problem for me to go and find information elsewhere. WSB certainlydoesnt corner the market on knowledge but it's sad to lose a resource. I simply pointed out what he said is incorrect. You are also incorrect. You keep claiming this is learning in a casino when it isnt. There are plenty of things to learn without money on the table (which I have btw). Read my other stuff if you want I'm not re-typing why you are also wrong.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they were not temp banned, the bans were not revoked (until the jartek saga when all bans were revoked)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which I understand. I'm not physically a child though, mentally...here and there. Physically I'm 36. Like I said. Trying to learn. It is what it is at this point. I'll keep my downvotes and whatnot."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unironically comparing wsb retards to any elite organization - let alone Olympic athletes - is deserving of its own ban, tbh."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re *that* good.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great lesson to learn! On the internet, *people lie sometimes*. This is a great thing to keep in mind *while your money is on the line*. Next time, you can research a user's history *or the rules* to help guide your decision-making."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the mods don't think breaking the rules is funny? Read the fucking rules dog it's the first thing you should do on any sub you're in.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did someone hurt your feelings on the internet? :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is accurate.

You need to be a significant issue for any of us to report site wide ban evasion to admins on /army.  Plenty of people ban evade and if youre following the rules, I'm probably ignoring your alt.

A few years back, i felt like a manual report was needed for any ban evader, at all.  Even ones that were like 'fuckmods1, fuckmods2, fuckmods3, etc'.  They're way more automated now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been banned from the conservative sub on dozens of alt accounts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"First ones free


Every single other one gets taxed"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But, but...what if die before stock go up in ten year and never make money? Then lose ""bet""?

I'm half joking. That's honestly the only way I was able to figure that one ""loses"" holding shares when I originally wrote my comment. Lmao. I do agree with the sentiment that holding stock isn't really much of a bet. Think it'd be different when factoring in day trading?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn’t a new thing mate.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if you fall asleep on the sofa with ne afterwards.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So much for saying he won't divide us
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t be sorry. Cheer up lil guy!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calling an ideology gobbledy-gurk is just baiting some one into a political response by insulting some one's political stance. It's like making fun of Christians and expecting to not get a religious response.

Imo making backhanded comments about politics is political bullshit or at the very least encouraging political bullshit"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it when the trash takes itself out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wear it with pride.. you’re now initiated
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm equally suprised and amused by that as well.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, it'll be what it will be. Most of this hasn't been tantrum but I was definitely not always polite but I wouldn't say temper tantrum. I'd say passive aggressive sarcasm with honest dialogue here and there would be a more apt description. Not as catchy, but closer to correct."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Doubtful. I'm too old for these kinds of games tbh. I tried to join what I thought was a learning opportunity only to be mocked for it. Thanks for replying to me though. Good luck with everything on your end.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude almost every sub has rules that they sometimes break... Normally with a once-a-week thread or something that says 'OK, you can post memes or whatever is against the rules'. Ppl acting like 'we don't trade paper here' is written all over the sub. Lol I've been coming here off and on for like 4yrs and just figured you don't post gain/loss posts of paper-trading bc that would be dumb as hell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes someone is sensitive
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"see screenshots above, stupid little bitch"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Call me retarded, it fuels me"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I need people like you stay using WSB and not let the new PC cucks overpower everyone
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All I'm saying is that's the way the winds blowing. You do you boo boo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I did speak for myself you illiterate ape
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do trust zjz based on his actions. 

I guess I’m just not explaining it well, idk. I can say it legitimately never crossed my mind that zjz would be lying, specifically because of how he’s acted in the past. Dude very clearly loves the sub.

Oh well. Been lurking for a couple years and posting for like 6 months-ish. I caught on quick with the culture but it is what it is. I’m sure there will be a couple people who will be glad I’m not around and it won’t matter to literally anyone else. 🍻"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can tell. Good thing you don't have to put up with the lying anymore. 

See? This is good, now we're both better off!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then GTFO this sub.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you had to do was read the competition post. It was obvious. ""Learn about the double ratio, the short e-snappin, 
>Time-inverse options, head and shoulders, the paper trap, the single box rammer, and of course, the naked tied-up straddle!

Come on bro!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your reasoning behind holding GME? If you can't explain it then you are not ready for the stock market and you are definitely not ready for options or day trading
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSB isn’t about ‘learning’ the casino...it IS the fucking casino filled with degenerates.

It never was, and never will be about teaching young guns the way.

Go learn, and come back when you’re willing to YOLO into FD’s on a tickr because your mum saw a delivery driver who reminded her of a an old work colleague who railed her behind a dumpster, and his name sounds like the company."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"so lurk more 

the whole point is people who can't contribute need to lurk until they figure things out and can make worthwhile posts"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, the good news is that the ban is temporary, and you won't repeat this mistake again when they hold paper trading signups in the future :P

Others have said it too, but just to reiterate: if you're earnest in trying to learn how the stock market works: **this is the wrong subreddit for that.** There are plenty of other communities to participate in if thats your goal.

(side note: paper trading is a violation of the [content guidelines](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/wiki/contentguide) outlined in Rule 1)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You can also learn while losing real money like the rest of us did instead of being a little bitch.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crying, like you are doing, deserves its own ban.  Then again, this post was made for you.  Tbh.

Also, thank you.  Correcting to special Olympics."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly the best prank I've seen so far today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, your legal name isn't Chainsaw Vasectomy? 

Someone lied to me! ON THE INTERNET!!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally reading your history was why I was like....hmmm. ima watch this from ova here.  *Eats popcorn*
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My money is fine, but I'm not interested in playing fucking mind games with you. Go ahead and prema ban me because I'm not coming back to this sub. I didn't spend time building my karma to post so I could be temporary banned by a liar for a stupid prank."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to report a user to the admins for ban circumvention manually
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure it was an automated ban, as I was IP banned from the subreddit after commenting. Didn’t even realize it was a thing lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How would you know if someone is ban evading though? Can you see accounts connected on the same IP or something?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can argue the definition of a bet all you like.  


To be a ""wall street"" bet it must first be retarded. Holding stock will never be as retarded as options."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you day traded options and stocks before? Dude with a share if you call it wrong and the share goes down then up to the same spot you bought at you break even. With call options the stock goes down then up depending on how severe the dip was you will lose money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll cuddle with you when he’s done, no worries."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,bro i hope you’ll be ok
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay? Why are you complaining about breaking the rules. They can enforce rules however they want

Edit: I was just trying to make you see that everyone that is getting banned absolutely could have not fallen for it, so it’s a pretty good prank."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye bye ape
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gottem
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just wondering, when did you join the sub?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,With a username like that you probably are bothered by a lot of things. No one gives a fuck if you are scared of a word buddy lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have a nice fueled day, retard."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How dare you call me an ape. I hunt apes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you don't come away from this thinking it means the mods don't care, because it's the opposite. They would rather you feel this betrayal about something that doesn't matter rather than also losing your portfolio."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I'm still around I might do it again. I'm clearly not very bright.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we make this an automod response?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you don't understand what an April fools prank is or what?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is the most butt hurt I’ve seen someone get on the internet

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,https://imgur.com/gallery/mKKbpin
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It probably was.  It's beena  thing for a while, but they were honestly terrible about manual requests, and now it's heavily automated.  It doesn't allow me to let someone learn their lesson tho.  So there's pros and cons."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because if I ban you and an hour later a new acc that’s an hour old called zxc370 shows up saying the same thing, I can make a reasonable assumption.

Sometimes there’s more to it, but it can be relatively easy to ID a BE.

Admins (Reddit site), yes, can see IPs."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes they can see what IP addresses the account sign-in came from.  Pretty much all websites track that.  It just sucks for anyone sharing a network and using the same public IP, if they're posting on the same subreddits.  


Your IP address is pretty much your most public information when browsing the web."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, I've been wanting to get in on options since I joined the sub during the GME wave. Any brokers good for it in particular? I'm on Fidelity, but I've heard of people getting the runaround when applying for options trading on there."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I haven't lol. It was a genuine question. I actually just asked the other commenter for recs on brokers to trade options. Got any for me/good resources to get started outside of WSB? Shit sounds retardedly fun. I'm on Fidelity rn but not sure if I should stick with them for options."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I've already scheduled an appt with my cardiologist for the heartbreak. I'd let you know if it was terminal or not but I'll be banned. Wish me luck.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not complaining about anything nor did I break any rules. Get fucked and stop being a pretentious twat. You're the kind of cuck who goes around arguing with ppl downvotinf their comments what a sad loser.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not an ape I'm a human. Bye bye.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See this guy gets it 🍻
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like November I think? Not sure. Lurked here for a few years and then subbed before the GME stuff went insane

E: guess this response didn’t go like you planned then."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Don't need people clutching their pearls too hard here..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah he gave proof so the retard can talk as much shit as he wants freely
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally said it doesn't bother me. I deal with retards like you on a daily basis.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck yes, thanks retard"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"🤷‍♂️

Idk what else I would feel. This is one of my favorite subs, and I’m gonna get banned for trusting that the single most trustworthy mod here, the one who has gone so far above and beyond for this place and it’s users that I couldn’t appropriately emphasize it if I tried. 

So, yeah, I feel as “betrayed” as someone could possibly feel over a subreddit ban (which is probably like 1%). It’s not a big deal and I’m not gonna cry about it, but it’s not like it doesn’t suck. I wasn’t gonna lose my portfolio thanks to this place anyway because I already didn’t trust DD that wasn’t well sourced and had solid references. I even called out bad DD and stolen DD. But I signed up for the contest because it looked like fun so it is what it is. 

Like I said, it’s just not really a funny prank for me since I’m the target. Im still not even sure I’m gonna get banned because I don’t trust anyone saying I will or won’t. Nothing personal."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"See now you are getting it. Most of the people on here are not very bright and just parrot shit they hear. If you do want to learn there is a wealth of information here but if you ask for handouts without any effort or homework on your part you will probably be harassed. Maybe sort by top posts and ignore all memes and videos and you may find something useful. Or try the investing Reddit. Try and look at an option you’re interested in, or any, and research all the metrics listed."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good. Now you can stay...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Again mods have to manually report that to admins. Then the admins shadowban your IP. So you’re still wrong. All you sent was the notification you get when you’re banned.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I suppose it's harder to see on bigger subs like here. Especially with the crazy amount of acitivty.

Also is it not easy to circumvent the IP ban? You can just reset the IP"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I learned by using YouTube, WSB, and paying the traders tuition. If you don’t have a decent paying job or the capital don’t do it. If your strategy is just HODL you will lose it all. Like literally your account will actually hit $0."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodl on for dear life
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It is a loss when you sell. I got stock in the past they went down 50% and the year after I recover the loss and made some earning too. It wouldnt have happened if I sold from the panic so dont listen people comments. We believe in BB and it will be back after the turmoil. I bought YI at the IPO at $16 went down to $5 months later and after 1 year went to $40 ... now back to $13-14 but I sold when up at the peak.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please use this as a lesson to set stop losses, there’s no reason to watch a stock go down 50% and not sell any shares while it’s steadily declining from $16. I’m sorry these type of posts are embarrassing at this point"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the end of the world will happen before BB ever breaks 10
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You also seem to forget that they bombed on earnings and will probably need a few quarters to see real growth. Next quarter there will be even more pressure to beat.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,*your biggest investing regret so far.*
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please head to r/investing if you feel uncomfortable.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been investing in BB since 2010 - long before WSB. Everything in there right now is profit, and I'm long with the investment, so trying to time the dips is pointless. There is massive value in the direction BB is headed and I believe it'll see big gains by EOY."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree. For some reason people have this fascination / blind hope that every stock talked about in WSB will be a GME and ignore the fact that there are no drivers to support that. They end up losing thousands for no reason.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry you dont belong here... pack your bags and fuck off
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It is a lesson. To be fair I didn’t even know about stop losses. I’m already down the 50% so I figured I’m gonna stick with it now.

Let this POS's sentiment be a lesson for you. If you believe in a stock, take a long position and if you can weather the dips, do it. I've lost money many times trying to time the dips, and I can tell you it rarely works out. Do your research and find companies you believe have real value (not just meme stocks) and then hold.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This wasn't one purchase. A lot of WSB people went in on BB without understanding that this is a real stock and isn't a short play. I posted my losses to show that I'm in it with them, and I'm holding because taking losses on a valuable investment because you're scared is moronic. 

If you can't afford to hold, don't. If you can, do some reading about the future of BB and take some comfort in knowing they're going to be a huge player in a huge market and people like me (and others who are down a LOT more) are still holding."

2021-04-01 19:37:10,wallstreetbets,"Been watching NNDM for the past 6 months or so after heavy DD, and the recent earnings was the green light for me. Here's my DD and summary of NNDM (long) This is a summary of everything you need to know about NNDM that also includes DD. I wrote the first half of this DD a few months ago and decided to wait until next earnings for more updated information. The most recent earnings was a green light for me.

**FUNDAMENTALS:**

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNDM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=NNDM&ty=c&ta=1&p=d)

[https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNDM/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NNDM/)

Looking at these, Nano Dimension (NNDM) has a few pretty bad ratios and statistics. However the position that the company is currently in seems to have incredible value if they can be successful with the Dragonfly. Buckle up cause this is my first full-fledged DD. Would love hearing counter arguments or opinions.

**COMPETITION:**

\- Stratasys (SSYS)

\- 3D Systems Corp. (DDD)

\- Proto Labs Inc (PRLB)

\- The ExOne Co. (XONE)

Except guess what? None of these companies are actual competitors because they can’t 3D print electronics. There's more competitors [on this page](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/NNDM/competitors-and-alternatives/) I'm still researching, but none of them seem to offer additive manufacturing for ELECTRONICS like NNDM does, so none of them are actual competitors. Subsequently, Direct Competitors in Additively Manufactured Electronics:

Primary Competition:

\- Botfactory (Private)

Others:

\- NovaCentrix (Private)

\- nScrypt (Private)

\- IDTechEx (Private)

\- Electroninks (Private)

**COMPANY OVERVIEW:**

Good Slideshow summary here:[https://s23.q4cdn.com/747906804/files/doc\_presentations/2021/2021-1-25-NNDM\_Corporate\_Presentation.pdf](https://s23.q4cdn.com/747906804/files/doc_presentations/2021/2021-1-25-NNDM_Corporate_Presentation.pdf)

*""Nano Dimension ($NNDM) is a provider of intelligent machines for the fabrication of Additively Manufactured Electronics. Nano Dimension bridges the gap between printed circuit boards, and semiconductor integrated circuits.""*

*""In late 2015, the company unveiled the Dragonfly, which it claims is the first desktop 3D printer designed to produce multilayer printed circuit boards (PCBs). Nano added that this innovation was, “new to the printed electronics design and manufacturing industry. They claimed that older methods had too many phases, were labor-intensive and wasted a lot of time and materials. This forced companies to outsource prototypes rather than produce them in-house during the development phase. PCBs are boards that hold silicon chips (i.e. semiconductors) and enable them to be connected. Further, they are now used in virtually all but the most primitive commercially produced electronics.""*

**PRODUCT OFFERINGS:** (as of 3/11/21)

Dragonfly:

\- Generation 1: Dragonfly 3D Printer (2015)

\- Generation 2: Dragonfly Pro (2018)

\- Generation 3: Dragonfly LDM (July 2019)

\- Generation 4: (2021/ early 2022)

NaNos 3D Fabrication Service (New)

With the current generation, the Dragonfly LDM, companies can *""reduce demand on prototyping and short-run manufacturing resources which lowers the cost of operation in comparison to traditional methods. The Dragonfly LDM is patented and has new proprietary technology that enables 24/7 uninterrupted 3D printing, the industries only comprehensive platform for round-the-clock 3D printing of electronic circuitry.""*

Keeping the entire development process securely in house is more important now than ever, as China has continually been accused of intellectual property theft, with a staggering 1 in 5 companies saying China has stolen their intellectual property within the last year. According to the United States Trade Representative Report (2017), Chinese theft of American IP costs American companies between $225 billion - $660 billion annually. Which exemplifies the growing importance for US companies to keep their intellectual property and development process in house and secure.

*""Electronic circuitry is traditionally developed through a back and forth process involving lots of trial & error and third-party manufacturer outsourcing. The industry’s largest hurdle has been being unable to offer a solution for the electronics market, primarily because of the difficulty in printing multiple layers of electrically conductive, dielectric materials at a resolution high enough to support professional electronics.""* That is until Nano Dimension was the first to develop an integrated solution for additive manufacturing of electronics, hence why I couldn’t find any competitors. What Nano Dimension's doing with the Dragonfly is disruptive to the PCB industry.

**ADDRESSING THE MANY DIRECT OFFERINGS:**

Although the company has used many direct offerings to raise money, \[then\] CEO Yaov Stern stated that they now have $990 Million of cash reserves (2/2/2021). This will allow NNDM to recover quickly from the halt in sales and is a primer for the huge growth stage that they are going to experience in the coming year and beyond. NNDM is also using the cash reserves for a huge acceleration in R&D, and also for acquisitions of new technologies that they plan on incorporating into new Dragonfly models. Stern says they are looking at 3 or 4 Israeli companies, 3 or 4 European countries, and 4 or 5 US companies (3/11/21). He also mentions that the drastic increase of SPACs in the United States causes many companies to be overvalued. Which as far as I can tell, means he wants to acquire the companies before they go public (in the US at least). In regard to those SPACs:

*“I’m very careful of being pulled into this rat race of paying too much. It’s a rat race. Even if you win you’re still a rat.”*

One goal with NNDM’s heavy investment in R&D is to improve machine consistency and support ink types other than silver, which can be expensive. They have been gaining progress on this front but I would still consider it one of their current challenges.

**REVENUE AND SALES:**

Determining an actual target price seems to be impossible due to negative EPS. However NNDM is in an early stage of commercial production with a razor & blade model, so this is acceptable for now. The growth during this stage has also stagnated due to COVID-19, and despite 2020 revenue being half that of 2019, it’s still quite surprising because of the incredibly low sales volume from 2020 during the pandemic. Which means customers are indeed using consumables for the Dragonfly, and the razor/razorblade business model is proving to be quite effective.

Stern also notes that as of 3/11, 70% of their customers have upgraded to the newest generation of the Dragonfly (compared to the prior version that came out in 2018). Stern is also confident that with all the new applications coming in that are military and industrial spec, once the materials are available post Covid, revenue will skyrocket. All of this along with the business model proving to be at the very least acceptable, if not incredibly effective, seems promising.

(3/11/21) 4 levels of revenue:

1. Dragonfly Sales
2. Consumables (Only NNDM can offer the ink, hence Razor & Blade model)
3. Selling maintenance contracts annually (After 1-year warranty)
4. The newly implemented NaNos (Nano Services), which according to Stern is quickly growing

**NEW PRODUCTS:**

As mentioned, NNDM is now offering Nano Services (NaNos). Those who don’t buy the machine because they are waiting for the budget to be released can use the software to prototype their products, and NNDM will print it for them using in house machines, to which those companies will only pay per round of prototyping rather than paying for a whole machine which they currently cannot afford. These customers stay in contact with NNDM and by the time we’re out of Covid and those customers have a more flexible budget, they will already be familiar with the software and it will have a slingshot effect on future sales.

NNDM is also planning to release the new generation of the dragonfly in mid-2021, which is currently in the middle of alpha stage development. They’re hoping to release it mid 2021 or once the pandemic is officially over.

*“The machines we have now are for prototyping and proof of concept. The new system is going to be getting into early stages of production. Even existing machines are currently being used in the production stage by some customers, specifically in defense.”* The new machines provide a heighted Z-axis, which allows for multilayered *circuit cubes* rather than one giant sheet of circuits.

*""This is the only technology in the world that can take a digital file and 3D-print a high-performance electronic part.""* That is, a 3D printed circuit board with upwards of 20 or 30 layers. (Each layer being a micro and a half). Normal circuit boards can become incredibly expensive the more layers they have. Whereas a 3D printer doesn’t charge you extra for multiple layers because it doesn’t know if you’re printing 2 layers or 30 layers, it just needs the material.

In addition: *“Our machine, unlike the standard PCB industry that’s full of non-reusable materials, is going to be environmentally friendly”* (reusable ink cartridges).

**ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS:**

*“I also think it’s worth keeping in mind that Nano could make printers that can create other computer parts given that it appears to have successfully created a 3D printer that can manufacture PCBs. Eventually, it’s possible that Nano could make 3D printers that could make semiconductors themselves.""*

*""In a world that’s suffering from a shortage of semiconductors, I have to believe that such a product would generate widespread demand. Given the Internet of Things trend, not to mention the recent strength of PC sales, there should be strong demand for Nano’s current printers that can already, according to the firm, make many computer parts.”*

About mid-way in the call, Stern was asked if NNDM might expand its market / business model. His answer was very interesting. He said that their mainstay business was 3D printing of electrical components for the high-end market (sophisticated and very small components) - but that they also are looking a nano-scale mechanical component printing - so not just the printing of parts with electrical components, but also moving components. ( I could see this as being a profound application in insertable medical devices and in military / civilian applications that require precise moving parts in an exceptionally small space).

*""He also clarified what many people here frequently misrepresent - microprocessors. NNDM can produce multilayer boards upon which many other components are stacked - such as microprocessors, capacitors, resistors, etc - so Dragonflies are very useful for designing and producing very complicated PCBs which can be the base upon which many other electronic components can be attached / stacked.""*

When describing the next generation Dragonfly that's coming this summer, Stern said that the company had greatly improved the software design by making it far more user-friendly, especially for complicated component designs.

*""He also said that the new printers will have the ability to add components. (I frankly did not fully understand this point, but my best guess is that it means that while a Dragonfly is printing a PCB, it would have the mechanical ability to add / insert a previously made component such as a resistor). I see that as being the first step to a ""lights out"" manufacturing process - where the human walks away from the machine and it produces not only a PCB, but also has added other subcomponents onto the board as it was printed, obviating the need for follow-on steps where a human or robot attaches components to the circuit board.”*

**POSSIBLE CONCERNS:**

**Concern 1:** *“In the 12 months that ended in September 2020, Nano’s top line came in at just $3.4 million. In 2019, it reported sales of $7.07 million. Those low numbers indicate that its printers have yet to achieve widespread industry acceptance.”*

**My opinion**: 1, The low sales from 2020 is primarily from the halt in demand due COVID according to Stern. And 2, the Dragonfly LDM was a very new product in 2019, so it didn’t really have time to gain an industry wide acceptance. In addition, these are all still very early models of what they hope to turn the Dragonfly into, as Stern explains in the 3/11 earnings interview. Just selling these early models was never the goal, and their heavy investment in R&D supports this. Along with Stern's ultimate goal for the Dragonfly being production level manufacturing (Current generation is meant for prototyping and proof of concept. The next generation will start getting into first rounds of production).

**Concern 2:** *“Although the company in December reported that some U.S. government agencies and European research and electronic manufacturing organizations had upgraded their Dragonfly printers, it did not identify any of these customers by name. It also did not disclose the revenue it had obtained from the deals. Those omissions make it hard to judge the extent to which the deals validate the company’s technology, let alone whether they’re a case for buying NNDM stock now.”*

**My opinion:** I do see how this could be a concern. However I would also understand if the government wanted to keep their contracts under the radar for “undisclosed reasons” or something like that. I also don’t think that those contracts by themselves are a case to buy the stock. But rather the unique product they’re offering, their plan for future growth, and the value acquisition strategy accompanied with accelerated R&D to maintain their current competitive advantage (Even though no other companies can directly compete with this product yet). If they start to take on a lot more debt for no reason and use the cash for that instead of acquisitions and R&D like they said they would, it may be a concern (that would be reflected on their balance sheet anyway).

**Concern 3:** One concern I might have personally is if another company is able to provide the consumables that the Dragonfly needs. Since sales have been lackluster in the past (though they might pick up), NNDM seems to currently rely on the blade portion of their razor/blade model, even though level 1 revenue comes from Dragonfly sales (the razor). Only time will tell if these machines are actually as good as Stern says, but from what I can tell, they are. Although I’m not sure if it’s even possible for another company to make a cheaper ink that can be used in the same machine, especially with all of NNDM's patents, but I don’t understand enough about the patents to determine that. Regardless, I see NNDM as slightly risky (in the event sales don't pick up by EOY 2022) but still and *incredibly* valuable play, especially over the long term. (Anything under 10$ is an absurd deal, even under 15$ in my opinion)

**TLDR:** The Dragonfly gives Nano Dimension a competitive advantage via product differentiation in the industry of additive manufacturing and PCBs, while also breaking into a new market with the same product. Additionally giving them a first mover advantage. On top of all that, their current ratio is an absurd 101.13 (Yahoo). Which seems like REALLY solid support for defending those advantages. Nano Dimension is first-to-market with a unique product that disrupts multiple industries, and are trying to keep it that way. Highly recommend watching the 3/11 earnings interview if you skipped down to read the TLDR and haven't seen it yet. WSB doesn't allow youtube links so the title of the video is ""Nano Dimension: CEO Discusses Acquisition Strategy."" Currently have 120 shares @ 8.46 and might get some long term calls as well.

**Other Updates:**

I've recently been informed of BotFactory as their main competition, so next for me is additional research on this company. However I'm still going to be bullish on NNDM at least until I see how their post-pandemic sales do.

\- Ark Invest has almost 7 million shares

\- Hebrew University is in charge of patent enforcement

\- Cash on hand is now 1.490 billion dollars, not 990 million

\- Along with additional research on BotFactory, I'm also planning on researching the history of their [board of directors.](https://investors.nano-di.com/governance-1/) Though they already seem to have very strong (new) management

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anything under 10$ is a great deal imo, even under 15$. I finally got in yesterday but if it dips under 5$ I might just full send my entire portfolio. Even if the Dragonfly sales don't work out in the worst case scenario, the industry they're in and the technology alone is *at least* double the current price IMO. Especially considering they're the only company in the industry that's publicly traded at the moment"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"IIRC Ark got in at around $9.30. Anything around this price is an absolute steal in my opinion.

Edit: They bought some at $9.30 but Ark's average price is $4.76 per the links below"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stern said new Dragonfly mid 2021 or when the pandemic is over and hinted at 2022. So I would guess in the fall sometime but not sure exactly when. If you only wanna do options and no shares I would either get long term calls (Aug/Nov/Dec) or just wait until mid 2021. I'm long shares on this but if I did calls right this second I'd probably go for late fall/early winter expiration. I think a big jump in sales would be a bigger catalyst then announcing the new Dragonfly cause investors know that's coming. So playing future earnings might be your best gamble but not a financial advisor.

Edit: Regardless, I would be pretty suprised if this isnt above 10 or 15 by fall"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCB has VERY low float and was shorted - something small like 30%.  It didn't take much volume to use up available float and cause a huge spike in price.  DISCA is a different animal lots of float
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,its had a pathetic recovery since it tanked. wish you luck. i got some calls at 51 3 weeks out and i dont think itll even hit at this point lol

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,U know it’s heading down and only down? It went up around the big gme rally... after that every day i see it -4%
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And GSX?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,DISCB has no volume.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh? This makes no sense, it's had an upward trajectory since April 2020. It rasied more around the first peak of GME, but never stopped, it only peaked after the decline of the second GME peak. So seeing at it was still rising after BOTH of the ""big"" gme rallies, and only declined during the bottom of the second decline of gme, your comment makes no sense. 

Paramount+ is gaining steam too.

I don't think it will rise like DISC after the selloff they had, but I don't see where you are getting it's only heading down?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The two stocks have nothing in common the only thing what i see is going down. But from other side is shorted. But i don’t believe to strike... everyone has an opinion.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,PENN and TLRY are a magical combo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your only green position is 2 shares 😂

you belong here"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a bloodbath
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn bro, you held bags on all of it!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,TLRY and AMC can kindly go live on a farm
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good looking account 👋💎 AMC
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"LFGG love the picks!!!

I’m with you HEAVY in PENN and Tilray. 

I think Tilray is going to MOON again soon, can’t wait!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,SNDL is a loser. Too many shares on the market.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get out of AMC or buy puts, nearly every executive sold in the last few weeks and they are about to offer another 500k shares.  buy GME instead"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC and SNDL have been pretty disappointing so far.  Maybe I got in too late, but I've been in the red on both of them for awhile.  I am still hoping AMC will gain after q2 earnings show a return to business,  but now that is under $10 in tempted to dump it.  And SNDL is a dud. I should have dumped when it was above $1.40. Held to long now I've got a turd I don't know what to do with"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yes need some GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got it at a high price too (no pun because Im too sad to be punny) but I managed to average down to $2.01. I need to be closer to $1.30....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,From what I can see it isn't really a good company but it has a shit load of cash on hand. They pretty much just capital raised endlessly. $600 million CAD. So It is a play on legalized USA weed... I guess? It has 1.6 billion shares out so I'm going to say a short squeeze is about as likely as BB or NOK. They all need to stand as companies now instead of squeeze plays.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Pure sex. That is a match made in heaven.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish that was it lol. Have more in another account.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re coming back for everyone! 4/20 around the corner. April is gonna be 🔥
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tilray is coming back. We’ll pick you up fam 🥰
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets," ""Dilution is something we care about, but I will say we are formally asking approval from our shareholders to authorize another 500 million new shares that the company could issue if it wishes,"" Aron said. ""There are a lot of benefits to our shareholders of having more authorized shares out on the market.""

It is literally the same thing we have been voting on since March, they have NOT reached an agreement."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 60 Bananas of that too. I like the stocks!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"a lot of countries are also re-implementing lockdowns, we aren't out of COVID yet, I think most locations are going to be completely shut down again in a week at most"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Vaccination will be open in the US for everyone over the age of 18 in a month. There is absolutely no way any US state will go back into lockdown/close businesses. Covid certainly isn’t over and I think we still have a long year ahead of us but there will not be more lockdowns in the us.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got my first shot two weeks ago, I get my second dose in two weeks and I won't be ""effectively vaccinated"" for a month.  Just because vaccines are available doesn't mean everyone will get them or that they will be effective immediately."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes..obviously I understand how that works.. but the economic impact of shutting down entire states is so significant. It’s like we’ve adopted this flippant attitude about it but it is a huge deal with massive unintended consequences. For one, we are not going to get millions of people back on unemployment for 30-60 days while people get vaccinated. Hospital occupancy is manageable now that the most vulnerable have been vaccinated. The country is not closing again so I wouldn’t worry about it"
2021-04-01 18:24:58,wallstreetbets,"$64k YOLO on TSLA $680c 4/1 - GAINS u/MickolasJae gave me courage to post.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please be smart please be smart please be smart Please be smart please be smart please be smart Please be smart please be smart please be smart Please be smart please be smart please be smart 

And BUY A FURTHER OUT DATE!

Edit: God just knowing that risk give me Anxiety"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit. These are skills I come here to learn. 
Congrats on your retardedness!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice job retard
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What made you think TSLA would go up today? Congrats and f u!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ev is back again I think it’s due to Biden aggressive push for ev adoption 

I read that globally lotsa country government Mandate all cars on road must be ev by certain timeline 

I am bull on Tesla and Arrival  ( “son of Tesla” )"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I shoudlve bought calls instead of selling options yesterday. Sold calls at 650 for today right at the bottom before TSLA ripped 6% and lost an instant 10k 🤯🤯
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good shit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,damn daddy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"nope. ~~double~~ ~1.5x that. man bought 114 contracts for $5.61\* and sold them for ~$13.25 average. Thats $7.64\*114\*100 = **$87,096** gain (minus fees, if any).

\*corrected numbers since OP bought a little before EOD"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The only skill in this is a lackluster attachment to your money and dumb luck.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks dad
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't.

Just a bet on  
\- Biden's infrastructure   
\- good Q1 numbers leaked early  
\- SPY wanting 400  


Given the past 2 days of rally and TSLA is a magnet for 666. I bought the close and sold the open. Made a lot of mistakes with holding these types of play only for them to go from 200% to -100% out of pure greed."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if he had put 100 hours this week researching all the reasons it could work, high chance it could've went to shit. 

He just got lucky. Congrats and fuck you OP"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god 

I bought in around $500 something and have been holding all this time. The drop from $900 was painful."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh well it says total return $50k , I just went off that."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully I'll get some dumb luck trying some predictable plays. But since it's a cassino maybe dumb luck and spare money is all we need lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. 

Ask me how I know."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems like only the “SPY wanting 400” would be applicable to such a quick trade. Seriously good work.

Yeah I’ve been burned the same way. Hold past 100%+ gains only to lose 50%+. From now on, quick trades for me."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure but OP must’ve had some conviction for the trade. Whether TA or otherwise. Whether he ended up being right or not.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i worked all year on getting my account high enough to buy 100 tsla shares so i could sell weekly cc on them. In feb i bought 100 at $770 and then it went up almost immediaately after and then i got to ride the recent fall. 

just temporary, but sure does hurt a little."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same I bough both Tesla ( first time during the dip ) and arrival too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that's the value of the contracts at end of day yesterday. at that point he was down an easy $14k — my numbers weren't quite right either (he bought a little before EOD)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If it's anything like me it's buying calls that were just as random based on no DD and none of them paid off.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"MMs and algos love to burn options. Anytime TSLA gaps up, its always best to lock in them profits because it could go south quicker than you can nut in a eastern European underaged hooker  


666 is a current magnet, 690, 700 are walls for TSLA bulls to break down.  


Holding 700c 4/9 that's down 30% now lmao. Q1 numbers better be fucking goat or I'm uninstalling RH"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s just amazing , I’ve just been doing shares, options can make or break ya"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What were the Q1 numbers leaking early? I would short Tesla right now there is so much red on the daily.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you ever do options start out small and get the feel for the price changes. i started doing options a couple of months ago and burnt my half my budget (~$10k) in 2 weeks... it is starting to ""click"" but man, i'd give anything to go back and start over."
2021-04-01 18:13:24,wallstreetbets,My GME YOLO update ☺️ should I buy more? 
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yes

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,can you please tell me how to activate dark mode on fidelity app
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"See, ""buying"" on robinhood isn't really buying."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wont say yes.... but i like what you do!😂🥂just the 2nd app design disturbs me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does a bear shart in the woods!?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,no regrets if you just so happen to butt-dial in 50 more shares
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If we have to ask whether or not to buy more then we shouldn't exist.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Battery life checks out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy moar noaw
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... At least get it to a nice round even number :D
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought we weren't supposed to be posting our positions 🤔
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should charge your phone.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not buying is not the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you really call it YOLO if you can still buy more?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short answer: Yes.

Long answer: Yes, but with more letters and a full sentence."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,250 gang calling down
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t get the question.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Always buy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand the question
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you could buy 49, 999, 736 more we could prove you own the float"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should also charge your phone while at it :D
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I need to answer this questions with a yes or no answer?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what is that button next to Buy More? It looks like the word Seal, but it's misspelled"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First charge your phone
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn  YOLO my n*gga
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely think so!

Your diversity is waaaaaay toooooo high, mate!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two things you should do;
1. Buy More, if you like the stock.
2. Charge your phone. Seeing that sliver gives me anxiety."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, buy till $1001, at least."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,More... Always a Gme play.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you should charge your phone too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to see 500 shares the next time you post an update.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put that phone on charge yo

Bro living on the edge here"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy and hold buy and hold buy and hold buy and hold buy and hold buy and hold buy and hold 

Hopefully this eliminates confusion"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hell yeah if you can afford to, 

I myself am waiting on the next fuckery or dip to get a few more added to the collection. 

This Is The Way! 💎🙏💎🦍🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Even 300 would be nice .

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol you missed the moon already so ya
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but that emoji in the title dude...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you could also buy ASO, make some dough from gamma squeeze, then invest those gains into GME"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel so sad with my little 6 shares since February lol, been loving the ride though and learning with all the great DD out there. Thanks for your YOLO good sir! we shall enjoy tendies."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just saw awesome DD brother....hedge funds are scanning our posts because when you show your shares and at what cost, it gives them target info and ammo.

We need to stop posting screenshots and hold hold hold!"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know I'll get hate for this, but thats my realistic target too.  I'll be a multimillionaire after taxes.  Me and mine never have to worry about anything again ever.  I can't even imagine.

&#x200B;

Also, people thinking it gets into hundreds of thousands are retarded, not in the good way.  The govt will have to step in and force a settlement way before that.  You might not like the settlement.

Theres also the realistic possibility that the hf are finding new ways to cheat and will cover.  I'll be extremely happy if i can sell at 5000.  Go ahead call me names and downvote me."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Next play?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn that's an impressive play.

I've got 25 QS and 25 QS.WS, holding since pre-DA.

I'm pondering redeeming the warrants, but selling them gives me the same gain.

I paid $7.21 for the warrants. I could redeem for $11.50 each. So my cost basis would be $18.71

$18.71 * 25 = $467.75

Current price $52 * 25 = $1,300

$1,300 - $467.75 = $832.25 profit

If I just sell my warrants, profit is the same. $40.50 * 25 = $832.50

Selling and rebuying the stock with the profits is nearly the same thing, except I lose a small fee, but my avg stock cost will be higher, so it will screw with my numbers.

So I should redeem??"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not a yolo. This was a small bet that worked out very well. Read the rules. Options requires $2500+ initial capital to post

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

Also, let’s just step back for a second. If you understand GameStop’s direction under Cohen, then you know it’s still undervalued at $190. So at this point we just hold through the sludge of daily price action knowing this thing is going up organically no matter what and the countless DD shows a squeeze in play. So what do we do during these times? WE HAVE FUN. Just keep having fun with this, hedgies want us to get bored and give up but the engagement in the megathread in addition to all the memes makes this whole thing bigger than just a stock play. I know it sounds culty but retail investors are showing that their balls are big enough to have a seat at the table. Be proud of that. And remember:

There was a plane falling down, inside it was Deep FUCKING Value, Jim Cramer, Ryan Cohen and a little kid, but they had only three parachutes left.

Jim Cramer grabbed the first one and said: ""I need this parachute, peasants, I'm the biggest market maker and I run Wall Street"" and he jumped from the plane, but of course, he farted on his hand and smelled beforehand. 

Ryan Cohen took the second and said: ""I need to survive, I have to turn Gamestop around and save lots of jobs and tendies"" as he jumped out

The airship was getting closer to the ground and DFV said: ""go on kid, take the last one, you got your whole life ahead of you, just make sure you buy GME and hodl after you land"" in an act of kindness only a Chad could do

To what the kid responds: ""Don't worry sir, the guy who runs Wall Street jumped with my schoolbag"""

- Buy the dips if you can / want, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be ***volatile at times***. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*. Plus, fuck giving hedgies free premiums on deep OTM calls. 

- This is also going to be ***boring at times***. Price alerts are your friend here as well

I will sell when the price goes high enough for me to pay off my house, buy a new car, buy a banana stand so I can hide my tendies in it and feed the apes, retire before age 40, and make sure my extended family is generationally wealthy and never has to work again.

Sincerely,

Ape"

Meanwhile, apes were creating DD about how the late February chart was looking like the January 25th chart.  

My God, if I am correct, the scale is magnitudes larger than said DD of late February. If so, we're on that bottom flat spot around January 15th and this thing is going to be massive! The sideways trading could go on for quite some time due to the scale.  

HODL!

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts. ***ESPECIALLY FUCKING TODAY***

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can / want, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be ***volatile at times***. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*. Plus, fuck giving hedgies free premiums on deep OTM calls. 

- This is also going to be ***boring at times***. Price alerts are your friend here as well

Add 1 large scoop of creamy coleslaw on top of the melted cheese/meat magic... yes, coleslaw in the sammich. Top off with the other slice of rye, spicy mustard optional.

I take it as, everyone is holding. All we need now is a buy catalyst. I think it's safe to assume that 3 out of the 9 million on this sub is holding somewhere around 10-15 shares each. Making retail 33% of the float. Now add insider and institution ownership and we around 200% of the float is owned. Retail is entirely speculative of course but that's what I'm going off of.

I personally own 20"

If either one wins the jackpot, we will share it with each other. For me, it’s all fun and games, but for her it will be life changing if we win even a 6 figure amount. 

So yesterday, I made her open a WeBull account (bcz Fidelity has some restrictions for PR Residents) and transferred enough cash to buy a couple of GME. Told her this is her lottery with a guaranteed chance of hitting a jackpot. Crossing my fingers that we keep trading sideways until the cash clears in her account and she is able to buy GME before it starts to moon.

* Purchase a *s*ynthetic long position, (they aren't actual shares) but you can use it to report a *net even position* since you're **short the real shares** and **long synthetic options.**

**If I borrowed 100 bananas , rather than buy back bananas I owe: instead I'll buy a coupon (call options) that says ""I will buy 100 bananas."" It appears I've covered the bananas I owe... without actually having bought a single fucking banana.**"

WSB has purchased the rights to the Wendy’s franchise and renamed it Tendies. Ryan Cohen is personally going around to each and every bathroom stall with a holesaw kit, installing glory holes.

We no longer have to occupy the back alley (although many still do out of habit). We belong here.

“Sir, this is a Tendies” An employee politely acknowledges as you slowly put your penis back in your pants and cum to your senses.

You open your phone and check the DFV trading app. GME is soaring @ $69,420/s and life is good. You glance up as an employee is holding the bathroom door open, beckoning you inside. You feel at peace with yourself, tranquil and horny for the days ahead as you enter the middle stall."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GME has been suprisingly steady at it's current price. IV is way down too. I wonder if those hundreds of thousands of shorts that entered at $348 are currently trying to cover slowly in a way that doesn't impact price (forgot the technical term). Definitely risky on their part if that's the strategy. All I know is I'm adding 5 shares after lunch regardless of the price.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So been going back and reading conversations on different threads.   From a year or so.  And one thing seemed be reoccurring.  Mentions of “this isn’t going to happen over night”. “Plan to hold for a while”. “Probably years”. “Expect to hold for a while”. “It’s going to take some time”.  

My take:  buy SHARES  and hold.  Not advising anything.  I like the direction of the company and consider this as my own personal investment not a get rich quick.  I’m crafting my dreams and that takes time.  Of course I want things to happen soon as well.  But I like the stock.  I like smoked meats.  And this is only my opinion not advise."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Potentially stupid thoughts welcome, right? This is not DD. This is me looking at the 3 months GME chart. The two times the stock started to soar began with a little “M” at the base. The second big drop was not as immediate and that drop went down less. But it’s now returned to an upward  trajectory. And I see that “M” again. 

If the pattern of what happened after the “M” the last two times follows, it’s obviously a major jump. 

I’m looking at one pattern on one chart and I appreciate coincidence. I’m just asking if this might mean anything at all since the behavior of the stock the last three months has been so volatile and driven by non-customary factors - many unknown or not understood - maybe this is a pattern emerging based on acts behind the curtain."

- Don't panic, ignore FUD accounts. ***ESPECIALLY FUCKING TODAY***

- **Remove stop losses** (the big short attacks you see are hunting for them)

- Stop watching if you're nervous, set price alerts if you want

- Buy the dips if you can / want, but HOLD

- Trust the DD (providing some below)

- There are no hard dates for a squeeze, and you're only going to disappoint yourself otherwise

- This is going to be ***volatile at times***. You do you, but in my opinion *Shares > Options*. Plus, fuck giving hedgies free premiums on deep OTM calls. 

- This is also going to be ***boring at times***. Price alerts are your friend here as well

Again - 
> the reason it's not going anywhere all week, is because cheap fuckers bought crazy Call contracts, that will expire worthless, only putting money into the pockets of the HFs that wrote the contracts (hold the shares).

>People have to stop fucking thinking they are going to win the lottery, buying Options for 500 - 800. Just buy the physical share, taking it off the table, rather than buying cheap ass contracts that will never hit, but only hurt the stock, allowing HFs to pocket the premium price paid, while keeping the shares they borrowed.

Now that you have a very stable ~$200 stock, could you convince the board to approve a 10:1 stock split. I would then have enough shares to write covered calls and all my bitchass coworkers who are too afraid to buy in at $200 a share will gladly buy at $20 a share.

When you see a stock with a large borrow rate increase, or “special rate” you know the demand for borrow went up, or supply went down.

I was watching the GME chart for like the whole day again and suddenly the chart pops up to 55.000$ stock price. I panic and try to put in a limit order for 50.000$ but I misstype and my order doesnt get filled. Then I decide just to place a goddam market order cause I dont care even more if i sell for 50000$ oder 49000$.  
The market order gets filled, my wifes boyfriends starts humping my a$$ but my P&L chart was somehow red. I then tried to understand what happened cause I just lost money on that trade but my wifes bf was humping me so hard that I couldn't understand. After he finished I finally saw what happened: That market order got matched with a 50$ order and I sold all my shares for 50$.   
Then I woke up.  
TLDR: WE WILL MOON BUT I WILL FKING FAIL IT AND SELL FOR 50$ CAUSE I AM A TRUE RETARD ........."

No one is actually betting the $GME will 690, but whales do this to keep shares tied up AFAIK. This suggests to me we have bullish whales still in. I think the fight is for $200 because the OI for 200c is 3.8k, whereas 190c is 1.2k; 195c is .8k; 205c is 1.5k; and 210c is 1.6k.

Edit 3: Walls back up at $194.89 and $195 for 2,500 shares each

Edit 4: Rebalancing the $195 wall by the looks of it, up to over 3,100 shares at that price.

Family Guy was created by Seth MacFarlane, whose middle name is Woodbury.

Seth voices the character ""Carter Pewterschmidt""- who is a billionaire.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not translating it lol. Options I assume?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea what’s realistic any more. EUR 500 a share? 1,000? Ten or one hundred thousand? A million? I’d fucking love to become a billionaire, but I have a distinct feeling the powers that be won’t let it happen. A lot of things are NOT impossible: Melvin, Citadel and a dozen other hedge funds going bankrupt. Sure, though improbable (the fucks are powerful and connected, after all), I can imagine it. The DTCC picking up the tab to pay us apes a million a share, draining their reserves? I think not - at this level of financial chaos, the US government would step in and stop the mayhem, cockblocking us HODLers yet again. I’m hoping for a x10 event at least, and will not sell (I will keep posting updates) until I’ve made life-changing money - but I will not get my hopes up for crazy-ass possibilities like the ones we’re all dreaming of here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares. You see the big fat minus and the red numbers? Plus, the current loss is in the title, nothing to translate LOL."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The government literally has no incentive to step
in and stop people from b coming millionaires"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I think the same as you; a major force will eventually steps in. However; consequences of this?  
First of all, if DTCC doesn't pay us, they still need these shares because brokers are bond to contracts (same as funds/DTCC itself), they can't say ""well forget your short positions, thing's resetted"".  
Second, even if that would be a strange case, with China's surge in politics and economics; US market would crash hard no matter what and would be a desert land. The credibility of the US would drop below 0, causing even major damages than tons of apes getting gorillanaires.  
I don't think there's a way to stop this. Everyone knows they're cheating hard but still they can't achieve shit. If you don't sell, they still need your shares; nothing can change that.  
Maybe they'll just tax hard financial gains to take something back; and also instead of having DTCC backing up things, they'll just print these causing a major inflaction issue. Everything is possible, just like in 2008 you couldn't lose on subprimes indexes rated AAA, yet it happened somehow. Just because we ain't rich doesn't mean it can't happen; these things still answer to math, you can't stop that even by halting trades."

2021-04-01 15:45:11,wallstreetbets,"$DGX Quest Diagnostics Pt. 3 - Leading a Redditor to Tendies  This latest installment of why $DGX is **still** the safest double up+ opportunity in the market will likely be my last update before earnings this month (baring eventful news). A lot of this will be regurgitation from Parts 1 and 2 because, well, most of what was discussed has been coming to fruition:

[$DGX DD Pt. 1](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lktkjr/dgx_quest_diagnostics_is_free_tendies/)

[$DGX DD Pt. 2 - Electric Boogaloo](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m2dtqk/dgx_quest_diagnostics_pt_2_electric_boogaloo/)

**TL;DR again** \- $DGX is now over 8% higher since DD Pt. 2 earlier this month. The stock and associated calls are still trading at very reasonable amounts, continuing to make $DGX the safest double up+ play in the market. **During their Investor Day earlier in March, they doubled both LT Revenue and EPS CAGR guidance. They also confirmed they will be repurchasing $900 MILLION in shares in the FIRST HALF of this year. This will reduce their float by over 5%.** That is material. Now consider 90% of float is owned by institutions. Then add in all EPS guidance given for Q1 and Q2 does NOT factor in repurchases. Blah blah blah ROCKETS.

**Positions** \- I've given my positions every single time, yet some smucks demanded a screenshot. Why how much $ I have in these positions matters is beyond me. Either I tickled your balls enough during the DDs to invest or I didn't. Anyway, here's a **consolidated** view (100% options), which is drastically understated ($10k+ both gains and total value) because Ally's platform has become unreliable hot garbage:

https://preview.redd.it/81zhulcnujq61.jpg?width=3480&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b73da97030189fb81852b2c62f04ccceb8376c4a

Open: May 21 $125, $130, $135. Aug 20 $120, $125, $130, $140, $145, $150, $160

As previously mentioned, I also have another $50k stock and a small amount of options in my other account with TD. I will be moving all of my holdings to TD eventually because Ally has become completely broken over the past year and their customer service is non existent. **Just a PSA to AVOID ALLY.**

**The new stuff:**

* Most important - March Investor Day LT Revenue and Earnings CAGR increase and MASSIVE share repurchase timing
   * This improved LT outlook has yet to be reflected in any new ""analyst"" price targets
* Acquired Mercy's outreach lab services. Like I said, they will be using their piles of $$$ to make acquisitions. Especially as smaller labs run out of runway as the pandemic slows down.
* Struck deal with Zora Biosciences' to further efforts to enhance direct to consumer self testing offerings. A key growth focus for them is self testing of all kinds in the future. **Removed article links in an effort to actually get this damn thing posted.**
* As previously noted in earlier DDs, analysts were drastically overestimating the Q1 drop off in COVID testing expected. Public data shows daily testing remains absurdly high. In fact, the lowest testing day so far in Q1 is still higher than the highest day from May-Oct 2020. The overall Q1 daily average remains over DOUBLE that period as well. Heck, even Quest's own press release indicates COVID testing remains absurdly high through March (Q1) for them specifically: [https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates](https://newsroom.questdiagnostics.com/COVIDTestingUpdates)
* On top of the $50billion in stimulus, $DGX will also be a primary provider of testing services upon school re-openings

**Some important stuff from the previous DDs because God knows you still didn't click the links above:**

* Based on management's own conservative EPS forecasts (**excl repurchases**), a PE of 10 at mid year results in a share price of $144. This is the absolute floor target. They also announced unprecedented $2b in share repurchases for 2021, meaning they can repurchase over 16m shares at current levels. Their float is 133m shares, **BUT roughly 90% of that is owned by INSTITUIONS, leaving LESS THAN 16m** ***available*** **to public.** Assuming institutions continue to hold the majority of their shares (they will. it's a safe dividend stock), this stock will rocket by end of year.
   * I have always expected a Q1 diluted EPS > 4. I am currently projecting 4.2, which results in a TTM EPS of 14. Further, I anticipate roughly $3 EPS as the Q2 floor, resulting in a TTM EPS post Q2 of 15.63.
   * This results in an EPS 20% above the high amount given in guidance, which again, was conservative and didn't account for share repurchases

The reason this stock constantly runs up into earnings and then ticks lower despite large beats is solely due to their base testing lagging behind typical performance due to COVID. The market is acting as if the COVID faucet will just get shut off in the snap of a finger (soon) and then the base testing will take time to return. Does this sound right to you? **This line of thinking is laughably absurd and naïve.** Reasons:

* After a year of this shit, there is a massive backlog of people/procedures that will be completed after more of the pop is vaccinated. We haven't even seen a DGX Q performance with strong base testing AND COVID $$$ yet. Q1 of 2021 will be the first. Book it.
* **Political climate / stimulus** \- I'm sure you all saw the CDC is now ""recommending"" double masking. Hell, I've passed out four times writing this diatribe due to the 6 masks I'm wearing. Why does this matter? For every bit a person feels the previous admin downplayed COVID, the new admin is going 100% the opposite direction. Considering the US is going to continue to pump trillions into the economy, you can bet your ass all testing companies will benefit. There will definitely be huge grants/subsidies for enhanced serology procedures and research....and of course in analyzing COVID further. These testing companies have so much COVID data that will continue to be poured over as the pandemic lessens. You can also bet there will be an increased $ focus on scanning/checking for new viruses in the near future.
* **$$$$$$$** \- Do you think DGX is just going to light the enormous $$$ they've made over the past 9 months and will continue to make for 2021 on fire? Because that's what the current stock price/growth reflects. When in reality and in addition to the buybacks, they will be targeting acquisitions and investing heavily in serology capabilities/analysis and self testing expansion.

**Price Expectations by EOY:**

* Worst case - $150. Yea, I'm serious. Baring a market meltdown driven by tax policy changes, this baby is a lock.
* Best case - $200

**Important Dates:**

* Ex-Dividend date this FRIDAY 4/2
* Q1 Earnings 4/22

**Disclaimer:** I'm a rando on a message board, yada yada yada, not investment advice. Ally SUCKS as a brokerage. Use someone else. Long live GME."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP is correct in DGX been a solid hold.

Position: 100 units @ $112

Edit: Seconding Ally as been shithouse"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you have a solid analysis, but I definitely have some concerns about your assumptions. 

You seem to believe the population getting vaccinated will be beneficial to DGX. This seems backwards, given PCR testing has been the primary OI growth driver in the past year. As more people get vaccinated, PCR testing should taper off. While hard to predict, this possibility has been acknowledged in  DGX / LH earnings calls. 

I’m also not sure if this idea of a huge backlog exists. In my view, most people have returned to normalcy (with the exception of wearing a mask). This is reflected in the fact that base business testing levels have almost returned to pre-COVID levels. 

Share repurchasing and acquisitions will certainly lead to solid growth; but I’m curious as to why you expect DGX to outperform LH moving forward. Both have mountains of cash; but LH isn’t a dividend stock and could have more flexibility in their purchases because of it. 

Throw in the whole “power of the combined” (diagnostics and drug development capabilities) message that LH keeps pushing, and I don’t really see a world where DGX outperforms LH. 

I’d love to hear your rebuttal on why you believe DGX is the better play."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought some calls based on your earlier DD and cashed out after being up 20ish%. I’ve kept my eye on it since and may have to jump back in again. Liquidity was my primary concern on calls though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD I’ll buy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What should I use then? I bank with them so it seemed logical. Yeah the UI is pretty shit but I just do all my research and only use the site to execute the trade
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Happy to reply, but did you read DDs 1 & 2? I do not think people getting vaccinated will lead to improved performance in $DGX financials. That would be batshit crazy considering the record performance in 2020 and expected 2021 Q1-Q2 (clarification: I expect FY21 to beat a record FY20, but then dip in FY22). Rather, the argument is the market is undervaluing past-current COVID performance and market impacts that will help propel the company forward as COVID winds down (strong financial position, smaller labs going under, hospitals shutting down their own labs during COVID, expansion into direct to consumer testing aside from COVID). 

Despite record setting performance, $DGX has barely moved from pre-pandemic levels. Hence it is undervalued. For example, $LH is up over 30% during the same timeframe. I also like LH, but view $DGX as the better value right now and literally the safest play in the market as a whole. 

$DGX is guaranteed to hit $4 EPS in Q1, resulting in a TTM diluted EPS of 13.74 at a minimum. Assuming the market continues to trade it at a discounted PE of 10 (since COVID $$$ will drop from peaks as year progresses), that's still a price target of $137. Now keep in mind $DGX as averaged a PE of over 15 for the past decade. $LH also remains well above 15."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personal view is that DGX is undervalued at least 20% due to a lack of uptake in shares despite record performance in the covid year.

I'm targetting a selloff around May-August depending on reactions when the Q1 financials drop and what the business speculates for Q2.

Not the biggest fan of holding DGX superlong as the dividend % is on the lower end and there are better growth choices.

OP is correct (imho) in pointing out this is a safe-ish stock with unrealised growth.

Not financial advice etc etc"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad you made some $$$. I expect it to get pretty choppy Friday/next week. Possibly pullback to $125ish. Then run til earnings. So you might get a chance to re-enter
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their site has been unreliable even when placing trades. It has been awful for 5+ months; completely broken if you are an active trader. Has directly cost me thousands.

Aside from that, they often don't update option value for certain underlyings in your portfolio, which leaves your account either drastically over or understated. Which, aside from being annoying, also impacts your margin. Screw Ally. I legit had to create an Excel sheet to track my account daily.

TD Ameritrade seems pretty solid so far (6+ months). I've had Ally since they acquired Tradeking many years ago."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuk. I only switched from RH like a month ago

Anyone else want to verify TD before I go screwing around closing out my positions or starting an ACATS transfer?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I blame $DGX for listing their ex-dividend date as 4/2 so I somehow overlooked Good Friday this year. 

As for entry point, tough to say. I think anything below $130 is still good value. The Aug calls specifically are still fairly priced. It hits $125 and I will add to my position again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Vouching for TD. Opened my first account with RH, then opened Fidelity and TD simultaneously. TD was mainly for ease of trading Canadian stocks (currently in Canada). Fidelity allows for those trades as well. But I like the TD layout a bit more.
Switched all my RH to fidelity, but TD is where most of my financials are."
2021-04-01 15:43:48,wallstreetbets,"Crash alert. Infra plan is a disappointing trojan horse for taxes The details of the Biden infrastructure plan are now out and let's just say that it is a huge disappointment. We were hoping for unbridled spending instead we get one time, highly precise spending items and a reversal of the Trump tax plan and then some more...

The reconciliation was meant to allow the dems to spend without any concession of tax increases but it seems that progressive dems want to raise taxes...for the purpose of raising taxes. The sellside is only starting to catch up to this reality.

First here is a summary of the tax initiatives by GS:

**A 28% corporate rate**: President Biden proposed this during the presidential campaign. Each percentage point of corporate tax rate increase raises a little over $100bn over ten years in tax revenue, so this proposal would raise between $700-800bn/10 years. *We think Congress can raise the rate to 24-25%, but might start to run into resistance among centrist Democrats between 26% and 28%.\**

**Tightening GILTI**: Similar to the Biden campaign proposal, the White House proposes to raise the effective tax rate on Global Intangible Low Tax Income (GILTI) to 21% from an effective rate of 10.5% today, move the system to a country-by-country basis that would keep companies from using tax credits from high tax jurisdictions to offset GILTI earnings in low tax jurisdictions, and rescind the policy that applies the tax to income only above a 10% return on physical capital. This would mean that the GILTI regime would apply to most companies with foreign income rather than just to IP-intensive industries like healthcare and technology, and would likely also raise taxes for companies that currently have little to no GILTI exposure. The Tax Policy Center estimated the campaign proposal would raise $442bn over ten years.

**Other international tax changes** The White House release appears to contemplate replacing the Base Erosion and Anti-Abuse Tax (BEAT), saying that it would replace “an ineffective provision in the 2017 tax law that tried to stop foreign corporations from stripping profits out of the United States.” It also proposes to eliminate Foreign Derived Intangible Income (FDII), which encouraged US-based companies to hold their IP in the US by setting an effective tax rate on that income similar to the effective tax rate on IP held abroad and taxed through the GILTI regime.

**A minimum tax on book income** The proposal would also establish a 15% minimum tax on corporate book income reported to investors, which would serve as a check against companies that report large profits to shareholders but no profits to the IRS. The campaign proposal would have applied this globally on a country-by-country basis, but the White House release indicates only that it would apply this only to “the very largest corporations.”

**New restrictions on inversion**s The White House does not define what this would be, but inversions are likely to play a larger role in tax policy if the rest of the proposal were to pass, as the US would then have a high tax on the foreign earnings of multinationals compared with most other developed countries that rely on mainly

territorial tax systems.

GS Estimates a 9% hit on EPS

BAML Estimates a 7% hit to EPS 2022 (currently consensus at 200$

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/g4whch0hujq61.png?width=740&format=png&auto=webp&s=a088bffcffb6a4595c138380aa8fd82482f96783

**Ed Yardeni**, chief investment strategist at Yardeni Research, wrote this week that Biden's proposed 28% corporate tax rate, if implemented, ""would reduce S&P 500 earnings per share by $15, to $200 in 2022.""

That 7% haircut is likely more than Wall Street has been pricing in. **UBS** equity strategist Keith Parker wrote on March 9 that he anticipates a 3.6% hit to EPS from Biden's tax plan.

Parker wrote that hiking the tax rate on long-term capital gains from **20% to 39.6% could slice 1.5 points off the S&P 500 P/E multiple,** potentially another 7% hit. UBS expects that not quite half that tax hike will become law.

==============================================

The only reason the sellside isn't outright bearish yet is because they seem to think that only a watered down version of this bill will pass. that's not true. via reconciliation what Biden wishes is what happens there is only one limiting swing vote in practice and that is senator Joe Manchin. Guess what the man is fine with a tax hike of A*T LEAST 25% so he LOVES THIS:*

>While he didn't predict a price tag, Manchin said Congress should do ""everything we possibly can"" to pay for it. He said there should be ""tax adjustments"" to former President Donald Trump’s 2017 tax law to boost revenues, including by raising the corporate rate from the current 21 percent to at least 25 percent.

## So for now i definitely don't see how the market can get away with pricing NONE OF THIS. BUY PUTS.

Moving on to other asset classes which will explain why I only anticipate a drawdown of 5% :

the phasing of the plan is problematic in that infra plans tend to take a long time to start hitting GDP while the taxes hit will be immediate hence it will reduce 2022 GDP growth. Without writting a whole article about the situation at the FED, the market is currently pricing a full hike in 2022 DEC. That is the most insane thing this market has ever done since GME. IT IS NOT HAPPENING.

## BUY ED DEC 2022

and the pricing out of these hikes that are not happening will help with NQ's valuation and compensate for a point or half a point of P/E hence the 5% figure.

TLDR

**SHORT USDJPY, USDCHF, USDGBP**

**LONG GLD, QQQ vs DIA, TLT**

**BUY SPX OTM PUTS**"

They’ve also fucked themselves over in the EU by bailing out members (Greece, Spain, Italy) at the cost of well run economies (Germany). There is a leadership issue in many European countries, as with the EU as a whole. If you want to research some of this I’m a fan of Robert Solow’s economic growth models, as they take into factor many details beyond GDP and market performance measurements (I.e. population growth, technological advancement, individual savings rates).

Yeah that’s interesting to consider, i honestly think Europe’s issues go deeper than just poor management, but also a relatively stagnant business culture that is largely not innovative and mostly just derivative and piggy-backing on US business innovation.

However, you aren’t taking into account the brain drain from Europe to US.  People in the top of their field in Europe often make their way to the US because they just make so much more money here.  You rarely see top Americans doing the same.  Taxes and limits on “inequality” may have to do with that.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely agree there, and those are exactly the factors that Solow tries to account for. Worker productivity, education levels, etc.  I might be mixing up some of his ideas with other economic models, but his are widely accepted as the new Keynesian ways to look at economics. It’s been a few years since I last took an Econ class lol. I think you are right about the business culture, too, that’s a good point.

Mainly the point I’m arguing for is that by increasing taxes for infrastructure investment end up increasing labor productivity, which increases labor output, thus GDP increases, and yes that is a flawed measure of economic health, but it’s still the best we’ve got lol. 

Of course anyone could argue: “how the fuck does a road increase worker productivity?” Well, when I have to spend an hour on 95 in bumper to bumper traffic, I show up to the office pissed, and leave earlier to avoid traffic, and don’t really give 100% into the day I’d argue that my productivity is low.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I currently employ 6 people. Tax me more and I can pay them less. Understand the math here? Corporations are not some nebulous entity. Corporations are owned by people. Anyone who has a retirement account or personal investments owns shares in publicly traded and largely publicly owned companies. Even Jeff Bezos only owns 18% of Amazon. The rest is owned by shareholders. The profits go into building more distribution centers and more jobs with higher wages. Take away their profits and that diminishes greatly. If you are dependent upon government payments, you won’t understand how this works because everything is the fault of “the man.” You really need to understand who owns corporations and how real economics works.

2021-04-01 15:33:52,wallstreetbets,"ASO - Set to Short Squeeze 🚀🚀🚀 Very high short interest in ASO: 31+% as of recent update. The stock I think is set to liftoff soon as it crushed earnings on 3/30/21.

**Adj EPS came in at $1.09 vs an estimate of 50c, a beat of 118%!**

Further they raised their forecast and sees FY21 forecast EPS $2.7-2.95!

That puts forward P/E at only **9.4**

**Compare that to Dicks Sporting Goods P/E of 15, implying at least 60% of upside to $43.20.**

**On top of that, we aren't even accounting for the short/gamma squeeze which we know is the most important factor here. With an elevated short base I don't think it is out of the realm of possibility this could squeeze to $100.**

And a disclaimer that this is not investment advice, just my opinion. I like the stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 400 more Apirl 30 calls,  You can see the MMs having to buy the shares every postions.

&#x200B;

Drove the price up 50 cents almost."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought one fucking call and goddamnit, I’m here to say thank you. I’ve been in ASO since the start. Up 98% but with my full retard GE calls - 4/31 $14 four calls, I needed redemption. My wife looks at me as less of a man after losing my ass twice in GE. She made me give her one of my testicles and I am here to salute you as I have been given it back."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those asking about my positions:

I own 200 contracts of the April 16th $30 calls

I own 3.6k shares market value ~100k"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in.  4/16 30c
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Getting close to ready.

 

apirl 16th Call options .60 a piece with a delta of .26.

So every option you buy MMs have to hedge with 26 shares or sell puts.

If the stock price jumps they have to hedge even more.

And thats how you get a gamma squeeze.

So if a 100,000 options get bought. At $6 million MM have to hedge with 2.6 million shares or $70 million. And as price goes up they have to hedge further and further.

Then the 35 and 40 calls get jumped on by more apes.   And all hell breaks loose.

&#x200B;

Postions

April 16th 30 calls 450

May 21 35 calls 800

July 35 calls 100

july 16th 40 calls 400"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,35 calls look nice why not
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All shorts are in under $28 so it’s only a matter of time now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Delta up to .14 on the 35 options  So every $1 you spend on options MMs has to spend almost 11-13x times on buying shares.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this thing might squeeze today if the short have their stops at 28..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me just sell all my silver real quick.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in. 4/16 30c and 5/21 30c. Only a matter of time imo.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this deserves more attention!! seems like everyone is obsessed with GME and many are missing out on other potential opportunities like these. More upvotes for this post!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i'm starting to think finviz 's short interest numbers are not reliable.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Delta is up to .31 on the April 30 calls.   So every call out there they had to buy 5 more shares for.

&#x200B;

Understand how it works now?

So the higher the price goes the more shares they have to buy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Positions?
2. Where did you get your data from?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 300 shares at 25. Won’t sell till I see 40+ easy 2x eoy though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Big institutional over the counter buys coming during trading hours. Dont see that too often.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Source on 31% short? I'm showing 15%
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are near their peak in price.  They are also 94.25% held by institutions.  I'd be more afraid some HF manager will say to dump their stock, causing it to tank.  But that's just me."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked at the short holders, not surprised that Citadel was there. There is a new one last week. I think 4 days before the ER.  I’m new, so still trying understand.  I was amazed that seeking alpha called ASO cheap."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So did you buy shares? Seems like it could. It is what, one of the top 5 shorted stocks right?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is the short activity? Price has gone up 25% in last week and I don't see any big sell offs from shorting.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it me, or the walls falling?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What are your positions?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone should be aware that KkR absolutely will do another secondary and sell more shares. It’s a matter of when not if. 
There’s still money to be made playing ASO but don’t get caught hoping for a short squeeze when KKR says they’re selling another 12M shares"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to buy in?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks for Tendies sir
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Update: the call straight printed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you find 4/30 calls?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow, why be such a bit player...if you are confident go ALL IN

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought my first ever call option. Rode with you on the May 21 35 calls. BOL to us!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We just hit $28.48!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, bought two weeks ago"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re correct
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,.36
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got my data from bloomberg. You can double check it and feel free to post if I made any mistakes but the numbers are the numbers.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh man, I feel like a retard and am debating selling APHA shares to buy shares of this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"On Bloomberg I see 39.6mm float, 12.5mm share short which is 31.62%"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[https://www.highshortinterest.com/all/](https://www.highshortinterest.com/all/)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they IPO’d in October of last year didnt they? Their peak price is over a small sample size. Your other point is valid though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know what to tell you dude...the short interest is the short interest. It was also heavily shorted the day after earnings, opened -8% and clawed back"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 $30c (3)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven’t seen anything about a 3rd offering, where did you see this? While certainly possible, if KKR offered another 12M shares, they would lose control."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm racking my smooth brain over it, maybe just a few cheap calls for funsies, nothing too out of control, can't put an extra 0 in there."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean April 16th 30 strike price calls.

&#x200B;

I forgot I am working with a fellow smooth brain.  Since there is only one Day in April with calls for sell I didn't bother typing it out.

&#x200B;

Hard for me to type while holding my bananas."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just wondering where you were seeing weeklies for $ASO since the 30th is a Friday. Admittedly I am slightly retarded.
2021-04-01 14:59:27,wallstreetbets,These BB tendies won’t be printing....should have dumped this into GME instead. nothing is helping BB since the epic cucking. 
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m holding my BB. Might profit next year.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today I’m buying BB for the first time in my life, due to how down in the dumps the remaining holders are. Gotta go contrarian!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB isn’t a day trading stock, it’s a long term hold... stick with it, buy the discount"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is one of the greatest disappointments of my life.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you get options for trading sideways?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy PLTR.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#rip
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully after gme is squoze we can return for all the bagholders
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, double down pussy."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i lost money on BB late last year, and still stupidly decided to FOMO into it near the top. def have considered taking the loss to buy more GME or something else multiple times. but bagholders unite, we'll be ok brother"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know that once the GME and AMC short squeeze rally is over everybody here in WSB will park their money in BB!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yesterday $BB bounced off of $8.36. Yesterday was also the last day of the month so we closed March with a low of $8.36 December opened at $8.36. I don't know what to make of this but god damnit I think that's the bounce us BB holders were looking for
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just holdin and hopin for a miracle
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I know we've been shitting on most fundamentals but really bro!? 🤦‍♂️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"When i loose money in the market , & i can come here n see retarded ppl like me and I’m like FAMILYYY"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haven't you learnt anything from GME? DIAMOND HANDS!

not financial advice"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My Sept calls are burning my entire portfolio lmao.

I took out a little of GME to buy pretty reasonable BB calls for Sept. I was even up 60% at one point and then BB shit itself  and now I'm down 60%

I am just praying that a rally pulls through sometime this month so I can recoup some of the losses and roll it out, but I'm not aware of any catalysts over the next month so yikes. 

Bye bye green numbers."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold around 60% loss put money into nio hopefully get money back by eoy. Good luck if you hold but I wish I sold after the dump my average was over 20 sold 8.40.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the delicious loss porn.  But don’t worry  its never too late to join GME.  Go take your wife’s boyfriend wallet while he is sleeping and buy yourself at least 1 share of GME.  Its going to be worth millions some day. 🙌💎🦍 Although by that time millionaires will be the poor and new billionaires/trillionaires from GME will be our elites.  Just imagine it  bananas everywhere.  🍌🍌🍌
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Patience Iago
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’ll be back. Hang in there
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,BB printing for my covered calls baby.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,give this ape a banana award.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me know when you decide to buy puts so I can inverse you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing felt better than when I gave up in BB, took the peanuts that were left from BB, put it in GME, and made it all back 🤣"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most of them meme stocks are doing s***** man it's probably time to quit jumping on the bandwagon..
Same scenario over and over. Buy it watch it drop and then hold because it's going to go to the Moon LOL
 I wouldn't put my money into that other stock that you were just talking about.. Wait and see if it really blows up first geez.. it's not like it's going to go to the Moon overnight is it? What would actually make it go up to the Moon because right now supposedly everybody and their brother is putting money into it and it's just staying the same..
It doesn't matter either some whiny A**:B""""""""""  is probably going to erase my comment anyways..
The people want karma lol..
I think the people just want their money back LOL
By the way I guess I'm supposed to state that I don't have any position in the stock"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has got the be the best time for anyone to buy BB. Sure, it's been a red-headed orphan girl for a couple months. Everything I'm seeing shows them positioning themselves to be in a huge portion of the market share in EV and autonomous cars AND heavy equipment.

Like lots of others, my buy in is considerably higher than the current price. But IDFC. It's not a loss until you sell, and this has a bright future. I AM betting on it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here, bought  BB yesterday"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,well.....i bought AMC and GME and thought BB had the most potential to move up incrementally based on the moves they are making and potential from FB settlement and AWS partnership instead....it just loses value every day. 75k thrown away.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ain't that the truth. They had the world by the balls, and then didn't adapt."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You sell them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell a strangle.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Genuinely surprised no one has become millionair doing strangle on Pfizer. That shit has been trading at 35 since 1850
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i have PLTR too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that’s why i’m holding!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smart move to go to NIO, hopefully you caught the dip at a good time mate"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low, that is the way."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think NIO might go up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,dumped my $BB today after losing over half of my investment. Fuck this shit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme peaked in January and made me rich. Just bought a $750,000 house with my tendies. The key was buying in before the media hype. I was in at 4000 for $12/share and sold at $375. God speed to the Apes still holding! 🚀"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only have 350 shares at the moment and managed to get my cb down to 9.88. Whenever GME decides to be interesting I'll dunk that powder into BB too.

Until then I'mma sell covered calls and collect premiums until it prints."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I timed it just right so that both are -30% 👌
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It definitely is, i loved my bb torch but they never had any decent apps for it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent. Need more. Hehe.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Allowed me to average down a little by buying at 38, good results today and pre market looking good. I wasn't impressed by bb conference so just chucked it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude.... fuck you. (That’s so awesome, congrats 🎉)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to be you when I grow up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The CC’s suck ass for BB, but guess you could do them for a ways out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I timed it so I lost all my 20 calls on March 19 in both.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks man. Couldn’t have happened better. My wife is 12 weeks pregnant!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but who cares lol. It's free money. I'll take $2-$10 a week as I build my little dragon hoard.

Once I can start doing 10+ CC's I'll start looking at other stuff to do while I wait for print."

2021-04-01 14:17:47,wallstreetbets,"Is Blink Charging (BLNK) the next Gme? 

Blink Charging is a small cap American EV charging provider with a value of 1.45 billion. It has been rallying from a around $1 dollar to a yearly high of $64.00 but in the last couple months has dropped in value by almost half to $34.00 due to a rising short interest amongst hedge funds to around 41% making it one of the most heavily shorted stocks on the Nasdaq right now. Not sure what hedge funds are short but I feel there are a few reasons for this.

The main reason for this is that there are a number of other competitors that are making inroads in the market and that Blink is relatively small amount of market share at 8% at current. Chargepoint is the largest in the market. Although I feel that that what the hedge funds have overlooked is that there should be room for loads of companys in the EV charging industry. The sheer rate of growth in the EV market has driven this company up 1200% and that has potential to keep going. Blink has implemented a total of 15,760 charging stations and Apple has added all these stations to its Apple Maps which is massive for the company. We also should not underestimate the radical change to the global economy where clean energy is going to overtake traditional fossil fuels. America has a target I believe of 2035 for the phase out of fossil fuel transport while most of Europe has pledged to transform its economy to be carbon neutral by 2030 with EVs playing a major part in that shift. This indicates that there is huge upside for the company in the coming years.💎🙌

Below I have highlighted a few of the fundamentals that are interesting and may look familar here including the current short interest (42%) and the current float 32 million. Thats around 20 million LESS than GME currently. 💎🙌

Also I checked on iborrowdesk where there is currently 45,000 shorts available very similar to GME at the moment although the borrow fee can be as high as 80%?? 

Here is where I got these numbers from if people want to expand on this.

https://www.highshortinterest.com/ 

https://iborrowdesk.com/report/CCGID

However I do think that there is reason to claim the stock is undervalued regardless of what the squeeze potential may be if that sanario was to play out. What do you guys think I'm not a stock wizard by any means I'm just an Ape like you 🦧🦧 all so it would be interesting to get your opinions. 🙌💎"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we just stop this whole ""has squeeze potential"" = ""the next GME"".

Just say it has squeeze potential or it's undervalued, stop comparing it to GME. It's not GME, they are not closely related and wouldn't squeeze for the same reasons or in the same way."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This company is basically garbage
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for putting this on my radar, time to short it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"People need to stop saying ""is this the next $GME""... The GME ride has been a pain in the ass, up, down, manipulated, sideways. If by spike measures alone, sure that seems like something exciting, but the entire stock market has been turned on its head. 

&#x200B;

I honestly can't wait for this to blast off and be over with. Afterward I might invest in some dividend companies and be stress free, lol. The words ""The next GME"" are going to give me PTSD."

If you don't know why then stay out of it, this company is a ticking time bomb, the ceo is using it to get rich by selling his shares and they were accused of lying to investor, the only bull case they have is if another company buys them besides this its red flag everywhere"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s a lot of feeling in this post.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have spent a bit of time considering the charging station situation.  I have decided to wait a while to execute in this space.  My line of reasoning is as follows:

\-Most folks for some time to come will buy an EV with a plan to charge at home if at all possible IMO.  My sense is that charging stations will be used in high density (apartment life) situations and long haul.

\-I still can't wrap my head around whether charging stations will be established and operated by private or public concerns, or both.  Will this be a government infrastructure plan?  Will BP just retrofit gas stations?  Will 3rd parties handle this build out like BLNK?  I just don't know.

\-It does seem that the market for charging stations will be smaller than gas stations.

I would love to hear thoughts on the market place in general.

BTW, CLII seems to be betting on a public play if you take a look at the firm management.  The CEO is from DOE and they seem to have in roads with the Biden administration."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes they are. The short interest is 42% and the float is 20 million shares SMALLER than GME so they are vary similar technically but I feel that its also undervalued as well

Bro seriously, they are completely different companies in different sectors.

Just becuase a company has a short interest doesn't mean the share price will squeeze like GME did."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blink is exactly what it appears to be, GME is a business that was steady state surviving horrific headwinds and now looks like it's going to bull charge hard.  People aren't just into GME for a squeeze, they're in for the long haul."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Both have short interest for the wrong reasons
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like this stock is shorted because it went up 40x in a year and not everybody agrees with that valuation. GME was shorted because they speculated in bankruptcy of a dying business model. How is that similar?

There's basically no BID orders(buyers trying to buy low) compared to the 90 quintillion ASK orders (sellers trying to sell high) from people expecting to be able to sell up to $730

means most of the people looking to buy will probably buy asking price because they don't think the price will drop low enough to trigger their Limit Buys

and most of the people looking to Sell expect the price to go up enough to hit their Limit Sell

example:

say you put in $100 into a stock. it's down 50%. so you now have 50 bux.

assuming the stock is relatively flat for 3 months, if you took the loss, reinvested your $50 into various stocks that gave you an average of 2% a day you'd be ahead instead of holding."

MARKET OVERVIEW: stocks are up and bonds are down this morning. Bad news: today's weekly jobless claim was worse than expected and there are more covid cases. Good news: manufactoring data hit 37 year high.

Bond market: 10y dropped from Tuesday high of 1.765% to 1.681%. Expect bond prices to rise as economy recovers. This drop is short term.

Details:

Initial jobless claim: weekly jobless claim came out at 719,000 new unemployment claims, greater than 680,000 expectation. This should've dropped stock prices but cheaper borrowing rates pushed stocks up.

ISM Manufacturing PMI reports: March report came out at a value of 64.7. Anything over 50 means the manufactoring market is expanding. This is the highest level since 1983. This should have increased interest rates but the spike earlier this week was somewhat due for correction.

Tomorrow: nonfarm payroll expected at 647,000, unemployment rates expected at 6% and average earnings expected 4.5% earnings increase.

This is financial advice and I'm retarded"

Is this normal for it to be clockwork on those exact days each time...? Or 1-2 off (probs if it’s a weekend)? checked the past year and it was like that 10/12 months I think."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIACA is a much better play than VIAC right now; shorts are scared of what happened to DISCB/DISCA.

They're not as willing to try to short the illiquid share class in case the trade explodes and sends VIACA to $100.

VIACA trading $3 above VIAC now, yesterday the difference was $2.  Pay attention to the differential, if it reaches $5+ I think VIACA can go out of control."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ironically only thing that can derail markets now would be too rosy unemployment numbers.

Like if the March report is 1.2 million jobs gained, that'd be bearish because it means Fed will face heavy pressure later on to normalize policy quicker...

That's biggest thing to pay attention to as far as econ numbers go.  If UE goes down too fast, that's bearish for equities."

Dual class shares: Founder shares have 20x voting power. Of course, banks don't like this, but as an individual investor I could enjoy him having control of the company.

Deliveroo editions: ""dark kitchens"" created by deliveroo and only available through them. Quite good actually.

Deliveroo tailored subscriptions: not all subscription methods are available to everyone. I order a shitload (1-2x / day), so my subscription costs more, but has a lower order amount (10£) to qualify for free delivery. Gf orders less, so her subscription is cheaper, but order amount to qualify for free delivery is higher (25£). Some people aren't offered subscriptions at all! (Me when I was ordering 2-3 times a day)

Deliveroo pickup: all in one place for ordering pickup. I like this.

A downside for me is the uber lawsuit, riders will actually have to be employees and treated as such.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"PUBM is in full short squeeze mode. 

I posted this 58 days ago:

""PUBM is the most likely ""next big post-IPO short squeeze"" like BYND and TLRY. The setup is identical: shorts got in at a low price ($24-28) and used up 30-40% of the available shares to short, and then the lockup on 90% of the float extends to June (so there's few shares available to cover).

This is identical to what happened with BYND and TLRY. The shorts wanted to hold out until the lockup ended, but they panicked and mega squeezes ensued.

PUBM closed at $45-46 today, so it's worth watching because the shorts are so heavily underwater. Most of the shorts are -100% already by my estimation.""


Shorts finally used up most of the available shares and PUBM is showing an increasing borrow fee.

Stock can easily double if the squeeze goes vertical."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,WHY DIDNT I BUY MORE NIO
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to April and the second quarter. Stock futures are up this morning, with tech leading the pack. Nasdaq is up 0.9%. Russell 2000 about 0.4% higher. S&P 500 0.3% to the good. Dow futures are flat. That’s as of 0630.

This follows a nice gain for tech and smallcaps yesterday when Nasdaq and Russell both gained more than 1%. Interestingly, the Dow dropped a bit and the S&P’s gains were muted as well. Rotation to value off again?

Couple of things may have prompted this: you had positive earnings results from Micron, and reports of semiconductor M&A (also involving Micron). There have been concerns about semiconductor supply chains and Biden’s speech called for investing $50 billion in the US chip industry. All of that is good for tech. When semiconductors rise, the rest of the tech industry usually follows.

Not much on the calendar today. Initial jobless claims at 0830. Expectations are for 680,000 claims, which would be equal to last week.

That’s all I got. Don’t fall for any April Fool’s jokes. You’ve been warned (Voltswagen, er Volkswagen did a good job of preparing you for that as well)."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watching Palantir right now is like trying to watch a bonsai grow. Just wait, come back every now and then to check in, and find your entry points. It is a sleeping giant and will take minimum 2 years (imo) to grow revenue enough to push the stock above valuations. It has a solid basis of healthy, quarterly and yearly growth with myriad and compound expansion plans. It is also quite overvalued right now, and therefore will grow extremely slowly and over a period of years, if not dipping to reflect current value in the medium term.

 Play options all day, but don't buy the stock and then moan because it trades sideways for 9 months. 

Do fundamental DD, or stfu about it. It will likely take 5 years to surge."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many people have asked about which stock they should invest in $TP or $BIDET.

I’m here to lay out the facts.

**Positions:**

2 $BIDET by TUSHY

1 $TP put 5/19. Soon will be $BIDET

**BEAR Case $TP:**

Easy. Charmin. Bears clearly love it.

But runs out during pandemics, hurricanes, and snow storms.

Doesn’t clean your butt. Dirty anus.

Wasteful.

**Bull Case $TP:**

Everyone in America thinks it’s great. Most popular choice in every home. Not going anywhere.

No one case about your 🌈🐻 $BIDETs. 


**Bear Case $BIDET:**

🌈🐻 touch butt. Nothing should touch butt. Are you 🌈🐻?

I wipe my own butt. And I like it dirty.

**Bull Case $BIDET**

You want to be 21 century people? Have clean anus. 

If you got poo on your hand, would you wipe it off with toilet paper? NO! You would wash it. 

Water cleans your butt. 

This stock going to the moon. 

The future is $BIDET.

TLDR: $BIDET is the way. We 21 century people."

Is TSLA currently overvalued? Maybe a little bit - partly due to Elon’s celebrity. The stock is volatile, and will continue to be volatile for quite some time.

I forget nothing, and many times throughout the ape invasion everyone was all like “pApEr TrAdInG wHeN” and I said multiple times y’all made no sense because they would have thrown it all on lamestock and we’d lose and then they’d have an even bigger ego - not once did any of you fucks dm me and fill me in. 

INCLUDING MY SUPPOSED SIMP AND MY SODA MOD TEAM 

So fuck you all and I’ll maybe never forgive you.

Edit - Rich didn’t know so now I’m just pissed at the rest of you, simp included ☹️

Edit edit - includes all of you fucks minus rich and bunny and Darkbyte 

includes the one with a fannypack simp flair who did nothing to save me and who it’s now clear just used me so he could drop his bear flair. Which I’m not mad about because I’d totally do the same, it’s just you should have told me.

Do i go to the beach and take artsy photos if the sunset?  Do i take it to the mountains and take pics of beautiful desert landscape?  No, i decide the best place to test it out is at my college's women's volleyball game.  I get there early and sit in the front row.  I start taking pics and the super-cute trainer comes and chats me up.  We hit it off as i take a sufficient amount of pictures of the game.  She asks me for my name, we really hit it off.  Overall a great day.  The next game i come back and show my student ID to check in.  They tell me I'm not allowed in.  That bitch was only flirting me up to find out who my creepy ass was, so she could have me banned from all future events."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if it's all a trick. What if the people that *didn't* sign up for the paper trading contest are the ones who will be banned?!

But yeah, I was thinking the same thing. I'm a raging asshole, I never get upvoted trying to explain things to apes around here!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve found if you phrase stuff a certain way, their smol brains can’t figure out if it’s an insult or not"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi ma’am you may be lost. The meme stocks that are bought high and sold low are in the pinned thread. We keep the short ladders in this bunker.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the fuck is a straight thumb? 

Also - I think you missed the parts where I said I regularly ghost my life long best friends for no reason and that my only two names at work are “dukes” when people love me and “ice queen” when they don’t."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I still don’t know what we are talking about. I am here for the fallout anyway. Making tendies and shitposting is all I understand anyway.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything. Including in 2nd grade when I wanted to be Donatello and all the boys said I had to be April in ninja turtles. April fucking sucked.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and I knew you didn’t know because you and I talked about how ridiculous everyone was for assuming it would somehow fix things. 

I read the rules too and was only going to sign up because it said share a gif and strategy. I just wanted to say something dumb and post my favorite meme. I was fully intending on throwing it all on KTOS for the lolz and never looking again"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine having tarantulas 😖😖😖😖😖😖
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit doesn’t let you edit comments more than once every 18 seconds now so a script won’t help if you want it edited before deleting
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And u/Memetron9000 is the teacher trying to be cool but always wears last years styles.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Like u/competitivebunny and u/four1six_ he don’t want it known that he’s canadan
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Scam reasons thats why
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He should be holding a pee martini like I am 😡
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s been up for dayyyyssss
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, exactly, it’s a great description"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They’ll eventually adapt to the subs culture or they’ll leave.  That’s ab how it goes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And his awardee karma just keeps getting larger and larger 🤫
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think so too u/richtofin115 we need shit posting!

I had to explain to my boss who is based in New York and he joked if I’m making up Canadian holidays - I’m like yeah this ones got rabbits giving out chocolate it should catch on 🐰"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sense of time only exists when there’s a frame of reference. The moment your memory is taken away there remains no time. This is why when we get deeply invested in any activity we lose sense of time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or if you are an Aussie.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope! 😭😭

😭"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao. Damn
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me add to this...

Rich is a magnanimous gentleman who has unmatched banter skills. A fizzy drinks aficionado who has a brilliant comeback to most insults that get dished out towards him, he is our only hope to even come close to /u/FannyPackPhantom level of mischief. After an almost successful murder attempt by /u/competitivebunny he was just recovering from his PTSD when the ban hammer fell on him. His loss will be a travesty of justice and a huge loss to the bunker. Like most of us Rich has his own faults but thats what makes him endearing. For all the people invested in SOXL Rich is a messiah who can lead us to the 3x treacherous path of the Siliconiaaa. He should be reinstated post haste."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Devastated is a strong word but I would be sad ☹️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm... I don’t know if it’s convincing enough, I might not unban you just yet"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I definitely heard the same
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/fannypackphantom feet pics are needed plz k thnx

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently I was the one who missed it all along :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The Pagans would appreciate it! The tradition was started by the Catholic Church to mock them anyway.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone actually suggested we do that next year
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve noticed this as well. I’ve said degrading shit about Gstop that somehow was getting upvotes. Now I just mention that terrorist and I’m a bot from Melvin.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please respond: ‘the market is rigged’. 

Answer No: end of discussion 

Answer Yes: how is it rigged? 

If Yes, all roads lead to DTCC. If DTCC completely incorruptible = almost all market shenanigans impossible. Maybe not 100%, but damn near."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a wild tarantula in my house once. I opened the door and the fucker walked right in like he owned the place. Then I had a bit of a conundrum. Can't kill him unless I want a material amount of spider guts everywhere, but sure as hell not going to pick him up with bare hands. 

I wound up scraping him off the wall with a spatula and depositing him outside again while he was spazzing out.

In the spring the males wander far and wide looking for mates, which now makes me wonder... why was he so eager to get into my house..."

Just up the ante. Make it an options-trading competition next year and ban anyone who doesn't sign up.

Or like, a mutual fund-picking challenge and ban the people that fall for it.

Edit: Keep going year after year until eventually the only way to stay unbanned is by buying JNUG FDs."

I wanted Mikey but I pressed for it so much that I started liking him and then it rubbed off and made me a nerd. Also fuck the Leonardo guys always thinking it gives them the right to dictate recess. 

Now that I think about it I ended up being some weird version of Mikey and Donatello in real life. 🤔"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what she said :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ego is there because we identify ourselves as the body. The moment we understand that we are pure consciousness ego prishes into nothingness. 

Ego is a defense mechanism. We got identified with this little body. This little organism has to survive in this vast existence of which we have no perception to even know where it begins and where it ends. Just to survive, we have to project yourself like a big man. So the ego is born. It is a false reality we created just for the sake of survival. 

So what is ego? It is like your shadow. The moment you have a physical body, you have a shadow. The shadow itself is neither good nor bad. If the sun is up there, you have a little shadow. If the sun is down there, you have a mile-long shadow. Whichever way the outside situation demands, that is the kind of shadow you have. That is also the kind of ego you should have."

I just collected some motivational quotes if you should really have problems holding:💎

-Focus on your goal. Don’t look in any direction but ahead.

-Is the sum of small efforts repeated day-in day and day-out.

-We must embrace pain and burn it as fuel for our journey.

-Tough times don’t last. Tough people do.

-Pain is temporary-quitting lasts forever.

-A little progress every day adds up to big results.

-Difficult roads always lead to beautiful destinations.

-You don’t fight will power-you create it.

-Be so good they can’t ignore you.

-Never give up. Great things take time. Be patient.

-Never stop trying. Never stop believing. Never give up. Our day will come.

-“Life is a storm, my young friend. You will bask in the sunlight one moment, be shattered on the rocks the next. What makes you a man is what you do when that storm comes.” (Alexandre Dumas)

Some of them might sound pathetic but this is sth some of us seem to need. 💎🚀🦍💪🏼😎 You want to share your motivational quote? Go ahead!"

From FUTU - App like IBKR:

Dear customer: Due to lack of borrowable securities of GME.US, as of writing, the upstream brokerage (IBKR) was not able to fulfill the lacking securities of GME.US. If the upstream brokerage cannot obtain the outstanding amount of GME.US fulfilling the settlement by 01-Apr-2021, 9:00 AM ET, it will be considered breaking the settlement agreement contract. According to the SEC Rule 204 requirement, you may get margin called. All of your shorted GME.US holdings will be bought back at the market price forcefully. We recommend you monitor your account, and we will be constantly updating you regarding the market.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's even funnier is Game Stop didn't even have to do a thing to get this status either.  Corporations spend millions upon millions in marketing in hopes to get half the meme following that GME got for free because some hedgies tried to fuck them and some rando figured out it all out.  GME should give DFV a board member salary for ten years for that alone.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not the Aussie ISPs doing it but something built into the TCP stack.  It's like big endian vs little endian where applications have to reverse the text as it transmits data.  What's funny is that even if an Australian is sending data to another Australian the text gets flipped.  It's also why hackers down there are easily identified because in order to sniff traffic they have to be Australian-upsidedown to read any of it.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never used margin so I'm not sure how it works if you have or plan on using it with Fidelity. All my shares in RH were cash shares, but for some reason showed as ""margin"" the first 2 days in Fidelity. The Fidelity rep said they've been dealing with this with RH's transfers for a while now and that the shares take a couple days to ""settle"". The next day, the shares in Fidelity showed as cash shares. I do not currently have margin on Fidelity either.

I should add that I spoke with very helpful people within 5 minutes when I called Fidelity. If you have any more questions I would give them a call, they were great."

2021-04-01 12:04:45,wallstreetbets,"[$BB] Blackberry is well-positioned to benefit from Biden's $2 trillion infrastructure plan President Biden unveiled the $2.25 trillion [American Jobs Plan](https://www.cnet.com/google-amp/news/biden-infrastructure-plan-ev-rebates-charging-stations/) that includes $174 billion for electrification (building 500,000 EV charging stations, giving direct EV rebates, building EV supply chain in the US) and $270 billion in upgrading train and road infrastructure.

A more robust universally-accessible EV charging infrastructure will accelerate the growth of the entire EV industry and help level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling point for Tesla). Being the software provider for 23 out of 25 top EV automakers, Blackberry will also experience the same explosive growth soon.

Upgrading train and road infrastructure might imply the adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) and Vehicle to Infrastructure communication (V2X) to enhance logistical/traffic management for better energy efficiency, productivity and public safety. As major infrastructure becomes connected to the internet, security will be a major requirement because these infrastructure will become hackable surfaces that can cause serious damage. Blackberry is the leading software provider for mission critical applications, IoT cybersecurity and Unified Endpoints Management (UEM) that has a great track record working closely with governments across the world. The [US military](https://www.newswire.ca/news-releases/the-united-states-air-force-chooses-blackberry-spark-for-secure-productivity-802136475.html) and [NASA](https://www.militaryaerospace.com/computers/article/16707929/space-shuttle-uses-qnx-software-for-camera) have been Blackberry/QNX's major customers for a long time.

It is very likely that Blackberry will win major government contracts soon in this space given its technical expertise in the IoT space and huge engineering workforce in the US.

No idea why this popped up in my feed, but recommend BB as hold if you've got it but not a buy at current price, they're still dropping.

Short-Mid term I reckon they're valued between $7 and $16 based on assets, market reach and existing long-term contracts.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it is Canadian. It also has engineering centers across the US.

The infrastructure plan is not a direct investment in US's EV companies but rather a capital injection to grow the domestic EV market to fight climate change and build a domestic EV supply chain (can be either US or foreign companies as long as they are operating in the US) that rivals China's. Modernizing road and train infrastructure also creates jobs and helps with the US economy recovery. 

Blackberry is a critical part of that supply chain for both EVs and IoT. Blackberry even has a dedicated [subsidiary](https://www.blackberry.com/us/en/industries/defense-military#hero) in Washington, D.C. that serves the US government, so it is well-positioned to help the government execute any high-tech infrastructure projects that requires safety and security."

Depending on your stake cutting losses here and reinvesting elsewhere is always a valid action. Suggest you see how the market adjusts to their recent EV patent and whether it wins them business before you breakup though.

Disclaimer: I hold none, looking at buying @ 7.10 hopeful they're performant enough to reach $11 again but I'm comfy losing 30% of $7 per unit or missing the rocket.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for taking the time to explain it this way. Have a blessed day
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,BB probably will hit $40 someday.  Maybe today?  But it's looking like a long ride.  At least it won't be as long as NOK...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This was and always has been a long play
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the comment ! Appreciated 🚀👍
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for saying this. I really was wanting to but you said it a lot better than I could have. There's a lot of reasons to be bullish on BB. Yeah their history has been rocky but I truly believe it's because they have completely changed the company direction. Excited to see what happens in the next 1-2 years.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dropped by NOK bags today. Fuck that shitty company

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg I see it!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dunno what to make of it. I'll chew the red crayons first though. Thanks for the lunch.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Been holding some MACD for a while now. Glad to see it’s finally getting some attention.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally the 1H & 1D all show the MACD crossing over the signal downward and the 1W looks like its headed the same way slowly???? The 4H is barely hanging above by a thread and the RSI indicates that we're in a very iffy time atm.

I'm not here to spread FUD, but be realistic in your expectations of TA. I'm expecting consolidation before another big rise, which is healthy in any market. Even a volatile one. Especially if you want long term stability in the price of the stock.

Best of luck to ya'll out here today, just don't be discouraged if we see some red in the coming weeks.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone retarded enough to actually trade on technical indicators, and not just yolo options based on feelings like a real G would, bullish macd crossovers are generally a good sign, but dont pin all your hopes on an indicator. If it were that easy we would all just watch the MACD for a bunch of securities all day and be rich in a week. Other indicators may say something else, even when they all line up its not a sure thing, especially on a stonk like gme that is holding up a middle finger to the ""experts"" and trading strongly on investor sentiment. If you beleive in the squeeze, just buy, hold, exercise ITM calls, and keep your chin up. Not financial advise."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep those are definitely lines

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it hasn’t yet, then it’s not crossing up. We’ll see. My idea of a price drop isn’t today or next Monday. I’m thinking mid to late April. More of a long play for me. We’ll see ups and downs in the mean time, but I do believe the overall trend is down looking out past a day. 

Eventually, things DO become over bought. Hands sell and take profits. They’re human. And that’s okay, it’s a part of the consolidation and stabilization process. 

What’s not okay are these posts that are, IMO, convincing people to buy at the top based on false hope and ignoring plenty of other indicators showing a drop in price over time. If anything, you’d want these people to wait until it does to buy and hold MORE shares. 

The reason people don’t, is because they’re trading based on emotion, because they bought the top. Lol. 

Just my two cents. Buy, sell, hold based on whatever information you’d like. At the end of the day, is what I’m saying really any more accurate? Time will tell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s only two rallies so far, but two out of three correct predictions would make you massive amounts of money in the long run."

2021-04-01 10:12:02,wallstreetbets,"Spongebob vs. Hwang Gang and the Banks **TL;DR**
VIACA 4/16 $50c $60c and $70c


**The Backdrop**

You have heard by now that Bill Hwang, who is so crooked he could piss around a corner, and his hedge fund Archegos blew up spectacularly by getting margin called from virtually every large bank on the Street. Goldman, Credit Suisse, Nomura, Morgan Stanley, and Deutche all got with their pants down. Goldman, MS, and Deutche hit the exits fast while the [others got caught holding the bag.](https://www.wsj.com/articles/goldman-morgan-limit-losses-with-fast-sale-of-archegos-assets-11617062028) Ever since the end of last week, everything in Archegos’ portfolio has been getting pulverized while the remaining banks scramble for liquidity. 

Archegos doesn’t show up in filings due to arrangements they have with the banks above, so it is hard to know exactly what Archegos was holding. Once people figure out a company in his portfolio, traders shorted the fuck out of those companies to put the pain on forced sellers. Discovery and Viacomm are two companies that was publicly outed and have been [stuffed in a box.] (https://www.thestreet.com/investing/viacomcbs-discovery-archegos-short-selling-stocks)

Discovery and Viacom both trade with multiple tickers because they have multiple share classes with different voting abilities. I don’t know why the fuck that’s a thing and it's stupid. For Discovery, $DISCB is the voting class, $DISCA is the common class. For Viacom, $VIACA is the voting class, $VIAC is the common class. If this were the SATs, $DISCB is to $DISCA what $VIACA is to $VIAC.

$DISCB/$DISCA found their bottom last Friday. The volume is now slowing which could mean most of the panic selling probably is finished. Not to be caught offsides, short sellers likely covered $DISCA as the trade was basically over and that probably caused the recent relief rally. $DISCB, on the other hand, went apeshit for reasons. 
 
Viacom’s selling pressure is still shitty, but getting much less shitty. The reason Viacom has been sadder for longer is probably because the banks above own a metric shit ton of shares and a large part of the total outstanding shares. MS + CS + Nomura + Goldman + Deutche = 20% of total shares (about 120 million). I am guessing there are still short sellers here since the trend is still downward. Viacom also announced a secondary offering at $85/sh that made people sad and may have started this whole Archegos mess to begin with. 


**The Trade**

I don’t know and I don't care what the fuck happened with $DISCB, but I liked it and I want it. $VIACA has options ($DISCB does not)…so I bought $VIACA April 16 $60-$70 calls to pay homage and really committed to going full retard by buying MORE than my Personal Risk Tolerance. I also want to own enough voting class shares that I can make Patrick SpongeBob’s gimp while Cartman shits on a picture of Cramer’s face by the end of next week...but that’s a post for another sub. 

**TL;DR:**

VIACA 4/16 $50c $60c and $70c

AMD 4/20 $25c

Most options expire worthless and these probably will too."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/16 seems a little soon with a lot of sideways/average trade days recently...

What the shit do I know though, that 60c looks tasty as hell."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My only issue with viac and disc going back up is that we’re missing the sole person who was bullish enough to hold billions in these positions. With him gone I hope the stock will return but nobody will be as bullish and with such a large position as hwang was.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got DISCA call spreads

45/50 and 55/65

Bought at bottom last friday"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find it bullish that the stock started to find a bottom. I am hoping that means the panic selling is done. It could have another day or so for all I know.

4/16 isn't that long I agree, but the price is low enough for me to take a gamble that trading rebounds soon. The bot picked up the wrong ticker - I am looking most favorably at the $VIACA although I do own calls on both share classes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hwang basically did the infinite money cheat by posting the same collateral at a bunch of different banks to get some insane leverage. Maybe he's a lurker?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I never said I was a smart man, just a degenerate."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this a Melvin bot? 

VIACA 4/16 $15p $20p $25p

Don’t panic guys, just recalibrating the bot. Not buying puts because I’m not a 🌈🐻"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well DISCB already mooned, which is why I looked at VIACA. You don't necessarily need another Bill sized whale to come in for this to work. You just need the panic selling and shorting to clear out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $VIACA play looked more attractive to me, but good luck on your trade. Hope we both win."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,After losing 20 billion dollars hes basically an honorary member. Need to add him to the loss leaderboard

[I wonder if I'll get one of those 'you lost a lot of money last month' letters...](https://preview.redd.it/ku06jys05iq61.jpg?width=750&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2e896f0a2fc845a7cb2383e6e53eccafbc69a21f)

Edit: adding one of my comments to the post because squeeze not squoze:

**We'll see how many 'shares' are owned by 13F as of the 3/31 cutoff date on 5/15 when 13F must be filed. The shorts have 45 days and counting before all hell breaks loose.**

Why?

Because 'the shorts have closed.' So they say. However, as of 12/31/2020 (per Fintel), Insiders + 13F filers owned 97M of the 70M shares that exist in the world. So statically we can prove a minimum of 27M shares were shorted as of 12/31 without any concern for Finra disclosure 'mistakes'. At that time, it was widely accepted that there were about 100M shares shorted -- 140% of all the shares that exist (nevermind the float!).  So FINRA showed 4x the number of shorted shares than we can deduce from the 13F filings (as of 12/31)

For 3/31, if the 13F filers show that collectively still own about the same number of shares -- 97M or so o the the 70M shares that actually exist -- **shorts r fuk**.  Because it means they didn't cover a damn thing.

If anything, retail owns FAR more shares now (3/31) than they did 12/31 -- 3 weeks before GME caught main stream, world wide attention. We've seen HODLers from Europe, NZ, all over. The January RobinHood freeze was the rallying cry for the world.  **9% of US adults bought at least 1 share of GME during January.** They all bought. Many held. They didn't sell at $40, why would they have sold now at $190?

I'm putting **(my own personal)** clock on this. 45 days and counting. I like being right. Getting paid is just gravy."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yikes. That date and strike price.

Is it too late to roll them out?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So for you to make a substantial profit the price needs to go over $800 as soon as possible before the expiry date.

Good luck I hope you make it.

Only one question, if it does start squeezing, what makes you confident that they won't pull the same shit like in Jan and tank it again?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if you had just bought the stock...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I missing something? You're waiting for the 13F based on filings as of 3/31 to come out in May yet you have 800 strike calls that expire in mid April?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well unless he is lucky that is pretty stupid. Buy 1 M shares, let’s say at $ 200. That would be 5,000 shares. Sit tight and wait for the moon. If GME doesn’t get to $ 800 he loses the 1 M.

My conclusion:

That is a HF paid guy trying to convince Apes to buy $ 800 call

My Ape recommendation. Buy shares not options"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This might be the single handed worst play ive ever seen. Gongrats and fuck you

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am guessing you bought these around March 15 when it was $220 per share. By my calculations you could have purchased 4,500 shares.

You could have sold 45 covered calls, made 75k and bought more shares.

You literally could have retired on $1mil of dividend stocks or a couple of houses.

I'm sure you have more if you were willing to throw this away, but still, why? There are/were plenty of other option YOLO gambles that would have been easily a 50/50 chance of multi bagging whereas this was about 0.1% at the absolute best of times."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure I sold you at least 20 of those contracts. Thanks :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"God damn brother. You could've gamma ramped us to $350 with that premium 😂

Let’s say GME closes at $801 on April 16th. If you weren’t going to exercise these and buy the shares then you’d have a profit of $50,000 right? ($1.00 over strike price x 500 contracts x 100 shares per contract). Is that right? Or is there something I’m missing?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i worked 70 hours a week all year last year, and got 2 separate 10k bonuses, and still only made 74,900$."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are making money?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,it would take me like 10+ years to save up 100k
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried not being poor
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,learn to code homie
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I somehow have made 70 k and spent 120 k.. the American dream baby
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone who’s YOLOing 7 figures is either filthy rich or unironically retarded

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The average household income is about $60-$70k. Learn a side hustle that can make you extra income while you're not in your job. Plenty of ways to make extra money, you just have to find them. Youtube and google are your best friends, besides Apes."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think fucking men will change anything bro
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A 4/16 800c is only $121 currently. I’ve spent more than 60 bucks at the horse track and casino. Easiest bet I’ve ever made.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you lose 100k? That's the question
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just wish I had 5 grand..... Someone benevolent hook us up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao i don't make 40k

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally better odds that Apophis hits a wormhole and rematerialises in the middle of the moon.  But I like those odds.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir if this hits 800 by 4/16 I’ll get a fucking Diamond hand tattoo on my ass I swear
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is golf. You’re supposed to try to get as close to zero as possible. Keep up the great work!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am asian. My family has told me time and time again if i ever get a tattoo they will disown me.
If gme hit 800 by 4/16 i will fucking tattoo a diamond on myself and post pic as proof. Mod witness me"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"so if the catalyst in your thesis can be up to 3/31 + 45 days, why wouldn’t you choose 5/21 as your expiration? not judging, just curious"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’ll happen!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohhhh niceee. Guess you arent worried about getting IV crushed with the upcoming volatility with the pandemic crisis rule not getting extended after 03/31!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The great thing about options is you acquire a get out of jail card when it expires, so no bag holding.

Just it aint free..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,don't feel bad... don't play with money you can't lose
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So... if OP’s catalyst is on 5/15, why the fuck did he buy all these calls to expire a full month ahead of 5/15?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Call holders don't even get a bag to hold onto when they lose lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure can I borrow about $40M?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tbh, if *all* the calls for exercised at once, it would absolutely trigger the squeeze."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"ooooh between all the DTCC rule changes, the repo market actions, Archegos margin call and now IB/Futu margin calls?  Not looking to set a date or price target.... but UP and before 4/16 would be greeeeeat."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Big Short: ""It's the same thing!"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say we're 94% of the way there...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not as dumb as I look.

But it's close.

I had a theory, it doesn't look like it's working out. My new target date will be right after the 13F filing deadlines (or sooner) which is May 15th."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,ohh i remember that one
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah and at least 40000 800Cs expired worthless on quad witching too lol. Godspeed fellow ape.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I own 2% of the calls god speed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought a single contract after one of your previous posts lol. 🤞
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why u have these if you give it 40 days?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm trying to show the world that the mentally diminished can still do some amazing things!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit I got them switched again. I probably left the faucet running out side too. lefty loosie and all that.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It felt like a real fuckin $950k a few weeks ago, could pay off my mortgage 2x over with that amount. But handed it to the CBOE instead. I've been 'rich' for the entire last 9 weeks since the first GME rocket stage ignited."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Either I'll have enough money my kids will be entitled assholes or I'll never talk about that time we had a few million dollars for a month.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, some of them were $38 yes, but this shows gain/loss. So my cost is $19 and I'm down $17ish... so only -94% at the moment. I've seen a football team come back being down 28 to 3 and win... so we'll see!"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">If GME hits $600 tomorrow, these calls would be worth about $120 per share, ie $12,000 per contract x 500 contracts = $6,000,000. Less the $950K or so I put down on the position, + about $5M.

>If GME hits $600 on MONDAY instead? the calls are worth about $95 a share, ie $9,500 a contract x 500 = $4,750,000, a $3.8M profit.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Million to one shot, doc."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's some r/investing logic. yes. I realized this late last night. So I'm a month early and $900K short.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say half of them did. The 12/31 numbers didn't really include sizable retail holdings at that point. I am certain there are more retail shares be held TODAY at $189 than on 12/31 at $18 a share given the worldwide coverage of the squeeze, fuckery, and insanity of the whole thing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They've lost 94% of their value... so rolling out is going to just destroy any leverage I would had. I'll ride them to $0 or try to get my money back at least.

Yet another unintended consequence from all the shorting manipulation. Same thing with halting GME buying in January. Every time they put up a road block, they make the masses angrier and the price goes up."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are contracts that react to time, moneyness, and volatility. Given how far away from the money these calls are, I was hoping buying the cheapest calls would give me the most leverage to profit off of large, sudden upward price movements on GME with sufficient volume. 3 weeks ago, when the price was at $330, these calls went as high as $75 per option. Now, they sell for about $1.20. If GME spikes over the next few days, the contracts will gain value again, before quickly losing value to time and diminishing volatility. 

TLDR: I needed GME to jump up quickly at some point over the last 3 weeks or the next few days or else I've pissed away $950K on lottery tickets."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those piece of shit calls are sitting right next to my 4800 GME shares (was a milly-ish, now a little less)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. But if I had invested my $10,300  into the S&P in November it would be $11,720. Instead, I bought GME calls and now I'm at $1.4M (and that's including being down $900K on these calls!). The time will come for more conservative investments.

I'm not there yet."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This new thesis was arrived at after my 3rd bourbon around 3 am. So my next YOLO will be for 5/21 (or slightly later). The big brain move might be calendar spreads.  Sell 5/7 calls and buy 5/28 calls (not yet available to buy) to minimize the cost of the trade and maximize tendies.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do exercising calls really do anything? If they are covered calls that means someone owns those shares already and if he exercises they are just transferring ownership based on a set price outlined by the contract.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What? Imagine getting assigned on this call. You would need an insane amount of uncovered calls, from people who couldn't manage to borrow money to cover them (when doing so would literally be free 300% returns). You'd be better off just buying the shares yourself."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us. One of us. Dude you are cray. What was the average premium you payed per contract? I was banking on my $800C before they shorted at $350. But the premiums are outrageous right now. You must have a lot of play money or a lot of confidence.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got my natural sweater
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well then, godspeed broheim!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve got gme call orders placed for the bell. It’s fucking 4 o’clock in the morning but I can’t fall asleep now. The futu dd is way too good.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of strategies he could have used with that bankroll. First he could accumulate GME shares or get free money by selling GME puts, then he could use those shares for a collar or covered calls. He could also use some money and make a debit or calendar spread to reduce his cost basis on a directly bullish position and negate some of the vega which leads to overpriced options. Could do put credit spreads or short strangles to collect premium.... etc. Plenty of strategies out there those are some of the basic ones."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/si567 is right in that someone is selling me these call options. In most cases, it's Citadel since they are the primary options market maker not only for most US securities, but for GME in particular. Since the $800 calls are SO far out of the money with so little time left, they may choose to not hedge them at all and pocked my $950K I gave them, which increases their capital more, theoretically delaying the inevitable pound-them-in-the-ass margin call they so richly deserve. 

I don't trade on margin. The most I can lose is what I deposited into my account ($10K) plus the profits earned. Citadel is rumored to leveraged around 8:1, so a sufficient hit to their profits and liquidity could be a disaster for them (and much of the US equity and options markets...)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, all these sunny quotes"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So buying call options and shares is playing both sides? If the stock crashes you lose on both. Seems pretty one sided.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, the MMs who sold him these calls already delta-hedged by buying the underlying. Exercising doesn’t do anything except throw away all the premium paid on the options. I don’t know where the retards here got that idea"

His break even is $819.04

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If GME hits $600 tomorrow, these calls would be worth about $120 per share, ie $12,000 per contract x 500 contracts = $6,000,000. Less the $950K or so I put down on the position, + about $5M.

If GME hits $600 on MONDAY instead? the calls are worth about $95 a share, ie $9,500 a contract x 500 = $4,750,000, a $3.8M profit.

So... the sooner the better I would say :)

You could guarantee immediate and generous profits in exchange for borrowing their money for a trivially small amount of time.

At best you'd get the same effect or better as if the people holding those options just bought 100 shares each at market price, without paying 4x the going rate. That would drive all those calls to be ITM anyway."

Like growing plants? Sell plant clippings, cheap, easy, and there’s demand if you grow common household stuff. 

Like mushrooms (gourmet)? Set up a tent if you have the space and a house. Start with a smaller one, learn to automate it, and move from there. I have pictures of an entire 10x10 setup and was going to sell at markets pre-covid. 

Flip books on Amazon. It’s really easy, takes a bit of learning, and you can make ok money. Especially if you are somewhere warm that has yard sales all year. You start to learn how they rank sell etc. Its low effort once listed. I’ve sold 10k over the last two years, and went on a binge over 2 months finding books/sending them in. Bought them all for <$150. 

Have a truck? Haul junk. Help people move items they want from Craigslist or pick up mulch from the city for people in the spring.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The weekend that S3 reported that tens of MILLIONS of shares were covered despite no upward price movement meant they just moved their positions to be less visible. IE stop actually borrowing shares, just naked short, buy puts and dump them before your 3/31 reporting deadline, sell naked calls, use Contracts For Difference, use total return swaps (like Archegos). Do stuff the reddit crowd can't sniff out too easily. Squeeze not squoze. High confidence.

The only thing I don't have nailed down is the WHEN.

Citadel is leveraged to the tits at 8 to 1. For NORMAL margin accounts you and I are limited to 2:1 but for 'high risk' stocks like GME and AMC, we must have full cash on hand (to have an equity position). Schwab right now requires 3 to 1 collateral to short a share of GME. So if you want to try to short GME tomorrow morning at $189, you better have $600 in your account for every 1 share you wish to short.  Why on EARTH would they require that much collateral?  Why would SOFI be required to keep equivalent deposits at  JP Morgan for any shares they lend out as part of their fully paid lending program?  Because the train has been barreling down the tracks for months, picking up steam, with every delay tactic employed by MM and hedge funds, they just allow the momentum to build further. The wheels are going to fall off and it will be chaos.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All those things put together don't equate to $5,000 a month. Unless you plan on doing them full time, which means it ain't a side hustle. If it were that easy to make 100K, it wouldn't be the top 5% of earners in America. 

There are much better ways of making money. Invest in a skillset, learn to code, freelance photography, house hacking. Again none of the listed are very easy to do still and require lots of capital upfront. Easy to generate $5,000 if your annual salary is already 6 figs, because you probably have the intelligence / capital to invest in. Making money requires money / time often, that's why the rich get richer."

You're right then but I don't like having locked money for that long with a business I don't fully understand nor feel comfortable holding in my portfolio. Also they would need to raise capital if they want to last more than 3 years. They are changing their busineds model too and that requires investing in infrastructure and qualified people and that costs more money so I don't know too many variables I'm not comfortable with.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because greed. This GME event is a double-black swan fucking a unicorn event that no on modeled.

It's like an onion -- it's got layers. It took time, volume, and price movement to execute and settle these trades, it will take time, volume, and price action to unwind them. 

Edit: adding one of my comments to the post because squeeze not squoze:

**We'll see how many 'shares' are owned by 13F as of the 3/31 cutoff date on 5/15 when 13F must be filed. The shorts have 45 days and counting before all hell breaks loose.**

Why?

Because 'the shorts have closed.' So they say. However, as of 12/31/2020 (per Fintel), Insiders + 13F filers owned 97M of the 70M shares that exist in the world. So statically we can prove a minimum of 27M shares were shorted as of 12/31 without any concern for Finra disclosure 'mistakes'. 

If the 13F filers show that collectively, with the insiders (RC Ventures, et al), as of 3/31 they still owned 100%+ of the entire 70M shares -- **shorts r fuk**.  Because it means they didn't cover a damn thing. 

If anything, retail owns FAR more shares now (3/31) than they did 12/31 -- 3 weeks before GME caught main stream, world wide attention. We've seen HODLers from Europe, NZ, all over. The January RobinHood freeze was the rallying cry for the world.  They all bought. Many held. They didn't sell at $40, why would they have sold now at $190?

I'm putting a clock on this. 45 days and counting."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly it, they doubled down thinking we’d be rational enough to let go when all the signs pointed to shorts covering. They literally took us for apes. Shame we have a few too many wrinkles and followed the breadcrumbs to the shitstorm that’s brewing.

From the hedge funds perspective it was a idea so stupid it might work, and they don’t want to lose against retail in any capacity, so a bit of pride as well"

People keep referencing these iconic stories as some kind of basis for success, but the actual statistic show otherwise. If it were that easy, 100K wouldn't equate to being more wealthy than 94% of earners in America. All I""m saying is that it's not that easy, and it isn't.

**If you want a short version, skim over the images in the post.**

While there have been pieces in the news about what's going on there, it's not reflected in their economy — yet. They are operating at over-lax conditions which has driven the growth in their economy. I tried to look at data from their government for public transportation, crime, etc. to correlate covid cases with each of their phases (making sense of the effectiveness of their **over 10 phases of COVID lockdown, the 10th of which ended in NOVEMBER 2020)** and found it almost purposefully impossible to locate or non-existent - all government data sources I pulled stopped being updated in March of 2020 🧐

Don't think downturn is as imminent. Nifty is a S&P ETF and if you want an early indicator of Nifty, try tracking SGX Nifty from Singapore.

Also, we have vaccinated like 65 million people already. From 1st April, vaccination drive would be in next phase with all 45+ being eligible for vaccination. Currently India is vaccination roughly 10 million people a week and it's only gonna go up. 

The lockdown would be scarce and businesses won't be affected much anymore as the people simply have stopped giving fucks.

2021-04-01 08:08:43,wallstreetbets,"CVS is incredibly undervalued Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine and you’re thinking about how important your health is. Now I may be called a boomer with this pick I can promise you I’m not. CVS Health is the largest healthcare company in the US with about the 4th/5th largest amount of revenue of all companies. They are projected to earn about $7.50 this year and over $8 next year which at the current price of $75 in insanely cheap in a market seeing the overall market trading at ~25x earnings.

Why is so cheap you may ask? Well I’d argue it’s for two reasons 1) Constant fear around Amazon 2) Concern they paid too much for Aetna a few years back. People always fear the unknown and it’s usually from a place of misunderstanding. Let’s take Amazon first. Amazon awhile back said they were going to get into Healthcare and formed a venture with Berkshire and JPM called Haven. I think CVS stock and others dropped 15% on the news when first announced. Now these are big companies and if anyone is going to upend the model it would be them. Well flash forward a few years and they disbanded the operation citing it was too challenging or something like that. This past year Amazon also made news by launching Amazon Pharmacy and more recently Amazon Telehealth for employers. I get what you’re thinking oh no here they come it’s over. This is absolutely hilarious if you actually understood how CVS makes money. Let me tell you how:

CVS has a few primary businesses: CVS Caremark, CVS Aetna, and CVS retail.

CVS Caremark is the largest drug dealer in the US. They are what is referred to as a PBM or prescription benefit manager. As an employer whether it be a public government agency or private employer like Amazon you go through a PBM to acquire your drug benefit coverage for your employees. CVS has thousands of employers ironically including Berkshire, JPM, and Amazon as clients. There are really only three main players in the space (Optum, Express Scripts, and Caremark) which are owned by United Health, Cigna, and CVS which also happen to be health insurers which we’ll get to later. This is where scale really matters. As an employer you want to give your employees the cheapest drugs. As a PBM you use your purchasing power across your customers to buy drugs from manufacturers at the lowest cost. This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry. Caremark probably buys almost 1/3 of the drugs dispensed in this country. This is why I laugh when I think about the Amazon fears. There is no way they could ever reach the scale of buying power to price drugs low enough to entice employers and government agencies to switch. Unless they’re throwing in a free Prime membership for everyone I think it’s basically impossible for them to break in unless they buy one of the big 3. So what is Amazon Pharmacy you ask? Amazon Pharmacy is just a re-branding of Amazon Pillpack their mail order pharmacy they acquired a few years back. Is it not a threat? Not in the least and that goes back to the pricing model many people don’t understand. Let me explain. If you’re covered by Caremark as an employee of say Wells Fargo you can go anywhere to fill your prescription...CVS, Walgreens, Walmart, Costco, or even Amazon. However if you go onto GoodRx and enter your insurance info you’ll see that there are a variety of prices for the same drug. It will always be cheapest at CVS as Caremark will give CVS the best rates. What’s better is all those other places actually pay CVS to be included in their network and have access to their PBM network. So if you fill at Walgreens they make money and if you fill at CVS they make more money. So when people say Walgreens is just a drug store but CVS is more than a drugstore this is part of it. Walgreens and other places you fill drugs don’t have PBMs that represent a huge % of America’s insured.

Now let’s get to the real undervalued gem in their business Aetna. Aetna is the health insurance side of the business and fastest growing. This is the other part of the equation for employee benefits and again same major players in United Healthcare and Cigna. This business encompasses health and dental insurance. Aetna was acquired a few years back in one of the largest acquisitions and largely funded by debt. As you can imagine Wall St hated the deal except for the bankers that did it of course. What’s crazy is CVS was surprised and ecstatic that the deal even closed as it was heavily scrutinized by the Justice department at the time. What I would say about a deal that large is no Board would sign off on that if there wasn’t huge upside to the deal. I mean talk about YOLO let’s borrow a ton of money ($60B) and buy a company. If you are doing that there better be 3x or more the upside, right? So what was Wall St missing? Well first you have to understand the health insurance business which is the same premise as any insurance business which is to insure against risks. Geico insures you against a major car accident while Aetna insures you against a major medical surgery or cancer treatment. What many people don’t understand is the #1 cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance. Yes exercise but more so taking your medication. I like to say this is akin to Geico being able to tap your breaks if you start to speed in your car. CVS has your health data and if you’re an Aetna member they’re insuring you. So CVS can use that data to intervene early to prevent a major medical event they’d have to pay out on down the road. This is a win/win for all involved and is how CVS is going to change healthcare. I mean this is a health flywheel that will just allow them to win more business.

Where I’m most excited for them is for their Health Hub strategy. If you are unfamiliar think of it as urgent care within CVS stores. Why I’m most excited is because of what it allows them to do that their competitors can’t. I’m a parent and my wife and I have had many ear infections that we’ve had to run to the Little Clinic which is a similar concept you may have seen in Fry’s grocery stores. Today with our insurance an ear infection and a Little Clinic visit is about $75. Well Aetna is rolling out $0 co-pay plans for these acute care needs at Health Hub stores. $0 is pretty nice! So next time we have an ear infection we can roll up to a CVS Health Hub and get the kiddos checked out, pick up the script for meds, and pick up a bottle of wine for us on the way out. This has huge implications for the industry that nobody is quite grasping yet. It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits. Just today they said by 2030 they are looking to do 75 billion health interactions. For reference Teladoc did 15M last year in a pandemic year. 

So hopefully I’ve cleared up a lot of misconceptions about CVS and the true business they are in along with who their true competitors are. They are really in an oligopoly with 3 players who have paid the price of admission which is having a PBM and Health Insurance business combination. If Amazon truly wanted to play in this space my belief is that they’d have to acquire one of the 3 as they would have to buy business to compete with the scale/spend on drugs. I honestly think they realized with Haven that this is a tough nut to crack. So oligopoly businesses are usually good to invest in but the one you want to own is CVS because they have a monopoly in stores. There is a CVS within a few miles of everyone in the US which allows them to unlock a lot of value that people have written off as useless before.

Valuation:
Currently trading at $75 which is ~10 earnings in a market that is over 25x. So it’s way too cheap here but this isn’t a stock to YOLO weekly calls on this is stock to own for a long time. A couple years back they put out an investor presentation showing 10% EPS growth annually past 2022. The best part is it was based on 28% tax rates so tax increases baked in. If you actually model this out this decade you’re talking $19+ dollars EPS in 2030. Throw a 15-20 multiple on that and you’re at $300+. Now I know stocks were going up like that in a month (ahem GME) but for the most part investors shouldn’t ever expect those returns overnight. SP500 annual avg. return is 10% and with where valuations and interest rates are at I suspect we’ll be lucky this decade to average that. So going back to CVS at current price of $75 with $300+ at end of this decade in the cards that works out to a pretty nice avg annualized return of close to 20% assuming you reinvest the dividends. And people might scoff at the thought of them doing double digit EPS growth but if you look up pre Aetna they did just that. Even if they fall short you might see 15% avg annualized which as an investor you can’t expect much better.

Would love to hear everyone’s thoughts!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should wait for the dip. Looking at the past four months the stock goes up, and then down.

Nov 23rd 66.78 - Dec 4 74.50
Dec 28 68.08 - Jan 11 73.99
Mar 2nd 68.13 - March 16 75.07

Next time it goes on sale load up on calls.
Do at 70 sell at 75.

Rn the price of the stock is 75 and atm 75.50c April 23rd cost 1.75.   1.75/75=2.3% of the price of stock. So atm three weeks out cost about 2.3% but let's say 2.5% to have some room for error.

At 70 the calls should cost 70*.025=1.75(cause we bumped it .2% to have room for error.)

When it goes back to 75 the profit will be 75-1.75-70=$3.25 per call

So let's say we buy 50 lots that is 5,000 calls it would cost altogether 8,750 your return would be 5,000*5=25,000 for a net profit of 25,000-8,750=16,250

Easy low risk two bagger. Thanks for this. Could probably make this a four or five bagger by upping the risk and going 2  or 3 dollars otm.

Low risk for wsb. I'm going do math for further otm will update post

So using the 77c 4/23 as a proxy it cost .91 so when the stock is below 70 three weeks out & $2 otm should cost less then .91 for the 72c while at 70.

110 lots of 100 is going cost 10,010
Return at 75 would be 75-72=3*110*100=33,000
Net profit=33,000-10,010=22,990

So atm would be a little less then doubling your money while doing $2otm would double it plus a little extra. I don't think that is really worth the added risk, especially if it doesn't get to 75 and only goes to 74 or if you wanted to be safe and close at 74 it would take off a huge part of the return.

Don't forget extrinsic value. The pattern usually is abt 2 weeks so should still have time left to them when you sell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a great company and fairly valued, but it's definitely a defensive stock (an Intelligent Investor kind of stock) so you can't really expect massive tendies."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not going to comment on the rest of this but, that’s not how goodrx works. It’s a coupon/discount card, not insurance. The whole point is it saves uninsured people money on some of their medications so they can actually afford to get them (only in America smh). Insurance usually beats the prices that goodrx advertises. 

Source: Pharmacist that recently escaped the hellhole that is CVS."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im in it, but for slightly different reasons.

Main difference is the ""cheap valuation part"".  That business has shit net profit margins at \~2% (dog shit) and shit roic. That´s what gives them those multiples. So even if they manage to squezze out some profit margin, it´s hard to deploy that capital effectively.

So for me the biggest question is, whether they can fix that or not. Thats where your DD is doing a good job at looking at future potential.

"" This is why these 3 companies have an impenetrable moat in this industry ""

"" cause of a major medical expense is usually preventive maintenance ""

"" Hopefully most of you are getting your vaccine  ""

"" It also has huge implications for the retail part of their business that will drive a ton more foot traffic and profits ""

I would also add that having the insurance and pharmacy and the doctor in the same company has pricing efficencies. Not sure how american healthcare works, but usually the those three things should go together.

Now when this plays out nicely,  -> //For the ""cheap valuation part"", that business has shit net profit margins at \~2% (dog shit) and shit roic. So even if they manage to squezze out some profit margin, it´s hard to deploy that capital effectively.//

This problem might be solved and they can start getting into the make money -> invest money -> make more money cycle.

And from a long term perspective, the demographics should play extremly well into their hands.

And the last point: They seem to have been mismanaged a bit in the past and missed out on big developments, like delivery, telehealth and improving customer health to cut insurance costs and so on but with the new management women, I think they will have a good shot of being up to date and not just profit of their size."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is an interesting post because I had this thought when I went to get my vaccine for le rona. The whole time thinking goddamn CVS is about to rack up dough from insurance companies as they bill them for vaccine doses. This is of course on top of their general pharmaceutical business and the shit they sell in store....maybe it’s time to dip my dick in CVS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"From a technical analysis perspective;

It seems overvalued, and that would explain why it's trading near the 52week high.... Maybe it's in a breakout and uptrending phase indefinitely though? Trickery?+

They've been reporting lower gains for 3 quarters now, despite being a leader of testing.

Also, 3month shows a reverse head and shoulders, historically a good signal for a ramp up. I haven't seen any reason for a downtrend.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rite Aid is a much more exciting play in the pharmacy space.   If everything in this CVS DD piece comes to pass to perfection, maybe your money grows 25% in one to two years.  Meanwhile, RAD has a breakup value around double the current share price with little or no downside from here (—Rite Aid market cap is barely above one billion).  With RAD having such a low market cap, you also have a better than average chance the company gets bought out for a hefty premium.  

Finally, Rite Aid has only 55 million shares outstanding.  So it takes only a relatively small amount of buying interest to drive RAD stock up 50% or more.

If you’re looking to earn a safe 5% per year on your money, CVS or WBA are definitely the way to go in the pharmacy space.  But if you are looking to double your money or better this year, Rite Aid is the only bet to take in the pharmacy sector."

This is our commitment and I’m excited about the journey ahead to make it a reality."" That's a pretty bold statement; if she pulls it off (or even comes close) this stock could fly.  
2. Simply Wall St rates $CVS undervalued by 52%. Their estimate of a fair price is $157.  
3. One of the their directors, Edward Ludwig, just bought 3,000 shares at a price of $72.  
4. They pay a 2.6% dividend.

Thanks for the DD OP. I like value plays; will be buying some shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR: Stonk = Up

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just sold my shares after holding for about 12 months. Went from mid-50s to mid-70s. Zacks has downgraded CVS from Buy to Hold and Fidelity's score has been fluctuating but is still around 9 (out of 10).

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"cvs is shady !  
i have a prescription for genuine viagra, they changed me prescription to generic viagra and want my insurance to pay for it.  i guess they make more margin / profits on generic drugs.  but i don't want no freaking generic.  there's a reason why genuine viagra cost so much more, i just feel more comfortable taking genuine.  i only use it on special occasions :)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is how I think too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's how Im playing it as well. Puts making okay tendies then going calls on the swing up. Someone posted this a few weeks ago and came to a similar conclusion if you want any of that sweet confirmation bias
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean sure it’s no small cap that’s going to double overnight but I believe this market is to the point where it’s going to get real hard to make money on the long side. These kinds of stocks will be the winners. If you compound your money 15-20% for next 10 years you’ll be doing better than most.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, most of us here are looking for a good payday to get the ball rolling because we're smart enough to know our 2k or 5k or 10k isn't enough money to really worry about. It's a lot, because we worked hard for it, but it's also not a lot at all.

Once I pull 10-20k off a nice option play, then I can afford to fiddle with 5% growth.

I'm just saying it doesn't make someone ""not smart""... It's just self awareness."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m investing right now. Yes takes awhile to digest/integrate. I actually like T here too but not as much upside as CVS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How did it turn out?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean sure there will always be people that want to go to Walgreens but they will drive traffic to stores via their Health Hubs and through their PBM which may in future require you to pickup your prescription at a CVS. There will always be upset consumers like you but their competition can’t compete is the investment point I’m trying to make.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,As in...do I own a lot of their stock? Yes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah buy CVS over Walgreens. Two completely different businesses. Not saying Walgreens is bad and cheap here too but won’t see the same returns long term b/c doesn’t have a PBM/Health insurance arm
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You gotta re read the entire thing brother your question is already answered

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and Aetna and Health Hubs are a game changer. I mean it’s a big company that I believe offers fear returns this decade
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does walgreens even sell boots?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well hopefully you didn’t buy weekly calls like I said not to. This is a buy and hold and dollar cost average kind of investment. I like most people have no idea what stocks will day to day minute by minute. Stock getting cheaper is a good thing you can buy more at lower prices!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well hope it works out for you. I can never tell which stocks have “immediate upside” but I still think CVS is cheap at 10x earnings with market at 25x. Long term 10 years it’s got potential for $300+. If I’m wrong and it’s $225 that’s still an average return better than market for last 100 years and most people can’t beat market. So 10x earnings or market at 25x 🤔

At this point they have to announce that they lost the contracts to distribute the vaccine to go up. Trump named them on project warp speed and all it did was to go down.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe 80C. I got 85 rn and def eating theta. I downgraded from 100c to 90c to 85c in February.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just pointing out a down side to their fundamentals.  I can be on board with dropping the tobacco products from their inventory - a huge cash loss - because of the mission of the company.

If you’re maxing our your IRA in an index fund or even Cathie Wood’s ARKK and this is play money have fun. Buying options is not investing though and you should expect you’ll lose a lot one day or in minutes.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody ever means to lose money but buying options increases your chances b/c as you point out more than one way to lose. Not trying to preach but actually just trying to warn people from making same mistakes I have. I once lost $250k on Apple puts. Turns out a month later my thesis played out and stock tanked. (iPhone 5 flop) I’ve learned that investing for the long term is only real chance at building wealth. Gambling on options is just that gambling. At some point your luck runs out and they go to $0 and it may have just been you didn’t go out far enough and time decay got you.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry but I don’t think you got the lesson at all, lol. Invest for the long term is the lesson! If you want to trade do it after you’ve maxed your IRA in diversified investments. All good though I’ve been there myself but just take a step back for a second and ask if you’re wisely investing your hard earned money or speculating on risky trades. Your future self will probably thank you for that moment of clarity"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you can get good premiums on covered calls. Easily enough that you can sell 1.5 calls and even if they're exercised you'll come out on top. honestly you're not in a bad position at all. 

the stocks a dog too so 1.5 probably won't even happen. So you can keep selling covered calls till you recoup your money. 

I have 700 shares at avg of 1.30 specifically for the purpose of selling covered calls."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tilray is the most popular and likely to moon. It’s done it twice before. With NYC legalizing and the merger closer than ever I she’s she’s about to pop.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Even though they don’t have any operations in New York State or anywhere else in the United States you’re gonna argue that that’s a better player than companies that are already established there and making money? Just because something popular doesn’t make it correct.... The framers of the United States Constitution (for example) had to keep in mind that the public as a mass are stupid and irrational and even addressed it within the federalists papers. What is popular isnt always best and in the case of weed stocks if you look at the numbers it’s pretty obvious that they are inferior. This is not my opinion this is facts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I’m fully aware. I’m hear for a good time, this thing will rocket past every other weed stock. It has the public’s love. It’s proven it time and time again. You gotta strap yourself to the rocket and hold on baby.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The biggest problem is all of the big partnerships and news that they have announced lately they did just before the ticker change. If they just waited a few days all that news would have made it rocket.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Think so? Put your ThetaGang research to work and sell naked calls....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You are correct. However most other spacs went up considerably and then “sold the news”. PSFE did not have a huge run like the others. Most of the good news lately came during a down market and didn’t move the price much.

2021-04-01 06:37:08,wallstreetbets,"[$VIACA] Ultimate Rebound Potential TL;DR: VIAC**A** has the potential to 2x/3x in a similar fashion to DISC**B**.

ViacomCBS (VIAC, VIACA) and Discover (DISCA, DISCB) have taken a beating, driven by share dilution and the  *Archegos* Capital Management liquidation fiasco. The majority of the sell pressure was not organic, but driven by Billions of dollars in block trades that were executed on Friday 3/26.

Fast forward to this morning, DISCB rebounded and closed with a 83% INCREASE...and was up over 100% at one point today. Trading was so volatile that it was halted **10x** today: [https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts](https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/trader.aspx?id=TradeHalts)

Now why is this important for VIACA? Lets look at Discovery Class A vs. Class B shares...and what happened.

ViacomCBS and Discovery Class A shares were the ones block traded due to the **Archegos Capital Management** [margin call-related liquidation](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/discoverys-class-b-shares-spike-80percent-in-unusual-move.html?__source=sharebar%7Ctwitter&par=sharebar). These shares are much more liquid and trade in higher volumes. Since the company’s Class B shares typically trade with less volume, and insider ownership (%float, more on the in a minute) is higher, this presents a better catalyst for a run-up.

Some key metrics:

||VIAC|VIACA|DISCA|DISCB|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|Shares Outstanding|587M|52M|162M|6.5M|
|Float|555M|555M|447M|447M|
|% Insider|4.12%|79.4%|2.84%|95%|
|% Institution|94.6%|16.5%|143.5%|7.4%|
|Shares Short (%Float)|102M (18.8%)|88k (1.7%)|46M (33%)|1k (0.4%)|

As you can see from the above table, both VIACA and DISCB are primarily owned by INSIDERS! This means they are **less likely to sell!** i.e. less liquidity! This means less volume can move the price upwards, evident by DISCB performance today. DISCB Average Volume: 3349 vs. Today:  **1,324,372...a 39445% INCREASE.**

Why is VIACA primed to fit the same narrative. The numbers closely match DISCB and we know short interest exists.

More Bullish Sentiment:

Fund closed all put positions and opened calls and bought shares after the Archegos Capital liquidation event.

[Fund Closed Puts, Opened Shares & Calls](https://preview.redd.it/4uaswyon3hq61.png?width=1887&format=png&auto=webp&s=bf5c783987033e401ca600deb53466e56e17ef39)

Primary Play: Buy and Hold VIACA (Class A Shares) (need the volume), Secondary Play: Call Options (IV still below 100 at this time).

I'll be loading up at market open. Will post positions.

*EDIT 1: NOTE: NOTHING IN THIS POST IS FINANCIAL ADVICE*"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stoners like discovery plus, thier wives love tlc. We like these stonks"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll wait the peak tomorrow to buy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really great DD, but I think you might be missing 2 points. Firstly, from what I read, the 95% of shares owned by insiders for DISCB was owned by 1 guy, so illiquidity was cranked up to the max there and secondly, the average volume for DISCB was incredibly small 3,300 shares is amazing. VIACA has avg volume 71 times that. Today VIACA's volume was already 4x than normal and it still went down 5% just like normal VIAC shares. I'm not saying it won't go up like DISCB I just think these are solid differences that might prevent it from 2 or 3xing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,VIACA has options while DISCB doesn't.  Gonna watch this for the next few days.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m balls deep in VIAC instead of VIACA am I fuk or will I just not get as much tendies
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just went balls deep on this one.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If everyone just buys calls on VIACA, will that be enough? Wouldn't buying shares help?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So for clarification, what play for Viacom would be better with buying a call. VIAC or VIACA???"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta count me out on this one cause I have viac and a sell there now to buy viaca will cause wash sale and I don't wanna end up like that fool who made 45k with a 800k tax bill lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, they had to sell of massive amounts of it to cover/execute their other shorts?

Tech analysis is way out of whack, so that would be a really good indicator...

52week average would be $57.50, and it's still $10 below that"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just placed an order for 50 4/16 viac 70c. Wouldve done more but i am bad at keeping powder dry. Got a good feeling about it. Or thats the rum typing. Whatever. Remind me on the tenth to check them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"ViacomCBS definitely has rebound potential, but I’m not sure VIACA options are the best move. The options are rather illiquid just looking at the bid-ask spread. VIAC on the other hand has far tighter spreads and have far more volume. 

I’ll bite and pick up some May 21 $50 and $60 calls after seeing how strong the rebound was on DISCB.

Edit: And straight fucking down she goes"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This could be fun I’m getting in

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just bought some May 21st 45’s 

Chance for a massive rebound"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For those following. Position is 60 shares at $48.17 and 2x May 60c. May add more this afternoon.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm considering VIACA, but I'ma wait until I see at least a little life out of it. I will buy 1 share to do my part, however."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe the float is total for all classes.  Here’s the breakdown for  Discovery from their recent 10-Q.

160,318,208

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question op, why did discb bounce back and disca didn't?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD, but my only question is about the 1.7% SI in the stock.. isnt that going to hinder the run up? I understand what happened with DISCB but not sure why the small amount of SI doesnt matter in this case"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Discb was a short squeeze cause someone sired the wrong disc stock
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They're gonna short VIAC to $20 fam sorry
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,..... have you been following me. Jeez man spot on.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like true WSB fashion, buy the peak :)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great information. I tried researching insider ownership and came up empty. For both Viacom and Discovery. Do you have any more details on this? 

I agree the share dilution was a kicker. But if I recall correctly it was only about 5% of the float...not much considering and if it helps them with marketing/etc. in the long run it may turn into a positive."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And what about the massive amount of shares they just issued? Shit’s not going anywhere with that dilution.

-🌈🐻"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, option leverage available will make this interesting."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're going somewhat long, and looking to enhance portfolio with a good stock, no you did good. If you're trying to play the rocket game and chase tendies, VIACA seems to be the better play short term. But this is highly dependant on how much traction it gains and how fast."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a few calls for VIAC also.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Por que no los dos?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Feel you man I Went Balls deep in DISCA early today so I’m probably f’ed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, exactly. Buying shares in this case will be the catalyst."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good question. Actually great question. When I was a boy in Bulgaria...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Historically both trend the same. But the play here is to follow DISCB trend by controlling more of the float creating a squeeze. This is more likely to occur with VIACA.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going long, better decision is VIAC. Chasing rockets, gambling, etc, VIACA."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$VIACA, imo"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid move. Holding you VIAC shares will help with overall ownership of the total float.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How about you just stop trading viac 30 days before new year and youre good
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How the hell did that happen? Can you link the post or comment about it?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Archegos had a large stake in both Viacom and Discovery, when the fund got liquidated both stocks went along for the ride. 

Thanks for adding the TA aspect."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang was never shorting these stocks. He was jacked to the tits with leveraged long positions.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha! Might be the rum. I'm looking to go a little longer on options. Probably May 21...this give almost 2 months and allows for earnings. I expect the recovery to occur faster, but want some wiggle room."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There could still be some sellers left to clear out, but it looks like most of it is has passed. I am sitting tight for at least a week."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What dates?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you have losses in VIAC? I played the put game coming down.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Less shares for institutions and retail to buy causing a squeeze. I do expect DISCA to recover eventually.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey op, thanks and I am retarded"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,*Are you stalking me?  Cuz that'd be super.*
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,1) I don't think the new shareholders can sell due to the lockup; 2) the dilution event is now past; 3) $VIACA has a lot fewer shares outstanding; 4) Most are owned by those who want to vote (i.e. large institutions) and arbitrageurs.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point, I think it was only about 6% dilution though, and the plus side is now they have almost $3 Billion to get them through the transition to streaming, definitely short-term pain for long-term growth, the market clearly didn't like the dilution though, without archegos it still would have been down a ton"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What options are you looking at?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for feeding my confirmation bias

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I'll buy some shares initially and wait to see what happens. I've burned a lot of money gambling on calls 😭
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"wouldn't you want to go with VIAC since there's more volume? or are you saying that VIACA has less outstanding float, so any trades are going to affect it proportionally more than the same trade would affect VIAC?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Some loss. But have gains on other. Will be dirt bag holding until it hit my sell limit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not entirely convinced the share offering prompted the initial drop...I suspect the Archegos liquidation actually started earlier than advertised. Both DISCA and VIAC trend the same following the share announcement around the 23rd, which also mirrors the drop that TME saw.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,VIACA April 16 $70C $0.30 but other posts are saying there are big differences between DISCB and VIACA.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Feel like a retard with a $45 yolo average cause I thought it was going to pop off like discB but nope
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same with the Viacom’s but the volume does make a difference
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I hope he's able to make a deal with the IRS.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not so sure he was making an ARB trade. He did not directly own the either stock and the trades were unwound on Friday and Monday prior to DISCB ripping on Tuesday and Wednesday. 

WSJ and FT have both said he was purely long and have not mentioned any arb strategy being implemented, which is why all his holdings were being liquidated as all his positions were moving against him, including companies like FTCH. The banks themselves were essentially delta hedging by owning the underlying, but when they realized that Hwang couldn’t pay-up, they were left holding the bag. 

Maybe I’m wrong, but Hwang didn’t exactly get rich making arb plays. He got rich using inside information and gambling like a WSB degenerate."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Source 1: How Bill Hwang got back into banks’ good books — then blew them up  https://on.ft.com/3fpmicY 

FT says he was exclusively in CFDs and long. No mention of an arb play. 

Source 2: https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-is-a-total-return-swap-and-how-did-archegos-capital-use-it-11617125839

WSJ also says he was net long and makes no mention of arb.

If he was using an arb strategy, he would have been able to meet margin calls before forced liquidation. As you mention DISCB mooned as the position was un-wound, but timeline wise that doesn’t align with DISCB’s rally. It also wouldn’t make sense since a few of his positions only had one share class available."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that's a good point, I forgot about the front weeklies. I almost played those but I was too scared. Happy about that decision now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin right there with you bud. Let’s go!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you might be right... It could be a combination of the share offering + the 10 downgrades from analysts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hodl

Ape together stronk"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The IV crush + decay will eat you alive if you don’t time the rebound correctly, if there even is one. Wouldn’t recommend buying weeklies on this at all. 

Kind of already regret buying May & June $50 calls because the IV crush today was really strong. I may just close them early so I can bet more on UPS $170/$180 May and June calls for their upcoming ER."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean if time decay is your concern, I'm not sure why rolling to farther dated options is better.

The entire premise of the $VIACA trade is that the selling/shorting gets cleaned up from very known and visible forced sellers. Judging from the volume, that should be almost through. Buying extra duration seems like a waste of money so I don't understand why you'd want May and Junes. The trade will already be a success or failure long before then imo."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"When comparing expiries, I would disagree. VIAC 4/16 $50 is -34.31% today while the May expiry is -18.31%. That’s quite a big difference since decay accelerates as the expiry date approaches. 

As for the premise of the VIACA trade:

•The rally may start after your weekly expiry. 

•Longer duration can participate in a rally longer and deliver far more upside over the span of multiple days/weeks. 

•Longer duration has more room for error and more money is preserved as it carries extrinsic value.

•Longer duration has more influence on prices"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The spreads are wide and vol is high, so looking at the daily move difference isn't something I find valuable for this exercise. The highest dollar bang is in near dateds, which is most important for me.

You are right, maybe a rally starts in three weeks and I miss. I find that highly unlikely given the magnitude of the volume traded so far but it's certainly possible. If sellers wanted out, they should be about out by now, so again I don't think that's a high probability event. It either works soon or it won't at all.

For that reason, buying excessive duration is a waste of money. I don't want exposure to a 90 vol option for long. That's giving money away and you are exposing yourself to the risk of vol crush for much longer. I don't agree with you that there is more room for error in longer dateds with high vol.

To each his own. Good luck."

2021-04-01 06:07:14,wallstreetbets,"Why Has There Been Two Days Of $100+ Billion In Reverse Repo Operations? Over the last few days, there has been a crazy surge in same day reverse repo operations at the NY Fed.

What are these Reverse Repos you ask, and I ask too BTW, but according to the NY Fed:

*""  The New York  Fed conducts repo and reverse repo operations each day as  a  means to help keep  the federal funds rate in the target range set  by  the* [*Federal Open  Market Committee (FOMC)*](https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomc.htm)*.  ""*

So large banks and institutions can exchange with the Fed money to help control the money supply. **Gotcha.**

Ok, and to see how much has been traded recently:

Honestly,  I came across something online citing  and wanted to see what others  thought. Steven Van Metre, Bond King from his videos, comments as it being too much cash in  circulation, though also in the same video cites a tweet about the IMO  saying there is a global shortage of the US dollar?

And  I understand that with the SLR exemption expiring, banks need to lower  their capital, however I don't think (I don't think alot actually  regardless) that lending the Fed billions overnight would actually help  banks comply.

Or is this in anyway linked to the shit going down with over leverage?

**TLDR:**

* Wrinkled Brain Apes, why are institutions exchanging CRAZY amounts with the FED to borrow treasury notes overnight?
* And why would Institutions WANT to trade billions for short term loans of treasury notes?

Edit: [ELI5 Thread With Excellent Comments Explaining Why This Can Happen At End of Quarter To Help Banks Pay Taxes](https://www.reddit.com/r/SecurityAnalysis/comments/d64tie/eli5_repo_rates_how_they_work_and_what_the_heck/)

\- Some comments also seem to imply that when Banks get worried about the market they do this to shift into more secure investments.

\- Another possibility I've read is that Banks will purchase a shit ton of Bonds before the quarter ends to make their balance sheets look WAY safer than it actually is...

\- Finding some stuff on the Overnight Repo Issues of Sept 2019 when the rate spiked up to 10%, but overnight repo rates currently have been flat (0.05 as of last Friday)

\- Repo Market depends pretty much on 4 banks (BoA, Citi, JPMorgan,WF) and liquidity issues back in Sept 2019 caused a fuss because of the Liquidity Rule and banks not having enough cash to follow the rule and to lend out, so the repo rate shot up back then.

\- Other theory I've read, Banks are fighting with FED, as always, and want the Liquidity Rule raised and the FED wants to sell bonds to pay for stimmies and Biden's infrastructure. Banks use the borrowed T-Notes to keep bond interest down so no one wants to buy government bonds. Not sure if this summation is correct, but it would be similar to Banks shorting the bond market.

\-- Yep, this is looking more and more like the case, but even weirder with Banks loaning HF's money and negative interest rates to get more treasurey notes, still reading more on this one....

\--> If Bond interest rates keep going up, then prices for them will go down. If Banks buy up treasuries and then sell them on the treasury market, they can buy them back at a later date after interest rates have risen, AT A LOWER PRICE, banks keep the difference, BUT if there's a shortage of TNotes, OR if interest rates start falling again, Banks have to buy them back at higher prices, which....  ------> This is gonna need a whole new post, this is getting DEEP.

\---> Yea, this is atobitt's stuff definitely, [READ THEIR POST about the shorting of the bond market and the short squeeze for TNotes](https://www.reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mgucv2/the_everything_short/)

&#x200B;

[Edit for April 1st, Reverse Repo's came down to 9.5 Billion as of latest info. So this lends credence to just banks wanting tnotes on the end of quarter balance sheets, and less towards the end of the world... I think.](https://preview.redd.it/607tls3qboq61.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=25131f4af8185efc3fcfd171aca40f0ba9dd2814)

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's probably the SLR. Banks can't have so many treasuries on their books anymore, but they have SO many treasuries they can't just unload them all at once, so they're doing reverse repos to get them off their books temporarily.

... I think.

*Bites a crayon*"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Too much cash in the system. Fed uses this facility to place a floor under interest rates, to reduce the incentives for counter parties to lend to one another at negative rates. No one would lend negative when you can use this facility at 0.00%. At the March FOMC meeting they raised the cap on the facility from $30B to $80B, which is why you’re seeing a big increase in usage. 

The facility is a little more intuitive when it’s not paying 0.00%. When the Fed raises rates to 0.25% to 0.50% they will use this facility at 25 bps to stop people from lending to one another at say 15 bps and pulling Fed Funds below their target range of 0.25% to 0.50%."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bonds are at a pretty low interest, and like you said, they are safer in the event of a market crash. I also don't think there is any shortage of the us dollar since 20% of what's in circulation was printed in the last year"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/atobitt is this related to your thesis
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They're shorting treasuries
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's probably because those banks need those short term treasuries (even for a day) because they are valuable collateral used in the repo market. There is a liquidity crisis that is unfolding, foreign nations are selling US bonds (bond yields rising) to get dollars. Dollars and short term treasuries are needed for the global financial system."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that's a circumstantial amount today [https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mhiqa9/biden\_calls\_for\_100\_billion\_to\_expand\_us/](https://www.reddit.com/r/politics/comments/mhiqa9/biden_calls_for_100_billion_to_expand_us/)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a friend in banking who recently told me people are pulling out large amounts of cash across the board. He was commenting how weird it was because it was happening across many branches. Maybe that is related to what is going on?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/atobitt might know
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem he describes is too many dollars on deposit in the US banking system, and not enough circulating globally.

Also, treasuries are the golden collateral. Hence why they need them."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just means that overnight rates started to get jacked again so the fed stepped in and did a bunch of business in one of the banking sectors to keep that rates where they were. Assets spoil and banks get scared to hold them, even overnight so the rates go up and can sometimes skyrocket if left to the different banks to set prices. The fed doesn’t have to worry about an asset spoiling on its book so it can buy it, hold it, and insure it. Which keeps prices in check."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fighting the fed, what could go wrong?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean? Can someone explain in in a very simple way to this retard?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fed is not paying for stimulus, Stimulus is a goverment issue, Fed is a private institution. So your stimulus checks most likely would come from the treasury, and the fed is not selling bonds, they are buying bonds, example from the treasury that issue the bonds so they can pay for the stimulus.  


Also the fed has no money and are allowed to buy whatever the fuck they want, so they do not ""want"" to sell. They do not ever need to sell anything cause they can't go bust. They sell when it's appropriate to do so, if ever."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In case no one answered...this is a benign story. The Fed raised its maximum amounts to lend in reverse repos in mod March allowing money market funds with too much cash to take advantage of overnight reverse repos. This provides a short term, safe place for money marker funds to keep money overnight. 

We could of course debate longer term implications but it’s a normal Fed open market operation to stabilize money market funds.

Edit: to add more context it is in large part to kee rates from going negative, something the Fed said it was not prepared to do."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Massive funds have rules that they have to follow about holdings.

For example, if federal banks are only allowed 500 million in Tech Stock ownership; and their 500 million investment makes gains and goes up to 600 million, then they have to liquidate 100 million.

If they're only allowed 1.5T cash on hand, and then they also have to liquidate 1T assets, then they have to move the excess 1T elsewhere. Perhaps into US debt bonds.

The rules are explicit and very strict with any sort highest-level money management.

I'm trying to stay fair in looking through posts and online resources, but it's seems like when this happens (banks borrowing treasury notes) it points to Banks thinking they're going to NEED them, either because everyone is going to start buying, OR because they'll need to cash them in themselves.

And I'm hoping to God that a wrinkled brain ape comments something that sets me straight, because otherwise this looks like Banks are expecting to be hit, or investors are going to start buying bonds by the truckload if the market falls."

2021-04-01 05:03:36,wallstreetbets,"VIAC, Archegos gets blown up creating a huge opportunity Hello fellow Apes,

GME is a great play and we must hold, but something else very interesting has happened in the market in the past week. The Hedge fund Archegos  got blown up when VIAC did an offering at 85 a share and the stock took a hit. They were leveraged 20x over according to some sources.  When this happened  Goldman Sachs Group Inc. liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks of VIAC on their behalf, causing the stock to plummet taking out a ton of stop losses on the way down. This stock is solid it has a great balance sheet and just made 3 billion more cash on an offering that they could by back for 1.5 billion a few days later due to the hedge fund getting blown out of the water. Nothing fundamental has changed with the value of this stonk it is an amazing value right now.

Take a look at what has happened with another one of their holdings DISCB climbing like crazy now after the dip. Now are we going to let the institutions, that are buying as many shares as they can while attempting to keep the price around 45 to cause Max pain for options buyers, take all these free tendies or are you guys going to buy shares with me and ride this stonk back to the moon?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also started a position. VIAC just launched paramount+ which surprisingly has a shit ton of shows people care about from MTV, comedy central and Nickelodeon. There is a ton of content. I see a way for them to translate out of being a broadcaster and into being a streaming service with gobs of content to start and cash streams to purchase and produce more. Little by little HULU has lost content I enjoy and it's showing up in places like HBOMAX and now paramount+. 

I get to watch beavis and butt-head, aeon flux, and ren and stumpy and the kids get all their fave old and new nickelodeon shows like SpongeBob.


Not thrilled about the debt, but that won't be a problem for long if they lock down subscriber counts.

Just adding to get more visibility on this play."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the idea. I wonder if GS has an option in that specific situation to just take stock or must they liquidate. Just thinking along the lines of a margin call for me would be without a question sold. For them to take on that big of a position without planning or checkboxes probly breaks some of their own / or federal rules. Don’t know shit but it’s worth watching for sure.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started positions in VIAC and DISCA, completely agree with your take, next week it should start returning to higher levels"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCB is a totally different situation. Only 5% of the float was tradeable so today was a huge short squeeze. It's price is now higher than pre-Archegos blow up. I don't know if VIAC will go up or down, but do not expect it to move in the same way as DISCB."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, I gotta be honest with ya, this reads more like wishful thinking than DD IMHO.

Paramount plus has *far* too many rough edges that should have easily been sorted out before launch... You cant even bookmark shows on that crap platform.

Nikelodeon? MTV? Mostly millennial nostalgia content. It'll get burned through and dropped. Had a subscription for 4 months now, and we're running out of content to watch. 

Kids shows? Disney *has the corner* on that market.
House of Mouse always wins.

Star Trek? No new seasons announced for Picard or Lower Decks, only movie deal on the IP fell through thanks to Chris Pine.... Wich came down to: *drumroll* Paramount not wanting to pay up. (More to it than that, but thats the boiled down premise)

Halo TV show? Fans will watch the first season, probably on a trial run, then dump it after binging.

Hell they price point you at $10 to eliminate the only *real* good income they have: advertisement. they are trying to make money like a television studio, but on a streaming service, yet give the user the option to bypass it for, what i can only logically guess is *less* income.

All their other shows? I can watch through a digital antennae... For free...

Literally *no one* has yet to give me a content (and therefore *good* business model) reason to explain why we should dump money into it, other than:

""It dropped thanks to a massive selloff... 'Has' to go back up, and has all the stuff we watched as kids on it.""

*please* someone *please* give me a *viable* reason that VIAC will moon."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we buy VIAC or VIACA ? And why?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have a look at VIACA, could make a similar move as DISCB, but VIACA has options whereas DISCB does not"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought at $16 awhile ago based on the P/E at the time and their content catalog. It’s been a good run, but the unannounced issue of more shares, and the corresponding dilution led me to sell. That they had to raise money with a share offering had me SMH. Replaced with IEME, which still has VIAC in it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not I; I’m diversified already. I have GME, GME,  and I’m getting ready to buy more GME."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My dumbass accidentally bought DISCA instead of DISCB
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how all posts on here now must pay respects to GME to get respect
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is something inherently wrong with DISCB. DISCA or DISCK didn't go up yesterday. If the market sentiment actually reversed, they would have gone up too.

The call premiums for Viacom or Discovery are extremely high now, because everyone else is thinking like you as well. IV crush is a real bit*h and it will ultimately burn all these call buyers.

So, I suggest my fellow apes seeing this comment not to play with options here. If you really believe in a reversal, then buy the shares and sell covered calls.

And about ""amazing value"": OP, these stocks are still up YTD. They ran up so much in the first place because those funds just kept buying the stocks with so much leverage."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to buy some more calls
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been riding this stock up and then down since late February at earnings.   I thought it was going to get a bump because of plutotv subscribers, it tanked.  So then I started buying puts, it started going up, by a lot,  but my 3 joke out of the money calls I made for 50 bucks for protection kept me from losing a lot of my account balance, as it went from 70 to 85 in a day.  I was betting against it with ITM puts, couldn't believe why this garbage stock was going up so much.  From then I just had straddles daily.  And that's why I didn't made that much when it went down from 100 to 45 dollars in a matter of 3 days.  Because of my day trade limitations, in the morning I'd cash out, then set new expensive high IV straddles ATM, with cheaper strangles, if I had a huge score at the end of the day I'd buy expensive calls(that would lose half their value by morning) to protect my wins.   So I just made 10K, but I was down 8K from the start of the year.  

I don't really know it's natural price, because it would just go up, like someone was trying to acquire shares because 'big news' was going to happen.    But knowing what we know now, the motive could be some entity just needed that stock to rise.   Viacom deciding to dilute their shares by 30 million is something also to consider.  So who knows if they're still selling and what the natural price is.  I don't care as long as it doesn't trade sideways for a month.  Set it and forget it, not doing weeklies for a while."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear VIACA is the play
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for feeding my confirmation bias
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 150 contracts for $30p 4/16. This thing isn’t done LOL
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a skewed view of reality lmao

Your technical analysis is extremely flawed"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would we wanna buy the shit sacks wanted to sell?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Started unrelated DD with GME crap not reading just down voting
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tempting, but I am concerned about the offering + the 10 downgrades (not that I care what analysts say, but I know a lot of people follow their picks)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Grabbed a few of VIAC but looking to in DISCA at MO..this confirms my thoughts

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,100 5/21 60C. hoping for it to rebound alll the way up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying some, I share the popular opinion that it's a fire sale and I'm betting it will go higher before it goes much lower. I could easily see this shoot back to the upper 60s+ and I'll feel like a jackass if I miss that ride."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea... There is reason the stock was rising in the first place... Then Hwang propped it up way over value while leveraged to the tits. 

Point is though... there is still a reason VIAC was on the up and up, and nothing fundamentally changed. I think it can rebound to 60 fairly quick."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe Disney buys em.

I wish those margin calls weren't on such lame stocks lol"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow and here I got some shit I never heard of worth three fiddy.  Sold it immediately.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for understanding my speculation
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I went DISCA too. Kicking myself I didn't go DISCB 😭
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you expect more volatility to continue on DISCB tomorrow? Is the squeeze still possibly going higher?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"At current stock price, it's $43 billion mkt cap on $27 billion yearly revenues, 1.6x sales for a media giant in the early stages of exploring internet ventures. The P/E ratio currently stands at 11, and they have a 2% dividend.

It kinda of reminds me of Intel circa July 2020, when it was trading at $50 with a PE of 9. Mature company, good earnings, has a dividend, not going anywhere any time soon.... low PE. These types of stocks are what people end up buying when they get too overloaded on growth stocks. 

VIAC is probably close to being done being Billy Big Hwang'd, and short covering from anyone trying to front run Credit Suisse / NMR is in the cards. I bet the VIAC short is a very crowded trade by now."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are overthinking the setup. This isn't about the long term valuation and the underlying company will be fine for the foreseeable future. It's short term supply/demand imbalances from many large banks force selling into people that know they have to sell. Judging by the volumes, that trading should be about done in $VIACA/$VIAC, so with the pressures eased, the natural trade is up. I like $VIACA more than $VIAC because of what happened at $DISCB. There are many similarities to the setups so it seems like a good gamble."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,To help him out with the bag holding he's going to be doing for awhile
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this post is to stir up interest because they can't dump their shares between $44-45 like they want. If everyone had backed off they'd have dumped and we would really get to see the discount.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same page. I don't know how to value them though with all their businesses. For me it's a see what happens over the next year thing. I don't want to look back and wish I had jumped in if it finds 80 or 100 or 120
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,it rose because banks were hedging!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA ain't lame.

I actually think their streaming service can compete with the others.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold it for a 200% gain lol. Should have kept it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would short it if I could, but there are no shares available to short. Not optionable either, so no puts :(. Just gonna watch it I guess!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do expect more volatility, but no idea if the squeeze is over or if the share price will go higher. I suspect in the long run, the price will drop back down to pre-Archegos blow up levels or lower."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They are the major voting shares. I think there is some funny stuff going on. Maybe someone is trying a hostile takeover?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possibly, i have a $29p 4/16 out as a joke, that contract values gone all over the place the last 4 days.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We're they specifically overleveraged on those two stocks or not?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Idk man about sacks. I bought a cheap put and call. Maybe it trades sideways
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the last time disney got told they couldn't do an acquisition because of antitrust laws?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just sold MVIS for todays 50% gain...probbbbb should have held haha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill Hwang was overleveraged. He borrowed with numerous banks getting himself super over leveraged.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What was he over leveraged and margin called because of. What caused it. Maybe he was robbed we don't know

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Roller coaster of a day.  Started at opening bell down 10k then gained it all back throughout the day with heavy volume.  At one point ASO had 3 mil when GME had 3.5 mil and kept a decent pace for quite a while

2021-04-01 04:53:08,wallstreetbets,"RKT getting ready for the S&P500? 🚀 A lot of you already know Rocket Mortgage and that it’s a beast of a company making your wife’s boyfriends salary in profit every quarter and is heavily shorted. 

Now I believe they are getting ready to join the S&P 500 as the company has met almost all of the criteria.

The criteria for inclusion in the S&P 500:

&#x200B;

* The company should be from the U.S. ✔️
* Its market cap must be at least $11.8B ✔️
* Its shares must be highly liquid ✔️
* 4 profitable quarters (Almost there)
* Have a public float of at least 10% of its shares outstanding (almost there)

RKT meets all of the points above except the last two. Dan Gilbert is the largest investor and owns most of the shares, 95% until recently. Today him and his wife sold 40M and now owns approx. 93% of shares outstanding. Once he sells enough to get to 90% of shares we should qualify for the S&P. 

TLDR: RKT 🚀. Position: 1,500 shares @ $24

Disclaimer: this is just speculation I’m not a financial adviser etc. Don’t invest solely on my opinion."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think investors are going to start pricing this in pretty soon. Edit: I think this is all blown out of proportion though. The report literally says it was for rebuilding Detroit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Housing market is about to kaboom inwards. Tech and EV for me until houses are at a realistic price.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Held on through the first spike, the next stop is pluto."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's ""only"" 20 million shares converted from from class D to class A shares from Rock Holdings. Dan and Jennifer are insiders at RKT Companies and Rock Holdings so they each have to seperately file a form 4, hence the forms in triplicate.

This was the 20 million share block trade from MS, look at the date.

This is how they are funding their 500 mil investment in Detroit.

The big question is, who is the whale that bought 20 mil shares above market price? Buffet? Cathie? Elon? Some boring ass institutional vendor? who knows? It will be spicy if we find out though."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was that 20 million share block from DG yesterday? Can you link something showing where they sold 40 million share? Thank you! S&P500 inclusion would be sweet.

85 shares (not much) adding more and more and more and more... You get the idea."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 call
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't the shorters just front running Dan? If he owns 95% of the shares he will eventually have to sell if he wants to get any cash. They actually like the company they are just trying to get as many shares as cheap as possible. How does anyone buy into the company in a big way if Dan is holding all the shares.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want it to stay above $24 for a few minutes.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm in tech and EV as well but i disagree about the housing market imploding. Not only did a lot of people save up at historical levels during the pandemic, but Biden is going to roll out a 15k down payment credit for first time home buyers. Not to mention car sales are through the roof and they also have Rocket Auto"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you think the housing market will implode? And when do you think it will? I was thinking about purchasing a house this year.....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Rite there with you. Housing is gonna crunch hard.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Housing market is inflated due to low inventory. Inventory should increase by late spring early summer and equalize out. People are still refinancing so there is still an influx of money coming into rocket. Price is low so not a bad time to buy. Slowly loading up on shares 477 @24.50
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This.  Delinquencies are on the rise, and housing prices cannot keep increasing by 20% per year."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you know who makes money based off of any sales? If people go underwater, and people buy those underwater homes, that's a sale for Rocket. Might not have the profit that it had before with bubbled up prices, but it's not like it's holding those underwater mortgages. The more sales the better imo, and if 20% of the market gets juggled around that's a good entry point for Rocket into every single home buyer's pocket."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen house prices in Canada? It’s only going higher and higher
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Came to say this, but you beat me to it. I am 100% convinced housing market is primed for armageddon. No fucking way housing prices are justified and certainly no fucking way people, who didn't have money for housing that was up to 300% less expensive when '08 crash happened, now have money for ultra expensive housing today with ZERO increase in wages. Fucking no way. This shit is gonna biblical when it pops."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canadian here 🇨🇦, housing market is HUGEly inflated! I mean like Bigly! I can’t afford a house even with a good salary. This is gonna blow up in our face one day"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,it can't.. yet. Meeting those two requirements doesn't seem that far away though. That's the point of this post
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEO is getting that money from the public to help the American people in Detroit. The owners of Rocket Companies has changed Detroit for the better when everyone else gave up on the town.

Doing good for society. And that 'dumping' is actually beneficial long term because:

1. Positioned to get in S&P500 index in the near future
2. Too little shares in public == was too easy to manipulate with shorting."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,One guy owns 95% of the stock dumbass of course he’s going to sell shares into the market why the fuck else would he have taken it public if not to at least partially monetize it? It’s not good or bad it’s just completely expected by everyone.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,what do you think about ceo and his wife this am
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,True
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus now if you file your taxes on turbo-tax you can automatically start the approval process with rocket mortgage. Instantly. This next year this company will be recognized as a game changer under everyones nose.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would be very cautious about waiting to buy a house.  Inventory is ridiculously low, and I don’t think that’s the temporary condition others claim.  Takes months to build a new house, construction material costs are inflating rapidly, timber already costs ridiculous amounts.  Labor is short for construction as well.  And money is flowing like Niagra.  Infrastructure bill is going to jack up construction wages and materials further and considerably.  Inflation is already sinking into existing real estate.  

Rates are still so incredibly low historically even with the bump, it likely makes a lot of sense to get the right house for your life and budget and not time this.  Your upside on costs falling on net is dwarfed.  Interest rates are so low I think the talk on housing costs dropping are absurd.  

Real estate feels very variable and risky to the younger generation for good reason - they grew up in a real estate deflation.  While not impossible to happen again, the boogey man right now is inflation and rising interest rates.

I think your play is start looking and decide what to do based on the market you see.  You likely will see that it makes sense to move forward rather than waiting.  More money has been made by getting a house early then timing a perfect entry point."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't say when, but the only thing that's different from 2008 now is that housing is up to 3x more expensive. And nobody is making any more money now than they were then. If the fed even coughs on the interest rates shit will implode faster than this guy here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz95\_VvTxZM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zz95_VvTxZM)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might not implode, because I read that Biden might be introducing a first time home buyer tax credit of $15k. I think he well announce it when he reveals his  ''American Families Plan"" that he breifly mentioned in his speech yesterday."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,we have been saying that for 10 years.   Fuck this rethoric.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I really hope it works out for you because honestly everyone deserves some gains for the shit year we have had. But RKT is a little to memey and in a bit of a disruptive sector right now for me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Delinquincies are on the rise because there is zero reason to pay your mortgage. With the Covid bills that were passed this past year you get interest free deferred payments on your mortgage as long as you follow the correct process with you lender.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,where do you see delinquency rate?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that's not what I meant at all. A housing crash means delinquency is on full show, and less people have been buying. RKT dropping 20 percent in its share price isnt going to save the housing market are you crazy bro"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No it makes perfect sense.  I know people who didn’t have a dime in the bank pre-covid, but now with unemployment and stimulus have saved over 10k.  People like this all over the country are using it to buy homes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything will take a hit but tech and ev has seen some strong support after selloffs. Fucked man isnt the word. Hedge funds are more into housing than owning shares. They usually short companies as it's easier.

Tech and EV cant go away, but housing as we know it could change. The stocks are so high because the whole world invests in USA stocks, not the usa economy. 

Plus hedge funds love shorting tech and ev so fuck them.

Not financial advice but I love TSLA PLTR NIO NVDA and ZBRA right now."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in May 2020 and my house is worth another 80k right now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"We bought ours 2 years ago in N Idaho. Worth $100k more now. Would not be able to afford that price now. Mortgage is the same as rent for 1b 1b apt in my area. Co worker thought I paid too much, was waiting for a crash. Now he's paying $1600 rent for house."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly this.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the good info on this. We've just started looking at houses and my older coworkers don't understand the effect being younger around 2008 had.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Freddie Mac publishes them.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's not what I said either. I'm saying that if a housing crash happens, a bunch of people lose their houses, the currently supply constrained market suddenly gets a lot of houses.

People buy houses, people need a mortgage company to buy houses. Rocket is a mortgage provider that will happily connect the strings for you. If more sales happen that means just purely statistically people will pick Rocket sometimes.

If a crash happens they still make money. They just get paid for hooking up the framework for your house, then tossing the mortgage on fannie and freddie to consume and die with.

The 20% was if like 20% of people lost their houses that means that there's a whole 20% of the entire market that Rocket can try to take."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,rkt sells their loans so they have no risk if prices drop. New buyers who were on the sidelines will jump in to buy the cheaper houses and will get new loans from rkt.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,he is 100% completely wrong (see the other comment). It was delayed by 1 quarter due to vol. I was in the trade at the time.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"S & P 500 selects the leading comapnies in each sector of the economy. RKT is the largest mortgage originator, surpassing Wells Fargo a few years back. They also have the largest market cap in this sector. Mortgagae finance is a major part of the economy and thus RKT is the primr candidate to join S & P 500 once the requirements are met"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is the s&p 500 made of again? I didn’t pay attention on finance class. Can you help me out?

u/ked89 this person wants to know why they would get included in the s&p"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re buying now and the hoses in the area went up 30k in 4 months.  This inflation has a 3-5 year stretch ..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup.  A coworker has been, “Waiting for reality to set in on housing market before buying.”.  Sorry buddy, reality has set in and the reality is supply and demand.  My house has gone up about 70k in the last few years..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will say do NOT get an adjustable rate mortgage.  I cannot stress this enough.  Fixed rate only.  I literally refinanced in January to the lowest historical rate in US history.  We are only barely above that.

The only possible direction for an ARM is up, and interest rates are going up in the coming years.  Powell is trying to convince the market they won’t go up for two years and can barely sell it.

If you don’t have kids you need to get in the best school district, for your first house, buy the most affordable fixer up house you are comfortable with your wife living in.  Watch YouTube to learn how to fix it.  Plan on it becoming a rental in one to five years.  Inflation will start pricing out those who don’t already have a first house.  Those who have one can roll into another easily."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where isnt important. When is what's important in this market. And the timing for a housing market boom has been and gone.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,8% rates on 30 years seems like a thing that's never ever going to happen.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Areas i am residing (cali), there are more buyers than sellers, but we shall see"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,we will not hit 8% apr on 30 mortgages any time soon man.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"like matthew mcconnaughy says in wolf of wall streer... doesnt matter which way the market goes, brokers always get their cut."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a housing crash happens, it means everybodys selling and nobodys buying. Recent house buyers become bag holders with negative equity, many will default on mortgages, it won’t benefit RKT.

But I don’t think a crash would happen in near future, I’m long RKT."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't have to. My credit union sent me an e-mail today saying I am pre-qualified... If you have a decent net worth and good credit the banks will always be pounding at your door.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop giving people the answer come on man this was going to be fun.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're correct, I was *definitely* wrong here. I was under the impression they were quite a bit smaller than they are, but after looking a bit more it's clear that it's not exactly a far-fetched prediction.

I'll add a note to my original comment"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup.  Reality is with Construction costs rising millennials hitting peak buying years soon, and inventory at all time lows, get the still phenomenal interest rates in mortgages today."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. I just don’t think when you refer to the housing market you can’t make a blanket statement across the whole country. I live in Southern California and trust me there are buyers. People who can’t afford to buy are just leaving, and making room for the wealthy. if there’s gonna be any pull back on prices, it’ll go back to like maybe 2019 prices, which if you didn’t buy then, it’s probably because you thought that the boom was over and you decided to wait. If you need a home, you buy the one you want if and when you can."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Potentially not but potentially yes , just have been reading nothing but tin foiled hat apes for the last few months and it clicked. I became one of them. No one expects it. But dig deeper and the signs are there"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao 8%? Yeah right 🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,how are the homeless?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean at minimum the eviction moratorium got extended through June 30th, so nothing will happen before then."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh. I can delete it if you want?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea nobody ever really expects it, but it has happened before. My uncle just recently retired as a ceo of one of the major Danish banks, and he has told some horror stories about rates rising over night. Inflation rumblings in EU as well."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk ask Pelosi or Newsom
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah it’s ok.. it’s what you said. Something something mortgages numero uno
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,don't some banks literally have negative interest rate mortgages on the books in denmark?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and we've had this for a while. People literally getting paid for getting a mortgage. And if you have too much money just sitting in your bank account, you're paying interest."
2021-04-01 04:28:20,wallstreetbets,SEC Filing for recent RKT block sale from CEO

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Captain?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this mean I have to wake up at 4am and sell all my shares?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm ok with this even if the stock price drops in the short term.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speaking off, what was the reason for the dump at the end of trading today? Looks like someone was waiting for the last moment.

I got an alert, but before I was able to respond the market closed. Yes I am slow. Aren't we all?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit wasn't that block like 15% of float (some DD I think I remember).  So that's locked up with Gilbert now.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So my 2 shares of RKT will go up or down?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't these mostly share swaps.  Converting Ds to Class A and Class Bs?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying at a discount. Thanks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Here they are! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh captain, my captain?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gilbert still holds 93% of RKT.

He sold this to free up cash to put $500M into Detroit neighborhoods. He's putting money into targeted projects. The first was he paid off all late property tax bills in the city for homeowners.

He's out creating some goodwill for the company with his money instead of RKTs."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it is good. Like you said the float is increased. Lack of float has been keeping a lot of the larger institutions from buying in to RKT
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or wake up to see how far to the moon we are going
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good question. Could be a push to get the share price as low as possible over the weekend to shake some more people loose to sell. The available float is quite small so every share they can get to seek and short counts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is this upvoted, the filing states Gilbert sold 20MM shares. It's now not locked up with Gilbert at all.. he increased the float not decreased it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It was about 10% of the float.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sideways then up for what you think is a breakout then straight back down to close .20c lower than the open.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Crunch-tize me Captain!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He has made huge investmenst in downtown Detroit also. Buying buildings and fixing them up.  I don't mind people like him getting rich because they don't destroy things in the process.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this doesn't seem good for the stock price no? i mean its on sale so it must be cheaper. lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"First name basis, is he your wife’s boyfriend?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a joke for 1 April. You people start to see bad news as good news, wtf?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,felt that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But then possibly back up right?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not like Gabe Plotkin who buys homes so he doesnt have neighbors.  Two entirely different people!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude owns 90%+ stock lmao thats unheard of in the stock market. Owning anything above 10% is bullish.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">First name basis, is he your wife’s boyfriend?

His first name is Dan.... and at $50B net worth he is more than welcome to be my wife's boyfriend."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that talk makes me hard
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell he could be my boyfriend's boyfriend I'd be down. 😏🌈🙊
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Soon to be ex-wife’s bf
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How does me taking a squirting diarrhea in your throat while my scrote on your chin make you feel?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"And when the LIDAR samples drop this month, Boomski!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What caused the big jump today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the 1 month chart

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been holding since 2.61.  What are your thoughts on market cap being in the 3B range?  I have been excited waiting for the buyout, but have been growing concerned with their current value."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell and pay short term capital gains, or hold a year for long term losses!!! Your choice !!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes sir yes sir. Averaged up from 1.81 to 4.84 (after the initial $9 run up) congrats. You sell cc’s or just holding? I’ve only got a couple hundred shares but just curios how others are playing this out. GLTAL.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but it's also under NDA, I doubt we'll hear anything until a contract is ironed out"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got my 200 tickets to the show. Locked in brother.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Piggybacking off the big Microsoft military deal.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, not nearly as high as it should be."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was averaging up until the $2 sp, I'm buying long calls on a smaller account too. Nothing too crazy"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Past the $20 mark soon?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's coming. Was knocking on the 20's until the NASDAQ crashed. Lidar will propel it deep in the 20's at least when that PR drops this month.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. I see a lot of people talking about it in the MVIS sub but  haven’t dipped my toes.
2021-04-01 03:39:30,wallstreetbets,Long on Tech it is. Calls all the way 
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tech it is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tech got wrecked for most  of the quarter. Its going to be on a crazy run now. Look at today alone. Bond market at highest point year to date and the selloff is fucking complete ! Growth stocks for the win, tech and EV forever."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He's just foreseeing the sector rotation that happened a few weeks ago.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All in on ARKX, they literally invest in anything space travel/tech related. Just IPO'd yesterday."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s the groupie Tyler the bitch writing about things Cramer is bullish on
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,good thing i bought more QQQ calls today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This comment is a SFW preview of how the Cramer ama will go..

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to continue sitting here and pouting bitterly as my UWMC calls slowly creep towards death. Genuinely glad RKT is looking promising still though, might buy in once I get paid."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I could be wrong I think it’s just 20M shares total. Because they both have shared voting power they both had to file the sale.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean they can sell the shares but they also have that billion buyback that can be exercised anytime
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's only 20 million shares. This was the giant block trade by MS.

Rock holdings converted 20 million class D shares into class A shares for the block trade. Dan and Jennifer are insiders in control of rock holdings so they had to file individual Form 4's as well. 

This how they are funding their 500 mil investment in Detroit. 

The big question now is, who was the whale that bought 20 million shares of RKT above market value? It had to be somebody huge. My money is on Buffet."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEOs are evil corporate gangster robber baron tycoons if they don't sell their shares and live off loans using their equity as collateral.

CEOs are also evil corporate gangster robber baron tycoons if they sell their shares and pay taxes on the realized gains like people want.

They built a gigantic successful company, it's OK for them to cash out some of it to fund other shit ya?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not bearish in the slightest. The float is being manipulated because its so small. We need less shares locked up by Gilbert. This is good news
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dan Gilbert trying to buy more NBA teams with all that cash?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess I'm buying more calls
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happened to that buy back?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold my shares a few days ago. Get ready for takeoff. 40 eow
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure they appreciate Reddit's efforts.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like everyone is learning from Chamath
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering Dan Gilbert owns ~1.9 **Billion** shares, I find it very hard to even consider this newsworthy. He's using the money to pay poor people's property taxes ohh how disgraceful"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does that mean up or down
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fail to see why this is a good thing. Could someone explain? Not shitting on rkt, just don't see how this is bullish."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta buy back Lebron.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Now people don’t sound so insane for calling out mortgage plays as bullshit distractions. They literally fed us the same goddamn companies that fucked us over in 08
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"With the dividend they were just paid on those, that should put about 1 billion is cash in their pockets?  500 million to buy more buildings and parking lots in Detroit, but where is the other half billion going too?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So a CEO decided to pay a special div, taking money out of retained earnings....that really benefited themselves then cashed out 40MM shares afterwards. That's not the strong vote of confidence sign I would want from the CEO."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Quit buying rkt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like they scurrrred of UWMC and Matt moneyyyy

I'll probably buy those shares when my call exp, why not.  I don't see a lot of positive stuff posted on UWMC, but I don't get on here that much.  I don't understand why they're so low though.  Other than rates going up a little, I'm not sure what's keeping the price so low."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 93% on my UWMC calls but they’ll take off any day now I’m sure 

Fuck me lmao"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They converted the shares so I think they are actually at 90% now? Remember when snap sold shares and the stock sky rocketed?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Dan is really the alpha badass that everyone believes him to be, this would also set up nicely to begin that 2B stock buyback. If you are worried about optics, you would sell BEFORE throwing corporate money at the buyback so that it doesn’t look like you are intentionally enriching yourself at the expense of your company."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with what you’re saying but don’t under estimate public sentiment on market prices...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Uhhh... There's more to inclusion than being profitable.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's also worth noting that while this news day have only come out in recent days, these trades were very likely set up months ahead of time. Any corporation with an ethics oversight committee requires executives to either automate your stock sales (sell x shares/options every quarter), or submit a special waiver which is then scrutinized for timing. I used to work for a public company in biotech and it was 6 months for standard with a special 3 month dispensation available, but it required an in person meeting and couldn't fall near any data/press release, earnings, FDA announcement... Etc.

When you have that many shares, there's no panic sell button. I imagine it's the same for RKT. Which is why insider trades at reputable companies don't bother me."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Reminds me of chamath p. Who sold a lot of his holdings to fight climate change 🤡🤡🤡🤡
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, talk about white privilege."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If this could happen tomorrow...that be great
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That would be fantastic as RKT is my number one holding and BRK.B is not far behind.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I GOTTA LIVE MY LIFE YA’LL!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do they pay back the loans without selling some of their stock? Or is it like they can keep it in the market longer than it would be otherwise?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's still coming and with them liquidating it goes to show they aren't specifically lining their pockets.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,God I fucking hope so my 4/23 31 calls have been just bleeding red all month
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not bearish. This is a private block sale that already went through and someone paid 25.25 a share
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is positive. The only short term negative are that greedy Hedge Funds try to spin it for dumping the price down temporarily. However, they’ve washed price down so much that it’s been floored at 22-23 for quite some time. Don’t believe they have much more to get."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too, the g-force of lift off is going to suck."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It already is AH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,for one the shares sold at a big premium
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol they’re investing $500 mil into Detroit by selling the shares ass clown.

they ain’t ditching the stonk"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not likely.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an incredibly stupid and un-informed comment. 

1. The CEO did not receive the dividend due the the class of shares he owns
2. They sold the shares to a large buyer and are using the funds to revitalize Detroit.

I suggest you not try to invest your own money because you will most likely lose it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think i'll buy some in a few weeks, thanks!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did that statement come out of Uranus
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally pennies to them. No thanks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some calls. Make some lunch money in the mean time
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost there, buddy. You can see the light at the end of the tunnel"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate on this? When did that happen?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,3D chess.   I like it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Public sentiment 😂😂😂who here is investing in rkt? Only the most smooth. Smoother than gme. Investing in a stock that is constantly manipulated for a company with a 50b cap and making billions in profit? No thanks. I’ll stick to my bond mutual fund. Last thing I want is to be included in the s&p like Tesla. They got out in there and look what good it did them..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sorry i forgot to mention that RKT is the largest originator and company in the mortgage sector. A quick search would have revealed that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Insiders sell for all kinds of reasons... But they only buy for one."""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,silly chamath. the climates gonna change no matter how hard you try to fight it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah except Chamath is a liar, and Gilbert wants to pay people’s property taxes off to help the neighborhood."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ultra wealthy individuals don't deal with money the same way as plebes. They have what's essentially an entire mini-company (family office or similar) with a full-fledged staff dedicated entirely to managing their finances for them.

They do sell shares from time to time to unlock liquidity that they use to fund other investments and to get cash flow and diversification (ie: investment properties, dividend-paying stocks, farmland, ownership in mining operations, VC, etc), but depending on how much ownership and control they want to maintain, they can also just use the shares as collateral and the bank will be happy to accept that.

If, say, Jeff Bezos puts 10,000 shares of AMZN up when it's at $500/share and takes out a loan for $5M at 1% interest, the bank is going to be happy to let him accrue interest on that indefinitely if AMZN goes to $1000, $2000, $3000...he's Jeff fucking Bezos...he's good for it.

As long as AMZN outpaces the interest it makes more sense for him to hold onto his shares. It's kind of like a second mortgage or home equity line of credit (HELOC) except with stock. If you can get a $100k loan @ 2.25%, as long as you are sure you can cover the payments, it can make a lot of sense to dump it in the market and make ~7%/yr to pocket the 4.75% difference while the value of the asset continues to go up at the same time.

They also have $0-balance accounts where the fancy bank people handle all the minutia for them. If he spends $10k, his account has a negative balance and they'll automatically sell off whatever assets they need to bring the balance back to $0.

>   Or is it like they can keep it in the market longer than it would be otherwise?

This as well. If you could get someone to accept 100 BakedTendieCoins as collateral for a $30k loan 8 years ago, it would make more sense to accrue the interest and then only have to sell 0.5172 BakedTendieCoins to cover (if you had crystal balls and knew it was going to $60,000).

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it mean there was one single buyer?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You are an imbecile.  You want to believe RKT is undervalued no matter what and no matter what evidence suggests you are wrong you ignore it since it doesn't fit your narrative.  You ARE a moron. You will spin any thing to suit your agenda. You are no different than the HF's.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um I don’t care what he uses the proceeds for (and that’s a private charity dork, not RKT) he still dumped an insane amount of stock. That’s one of the largest insider sales I’ve ever seen. Not a good sign."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My bad on the dividend. But i hope your shares of Detroit increase. Oh wait a minute....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I have actually tried this.  I want to sell calls at a strike I would be OK selling at.  However, I'm ne to options and Fidelity always blocks me for one warning or another.  Usually, it's about cash in my account.  I don't understand why because they're covered calls.  I'm pretty smooth in the white matter, and I just gave up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way. Last batch I bought at 7.6 and sold 5/21 $7.5 calls for 1.05. At least those will be green 5/24 as long as stock isn’t below 6.55 by then.

Prior $10 sold calls when buying at $9 and $9 calls when buying $8 have covered the fall.

I’m somehow going to be up a couple % if stock goes sideways through 5/21, despite all the pain to date."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, try selling a $10 call for next week? Just one, screw how much premium it is, just sell one to see how you feel at the end of it and as for how Fidelity reacts, do you happen to have ""stock lending"" Or something similar turned on that's probably preventing you from selling calls?

I sell covered calls on WeBull just fine, don't use Fidelity yet tho"

In one of the all-hands meetings, Dan asked his employees to move with him to Downtown and help revitalize the once-great auto city. He asked them ""who's coming with me?"" and they said yes.

So no, he's not gentrifying it ""just so his employees can work right next to the job"". He could have just happily stayed in Livonia. Instead he's making Detroit great again"

Fact: RKT had a strong collection of apps and websites that are attractive to use for the younger generation who would hate to have to go in and fax documents through a broker. Fact: RKT makes loads of money. Fact: RKT survived 2008 - it can survive rising interest rates, which appears to be the only legitimate bear case. Fact: RKT is a long term investment, and most of us don't care if it doubles this month or this year.  So yeah,  we will get our gains in time.

Every president since JFK was officially warned by scientists about climate change.

It's easier to point fingers than look in the mirror."

I could care less about how much $ I care about the rate of return. Trade well. Up 25% is a win!

The take from all this is I think even bag holders @40 will see a return EOY or EO2Y"

Prove me wrong? I dont think ppl work for companies because they give back. The best ppl work for money and career opportunities. This improves his personal brand, does nothing for the companies.

 Your telling ppl this will make the sp500??? Seriously? Based on internet dd? Rumor, ideas, hype sure but dont use that as confirmation bias to excuse someone selling mass shares.

They have to fulfill their obligations and requirements as a broker. Prices went way higher than their shit run company expected and were in deep shit for not having enough capital. 

These fucks are the little kids that were straight BULLIED by their ACTUAL clients (the big boys on wall street). Yes fuck Robinhood for not standing up for retail but they were damned if they do, damned if they didn’t. Add to the fact that they were violating their lack of liquidity obligations and it’s easy why they stopped letting ppl buy. I STILL HATE ROBINHOOD AND WOULD BE RETARDED TO USE THEM, but Citadel, Melvin, Point72, and the other gay hedgies are the REAL CROOKS.

After that, since 1987, his life has been one large act all at the expense of his audience, who naively takes what he says as gospel. Fraud"

And Cramer cooked a viddy with no FUD.

I got my FOMO and some deep dives,

Everything I need to feel good about the stonk price.

Bought so more shares as the dippy came,

Anything under $500 is a gain.

I gotta buy cuz my ape tards need the 'Stop,

If I see a dip, I can make the cash drop,

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I say this in every thread. It’s more disgraceful that other brokers don’t even try to compete with Robinhood’s rates or I would switch immediately. I can’t switch from 2.5% to 8% like come on... RH is so far and away the rates leader that I can’t justify taking hundreds of thousands of dollars to another broker.

You don't need to act like a 90s hip hop artist taking a stand in court or come up with your own rap parody song about Robin Hood. It's not very cute or funny.
 Usually it's only the global minority that finds this sort of thing amusing, which is kind of sad. I bet yall wouldn't do this if Garth Brooks was suing a company for using his image in a way he didn't like."

Off yo ass, that's how I'm goin out

Goin off on a robinhoodfucker like that

With a crayon that's pointed at yo ass

So give it up smooth

Ain't no tellin when I'm down for a short move

With a crime record like Bernie Madoff

Diamond hands are the tool

Yo weekly, monthly and yearly

Extortion sounds more like it. ""Also signing the ad is native Detroiter Byron Allen, head of Allen Media Group, and former NBA player Ulysses “Junior” Bridgeman, who bought Ebony Media last year after bidding $14 million for it in U.S. Bankruptcy Court.""

Yeah, I'd love to signal my virtue by spending millions on a failed media group, that has no readership, or viewership. That sounds like premium ad space to me. A defunct magazine and media group, with no readers..."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not. He's gonna lose. The case will likely be thrown out before it even starts. 

It was blog article, and robinhood licensed the photo from some sort of image farm like Gettyimages and used a pun based on his lyrics. Nothing illegal in any of that, and there are landmark cases setting precedence to protect the use of public figures in that way. 

Hate on robinhood all you want, but Ice Cube has no case here. And, he knows he has no case here, he just wants to grab some of that GME/Robinhood hype and get some headlines.

Edit: lol OP downvoted this in like 2 seconds, the instant it hit his inbox, before any human being could even read what I said. This is proof of my point that a huge % of zoomers and millennials will rally around any anti-robinhood stuff and refuse to think critically, which is exactly why ice cube is doing what he's doing. He just wants his name on WSB and social for some free publicity."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a newsletter. The title was “why are tech stocks falling”. Had nothing to do with Ice Cube endorsing anything.

Vlad: “ok geez I’m sorry I spoke outta line. But they’ll try and throw me in prison if I do!! Please daddy Ken! Don’t make me!”

Kenny G: “You stupid fuck, how did they let you in Stanford! At least I know why Harvard rejected your dumb ass. I’m have half of Congress on payroll including most of SEC. I have the best lawyers on earth, and those congressional members have 0 understanding of the financial industry. Pretend to be sad, and it’ll all be ok. But if you don’t shut it down right now, I will personally call the feds to send you back to Bulgaria in chains.”

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s actually understandable to hate him for rather than hating him for being part of rap culture like people are oft to do. And there’s a whole other can of worms argument for why black culture can be intolerant of gay culture or Jews or other ethnicities as observing others get propped up around in America while they have been historically dismissed and ignored or openly sabotaged (Tulsa bombings). It should be changing here tho with new generations.  Ice cube is old school.

Since i’m in a position to talk to these apes and they listen

I ain’t no financial adviser but i’ll kick it with ‘em a minute 

Cause see they call as a menace and if the stonk is worthless we’ll still own it 

But if it don’t, then why y’all halting trade swallowing the truth grin and beat it 

Now who’s the king of these rude, ludicrous, lucrative stonks? 

Who could inherit the title put these apes in hysterics

Using reddit to share his views and analysis of his portfolio 

But from robinhood there’s  a huge interference, like you shouldn’t hold it, 

Maybe it’s dumb shit we spew, maybe it’s food for the spirit

Maybe it’s a beautiful DD we just made for you to cherish

But we’re debated, disputed, hated, and portrayed in America

Like we’re some motherfucking drug addicts who only YOLO they’re earnings 

Until u/deepfuckingvalue explained it all in Congress appearance

And now market experts that’s when you start to stare at who’s in the mirror

And see yourself as a retail trader just starting out again, and you get embarrassed

And we got nothing to do but make you look stupid as traders

You fucking do-gooders to bad you couldn’t actually do an objective DD 

And do you have any clue how many worthless jobs we’ve had to work to get here? 

We don’t think you do so keep your eyes glued on this sub 

Cause here we go again, he’s u/deepfuckingvalue and we’re just smooth brained apes"

Every time they asked him a yes or no question, which was like 69 times, he never gave a straight answer, and to waste the time limits per question he would always say something like, “that’s a great question, and thank you for asking that question, I appreciate your time and the question, the question that you’re asking has an answer and it’s the type of question we could expect in a situation like today and similar to other good questions being asked in regards to the questions...” It got old real quick."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends.  If the newsletter is a service as some people call it, I would see it the same as an amenity.  Plenty of people offer amenities to sell services to new customers AND to keep existing clients (ya know, since Robinhood is probably losing a large customer base right now).  I think Cube needs to prove they will make money from this, but I would say they should be prepared to prove that they do not make money from this newsletter (btw, my view in this is that they probably won't make money from it, but they need to prove it)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 5 business days to settle is something others have talked about, too, but again, what I've seen others talk about is about 5 or so business days for the margin-cash wrap up and settlement, but not their shares being missing completely between brokers for 5 days. 

I'm just genuinely curious since what you said didn't match up with what other people have experienced, and wanted to make sure the commenter wasnt in a pinch without knowing it. I'd be 1000% concerned if my shares disappeared for a time, too! 

It may be all on the right track, but since their experience isn't lining up with info from others recently transferring shares, it's probably worth a call to webull, since we know RH won't help much.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course they have.

But when your not paying for anything your not the client, plain and simple. The entire Robinhood fiasco occurred because of SEC/FINRA regulations and big money crushing and manipulating  Robinhood for their agenda. There is no way Citadel didn’t put severe pressure on Robinhood and isn’t being investigated. No matter what Robinhood did, they were done for. Think of the implications for them if they had not closed out buying. How TF was this not thoroughly investigated? You had congressional members at the hearing asking all the wrong questions.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Contempt of Congress is different from a contempt in a regular court proceeding.  

Everyone has a set amount of time to ask their questions and receive answers.  That causes both sides to pull shenanigans.  

The questioner might build a 3 minute narrative then ask a leading question.  Or do the Yes No thing as though nothing is life is nuanced or ever needs explaining.

The one asked might use Bulgaria to try and run out the clock.

If it’s a partisan hearing, you’ll see obvious strategy shifts depending on if it’s “your sides” witness or not.

In a regular court, the judge would gavel me to shut up if I ask a witness about Dr. Seuss, or recited such as the witness.

In congressional hearings I can ask any random thing I want. It’s my time and I can use it productively or fritter it away on behalf of my constituents. 

The only procedural power to reign in an evasive witness is “reclaiming my time”.

Edit: corrected atrociousis misspelling of ‘evasive’"

The shit I'm afraid of is the young people that want the 'european' dream (the list wouldn't just contain purely european nations) and the left dem players that want to execute that. I fully believe that US status quo affords those nations the ability to be a social commune due to their abandon of military spending, which is a combination of arrogance and ignorance. We are max 6 years from bad actors controlling europe/asia/Africa if usa says 'fuck it, I want a piece of that peace and quiet'. I'd like to think it's our civic duty to let those cultures relax for a bit after all the war theyve experienced and come back to defending themselves and maybe let us have a turn. Maybe I'm wrong."

2021-04-01 03:22:29,wallstreetbets,"$NTLA - poised for growth at a CRISP pace **Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA)** is an advanced biotechnology company developing medical treatments with the use of **CRISPR**. 

**Unsmooth your brain - background on CRISPR:**

Now, what the fuck is a CRISPR and why am I bothering to explain it?  CRISPR is literally one of the most important inventions of all time. I'm not exaggerating. 

Your ape body is made of trillions of little fuckers called cells. You have all kinds of cells inside you -  skin cells, blood cells, bone cells, etc. Some of us here even have brain cells. But inside all those cells, there's something called DNA. You've heard that mitochondria are the powerhouse of the cell. Well DNA is the CEO of the cell. It makes pretty much all the decisions, and is also the instruction manual/blueprint for how to make every part of the cell.

Now, imagine we can take the DNA instructions to make the chemical that makes a bug glow in the dark, and stick it in a banana. Think how much money we would make selling glow in the dark bananas to apes looking for a midnight snack.

That's what CRISPR is. **It lets you take DNA from pretty much anything and stick it pretty much anywhere inside another piece of DNA.** 

**Why NTLA?**

Making glow in the dark bananas is cool, but what if we used this to, idk, help people? Couldn't we just inject some magic DNA into people and cure their diseases?

Yup. And NTLA are the first ones to do it.

Late last year, the first human had the DNA in every cell in their body altered using CRISPR technology. 

This experimental ""drug"", NTLA2001, is for a rare genetic disorder that can be very painful and dangerous. **Until now, medications have only been able to treat the symptoms. NTLA2001 (theoretically) cures the disease, permanently.**

**Why now?**

On Tuesday, the **EU declared NTLA2001 an orphan drug**. Orphan drugs are medical treatments that are deemed important enough to have around even though the disease they treat is rare. **Important enough to have around that the government subsidize the research and production for that orphan drug.**

So not only do we have a world's first whole-body CRISPR therapy - which alone is enough to make the likes of Cathie Wood sploosh - but it just got bankrolled by the entire goddamn European Union.

**Strategy**

This is a long-term HODL move. But what a long-term HODL move it is. Imagine you're buying AAPL/MSFT in the 80s or AMZN/TSLA in the 00s. **This is not the only CRISPR company, but of the Big Three (NTLA, CRSP, and EDIT) it's got the most momentum**, making it suitable for shorter term plays as well.

**TL;DR - WRINKLY BRAIN GENIUS APES AT INTELLIA ($NTLA) GET BANKROLLED BY EUROPE TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING FIRST OF NEW CLASS OF WORLD-CHANGING MEDICINES.** 

**E: best immediate move would be to pick up long calls and/or LEAPS. I would want to see it dip to the 65-70 range to buy shares**

I am not a financial advisor, this is not financial advice. I just like the future."

I totally embrace the ideia that buying genomics today is the same as buying MSFT and Apple in the early days. Not only for diseases but human overall enhancement.

They basically have a lock on non-human CRISPR, which in practice means agriculture. Medical can swing based on the results of an experimental drug, but agricultural CRISPR be like GMOs but orders of magnitude more effective and precise. Easy, reliable money printing. 

They plan to IPO sometime this year I think."

2021-04-01 03:20:18,wallstreetbets,"$PCG - Pacfic Gas & Electric an EV and Infrastructure play emerging from bankruptcy. Utilities in the PNW Sup Apes and Retards this is my first DD so go easy.

May I present to you Pacific Gas & Electric; the ultimate infrastructure play. 


$PCG checks not one but two major boxes of the plan that Biden laid out today in his speech. 

1: Electric Vehicle infrastructure

Most of this is already laid out in [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmv1q2/pge_launches_ev_fast_charge_program_to_help/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) DD 
The TLDR is that PG&E has a deal with Tesla to promote EV in the Bay area. The company is ALREADY working to improve the EV infrastructure in Northern California, which is home to the largest EV vehicle fleet in the country. ~20% of the EV vehicles in the US


2. Power-line improvements

Now THIS is the part I’m most excited about for PCG. In Bidens speech he directly states “The American Jobs Plan will lead to a transformational progress in our effort to tackle climate change with American jobs and American ingenuity. Protect our community from billions of dollars of damage from historic super-storms, floods, wildfires, droughts year after year, by making our infrastructure more secure and resilient” followed by “My American Jobs Plan will put hundreds of thousands of people to work, hundreds of thousands of people to work. Line workers, electricians, and laborers laying thousands of miles of transmission line, building a modern, resilient, and fully clean grid”

PG&E, for the last decade, has been NOTORIOUS for their powerline failures and antiquated systems. In fact, the debacle of their power lines starting numerous wildfires in the PNW is the reason for their recent fall from grace starting in 2018. This share used to trade at 70$ before their fall due to settlements. Given the last years fire season, which was the worst EVER on record, there is no doubt in my mind that a huge portion of the infrastructure plan will go towards mitigating the risks of fire in the PNW, and PG&E will get huge amounts of funding to improve their utility infrastructure. The debacle has left the shares in shambles, which are now trading at 11.80 as of this DD

3. Palantir Foundry integration

Oh yeah, I heard you apes LOVE $PLTR. Did you know that PG&E is the FIRST client to integrate foundry software ? Yup. Multimillion dollar deal with them. 


TLDR: This company has been held down by its past mishaps, is too big to fail, and is ripe to benefit from the infrastructure bill.

Cons:

-settlements for fires will bankrupt the company again

-new fires could lead to new settlements

-people fucking hate PG&E as a company. They are not loved


This is not financial advice. I like the stock.

Cheers ya’ll and GL in the casino

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember the movie Erin Brockovich? 

Pepperidge Farms remembers."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"These PCG dd’s are so great. Imminently mooning all the time, just a bankruptcy hearing away, just a settlement away, just a wildfire season away, probably next week. Look at the long term chart kids. You know how many accounts died waiting? I’m not saying it can’t go up, but you’ll watch the whole economic recovery from the sidelines if you put all of your BP in PCG."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This company is a dumpster fire of mismanagement.  All they care about is looking woke, and keeping their bloated middle management comfortably overpaid.  Don't believe me?  Go to glassdoor and get it from their own employees.  Too big to fail and the company is run like it.

You need to think about the root causes of them burning down half the state.  *Why* was their transmission infrastructure so fucked up?  It sure as fuck wasn't because there wasn't money to fix it.  *Why* did they kill 9 people when one of their pipes blew?  Not because they couldn't afford to replace it.  Every time one of these happens, they shuffle personnel around and never actually resolve the underlying issues.  Instead you get to watch them pay contractors to tear up and replace the same sidewalk at one of their facilities three times in 5 months.

Stay the fuck away from this company."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made this play in the fall, betting on the safe passages of winter to bring back investors. It didn't, they took my lunch money.  Investing at the beginning of fire season is... ignorant.

Federal grants for private utility companies, disliked ones at that, to make more profit is a bad optic. More likely, funding would be furnished for a municipal takeover. Needless to say, not good. 

I'd stay the fuck away. It isn't an exciting thing to watch a stock move sideways for 6 months waiting for a breakout that never comes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh PG&E in CA is not the same as Portland General Electric(PGE) in the PacNW. 

Nice DD"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. PG&E are just garbage run. The worst shit people doing stupid and shoot yourself in the foot instead of being smart and not asshole decision makers. 

2. PG&E is responsible for not just burning down Paradise a whole fucking town. But just a few years prior. They set San Bruno on fire with exploded gas pipelines. 

3. Did I mention they are morons? 

4. Fuck PG&E

5. They didn’t burn a whole town down last year. They are due. Check back here sometime in the next 8 months. I’m sure PG&E will be responsible for the deaths of dozens. Because they have been super lucky for over a decade with fatalities and their stupidity."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a PG&E customer. I’m here to say fuck them and upvote anybody that agrees.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Get puts before summer time. They'll tank again once they start more fires.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No this DD is so off. Utilities actually don’t want free government money. They are a regulated monopoly, which basically means that they want to spend money because they can then charge customers / earn a return on it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at $12 a year ago sold at $12 a month ago. There are way better places to put your money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The lawsuits waiting are scary.  Lots of homes were lost in that last fire.  Think it was determined their equipment caused the fire?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Straddle for jan 22? Options are cheap (3.50 total for jan 22 12$) and news (fire/bankruptcy or infra money) could make this jump out either direction... break even would be at about 9$ or 15$
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,is it that time of the year for PCG posts again? Time's flying.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the play and own the stock.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts is the way 🤷‍♂️ I said I’d make money on pge didn’t say it would be cause I thought they would do well 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea i was going to say PG&E doesn't operate in the PNW. What is this guy smoking. Probably a east coast boy who did a 5 min google search for the DD
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, this is completely false. If you take a look at their Wildfire Mitigation Plan after the Camp Fire they invested billions into transmission and distribution line hardening. They paid out millions of dollars to tree trimming companies to remove hazardous trees near power lines. They pushed the Wildfire Relief Fund, with the blessing of Gavin and the CPUC. Yeah PSPS sucks but all other utilities in CA have done a power shutoff ( So-Cal Eddison, San Diego Power and Light)
 I believe that increased wildfires in our state are an effect of global warming. I know alot about this Company but do not hold any positions. Trust me, there is alot of things in the pipeline when it comes to green energy and hydroelectric power."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck pg&e
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. Every play in the last couple of years has Been bad for bulls and bears for this stock. This Stock just trades sideways. Only viable option would be a narrow iron condor... in which is certainly not financial advice
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Take my upvote
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also PG&E customer, fuck anyone that says they're a viable investment while we're at it. POS."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, and plan on that happening for a long time. Boomer Stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But if they kill a bunch of people again while shutting off power to half a state, they'll get ground into the dirt... again. I don't really trust them to fix that mileage of cable, it's a lot. Which makes it a potential wildcard."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They won’t fix it and they will. They are a garbage company. Let me set aside the fact they are negligent for a second, they have shown time and time again to shoot themselves in the foot and not invest in actually making themselves better. As a company they are shit, as an investment they are shit. They will do the wrong thing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No range. Only anger. I love this guy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to be fair, I come from a far worse power company. Highest rates in the nation and highest rate of fraud. 

I get you have some personal dislike, but the spam is annoying. No power company in the USA could replace those lines this year.

Personally pg&e has killed less people around me than GRU and certainly stolen a lot less, I haven't had any cease and desists served from them in 5 years whereas that was a quasi normal thing for an EE student in Florida."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Your goddamn right. They are trash.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So a guy who’s ethics or morals are always for sale.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I lived in one of those countries and was wealthy enough to invest in the US stock market you’re absolutely right I would it’s good money and I wouldn’t be living in a problem area to worry about bombs. It’s ok buddy don’t let this effect you’re blood pressure I can feel it rising from here
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking investing for profit off a company has anything to do with ethics. Pretty sure none of these companies will fail with or without my investment.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So you would invest in a company that was bombing your neighbors...I realize this is WSB but just say that out loud to yourself.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, you have no boundaries when wanting to profit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First off I don’t know any of those people. Secondly pretty sure pge will go on being pge wether or not I use them to make back some of the money I’ve paid em over the years. You go on being a stock market social justice warrior! Hope it works out for you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You might actually be too dumb for words
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You might be the type of person who associates every critique of their actions as always rational.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😅 what are you even trying to say?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because you selfishly do something, such as continuing investing in a company like PGE, doesn’t mean it’s ethical. Just accept that you don’t give a fuck what a company does as long as you get some pennies in return."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you saying your argument isn’t rational? I mean agree just surprised you realize and still argue. Stock market isn’t the place for social justice warriors but I’m pretty sure someone failed to use the correct pronoun at a sportsball game justice better offer up your services where they’re needed.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. I'm just saying don't justify your reasons for investing in a dirt bag company like PGE because you don't care what their business practices are ethical or moral as long as you make some returns on your investment. But, don't try to convince others or be offended by what they think of your interest in supporting that type of company either."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find your childish emotional approach to mathematical investing laughably entertaining not the slightest bit offensive. This however sir, is a casino not a philosophy class."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, you like to church up things that you don’t like critiques about. PGE has a known history of bad business practices which resulted in innocent lives being lost, people displaced, and other types of corruption which shouldn’t be acceptable. But, they provide necessity which keeps them from completely going under. The only laughable thing is you can’t accept that someone calls it as they see it. You don’t care about a company’s practices as long as you make money. Somehow that offends you because of how others view it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t offend me I know that’s hard to understand. I’m just trying to help a lost little boy find his way out of the big scary stock market.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then your morals and ethics have a price. You're fine with investing in a company like PGE regardless of the majority view because you're only in it for your gains regardless of their business practice. Bye.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The epitome of an emotional trader good job sir

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! I actually quintupled my GME shares today. Went from zero shares to zero.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"150 is the floor .. anything below that I am buying hand over fist.

I was thinking / hoping we'd go below $100 post earnings but they couldn't even take it below $120. 

I've averaged up. This is going to be $200 in a year .. following a stock split.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, that’s one louder, isn’t it?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I mean a put credit spread. It's not foolproof but still probably too safe for apes. **I'm not recommending this strategy.** ***Just as an example*** though, you can sell a 7May 130 Put for $20.30 and buy a 7May 100 Put for $9.98. You keep the difference, $10.32, and this is your max profit. Your max loss is the difference in strike prices minus the credit received, 130 - 100 - 10.32 = 19.68.

Max profit occurs if both contracts expire worthless and max loss occurs when the stock price is below $100 at expiration. In other words, you can make max profit even if the stock drops $59. 

However, it is **much** safer to close the contracts as soon as they reach a certain profit.

None of what I am saying is suggesting that you do this. There are a lot of considerations when choosing strike prices, spread width, and an expiration date."

2021-04-01 03:02:22,wallstreetbets,"Coursera IPO ($COUR) - Just Launched Coursera ($COUR) IPOd today. I have been waiting for this one to see how it did.

My hypothesis has been that it would either tank day 1, or show steady (not rocket ship) growth.

Well, the results are in for day 1 and it didn’t tank. It is up over 30%. I expect some profit taking tomorrow from people who wanted a quick gain (and got it!) and then a climb back up again in the short and long term.

I went ahead and bought 10 shares this evening and will double down if it dips tomorrow.

I have personally used them for a certification. Led to a $10K raise at work as a direct result. Also shared on my LinkedIn profile which was a nice touch for recruiting to potential new jobs.

My company is now using them for training. These guys are light years ahead in an industry that is full of decade(s) old technology that never got updated.

The pandemic has shut down all kinds of seminars and workshops and corporations are moving training budgets from expensive in-person conferences with hotel and airfare and meal costs, into professional grade training such as Coursera that associates can do from the office (or home).

I think this is going to grow and continue growing as companies realize how much more efficient this approach is than flying people all over the world for 3 day workshops.

Add in that you can literally get a college degree online from them, from accredited universities (not random schools, good ones), and I think this is a great pick."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As i believe EDX is their only actual competition, can we do a side by side comparison?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been using Coursea for many years (orginally it gained popularity with their deep learning course). 

I usually just use it to learn and don't get any certifications, so I haven't spent any money. Originally they were trying to figure out how to monetize it, and it seems certifications are working as revenue is few hundred million. 

Their tooling and interface is really good, so if online schooling does get really popular they will do well. 

I don't have any shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I make my sons do coursework on Coursera & Alison during summer break to get an edge up in applying to charter schools (they just got in for this year).  Also recommend to new grads to show something extra on their résumé when applying for jobs (I interview new grads, & most résumés are all the same)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really like Coursera, Ive been using it for the last 9 months for various learnings. I pay 400 a year for continuous usage. Picked up 50 shares, not much but Im a po boi and its honest work."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have some of the lowest user acquisition cost in the industry, with the largest top of the funnel for online education, combining those 2 will give some pretty sick network effects imo. I also like that they are diversified in their revenue stream as opposed to a single model like their competitors. Def a long term hold"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of certification nets you a $10k salary bump :D
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't fuck with daddy ng
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's funny, i remember these courses when i tried to learn different science subjects. These are really really good tbh.

I will defintely look into this as i think it's awesome."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re losing more and more each quarter... no thanks.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are lots of options now. Pluralsight, Lynda, and so on. Many are free either via workplace subscriptions or public libraries. 

There is no defensible sustainable advantage for Coursera in my opinion."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the retention for going to college?  You go and then stop going right?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great for you with your kids - that’s good parenting!

I like where your head is for hiring, too. Full agreement - as a hiring manager I love seeing stuff like this. Put a certificate on your resume from Coursera and an Ivy League school and it pops."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you see a benefit in utilizing Coursera over a free service such as Khan?  Obviously Coursera has more topics but I imagine you have curated your sons' lesson topics already anyways, so just wondering.  

Great idea btw and I'm stealing it for my daughter so she'll be hireable!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet you're happy with those 50 shares right now :) Congrats!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like Stringer Bell using community college to become a better drug dealer in The Wire.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Possibly something relating to biochemistry or hydroponics.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those who are not familiar, I think this is referring to Andrew Ng, one of the founders."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But is the loss due to the company growing and investing more money in this growth?

Or have revenues declined ? Or is it just fiscal mismanagement?

If it’s due to growth— might be worth overlooking for the short term"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Using money to fuel growth isn’t bad, don’t be a boomer"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Google just launched a set of 4 certificates for high demand growth jobs that are underserved by current educational opportunities. Content produced by Google, delivered through Coursera. Project management, Data analytics, IT support, UX design, more info [here](https://grow.google/certificates/?utm_source=gDigital&utm_medium=paidha&utm_campaign=sem-bk-gen-exa-glp-br&utm_term=google%20certification&gclid=CjwKCAjwu5CDBhB9EiwA0w6sLQnuLbwYegigmPwLETnzF0eoA8haDZX5Kr-Ysi-B-nugkfd25rUP4hoC6I8QAvD_BwE). 

I’m in this thread because I’ve been waiting for this kind of company to go public and ffff I missed day one! Pissed this went under my radar. Will buy some shares tomorrow."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Coursera is totally different then Pluralsight or Lynda; the courses are mostly from universities and many are based on actual classes with the same curriculum. Some of the classes are the main content for legitimate BS/MS degrees from good schools. The closest competitor to Coursera is something like EdX
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very good point.  There will be some people who just love to learn and take course after course.  But by and large people (both students and prospective teachers) likely use this with a purpose, and do not intend to take any further courses.

Edit: I just learned that Coursera IS free to use, much like Khan, and both cost money for certifications.  Now I can be hireable too!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does putting ""Apelord of WallStreetBets"" on a resume pop too?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No one gives a shit about Ivy associated Coursera BS.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  Khan academy is knowledge for knowledge sake.  Courses with certificates are evidence of completion.  All other things equal, if youre selecting kids for your charter school, do you pick the one with or without certificates showing extra coursework done?  Same for new hires."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"heh thanks. Im sure it will do what stonks do. But Its enriched my life, so Ill hold for a bit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Data science related?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if you got your certificate- hold it up so mom can take a picture of you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This would definitely pop. Maybe list how many shares of GME you own and your cost basis as well for good measure.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you’re bummed you didn’t buy in and missed out on the double digit returns so far today :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a valid point.  I don't work in hiring, so I don't have the same viewpoint.  But I appreciate your insight!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the right answer. If you’re learning just to learn, use YouTube or something.

If you’re learning to get credit to advance yourself - scholarship, job, etc - you need a certificate.

You can do the free stuff on Coursera. Pay the fee and you pick up the certificate. Throw it on your LinkedIn and resume and boom, you’re monetizing your learning."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Outside of EdX what are the many other competitors?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Google offers a bunch of certifications through Coursera, might be what you are thinking about"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have crayons to highlight the good parts of my resume. Like where I holded my job for as long as gme was shorted
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I can only list 0 at this point :/
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I won't buy in because I think the business model is trash. Not stopping you. I will be buying puts when they are available.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So.... has GME? Or no has GME? Has crayons?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy fix.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go for it! In the mean time, we’re here to make money. A lot of people are very happy with the 50%+ ROI in the past 24 hours."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why’s everything so green?  You’re doing it wrong I think 🤔
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Up 50% today tho so might want to wait for a better entry
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is mvis going up? Do you think it'll go down based on the chart
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Newbie question here, but why did you choose such a wide variety of strikes?  Congrats!!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Miss Mavis? The typing lady? She's pretty cool. I'd keep calls on her.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well fuckyou.......
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good options entry point? Any moves? :0
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened with MVIS?? Didn’t see any news on it lately
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol to think I sold that shit back in January 😬😬
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its flat slightly down AH, and again premarket.  Be careful on this one if you fomo."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Looking at the five year chart it's up 100x since March of last year. Seems like that's a lot of sprinting done; why would it do that again?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was down from 340k at its peak when it was 24$ a share to 60k last night. No joke. I sold shares and bought calls all month while the price continued to drop. 

I also had 25-30k shares when it was 6-7$ a share, at the end of the first gme spike. Made some very bad moves and held held held, even sold 1/2 of my mvis to double down on gme and fucked up bad."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks brother. Hype is real.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy 5 more
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably. That mofo is a beast.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll take it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair, though lots of shorts gotta cover still and we are still down 6-7$ from our February high.  Don’t yolo tomorrow, but start buying shares for sure, 10% of what you want to total, every day or every week, however you want. 

Don’t miss this. It was up 6000% percent on the year to date when it peaked in feb. retraced 50% lower in March, the whole month sucked, Tesla was down 40% and plug and NIO we’re down over 50%.  

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I believe it has 5-7 days of steep increase, judging from the last 3 big spikes over the past 4 months."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rough estimate, about 145k. I’ve been averaging down all March. Subtracted my total gains from each block of contracts and totaled them up. Only sold 100, the April 13$ ones so far. Hope to sell 50-100 at a time as the price consolidates and rises next week. Get rid of all the April’s, hold the 350 remaining May’s.

Keep in mind tho, at 9am my account was at 61k. A lot of those contracts were down 75%, even with massive averaging down."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Different strategies. Deep in the money or OTM.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do 30,seconds of DD, just go to the mvis subreddit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Nice try bra. It’s up 50% on the day.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh? Source?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a terrible feb/March too. Hoping this keeps moving tomo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the premium on these? I’m too retarded to know if it’s shown in the screenshot
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please sir. Taper out profits this time
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since you’re a crayon eating ape, I did. Tell my wife I say hi."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Certainly going to check this out non the less
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, first off congratulations!  Just wondering what made you buy into MVIS back then (must've been <$1/share at that point?).  Did you read some DD that really clicked with you?  Work in a related field and saw a lot of potential in the tech?

I've been accumulating shares over the past month or two.  Kind of kicking myself for coming on board so late, but I guess better late than never."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, okay. So they may get bought out by Microsoft in 2-6 months and the price may triple. That's still not 100x.

You do know that Microsoft has a long and storied track record of buying the second-best product on the market and stuffing it down its customers' throats, right?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not. Let’s just say I was down 240k from the beginning of March and started selling 1000’s of shares every week and averaged down on all those calls in 50/100 contract blocks. Had 25k shares at one point, as you can see, I’m down to my last 1000. Just in the nick of time, Sweet baby MAVIS!!!!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You see I sold some April’s today at 3:55. I’ll sell the 28$ ones probably tomorrow.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying 10 as we speak for funsies... gme is getting boring to watch... need some more green in my life!

Edit: dropped 300$ on it 🤷‍♂️"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"A friend got a tip from his Accountant about a year ago. He had 10k shares at under a dollar. I been in it since 2$, 

Once I understood calls I yolo’d. Their subreddit has amazing due diligence and I was convinced they were spot on about the buyout/April lidar news"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good ape.
Also major fomo got out of mvis a while ago to go all in pretty much on gme/amc"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Commenting so I can check back in
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess I’ll do a weekly update🤷🏻‍♂️. Contemplating buying 30$ leaps for 6.20$. 100 of them.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do it, free money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It also was down 55% yesterday am from its high of 24$ in February. It was hit hard. Lots more room to run, April starts tomorrow.  This bitch has 5-7 big days of gains in front of her, based on the last 3 spikes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also. I’m up 179k, when I woke up today my account had 61k in it.  That 41k gain is the 100 April 13$ contracts I sold today, at 5.50$."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"well enjoy going back to red  😂

those aprils down 62% today

Monday will be another down 10-20% day too"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you legitimately have very little clue as to what’s going on with the company then, if this is your argument for him to sell. 

i’d do a little more research as to why it’s value is up so much YTD; you might learn something."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey thanks. I’m doing just fine actually, but super cool that you needed to run it in that some of my investments are down today. Not sure if you understand that maybe i sold at open and the repositioned during this 4 hour dip😂😂😂"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yep, I have no clue what going on, only red again today.

thanks for the awesome insight xsnowingx 😂 😂

you retard 😆"

One more question. Where do you think the value of GME will be once the shorts come due?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well because the shorts are in over 100% (some estimates over 900%) the top is literally infinite.  The question is who will really diamond hand this.  Me personally?  I have a shitload of shares I'll ladder it up and save 2 or 300 shares to see the top which could very well be in the 1mil+ range. 

 The question is if the government even allows it to go that high before stopping all trading.  The issue with that move is they will literally kill their own market and lose out on those sweet sweet short term capital gains taxes.  I foresee them letting it play out.

  My cost basis is 24 and I've already seen 500k in portfolio once and I didn't cash it in.  This stock is gonna be worth 1500 minimum  without a squeeze."

2021-04-01 01:54:57,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC - What's currently going on & updates Hi fellow investors,

I want to break down why the stock is currently floating at high 7$ - Low 8$ right now and also discuss some positive sentiments in the upcoming months. 

1. Let’s start with what’s currently going on. $UWMC has a short interest of %10.72 on a float of 92.5M shares. This is very high for the amount of shares available in the public float. 92.5M \* %10.72 = 9,916,000 shares. 9,991,600 shares times let’s say 8$ your looking at $79,328,000, and that’s if it was shorted at 8$. Total float of 92.5M @ $8 =  $740,000,000. So, with this being in mind, the stock can be considered having quite a high short interest pertaining to the available public float.

2) UWMC announced that they're considering a Senior Notes Offering not to be confused with Senior Debt, of $700,000,000. This is to be used to pay off their MSR and for other corporation purposes. This has both detracted some investors and attracted investors at the same time. Is this a bad thing? Not all, it’s simply a way of raising capital for the company. Think venture capital, inside investors etc. The interest rate would be locked in at %5.5 which is very low and to be paid in 2029. This is actually a smart decision depending on how you look at it to pay off debt owed with a lower and cheaper interest loan. It’s essentially, a senior convertible bond. Prominent start ups and companies expected to have high growth typically use this option as it reduces risk and lowers interest. I mean, I’m not going to go into the nitty gritty of explaining what Senior Notes are, I’m sure someone will in the comments section for those interested. Senior notes are not considered good nor bad. They can be considered bad when a company is sinking like when GM went bankrupt but would be considered good for growing companies such as UWMC who are using it to strengthen their balance sheets and grow their business. Some investors see senior notes and sell out and that is one aspect of the reason for some sell offs. (This is not something to be concerned with at all, personal opinion). The senior note was proposed but has not been finalized in any way. What does this impact to your investment and the stock price? Apart from some people selling out of the stock, it has little affect.

The 3 big factors for the stock price chilling at around high $7 - $8 currently are 1) Current bearish market 2) High short volume % 3) Senior Note announcement/consideration. (Again, this is not a negative thing).

Positive sentiments: Dividends payout in April, will be added to the the Russell 1000 & 3000, if interest/inflation goes up that’s when UWMC or the wholesale channel in general actually makes more profit/revenue verses the retail channel. UWMC holds 34% market share, the largest in the country. So, all this inflation and interest talk going around, this would actually benefit UWMC to my understanding and not go against them. It would actually make them more competitive since wholesalers/brokers provide better rates, that’s not an opinion, it’s a fact. The other biggest factors for positive sentiments is the fact that the stock is extremely undervalued, has great fundamentals, and has a solid balance sheet. This isn’t a GME or an AMC, etc. This stock is a completely different play all together and a great hedge in this bearish market; that’s currently on sale at it's current price and provides high dividend payouts of %4.83 or $0.10 per share quarterly.

This is not financial advice, this is just my personal DD on the current price range UWMC is currently trading at. Have faith and patience my fellow investors and put those 💎🖐 to the test. (Disclaimer: Do whatever you want, I'm personally going to 💎🖐 no doubt).

I hope this proves useful to you in some way or another and that you all make a bunch of tendies. 🚀🌔

TL;DR - Stock price is being affected because of the bearish market, short interest and short volume%, and the senior notes offering announcement/consideration.

**\*\*Edit: Something I forgot to add and didn't mention that I think everyone is overlooking is the fact that UWMC has their own proprietary software & system to process mortgage applications and are the fastest in the business at qualifying and closing applications. This benefits both B2C and B2B. B2C: 1). Faster closing time. 2). Better rates. B2B: Fast closing time, more applications completed, more revenue and profits.**

**This is a critical competitive differentiator among it's competition and market. This also attracts more business, mortgage brokers, and customers. They also came out with their new jumbo convertible product which is going to further enhance growth. Sorry, I forget to highlight all this in the post.\*\***"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,is this the bagholders animous for UWMC???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol yooo the hate is crazy. This was just a write up to discuss some factors that could effect the current price of UWMC.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does this read like it was written by a narc?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC tried to give people an ultimatum and they spat it back in their face. This is not a well run company with decisions like that, i can’t get on board with this one sorry."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Much appreciated DD, thank you ape"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,DD like this will lose people a lot of money. The chart has been showing a decline for months now with no catalyst in the future. If the company is so great why did they just have to sell notes to raise money? The price might get a bump after earnings but will then go back down.. the target price just got downgrades too...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought they weren't being added to Russel? 

Did this get fixed?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully something miraculous happens before 4/16. I wish the R1-3k index addition happened when it was supposed to :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only own 500 shares, but I don't even care if it trades sideways in perpetuity as long as I can keep collecting a 5% dividend and sell covered leaps for ~20%."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This looks good. Waiting for a decent entry trigger...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This doesn't address a major issue for UWMC's immediate future.  Housing supply is down 30% yoy which reduces their potential profits and revenue for a bit.  Means it might take a while to go up again 😕
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just know you're always welcomed here. This is a safe space. Would you like to introduce yourself and share your story?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,any mouse....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I swing both ways. I don't commit myself to just one.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See you on the moon 🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Right!!! Their cross town rivalry has nothing to do with my portfolio. I got 1250 shares of RKT and 400 UWMC. DGAF who their compaction is. I long on the subprime.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you need at least 100 shares for covered calls right?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you, me?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This has been my strategy.  My covered calls are currently at $18 for April.  If it hits $18 by then (doubtful) I won't mind a bit.  I plan to do similar indefinitely.  Between the call premiums and the dividends it's a nice little income stock.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"667 Averaged down to $8.59 (and 1 call).  I'm gonna buy another $1k tomorrow if it stays below $8.  I buy more every payday, and on days I don't get paid."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"3000 @ 8,06

There are some big fish on WSB. And I am not one of those.

I'm sure there is someone with 20k shares or something."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1400 shares and 10k in calls here, also the biggest I've ever done, also down 20%. Right there with you - but if I didn't think it would go back up, I'd sell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in the club too, 2068 @ $9.76/share 💦"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,8.20 here but I've been selling csp on this bug dip and averaging down with the premium. I'm extremely bullish on this company and think it should be in the 15-18 range tbh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where are you getting your institution ownership numbers from? I'm seeing 18% of 1.6B.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"\>if the companies are both dealing in the same industry, logic says that hey should be priced around the same ballpark

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I first bought 4/16 10c a few weeks ago and have since opened up 120 contracts to average down to an average cost of .12. I’m just praying it jumps back up to .13 tomorrow so I can get my money back

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hold some of those so answer is:

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"4000 shares?  YOLO.

You give me all the confidence to add to my 200 share."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a wholesaler they actually make more money as rates go up. Don’t forget these companies are underwriters, there not the ones originating the funds being lent to a customer. So the risk of insolvency and credit loss doesn’t impact RKT or UWMC it can reduce sales of course but if a mortgage gets foreclosed you can guarantee there’s a buyer around the corner and the cycle repeats itself."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Notice how they’re all 60day old accounts
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude is sketchy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, buying stocks that have cool names. The ultimate form of DD."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Peak housing last year?! Housing market is booming on the west coast, it’s the highest it’s ever been"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is too simplistic. In the mortgage business, you make money off of originations, mortgage servicing rights, loss mitigation activities, and the interest on the loan. 

Slow to moderate increases in rates and house prices protects their mortgage servicing revenue (while reducing origination revenue). A sudden dip in prices would increase their exposure to bankruptcy (partially offset by loss mitigation income). A sudden dip in rates increases runoff risk at the same time it increases origination revenue. 

If you have a large portfolio of credit worthy loans on relatively valuable properties, moderately rising rates and prices is good news for profitability."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Upvoted because this is relevant and i agree with both reasons. 

I disagree with the conclusion that there is no money to be made here. There is plenty of long money on the table but this isnt wallstreetbets fast money and should probably be in r/investing or another subreddit."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, an intelligent opinion here. Listen to this person or lose your ass people."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The democrats turning that child tax credit into monthly payments is going to make it awfully difficult for republicans to ever get rid of it.   A lot of young families are going to suddenly have hundreds of extra dollars every month.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then don’t buy the stock. You could have easily just skipped this write up and moved on. No one cares for your personal incentive as to why you’re not interested in the stock.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was looking at it from the reduction in sales approach. Refi vols will decline
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh. It's a solid DD post like what we had in the old days. Comes off like someone autistic trying to be ironic rather than anything sketchy to me. That said, I've been long on UWMC for about a week now and I'm looking at the shitty trading as a discount."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you’re seeing is a lack of supply. Mortgage companies need high LTV from people that can get qualified mortgages that Fanny and Freddie will buy. Those are drying up.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You may be correct. The idea of refundable tax credits is absolutely repugnant to me.

Simply saying, I don’t like this stock because they did an ultimatum and you don’t seem to understand why they made that business decision and try and suggest that this is why you personally don’t like the stock is not constructive. If you don’t like a stock don’t buy it. You don’t need to post why you don’t like it unless there’s constructive reasoning behind it."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm down 91% on my 4/16 9 calls. At this point there's no point in selling.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to let it ride to the 🌕
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean we will see on thier earnings but if trends continue thier book value would be in the 12 - 15 range. I agree however rkt is more of a tech company and can justify higher pe. I just like the thought of having one somewhat solid company to sell csp and cc against so I can spend premium on spy fds

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,and why?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No not at all. But again it’s not constructive. That’s like saying, I was interested in a blue Toyota, but when I got there they only had a red Toyota for that model. So I’ll never buy a Toyota again. It’s redundant as the colour of the vehicle has no changes to the fundamentals of the car. Same for the addendum for UWMC. That’s why I stated if you just don’t like the stock then don’t buy it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh they're awful in many ways for sure (I avoid them like the plague...unless they are actually flying to the airport I want, in which case I will go with them since they're usually less than half the cost of other airlines), but they cut through competition like a hot knife through butter; with so many European airlines struggling after taking huge loans and being grounded, Ryanair is a fantastic position to move in on their turf; they were in such a strong position at the start of 2020 that they didn't need loans and they could afford to fly empty planes between airports to keep their slots, which other airlines couldn't do.

Additionally, Michael O'Leary (CEO) is one of those OG meme-level bosses who gets shit done; he's like Ireland's Elon Musk or Jeff Bezos."

Management guiding to $500M+ of revenue in 2021 and $100M+ adj. EBITDA WITHOUT underwriting recreational sales from New York and Virginia, where they are poised to be the #1 operator in the former and the $2 operator in the latter. 2020 revenues were up 234% YoY and the margins are steadily improving. Consider their two NYC locations: 14th & 3rd and Brooklyn. Curaleaf, the largest MSO trading many turns of revenue higher, is located in Queens and Long Island. There is no other MSO better exposed to NYC.

I am expecting $1B+ in sales in 2022 and $300M+ in adj. EBITDA. That means the biz. is trading at 2.4x 2022 revenues. If you put TLRY's multiple on this business (\~18x 2022 revenues), it should be trading at $40/share.

Personally I think it has to do with the supplemental leverage ratio that did not get extended.
Basically it was a change in policy that let banks take a little riskier positions due to coronavirus. Jerome Powell denied the extension of this policy, and the last day was today. I think banks now have to deleverage their risk. Don’t know much more than that, but today is a big movement day
Edit: to be clear, this doesn’t mean the market is imploding. It just means that there was a lot of volume today and my above comment could be relevant. If 200m was buy and 200m was sell, there effectively would be a net average of neutral volume, hence no major price change.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of that is true EXCEPT...if I'm understanding correctly, isn't it possible to record that phantom gain in tax year 2020, and the realized loss that should cancel it out in tax year 2021?  I mean, you'd never do that intentionally, but if you weren't aware of how the wash sale rules worked you might get caught by accident.  And in that scenario, I'm not sure whether the IRS actually allows you to apply your 2021 losses against the 2020 gains so you might still be in a bad spot."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It says a lot you knew exactly which one :'(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"NGL, I wish I was joking. (Well $200k debt vs maybe 100k salary if I'm lucky, but the field itself is pretty rough.)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That...is actually a good question. I have at least one theory?

My last investing adventure before GME I was able to daytrade up about 10% over two months, before the stock I was playing with crashed hard. Then I just let it sit for a year before selling so I could use the Long Term Capital Gains writeoff. The first year I had to pay taxes on the +10% due to wash sales, and the second year I got to enjoy the writeoff.

If that’s what happened here, that would imply at some point he really WAS up $1.4 Million, then blew it all on FDs or something, but the expiry date on the losing bet was after year end. Feels like a long shot but it’s not impossible given how some people on WSB trade.

And if that WAS the case, the guy was totally irresponsible for not setting aside some of his $1.4 million in gains for taxes before gambling it again."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You júan  naive SOB to believe it’s all glitches lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good points, currently at 99% hoping. I'm going to assume one feed is wonky, given that there are multiple trading platforms showing this. Why is Bloomberg showing this..

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure does make you wonder.  $AAPL alone trades over 100 million shares each day so it would be impossible for \^DJIA to only trade 4 million shares.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. It's not a selloff. It's total volume. There is no data anywhere in this post or comments that says what portion of the volume was short.

2. The data shared in the post was inaccurate, which has been pointed out and explained in detail in the comments already."

But what's more likely - people don't understand wash sale at all or someone went up from 30k to 1.4 million and diamond handed all the way down to 75k while happening to time his trades just right to have 1.4 mil in phantom gains?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What, that shorting an ETF composed of 1% of a stock is a shitty, inefficient way to short it because you need to use 100x as many resources to have the same effect?

You want a source for that? Or how about the fact that nearly every time it was posted, there was a top level comment right there tearing it apart that the OP either never replies to or brushes it off with ""maybe, who knows""?

The good thing about this is that as a society, we have collectively recognized that a statement needs to be proven, rather than demanding that the negative be proven. So your conspiracy theories masquerading as due diligence are what need to be proven.

Take off the tinfoil hat and think for a second about what reason could there be for why ETFs with exposure to brick and mortar/retail  *might* not be doing so hot lately. Not every drop is due to shorting and the entire market doesn't revolve around a few tickers."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Which is crazy. Been a floundering company in Washington state for like 30 years until now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started buying at around $19. I've bought every dip since and have lowered my cost average to about $14 on 1400 shares now. 

I've got no problem buying MVIS in the $12-17 range, I think it will be worth far more than that eventually. I'm just out of powder until payday next week though. 

This is all funded by GME gains (still holding about 100 shares), but I'm much more confident that I'm not going to lose a lot of money on MVIS because I think they have some very impressive technology that could very realistically become ""the next big thing"", in my opinion. 

If MVIS gets bought out before GME moons, I'm probably going to put a portion of my gains back in there, but this is much less stressful for me."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"this reeks of pltr/bb to be honest. there will be bagholders in 3 months talking about how this is a ""good long play"" now lol"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah except the big news hasn't even happened yet. This news was unexpected, and the articles don't even mention MVIS by name. 50% intraday increase on UNEXPECTED news about a secondary vertical of the company, with no mention of the company name, while waiting on literally the biggest news that should be announced within the next 1-2 months. 

I'm already in, but if this dips again, I'm probably going to be all in."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It was over 20 before the market correction. I’ve always had my eye on mvis even since it was a penny stock.. in and out a few times (including today) but with the news today and more to come in the short term I’m about to go all in on this moonship
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MVIS LiDAR does scale. MVIS AR tech breakthroughs are what will make AR no longer niche.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Corrected this, it’s actually Steve Holt (STEVE HOLT!), the CFO, and he exercised his options to buy shares at $17/share a few weeks ago... very interesting that he would choose that time to do it... BAFF"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude I’m looking at LEAPS they’re not that crazy expensive and they’re basically guaranteed to print.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s a strong chance we pull back a little and then with volume and FOMO we continue to climb. The key resistance is ~$19.30 and after that there isn’t much resistance at all... so once we close above that $19.30 we’re going to 💣🚀🌙
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the correction, but it should be noted that these sold shares are very small in comparison to the shares they still hold."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,These were automated transactions to cover the taxes from options being exercised. This doesn't really count as a sale.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The demo will likely be announced that it is underway this month, at some point. 

The thing to keep in mind is that it's not a ""public product demo"" but rather providing samples for potential customers to see if their A Sample works as intended. MVIS claims to have the best in class Long Range Lidar tech- if that truly is the case, I think that we will probably be hearing about it relatively quickly once the demo has been announced.

Best case scenario this turns into a bidding war for a buyout. It's not too late!

I'm in for 1400 @ $14 and got a couple 4/16 $17 calls I'm going to ride out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I def agree about the future but I’d just caution people about FOMOing in right now, it’s bound to pull back. IV spike now. Damn got some downvotes for telling people to be cautious lol"

As has been stated, this news didn't even credit their tech explicitly and its related to a minor vertical. I balked and was waiting for an entry this week of around 10.20ish... got close but I hesitated. Talk about picking up pennies in front of a steamroller. FML. Grats to those that have been long... I'll be joining on the dip."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh gotcha. For sure there will be a dip in the morning.. I sold my calls at 3:59pm to avoid the morning sell off and will wait for a better entry before getting back in.

You’re absolutely right though. So many new guys see the +50% and FOMO their college tuition just to watch it fall back to $13-$14

They have innovated in the sector since IPO, but the only thing holding them back was their balance sheet. They had one of the worst PE ratios, as well as not being profitable, and many other financial shortcomings. On Monday after hours, they reported 2020 full year results, and it was great. 1,908% revenue increase year over year ($230 mill), EPS of .53 basic, .45 diluted, compared to .01 loss per share in 2019, $119 million in net earnings compared to a $1 million loss in 2019. Here's a [Yahoo Finance article](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html) on the full results. I don't see much holding this stock back from reentering it's IPO price of around $60 in the coming 2-3 months. It popped up 27% today, $33.96 as of writing. I'm not going to do a full DD, but hopefully this brought some apes attention to this stock, sorry for not talking about it a few days ago when it was cheaper. Not financial advice, yada yada."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel the need to clarify what Abcellera does. I’ll keep it short. Abcellera provides AI tech to help companies discover antibodies that can be developed into drugs. 
Simple as that. Read on if you want a little more info. 

———————————————————————————-

Abcl does not develop or market the drug themself. Bullish bout this cos the main risk is failure in drug development, and abcl’s partners shoulder this risk. Abcl merely helps them discover usable antibodies.

Now what are these “targeted antibodies” or “monoclonal antibodies” for? I also think lots of ppl are underestimating the potential of these drugs. Heard of Humira, Abbvie’s blockbuster drug? It’s a type of monoclonal antibody. These drugs can be used to treat various conditions ranging from cancers, to other stuff like rheumatology, gastrointestinal, neurological, dermatological, autoimmune diseases etc... I think lots of ppl thought it is only good for infection like COVID... Think BEYOND covid 

Here’s how it makes money: https://www.google.co.nz/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/52796529-breakwater-research/5525083-pre-ipo-everything-you-need-to-know-abcellera-part-i

If you feel nerdy and want to understand more bout how monoclonal antibodies treat cancers, here’s a short & sweet vid:

Disclaimer: I’m a shareholder, bullish long term. I’m merely a dude on Reddit who is interested in this company, not a financial advisor. 
I work in the medical field, but knows nothing about biotech or how to value them lol.. I just like how Abcl works and see great potential."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How does this company make money? They provide services? Or do they have approved drugs?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see this going to 100 easily. If you read what they are doing it’s very impressive. They are licensing out their enzymes to other companies and collecting royalties.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And then it got hit with analyst downgrades and the stock got pummeled down to right around my cost basis. Could be worse.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They partner with companies to help them discover antibodies that can be developed into drugs. In summary, 3 income streams: 
- Receives payment to access their tech
- Milestone payment during drug development 
- Royalties on sales of the drugs they help discover

In short, they are betting that their technology will be a success in helping companies develop drugs. This as you can imagine have a huge upside potential, without taking on the risk of a usual biotech company does."

Recently investment fund Archegos caused $30 billion dollars in market selling as a result of failed overleveraged (LOL) margin calls, with many positions being leveraged 8:1 and some as bad as 20:1! As a result, over the recent week we saw share price in ViacomCBS ($VIAC) & Discovery ($DISCA) fall as far as 50% 👀  Whenever a security takes a plunge like this, especially since its caused by a forced sellers rather than a technical or corporate change, they return! This is basically a half off sale on two very very large and successful media corps. Viacom owns BET, Paramount, CBS, CBS Streaming, CBS News & CBS Sports, Discovery is discovery channel. 

As you can see, we are pushing the very bottom of a 1D/1Y regression channel, looking for BIG push this week or next on both securities. If you have any questions, feel free to DM me!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really don't believe TA applies to GME.  TA is largely a self fulfilling prophecy.

I.E. The crayons say it's about to moon, thus it moons because so many people believe in the crayons.

The difference here is that people believe in the crayons when a stock is acting (what is perceived) rationally.  In the eyes of the main, GME is an irrational stock and don't know how to perceive it - thus leaving people to doubt the crayons.  Doubt inhibits the self fulfilling prophecy from occurring, hints why we have seen lots of TA that has never resulted in the next leg up.

TLDR: Crayons don't matter on GME because many people view the stock as irrational and are afraid of losing their tendies.  HODL and wait."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are in a 1h chart, but you draw a symmertrical triangle and you ignore the last bigger breakout. Your analysis is probably not correct."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can yall fucking stop? Have you not learn anything?

Typical markers, analysis and all other standard shit doesnt work on GME!

You are giving false hope. Just enjoy the ride, wait for whales to kill one another and feast on their corpses.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh drawing random lines and thinking they mean something i love this sub
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ummm, pie. Looks like blueberry and cherry with some green mold on top. Ape like"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's get em
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like this is a bias triangle. You didn’t angle it enough outward
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you decide when the straight crayon lines dont have to be outside the squiggly crayon lines
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My wedge is feeling pretty huge looking at this and the tip is ready to overflow rn
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I got excited the first 50,000 times I saw a breakout predicted on GME after a bullish looking wedge but the novelty has worn off"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yes you know what else is filled to the tip rn?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah let’s draw lines wherever the fuck we want!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You can flip that purrtyy triangle upside down and it would still be T.A
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m filled to the tip

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got a huge a wedge filled to the tip right now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A blue triangle on a confusing chart. I’m in!!!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see triangle, what does this mean?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,TA .... how people on twitter think they're relevant in the world.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"hmmmm, I smell what you are cooking."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Market is closed tomorrow. Take a nice break from YOLOs.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the Tip.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What a great throwback. Still think it's the best COD game. Thanks for this.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well those patterns are formed over months of data. So the result may take months to come to fruition. Expecting something on some random ass date is just asking to be let down.

The massive cup and handle has formed. We are tracking upwards. The massive wedge has formed, and can burst upwards any day. 

It is very rare to get a textbook pattern especially when there is so much manipulation"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, every time someone posts a wedge on here the stock dumps like a rock the next day"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well....what did the doctor say? Hodl or Hodl harder? Did you break it with your 💎🤚?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Biggest cup and handle in the history of mankind 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's such bullshit on gme. I wish it were true but this is Billy volatile stock that doesn't abide by technical analysis like this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We have almost 10 million members and the majority have no idea wtf they're doing or talking about. Expect virtually all DD and TA to be dogshit.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of these need volume which...,^u know"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m an avid believer in TA, but anyone who tries to use it on GME is playing a very dangerous retarded game lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed. I am standing here with my dick in hand and waiting for it to pop. It‘s a tough job but someone’s gotta do it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"These people notice the pattern, it doesn’t happen"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In the past 2 months the stock has gone from 40 to 190 so idk what you're complaining about.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"TO BE fair...

Is it forty dollars?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Math Doritos are perfect for tasty dips

💎🙌"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Math dorito... math not required
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wedgie the hedgie
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I too like Math Doritos.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Chart looks broken. It already fell out of wedge so not sure if this is the best way to look at it.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"technical analysis is only good if everyone believes it and the prophecy fulfills.

Otherwise it’s just crayons"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea but this confirms bias!!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not even a wedge on the time frame he cherry picked to show. This is pure nonsense and not how GME or a squueze works.

If hedges gotta buy in you think it matters what fucking chart pattern is?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even then, this stock is NOT normal and can’t be tracked like normal."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Its like reading tea leaves and clouds except with candles
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"""So you mean it's triangles all the way down?""

""Always has been"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea right? Anyone can draw lines on a chart and then immediately ignore them to serve a narrative...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rofl, this had me laughing like an idiot in public transport"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They are gonna have to come up with a new shape when this is all over
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It does match somewhat, since most of the trading going on seem to be HFTs which work based off of algos, and algos are somewhat predictable"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But the price is sitting solid at 190$ you gotta give it some props!! I love this!! 🤘🏼
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Them having the money has never been the problem, they have it. Them being stubborn prideful greedy fucks has always been the problem."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it I fall for it every time so I am always convinced the squeeze is gonna squoze tomorrow 😅. Its kinda fun being a fruit fly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I have Friday off so Thursday is my Friday. Checkmate
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you guys win on the breakout today?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not massive 😂😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I made more money than you today, than you have your entire life."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MS Paint
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, if you ignore the third laterate and account for the pitch of the qualifiers its a cookie cutter ""pig in the hay"" rush"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its clearly an arrow pointing in the direction of ever progressing time. It points to all of our imminent deaths.

Anyway, I'll have some more tendies please"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"True that, I did manage to average down, and it made a healthy turn towards the green but its definitely not a short term winner."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's actually a reddit story about that. Dude got a boner in the woods after popping a pill and couldn't get to a hospital in time. Horrible story, it died and they removed it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it. Get a cyborg dick. Always hard.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So does eating gluten.  (Everything comes back to cArtoons. South Park in this case)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot double, triple, and quadruple witching day.  Shit got me freaked out on the 19th that market was gonna crash.  Well written DD, seen like 50 of them on GME going to moon tomorrow."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You also have the tunica albugiunea which closes during erection and after 4 hours you pretty much destroy the ability to maintain a normal erection after.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just destroyed a fantasy of mine.  That's okay, I'm into that shit too."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Most girls don't like 4 hours of sex....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I have an erection that lasts longer than 4 hours she's the one who's going to need to see a doctor.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t believe it, pretty sure I went 6-8 hours once after a rave"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My GF give my dick mouth to mouth so cirkulation is fine for hours
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is because if it is stuck it could mean a blood clot at the wrong spot, right? I have a vagina so I get a whole different manual...."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, I seen some guy play with Elliott waves for 5 hours on YouTube today trying to predict GME. He was getting genuinely confused when the stock didn't do what he wanted it to do. 

Technicals are a good servant, but a bad master."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME doesn't get failed by [TA](http://imgur.com/gallery/LXWuITm), most of these young posters are just half cocked looking for karma. $150 to $150 [cup and handle](http://thepatternsite.com/cup.html) had 60% chance of 50% rise with an upward breakout. Which happened. TA is just stats for charts. 

Patterns have a predictable fail rate that can be estimated as well. I use the previous charting to time my entries and exits in GME"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still possible, analysis still applies to GME"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or betting on NBA with any level of certainty.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tea leaves in upper right quadrant. Bullish.

I REPEAT, SCORPIO IS IN URANUS"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also known as the ""huge wedge getting filled to the tip"" pattern"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I fully expect that the MMs will try to kill the price tomorrow just so that lots of call fall otm at close.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still a breakout, just not the one everyone wants"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,God dammit I'm in. What a perfect use of all my $1
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Salami from the deli!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if they cool ranch
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is an underrated comment
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just ignore that part, duh"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same thought.. why does it just ignore that the wedge isn't a wedge.

Edit: don't believe in technical voodoo but if you are going to voodoo then who do somewhat convincingly"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm channeling my inner-global consciousness for ya'll, feeling cute, might destroy the stock market tomorrow too."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm 100% for the cause but I don't see a reason to blindly accept everything. Because if this doesn't moon in the next couple of days (or whatever), the apes that saw this image and believed in it are going to start doubting. So consider this a disclaimer, because I know how enticing charts can be."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Up until it doesn't. If let's say this doesn't take off in the near future then you will remember this chart and you will doubt. I want it to moon just as much as anyone else but how many of these chart interpretations I've seen not meet expectations day after day it does more damage than good. Educate yourself! I fully believe in GME just be patient.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah that’s deep
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Its crazy. Retail has power when its focused. And it's crazy the Funds shorted it again. Honestly once this is over. I wouldn't be surprised to see a 3rd squeeze.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Its almost like no one knows what's gonna happen and we are speculating to amuse ourselves
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Details, minor details"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the pattern is not a wedge. It is the classic INVERSE SHARK pattern and should be traded with caution. So, when clicking the buy button you must be quite stealthy."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would GameStop win though? Issuing shares would be a massive middle finger to all their retail shareholders. They'd raise some capital and lose a lot of customer support in return.

I like the white crayons."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am waiting for the announcement and looking for a better buy in!! 🤘🏼 I hope they take it easy....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The short was 140% 3 months ago 6 months ago and now... it is what it is.... What cause the price to surge is no STOP LOSS... they never thought anyone would buy GME.... now that they have stop losses they are just prolonging the inevitable.... it’s okay let them pour more BIllions into it... 🤘🏼🤘🏼 I’ll be there to see it! Good luck!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I like hot dogs
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All good in the hood until someone loses their wood.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirms here for me ... wedgie looks good for a rip
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,For their long term play they'd have say $2 to $4 billion in the bank.  From a long term survival perspective and capital to implement a massive swing from brick and mortar to online focus it might be a solid long term play.  I can guarantee they are at least considering it and weighing their loss of support vs future impact 3 to 5 years from now.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Says the dude that bought over 400 and will never see that again 😅😅
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure they get cut up for you, and you eat them with a spoon."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,All fine and dandy until someone can no longer get randy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,sad thing is that I don’t care if it does go over $400 again😎I’ll hold till I fucking die you hedgie bitch

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"do we have any hope of this dipping on open?  I don't mind averaging up but dont want to too much lol

Personally I got into this stock right when I opened an account to get in on GME....done alot of reading of DD here and elsewhere and absolutely love the outlook of this company.  I think April is going to be a big month for this one.

Thinking of taking my profits from dvax and moving it over to this."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls deep in Miss Mavis. Lets fucking gooo!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you didn’t sell before product launch.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MVIS gang is wheres its been at
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was super happy to watch it jet up today but...why did it happen?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t call a doctor, you call another hooker. Charles Sheen"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"  
For an erection lasting more than 4 hours, call more b\*\*\*hes"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,On that gains train too bb 🚀🚀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My stupid ass had 300 shares at 88 cents a share. I was selling calls and then had to sell at 2 bucks a share... fuck me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold my MVIS shares back at $1.40 cuz was happy w gains... take my L and fuck me with it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What i like about dfv is how hes never nasty or anything. The best manners to his naysayers.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Their CFO's name is Steve Holt
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,MAYVISSS
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I'm literally 1,000 shares at $1.40 avg I swear to God how do I post a pic I'm new to reddit 😂
I originally entered at ~$0.80 but avg up a little, holding this MF till $110+"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, I was going to buy stock in that company last week because I thought their products are cool. And then I figured they might have a shitload of competition or something/what I think usually has no correlation to the stock price. Anyway, I like the jawns they make, they could be in some pretty cool devices."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuuuuck that average cost..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Think it will still be running at the bell tomorrow
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Whaaaa? $1.41!  You motherfucker.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bravo!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did they go up 50% near close today?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I put like $100 when it was at 0.60 per share
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That took a nice little leap dinnit
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In for 1200 shares. Let’s get it!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"When did you first buy this stock, and what got you interested in the first place?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am up 1$ on MVIS. Been holding since the last time it was up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,In since .90 been picking more up on dips. 1400ish shares now at 5.25ish average. Already locked in gains and I’m just letting the rest ride. Hoping for good PR/news on the LIDAR sample in April!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice sir! I have 300 @ 1.38 myself
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We go through lots of dipskiis but the upskiis are quite grand
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao what the heck it was like 12 yesterday
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Save some jizz for the rest of us
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you know to invest in $MVIS when it was at 1.19? Was there a particular reason you invested?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lets save the ocean
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You better have sold CCs at the top you cunt! Congrats!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,wow....I always miss it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m balls deep in sndl but my friend made a 69 dollar gain on $mvis today 2D m00n
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I owned $7k of them but sold too soon like retard I am.  I would've had $126k+ had I kept it. 
https://imgur.com/a/9oej7Oj"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL because MVIS can go 10X from here!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late to yolo at open?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Closed out of my 4/16 CCs when they were >80% return, then things shot up...so I closed out of my 4/16 puts which were also >80% return.

Fresh batch of covered calls going out, can't ignore those premiums"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I have 3 shares at $15 each ... not much but it’s something !
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"you cost basis is 1.41 and you only have 1k shares!? guh bro. either way im with you, getting them mvis gainz"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But at what price did you buy the contracts at?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not quite sure why you're still using robinhood
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ismt this thread supposed to be loss porn?  Fuck you buddy.

Also call me"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just bought in, I want a long erection too"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice! I'm still playing catch-up, here. New to the game and getting my feet wet, developing a strategy. It seems like the key to getting in early is: Identify emerging field (like tech) > Identify key players still establishing themselves > do DD on them > buy a bunch of what looks good > wait till it goes to moon. Have I got that?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man make sure you take *some* profit. 
  
Nobody on this sub (despite what they'll say here) knows for sure to an absolute certainty, that Daddy Microsoft will even use the MVIS chip in their products. Rn, your gains are mostly hype. MVIS doesn't even have revenue."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"new to stocks, how the fuck do you guys choose where to park your money?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My husband has a 1.05 in MVIS average on one of his accounts! He doesn’t want to ruin that by buying more!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and Fuck you!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"same.  Pissed my buy in the 12s dip didnt trigger the other day.  Got it in too late.  Still may average up.

only 60 shrs, so not just poor...but late since I didn't have an account till after the first round of GME squeeze, want to get to 100 at least before it really takes off."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add a ""1"" in front of that 50"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you guys not just sell at 30% profit? I've lost so much money holding on stocks that my gut tells me to sell when I see green.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was in at 1.6.... but sold at 2.7 fml
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold 10 contracts of the 24 strike two days ago FML.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're partial to options, then you'd be better off looking a month out to May. There's no confirmation on when the working demo is scheduled to happen in April, and if it ends up being on or after April 21, then you'd end up missing a lot of upside. OR...play it safer and just grab shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I did about the same. Took profits on NEM and managed to buy another measly 100 shares at 12ish this week. Now holding 800 @ 14.69.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,what is sell?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$MSFT announced 20 billion dollar contract for Hololens, MVIS is one of the key components of it. IMO that’s not even their most potentially valuable vertical. Their best in class automotive LiDAR will be ready this month. hype has been growing for some time over this past year on buyout rumors."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Microsoft got military contract which uses microvision hololens tech
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,gather up the WSB wives in need of a boyfriend
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never really understood this mentality. Over the past ~6 months I’ve bought and sold GME at different points all the way from $11 to $450. So for example when I sold my $11 at $15 and then it jumped to $18 did I care about what I did in the past? No. All that mattered was at that point in time did it seem like it was going to continue rising from that point? And if the answer was yes then I bought.

Don’t let your past actions prevent you from future gains."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,should always try and be nice. But sometimes gotta let a MF know..
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I initially bought at 50¢. I actually averaged up to 1.40
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Click reply, add image"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Might consolidate but doesn’t matter much because once the A sample completion comes out in April the pps will gain another 50%. MVIS provides a lot of great opportunities to buy in and add to your position :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Microsoft was awarded a $20B contract with the military for their AR headsets. MVIS tech is inside Microsofts hololens 2.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stumbled across them at the 50¢ range about a year ago. Did a bunch of DD and averaged up some
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,can’t stop $CUMing
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"randomly stumbled upon them initially, then did my DD/homework and believed their tech will be gamechangers"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,done. less pollution on earth when we’re all on the moon
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold 30c and 35c that week it ripped to the high 20s, with like 2 week expiration 🤙🏻"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP bro. That’s part of the reason I didn’t keep buying more ans just let my initial investment ride. I Likely would’ve been more tempted to sell it all and miss the later moon’ing
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It was in the 20s last month. strongly believe it’ll get back there or higher soon. Just need patience — not financial advice —
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not too late . Sub 20 is a steal . Did my DD
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,smart man
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you afraid the any positive news will kill your covered calls ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,too true
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve made other plays while waiting for this to happen, just set and forget this. should I have averaged up? Probably."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought them earlier this week at .8, .1, .13"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,bc I have open options and GME on it still.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! Found a cheat code to change the color theme to green mode
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s many strategies. I was just patient with MVIS bc I did my homework and stuck to my belief that they will continue to grow.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, a guy on r/MVIS confirmed that MVIS chips are in the hololens. He bought one and took it apart and it was right there on the chips. There’s a ton of DD over there I reccomend you check it out. Video of the tear down is on YouTube."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,shhhh I'm trying to sell them calls above $30
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,R/stocks is that way 👉
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He did it for the karma. Madlad
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could do this whole selling covered calls and still keep my shares thing. Every time I sell calls the stonk rockets...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What does his boyfriend think?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This rocket's about to shoot.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,its only a matter of time
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Still worth climbing on board?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">MVIS 

What made you decide to buy in at .98? I only hear about stocks AFTER they've blown up"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I did exactly the same. I sold when it peaked yesterday because that stock will definitely dip again. I don‘t know why and I‘m seeing a bright future for them but it  keeps dipping so hard every time
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone has their own style. Don't look down on those who don't follow your grove. For me personally I threw a thousand at it since what I read about it all seemed like great news. If it tanks, no big loss, if it does well a year from now I'll maybe consider taking gains out or let it soak for a while longer. As they say, ""Sir, this is a casino."" Everyone has a different game play."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because MVIS is the most undervalued stock on the market and I still believe it’s at a good entry point today. That’s why I’m not selling.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you're selling things reliably by the time they get to 30% you're not thinking about things right and you're likely to lose money in the long run.

If you're holding very solid high cap stocks you might make out okay, but if you're mostly in small caps you'll likely lose over the long run. This is similar to any gambling type situation, like poker where it's all about those big money wins to be a profitable player.

The number of times you'll get burned is likely to outweigh the number of times you win so you need to shoot higher. I'm not saying never sell when you're at 10-30% profit. Sometimes that is the right move, but if it's your main strategy (because of fear) you will likely miss out on some several hundred percent gains that you really need to ensure your portfolio grows over time.

This is not financial advice. I'm just a 🦍 who's been down the exact road it sounds like you're on and have so many regrets about selling so many of my positions at like 15% gains only to see them 2-3x later."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop looking.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is super high , at 300 percent ."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks - bought msft 4/9 250c at .28, sold half at .59, riding out the theta on house money to see what happens next week."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know. I heard other people say it, I was just trying to sound smart."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m learningggg
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just jealous of your cost basis :)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell them already ?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, we couldn't get your comment without mine, so in a way we're technically both helpful."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rephrase, new to stonks, how do you guys find bananas? 

(On a serious note, I'd like to yolo, but yolo with at least a bit of dd, or any sort of reduced risk. It's why lottery tickets are mostly purchased by the poor. We don't have much to lose and the market preys on hope)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you’re not wrong hah
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yeah it is
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not a squeeze. It’s just a good stock.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, this is just the beginning. AR is just one of their verticals. Lidar demo should be in april. The company is eager to sell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy and hold! If it dips buy more and if it never dips below your average just buy dips on the way up
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumb luck mostly? I was specifically looking for cheap stocks in the tech industry at that time and the rabbit hole led to mvis.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not looking down on anybody I just fear missing out on gains especially when I could have tripled my money on the OG GME squeeze.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes a lot of sense. I have a couple of month out calls that I think I'm fairly confident in and I think I'll try to calm my itchy trigger finger on. Thanks!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow we will test 14 support level imo anything under 15 is a buy.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't come back from that. Accept the burn and move along.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope. Bought some more on the dip today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub has been ruined by people who refer to us as apes etc. 

There used to be good stuff, but now the GME horde downvotes anything other than GME. 

You can find some under the DD section in the heading texts of the daily threads. But that's it. This place is ruined."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just the tips, together, as one ☝️"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We could really use more lidar companies out there. Velodyne has been...disappointing.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man that's so lucky! I want to jump in on this too. The company looks amazing for long term. People keep talking about a buyout, but I didn't find any credible news. What chances do you see for this stock if there's no buyout?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the stock. For sweet baby MVIS we all believe she has way more growth, and that there's a buyout coming one day soon.

We trust the company, the product, and we trust Sumit.

But we don't trust Kevin."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then honestly sounds like day trading is more your thing.  And that's totally cool cause that's fun too.  I highly recommend everybody try it, especially if you're addicted to the ticker."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you’ve failed before you even started 😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep new lasers away from cops and deal
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,damn should i buy this stock it just went up a lot tho
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First I need 25k.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What everyone says when a stock rises, when it's falling or trading sideways for a while no one bats an eye. 

Wait for a dip to buy in and ride the rumor of a buy out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah i been waiting for a dip didn’t just buy in
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this not a dip?
2021-04-01 00:56:35,wallstreetbets,"Put all my life savings into RKT 🚀🚀🚀 &#x200B;

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This literally can’t go tits up. I’m in @ $23.71 and buying more next dip
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO and wife selling 40m shares worries me a little. I see some say it's not a big deal tho.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really believe you'll get this money back with interest if you hold long enough. Whether it's enough to compensate you after the discount (please let inflation fears be overblown!) will be interesting for you. 

But I'm that guy averaged in below 20 (from the sideways days). I like the stock. So this isn't financial advice.

Remindme! 1 year"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, wsb needs to put the mm to.ahame here they are holding down this stock"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not in rocket right now but no it's not necessarily bad. Theres an article that states they sold to be able to put it into their non-profit organization. I don't know the validity of that but they didn't sell nearly enough to make an impact on the price.

They collectively still own more than 90% of shares in rocket"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That is actually scary.  Wouldn’t they be holding if they are confident with the company???  And they are the one managing it!? 🤔

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The sale was to fund their foundation’s 500m Detroit revitalization efforts. Not because they don’t have faith in the company.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You stupid fucks that believe short interest is any kind of indicator of a good investment opportunity crack me the fuck up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Also i believe the term is called retarded

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"See that’s the problem.  That’s not fucking why that happens.  A stock primarily goes up and down based on demand from buyers.  A stock is only worth what someone is willing to pay for it.  Someone shorting a stock is in the exact same boat as someone buying the stock long.  You buy the stock in hopes it goes up, someone going short the stock doesn’t make the stock go down.  If people keep buying, the stock goes up.  Period."

Looks like they crushed earnings, and the lockups expiring only caused a minor dip this morning. This puppy may be fueled up to moon. I took a small position the other day, and may add to it after the good news. Just wanted to share.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman had his collateral to exit the trades without a loss. They are not retards like Nomura and Credit Suiss.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I refuse to edit, I made my bed now I'll lie in it"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt the stupid urge to give you a high five. I'm so retarded.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, please do that. S&P just revised CS outlook to negative based on deficient risk management... what about the green sill loss a week before materializing billions in loss? Or the espionage scandal in 2019 where the COO literally hired private investigators to follow their competition. Or when their Ceo called luckin coffee their dream client when they underwrote their IPO and then luckin coffee had an accounting scandal where they were just fined in December for 180mm.

I thought the hyperbole was clear lol. It’s the tone from the top set by chief risk officer Lara Warner, not your friend who is likely in the meat grinder.

They knew about the losses along with all the other banks by last Friday. UBS ms gs Jpm DB placed weekend orders. Credit Suisse waited until market hours on Monday to liquidate. They clearly are not up to par"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, her and the whole department might as well have not even existed... judging by what just happened"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The situation is fucked, and we need real change, but god I am seriously laughing at GS just fucking selling and flipping everyone else off.  Not only that, after Nomura and Credit Suisse warned of losses, GS was like ""we good"" with immaterial impact"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're telling me, the bank that bankrupted Greece stabbed someone else in the back? Never woulda seen that coming."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This in china, and they triple R your ass : reduce, recycle, reuse."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't get how you draw that conclusion. If they were writing TRS to a long-only fund (which is what is rumoured) then the hedge is simply to buy the underlying. The fund has gone bust and can't meet it's margin call and Goldman's have had to unwind the TRS and liquidate the underlying into a falling market i.e. they're holding the bag. If they hedged correctly then they _should_ have lost money. Only if they're hedged _incorrectly_ could they have made money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They can’t liquidate if it goes against their csa’s or isdas. For all we know CS’ vm was high on the swaps so they didn’t send a margin call until monday
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real problem is, they probably shorted both before fucking them over."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you think this guy was the only one I've got a great lead on a former brick and mortar store you could short. Literally can't go tits up

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he in china, jail is ligh sentence.  You could vanish into thin air and disappear forever, thats a real sentence."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over leverage your bank? Jail.

Under leverage? Also jail.

We have the best stonkbrokers, because of jail."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,A little of **that** too
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s exactly the opposite.  Goldman and the other PBs were plying the prisoners dilemma (game theory). They sold first - even though they will 100% be working with these firms again. The risk must have been so great that they needed to liquidate the positions before the other PBs. That’s my take
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mr roboto

Despite the company’s extremely strong Q4 growth and the upbeat macro outlook, UWMC stock has a forward price-earnings ratio of just 5.9 times. That’s extremely cheap in today’s market.

Further, the mortgage originator has a superb dividend yield of 5%, Value investors will enjoy the low valuation of UWMC stock, while income investors will be very pleased with its large dividend yield. Those investors should buy the shares."

2021-04-01 00:37:33,wallstreetbets,"$MVIS Update - Why it's not too late. Greetings, my fellow degenerates.

Last week, I posted my first ever DD on MVIS. I recommend you read it here: [https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs\_friday\_dd\_mvis/](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/me3f3r/zerog34rs_friday_dd_mvis/)

If you missed it, today MVIS took flight as it pulled 50%ish on the day. It took liftoff at the start of power hour and, after 20 glorious minutes, began the trend sideways to eventually close at $18.55 (up from sub-$14.00).

**Why did this happen?**

Well, Microsoft won a contract with the U.S. Army for augmented-reality headsets, worth up to $21.9 B over 10 years: [https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/31/microsoft-wins-contract-to-make-modified-hololens-for-us-army.html)

I believe, as I explain in my DD, MVIS is going to continue it's rise all throughout 2021. I have different price targets depending on scenarios but for the short-term, I believe MVIS will hit $29 by end of the month (APR).

**How will it get there? What's new this past week besides the spike?**

1. MVIS is going to be showing off their LiDAR in an APR demo. They were still on track to meet their goals during their last report.
2. Biden Infrastructure Plan - Building a national EV charging system, promoting vehicle exchanges from less efficient gas-powered cars to full EV or hybrid EVs. EVs and autonomous vehicles go hand-in-hand so this plan is great for MVIS as well.
3. MORE job openings (up to 17 now thus confirming my claim last week that hiring would ramp up): [http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj](http://www.microvision.com/current-openings/?p=job%2FoTo4efwj)
4. Buyout possibility still on the table from a T1 tech company that *may or may not* already be invested in MVIS tech (RE: MVIS DD)
5. MVIS dropped hard with the NASDAQ dumping last week but as of today is the BEST recovery stock impacted
6. Short-interest is still a factor with >1 day to cover:

Short Volume Ratio: 13% (down from 30% last week) - [https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis](https://fintel.io/ss/us/mvis)

% of Volume Shorted as of Mar. 30: 33.46% (down from 64.98% last week) - [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/MVIS)

% of Shares Shorted:  15.32% (up from 12.64% last week) - [https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/MVIS/short-interest/)

Summary Quote: [https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote](https://shortsqueeze.com/?symbol=MVIS&submit=Short+Quote)

There are excellent long and short-term opportunities to play here. So for those feeling the FOMO, I believe there's still plenty of time to get in even if the sub-$14.00 bargain price is gone.

**Positions**

* Shares - 600 @ 14.46 (up from 100 at $13.33)
* Options - Closed my contracts today during the run, will be reopening positions when I calibrate my goals tomorrow

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,for how much everyone in here claims to hate hedge funds and the 1% you sure try hard as fuck to be them
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m confused. Do you want them regulated? The more the govt meddles in markets the more it will affect retail, too. Esp with Dems.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think they can afford to bail out hedgies. In fact, the prevailing sentiment at the last hearing seemed to be “What would happen if we let Melvin or citadel fall?” And it seemed everyone kind of shrugged like “eh, maybe nothing?”"

Sometimes to cure depression you need to feel alive and challenged and sweat for your living instead of sitting inside playing video games and hoping you get into the college you want.   America needs the workers to take power again and start glorifying trades instead of denigrating them as the death throes of an ignorant lower class.  The people at the top in big tech have only proven that greed and entitlement have no limits
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it's someone they've explicitly already paid off? Of course they love it. The people reading the news think ""Wow, they're being regulated, surely things are up and up now!"" and in reality they're all enjoying fleecing the taxpayer with free bailouts for their gambling losses.

She'll make some regulatory threats and high profile ""fines"" that are a small tax deductible line item while a taxpayer-funded safety net makes sure they can gamble freely and the IRS goes after retail investors to punish them for daring to play with the rich's profit margins."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"SEC and the Fed have been slowly closing in on quasi-hedge funds operating as family offices. They have to at least register with the SEC now, which is something they never used to do. People are super critical of Yellen for taking Citadel's money and I'm not saying they're wrong to be critical but the speaking circuit is a big moneymaker for ex-public institution execs and doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to be actively corrupt. It's not like Citadel was given special treatment, she took a similar amount from Standard Charter and PwC as well as fuck tons from GS, UBS and loads of others. When she returned to the Fed, she actually had to sell off a load of her stocks because of ethical safeguards and she's almost certainly going to have lost money working at the Fed due to opportunity cost.   


Yellen is probably going to genuinely move towards proper regulation and oversight of as many loopholes as possible. As far as the SEC is concerned, family offices do pose systemic risk if not properly examined."

I been wanting to get into a trade(only thing I'm good at is blue collar shit), but I'm terrified of heights.. and small spaces.. and insects or rodents.

That basically disqualifies me from electric, plumbing, HVAC, and welding. Mechanic school takes too long. Trucking is a no-no because I need to sleep in my own bed at night.

Going back to your point.. I trust any blue collar worker way more than my white collar employers. I've never been blatantly lied to and exploited by a working man. Working men, including those with criminal records, are typically honorable people.. they understand that we're all struggling the same struggle."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, people who do labor that any laborer anywhere in the world can do should ditch the entitlement and accept that the global median standard of living is acceptable. 

That’s entitlement. Thinking you can do what someone in Bangladesh or El Salvador can do (even though they grew up eating a bowl of rice or beans) and have essentially no formal education but you deserve to have a nice $20k car and a nice 1br apartment in a desirable metro area while going out to eat constantly 

Americans lack perspective. Go join the peace corps and see what the global norm actually is, and maybe you’ll be thankful for what you are already entitled to

Why do you think people walk thousands of miles from the Northern Triangle to our southern border? Because we all collectively live in relative luxury that 90% of the world does not

Per the federal government, the US poverty line is somewhat over $12k USD. The global median individual income is $9k USD PPP. The median Indian individual income is $2.5k USD PPP. The median in Colombia is $1.5k USD PPP. The median in El Salvador is $1.1k

You’re right third worlders don’t have the epidemic of mental illness we do. Americans need to live hard lives, eating three bowls of rice a day, and be happy owning maybe one motorbike for the family and they’ll be happy like the rest.

It can be tough when ya work so hard for your family, destroy your body, make more money than most, yet everyone still looks at you as an abject failure, generally results in these men (the females in trades tend to be super stable) ""settling"" for less than ideal partners (far and away their biggest downfalls) so I get it... its rough out there, and we really do as a country need to bring back some pride to the trades.

That said, I don't believe ANYONE should be content with how much the leaders of society fuck us over. It's a goddamn fact of life that the upper class supress the lower class, and without exceptional talent or dilligence, it is nearly impossible to bridge that gap. I find it absolutely absurd that it's acceptable for a piece of shit to succeed merely because their family is rich, whilst good people with noble dreams are suppressed by the very same goddamn pieces of shit who aren't worth any more than their birth.

- everybody has the same duties and the same rights, the same penalties and the same goals.
Useful goals, tons our smartest people are living to predict the net worth of a corp the next year or even something more stupid, like Forex. People throwing coins at each other betting that what they throw worth less that what they receive, literally. Even us,  some of us are really intelligent and it's right to fight this time. Because this time it may work, maybe this time we can start to equalise. But after that I hope that some of the smartest among us will start to think at real problems, not economy. Real problems like: age populations gap, global warming, population increasing, finite supply resource etc... Those are the type of questions people should try to answer. 
When I start to think that economy is nothing more than sophisticated barter it's impossible to not see that states are tribes, where tribes this good model for a society ? 
Power over nature or power over humans ? What's worthy to think about in the long run ?
People should worth what they do not what they own, build something don't invest in something. ( Not this time, this time is worthy, buy more gme)

The first world, through the current status quo, has it extremely lucky

Nomad capitalist said it very well recently. He doesn’t hire Americans. They’re entitled and lazy and spoiled (I’m American so don’t think I’m just trying to shit talk Americans). He hires solely in Eastern Europe. He had it right when he said 90% of the world’s population is ok with three bowls of rice, one motorbike, and a hut with a mud floor for a family. They’re eager for work. We live in a society where we’ve let entitlement run wild. I know I quoted you the figures earlier about US poverty line vs global and other country’s medians. I purposely used PPP (purchasing power parity) figures - when I say an El Salvadoran has $1.5k USD PPP, that means an average El Salvadoran *does not* make $1.5k/yr, but rather s/he can afford an equivalent in local currency that an American in America can afford on $1.5k/yr - same lifestyle, same goods, same housing 

Any American would say that $1.5k/yr is impossible. That’s what the *average* Salvadoran lives with for their entire life."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t say it sarcastically, I said PPP because people make the same argument as you “it costs more here.” 

The point of the $9k figure is that everybody in the world would live like an American does in America for $9k

This would be an objective upgrade for 90% of the world’s population and a downgrade for Europe and the English speaking countries like America Canada Australia and New Zealand

Make no mistake I was not being sarcastic, but dead serious"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Purchasing power parity 

No worries homie we were all (and many still are) at this point. If you care, just ditch the modern media and sports and reality tv and read about geopolitics and global economics and history and whatever interests you. Listen to academically sound podcasts and read *Foreign Affairs* instead of *Men’s Health* or whatever popular garbage is out there

A good starting point is Peter Zeihan’s books. He’s very high level, broad brushstrokes, and misses a lot of details, but it’s a very great starting point 

A good perspective on the changing global business landscape from a “low” level individual is Nomad Capitalist on YouTube. Don’t try to take away any high level ideas from him but get a feel for what trends are and will be"

That’s literally what the ruling class goes for when they fabricate all these decade long wars and conflicts.  Make some part of the world a living hell to look perfect in comparison"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come on man, calm down

I cited $9k USD PPP, which is the global median *income as if the person were an American earning American dollars living in America.*

That is not an extreme, that is literally the 50th percentile (as is the definition of median). That’s nenas out of ~7.5B, half of the World’s population (~3.25 billion) lives worse than an American making $9k/yr. 

We don’t even want to touch India at $2.5k USD PPP (that means the average Indian lives like an American would in America in $2.5k) or the average Chinese at $1.8k USD PPP (meaning the average Chinese rice farmer lives a life like an American in Oklahoma making $1.8k/yr). 

Look man I’m drunk as shit now, but I can tell you care. Caring is more than 90% of the battle. I am so drunk I didn’t even realize I’ve been responding to you on WSB because I don’t talk politics here, but if you’re open to continue talking (constructive dissent is always constructive), I’d love to continue this back and forth somewhere not on WSB.

I promise you I’m not an evil billionaire banker or some shit. I’m just a mid 20s working professional child of immigrants grew up in East Oakland and have a somewhat nuanced and different take on “what is” because I took the unconventional route and gave half of my 20s up to Uncle Sam and got to live with and in real poverty across the globe

2021-04-01 00:10:33,wallstreetbets,"Why Bill Hwang got margin called **TLDR:** >!Bill Hwang got margin called because he immediately reinvested his money. How? Read the article you retard.!<

&#x200B;

**Disclaimer:** This is not financial advise and I'm not a financial advisor. In fact, as this is of one of my first articles here, don't shoot me immediately unless it's to the moon! Tho I'd love some feedback from you all, I'd love even more that you do your own DD and analyses.

&#x200B;

Hi fellow apes and retards, 

&#x200B;

So if you've all followed the news, or even the daily charts here on Reddit, you've read that Bill Hwang has received a margin call of several billions, probably the largest margin call ever seen. In this article, I'd like to connect the dots for you guys on that call.

&#x200B;

**Bill Hwang** has made an incredible fortune on Wall Street. With Archegos Capital Management (ACM), he and a lot of employees are trading nonstop to achieve financial freedom, about a million times financial freedom. To many of us is that a dream, some are on their way, others are starting their journey to what Bill Hwang has accomplished. My reason for this article is that **we all can make the same mistakes as mr Hwang did**, although it will be one of a smaller size, it's impact on our lives can be just as large as it is to Bills. We should learn from him.

**So why does he even get margin called? He's got a fortune, right?** Well yeah, he does. Or actually, he does, but he's also got a bazillion of leverage. Basically, what Bill did, is he got a $600 share for about $100 of his own money, the other $500 was a loan. Unlike what some say, loans are okay, every major company has loans, and they are able to borrow money because they have assets.

The same goes with ACM and Bill Hwang. As they bought something worth $600 with $600, that's fine you would say. Except he didn't actually buy it. Bloomberg reported that Bill was trading in swap stocks and leveraged **contracts for difference, or CFDs**. These are legal in Europe, not anymore in the US. a CFD is basically agreeing to deposit $600, with the same price flow as Stock X, and when it goes to $800, you get the difference in your bank account **immediately**. 

One of the most quotes here on reddit, and especially in the much volatile GME thread, is: **You only lose when you sell.** But in the case of Bill Hwang and CFDs, that is actually **false** because he doesn't buy any asset, he deposits money that replicates the same price movement as an asset. And still, that's okay, even when leveraged, that's okay, because it allowes to replicate a $600 stock with just $100, and when it goes to $800, you have $200 extra in your account. 

Now let's say we got another example. In this case, We have stock B that is currently trading at a $100 price. Bill has got $100, so he would buy 1 CFD. But when he leverages this with $500, he's now able to buy 6 CFDs. If the price of stock B moves to $150, he would not have $50 in profit, but now, **6 times as much**, which makes $300! The value of the CFDs is now 6 x $150 = $900, $500 being borrowed, $100 initial deposit, and $300 profit.

Bill came up with a great plan. He's got the $300 immediately in his account. Stock B trades at $150 and Bill expect it to rise even more. So bill takes his $300 profit, and of buying 2 stocks, he leverages it with the same 5:1 ratio and get about $1500 in leverage. Now, he's able to buy 12 more CFDs of $150 each. **Bill has only invested $400 of his own money, but owns 18 CFDs, worth $2700!** 

Now here's comes scary part. Bill doesn't own a stock asset at all. He has something that replicates the movement of a stock. It may well be that the price goes down, even tho Bill has great interest in the stock. **As Bill didn't buy any stock, but a CFD, the price doesn't move up or down by Bill's moves.**

As he doesn't own the stock, the underlying asset is.... (surprise)... **his bank account**! And in that bank account is $2000 leveraged, $100 initial deposit, $300 in profit. That's only $2400. You ask where the rest is? There is no other $300. It is leveraged profit from the first 6 CFDs. 

Now let's say the price goes down from $150 to a price of $125 per stock B. That means his 18 CFDs decrease $25 each, **he's lost a whopping $450.** Bill's only got $125 x 18 CFDs = $2250 now. And that's also okay, because he borrowed $2000 and invested $100 initially. He's got $150 in total profit, still. Please note: this gets immediately charged on this bank account value, because as profits do, losses do too.

But what happens when the price goes to, let's say, back to $100? His underlying asset, his bank account, is only valued at 18 CFDs worth $1800 in total. It starts getting tricky because the bank wants their $2000 back. **The profit and initial deposit have vanished.**

At a certain, pre-defined point, the bank does not want to take more risk of losing the $2000 loan because Bill is nearly broke. As the price goes to about $50, 18 CFD value at $900, Bill needs to pay a lot back and he hasn't got any assets supporting him and eventually leads to a predefined margin call. This can be tackled by diversification, but as we saw in the tech stocks, if a full sector or even multiple sectors decrease, this gets tricky.

 That's why profits can be great, but continuous reinvesting of profits can make a slippery slope."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"People.buy companies with leverage all the time. Infact this is what Private équity and Venture capitalists specialize in

Bill's problem is he owned so much of the company indirectly but couldn't tell the CEO to f*** off with a plan to sell 3bn of shares to dilute existing shareholders

Basically he had no control over a company he owned a huge stake in

Strange"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"To clarify, CFDs are legal to trade in the US by firms that secure an ISDA (which is out of reach at assets below 10m). So... illegal for the everyman but not hedgies"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long-term it doesn't mean that his positions were wrong, it just means that they didn't work out in the short-term with leverage."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So how much of the VIAC and DISCA stock prices is solely because of him?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bill wants to be either the richest on the planet or a nobody. That is all...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the whole thing and still don't know the most important thing. He gots a hot girl?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically, Bill Hwang is an autist who just had too much money to lever with ."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we get a TLDR of the TLDR?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So he pulled a guh

Only he was generally smarter about his plays

idk why people just continue playing the game like they're yoloing the money earned from 3 months of burgerflipping

At some point you're just certified rich and its time to call it a day and hop on to boomer stocks"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Another aspect of this is that he put on these total return swaps on the same stocks with different banks? So it is also like creating his own one-man pyramid scheme as well?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Losing $10B sounds crazy. Can’t even fathom.. why would u even risk that much. 🤦🏽
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guy literally went itty bitty shitty titties up

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So Bill dabbled in CertifiedFDs???

Cool, use it leveraged to make another $5bil. Hit a $20bil milestone? Let's do this, all in. We're leveraged out the ass? All. Fucking. In."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He belongs here. He'd get an honorary award. A play that autistic screams WSB. He probably got tired of seeing people turn thousands into millions on WSB and went full retard. His only down fall was he didn't realize that 70% of WSB is loss porn.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"From what I understand the total margin available to a robinhood trader simply matches the amount of the deposit, effectively 2x leverage (not sure if I am using that term correctly). So while an individual trade might be leveraged by multiples larger than 2x, the portfolio as a whole would not be.

Then again, I only have experience with a cash account on robinhood, never touched robinhood gold. Not sure if you can do something as risky as selling naked covered calls  on that type of account, (which could risk one getting margin called).

From what I am understanding the problem here in this situation was that the unrealized profits from the price movement became available immediately to be used as additional collateral to gain further access to more margin, increasing their leveraged position. This property seems to be the unusual case here vs. what is normally allowed? Otherwise what's preventing others from following suit in similar risky plays?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"“ Seriously, you really think Bill Hwang opened a retail CFD account like you.”

- never said that! I explained the concept in a very simple way.

“In addition he actually had cash, underlying and other swaps as collateral.”

- I just focused on CFDs here. If you think (and I’m not saying you do) he has a underlying for a CFD, we agree to disagree, because a CFD has no underlying (that’s the concept of a CFD)."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he triple downs and exercises the option call.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol this is so absurd how long this is going on. In this case, the journey and the destination are both equally awesome"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that for every dollar fluctuation this guy gains or losses 100k just baffles me. He’s not our elected leader but our natural one
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,YOU BEAUTIFUL BIG BALLED APE...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's gonna exercise those options. $12 per share × 100 shares × 500 contracts = $600,000 for 50,000 shares. Then he has 150,000 shares, and can sell 1,500 weekly covered calls.

Why isn't he selling covered calls yet?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This will forever be regarded as the greatest stock trade ever and yet it will still be under appreciated

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You know what I like about all this? Is that regardless he still will make profit. Even if these were to expire. He is still a millionaire. That is how confident this guy is.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I cant wait until he exercises his options contracts on or about 04/16. If the market drops leading up to that, we will have a front row seat to the most blatant market manipulation in years! The different is that the WSB Army is watching, tracking, and documenting it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$25m... now that’s real gains right there for anyone who is dumb enough to get happy over a couple thousand dollars. Big boy money 💪🏼.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to ask if DFV was going to sell them or exercise the options, but this is WSB, the only correct way the handle this is to let them expire"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,And I can barely pay my car insurance. Must be nice to have this much play money. IM a fucking failure
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Here comes theta

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That DFV is so hot right now
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if DFV has calls expiring on the 16th because they will do a share recall before June so they can vote on the new board members. Gamestop announced a share recall for the 20th of April in 2020 btw. Just a thought.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep thinking about what might happen if GME, 5 years later, starts doing a dividend again. Say, $2 per share. DFV would be in a position to make $300k a year on dividends alone. (once calls exercised)"

I really feel like 20 years from now financing students are going to be learning about y'all the way i learned about Enron in my intro to accounting class. That being said i have a normie noob question to ask because i know nothing about the stock market itself outside of stocks and shorting. Is this the total value of gamestocks stocks, or just the stocks you hold?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, does this make sense cause I'm just seeing the strategy to play when time rolls around.  Would it make sense to Sell 3160 shares to exercise the options he has on hand, cause he only needs $600,000 (3160 shares at market price) to exercise and would obtain another 50,000 shares.

Sorry, brain too smooth to know what to do."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. Many people screen out for ""curvy"" so you're probably better off with waking up later will always be.

I bought, played and finished Cyberpunk and I do like some /r/all_NSFW now that they had so much fun watching him YOLO his overtakes. He stood out when you watched a race. It's the right thing would be an interesting one. There’s even a video of exactly this happening, yet people are so bad they're forgettable, no real ultralul first round pics, no major collapses because they can't elevate enough to collapse in the first episode? I only watched the first episode? I only made it so far, but it's a term usually only used unironically by people upset about holding people responsible for their own good so they don't lose power in case anything happens to their main account."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why $12 deep ITM calls haven't been exercised yet??? Those call option writers would have to buy 50000 shares if 500 call contracts are exercised.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone think there's a number he would actually sell out at lmao? Would he actually let this shit ride through a real short squeeze to 2k? Goddamn I can't wait to find out.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There goes my heroooooo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that april 16 call doe
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Incredible!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can somebody explain this to me please? I've seen these posts a lot, but some bits of it confuse me still or I just don't know the backstory. I don't have much experience with options, so I'm missing out on all the *cool-factor* of these posts. More specifically...

1. Is the ""Qty"" the number of shares, or number of contracts (i.e. `# shares = 100 * # contracts`)? For the top line, multiplying the Last Price by the Qty gives you the correct Value. But for the bottom line, the same multiplication is off by a factor of 100. 
 
 That is:

  `189.82 * 100,000 = 18,982,000`

  `179.70 * 500 = 89,850 (which is not 8,940,000)`

  It looks like the top line is the number of shares, but the bottom line is the number of contracts (equalling 50,000 shares); it doesn't make sense why it would show mixed like that.

2. Why does it not display the expiration date for the top line? Does it expire on the 16th as well?

3. If they're both for GME, why is the ""Last Price"" not the same for both?

Thanks for the help."

The other side just needed to make an example out of someone and he's on our side so they crucified Bill, easy pickings and blamed it on his leverage which was high. There are alot of activist investors in his circle, he was one of them. If you short one of the group, $GSX, they will get you back, Melvin $GME. Those on melvins side made some calls to get their backers and now here we are, the giant financial mafia war."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Question is “what’s next”?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only 80k upvotes, has the hype finally died down?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does DFV continue to hold on to the April 16th $12 calls? Is the only reason just in case the stock drops to under $12 on or before April 16th? Then DFV would only be out the premium value and possibly be able to buy the same amount of shares for less money than he would pay through the calls?

Since we all are of the opinion that this stock is going well above $12, is this just a safety play to action them closer to the expiry date or is there something I am missing on understanding calls?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please sell bro

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi smooth brain, slightly less smooth brain here. He has $11M in his cash account - he’s very likely to use that money to exercise options on Apr 16. It’s all in the same photo he posted. That way he can still purchase shares without selling anything."

At expiration he can either exercise the contracts and buy 50 000 shares for 12$ or sell the actual contracts which are still worth a lot of money!"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even better. What he will 99.999% do is; exercise the calls, take possession of the shares, hold until moon so fuckin far it’ll no doubt be the biggest event on Wall Street in recent years."

The best part, either the calls were covered. In which case, whoever wrote the call has been watching GME go from like $5 to what it is now, unable to actually sell. Or they're not covered. So whoever wrote them will have to purchase them at the market value to fulfill their contract."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,People exercise calls?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because they aren't showing up in that list.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The strike price is $12 not $40
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There is also an issue regarding to short term or long term capital gain for DFV
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I know he has 11 million in cash I'm just wondering why he hasn't took any out to treat himself.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You are right. I was looking for the 50k shares and I forgot that he already had 50k shares before.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not exercise them now?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but does he like money more?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sharp answer
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Keith Gill bought 50 copies of Disney’s new movie “Soul” when it came out and donated them all to a children’s hospital because the blockbuster he normally does it to in Oregon said they had 20 copies left from his last donation.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, but if (squezeless) targe price is 400-600 it only is an increase of 100% or 200% current price, would be better if i already where 500% like the lucky chimps who got on ship on $40, sadly, FUD got me when the price where on that range"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but also HF’s are known to be very stubborn and money-hungry as all hell. They also have this urge to destroy n’ ruin.

I guess I'm extra retarded cause I read this as $100 on the option to buy 500 for $20 later?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He found it. That took work
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He paid $10k for 500 contracts? Didn't he pay $0.20/contract?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Your only risk is your intial investment. Costs no money to holdp
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For their sake, i hope it was covered calls..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you truly sold 100% covered calls then you wouldn’t be upside down $250K. You would just be missing out on the profit. You wouldn’t have to do anything. 

If you wanted to hedge in case of a squeeze after selling coveted calls, then you could have bought a few “insane” 100.00C in case the price absolutely skyrocketed, or near the insane jump, buy a “normal” put around 100.00. Expecting the price to realistically hold $400+ for days on end is not realistic.

Imagine having enough money to buy 1000 shares but dumb enough to fuck up a situation in which you sold covered calls. 

What calls did you sell for “the easiest 12K” you ever made?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying shares is the only risk free play now

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we’re implying the same thing. Thinking it will be that much higher at expiration is a ballsy move. I’m not questioning it at all. He’s been so on point all along so I’m just curious what why so much conviction for 4/16
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I would ask Ken Griffin if he would like to play himself for starters."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I meant the fool who bought them lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What about theta? Shouldnt that have eaten up most of the calls already?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a regular joe made this move, would they need 600K cash on hand to exercise, or could you find a way to go ""look, I am literally about to make 9.5 million from this, I'm good for it"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks a ton for the explanation! I think I get it. So basically it's saying ""I bet the price will be X on this day. And if it goes over that, I still pay X""


So I guess my follow-up question is what stops someone from getting call options for $1 in a share when it's , say, $10. Even if it drops to 8, it's still over 1"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you wana bet.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK, and?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The call options for $1 would cost a massive premium. Premium is the price for the right to the contract, you don't get it back and it goes to the person who is selling the contract. In order to break even the price would have to be way over the strike. Contract minus the Premium is your profit. Buying an option past the Strike already is abbreviated ITM In The Money, an option not over the strike is OTM Out of The Money. A Strike that is exact is called ATM At The Money. Depending where the stock price is, that changes the price of the premium. The premium price is calculated using the Greeks but that is a conversation you'll have to look up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If he buys more calls you have to eat an entire Arby's meat mountain.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you get your numbers from? It looks like the last trade price for those options was 179.70. The last GME price was 189.82. So exercising would be (189.82 - 12) = 179.82 x 500 x 100 = 8991000. Vs selling which would be 179.70 x 500 x 100 = 8985000. So only $6000 less. And that’s because the market is expecting it to drop. Still 16 days to go.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, value in theta, which is evaporating."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It costs him 600k to buy 50,000 shares.  He’s 100% exercising them lol."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean yeah but he has been a solid contribution to the board too ie these folks probably wouldn’t be working there now had dfv never been born

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Holy shit so even at $200 thats another $10m.

The best part is he won't be exercising at $200.

(Maybe you know this but in case you or some others don't) When a call is ITM (in the money) you exercise at the strike price. That's what buying an option gives you. A cheap way to secure a future price with the expectation it'll go above that in the future. 

He'll be paying $12 per share, and $12 by 50,000 is $600,000 for $10m worth of stock. He'll still have tons of cash when he exercises."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the best thing I have watched on Reddit. He can now likely afford Julia Louis-Dreyfus to make a sitcom for himself about this whole process. (Hopefully in a few months he will have enough to get get Jerry Seinfeld as well)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you - thank you!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo good catch. I actually minus the 12 exercise cost from the option price of 179.70. Your math checks out. It’s still a $6000 favor so I’d still exercise if I was DFV when the time is right. 

Also wouldn’t holding the stocks over an option through a squeeze will give you more leverage to get a favorable sell price? I would imagine it would be hard to sell an option during the squeeze depends how quick the price rises"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck... Somebody just deleted a long post in front of my eyes. It just fucking disappeared 🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Proves how very little ‘intelligent geniuses’ there were in this Sub in its so called whiny ‘the good old days’ before everyone spoiled it for us. All the smart arses didn’t believe him back then and have re-visited to delete their mockery.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just read all the comments. Fuck man the scrutiny he had to go through when millions were patiently waiting for him around the corner. And potentially billions in the long haul with GME.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe none of you realize that you are completely buying in almost cult-like into survivorship bias/success bias.


Dfv isn't some masterful genius. He's just not, aaandd the stock never would've taken off like it did without strange,  extenuating circumstances, and reddit hype.  For every Dfv there's 100 others who have done exactly the same thing and failed horribly.


Frankly this is the same disgusting attitude that causes people to practically worship billionaires. Survivorship bias worship is like a glitch in the human brain.



 The vast overwhelming majority  billionaires are not special in any way, they were born with a lot of money and it's incredibly easy to make a lot of money when you already have a lot of money, and you have no more morals.


DFV started with more money than most people will ever see. It's not incredibly hard to make money when you have the kind of money he started with. Furthermore, he was the exception to the rule. It's super weird to virtually worship someone who halfway made a smart play and halfway got extremely lucky with timing,  reddit hype, etc.






 As far as I can tell GameStop still has no actual truly viable plan to compete with all of the behemoths out there, and is absurdly overvalued. It's still just a physical game store guys.."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So the contract writer is obligated to buy the contracts that have amassed millions? Hahaha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if he doesn't do anything way pass dte, are they going to expire worthless or money automatically goes into his account if prices stay the same now?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless you
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why? Remember when JPow just set the printers on max and fucked the 10 year bond into worthlessness?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow thanks for the update! I was wondering this same thing looking thru that old thread. Congrats!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done still sir. You saw the conviction and made a decision and got paid.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly this is how you know time machines will never be invented.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless they already own the shares
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the date of expiration near close, most brokers (I think) will excercise your options that are in the money and sell the underlying shares so that you get the profits.

So if DFV did nothing, he would book the profits of the sale and he wouldn't get the shares. You can't continue to hold past DTE."

Edit: ITM by $10 during premarket. Obviously way too early but so far so good for OP. Even if it opens at this level ($680) with TSLA + opening IV that's should be a solid 50-70% overnight gain."

An indices volume is the sum of all the volume that all the companies that make up the index had in the given time period. So when it says that the DJI had 418 million volume that just means that all the companies had 418 million volume between them.

On the other side, moderate democrats wont want to be on the hook for the tax hikes that will fund the bill, especially with mid-terms coming up. Not saying this is right or wrong, just reality.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The first time you saw her was the first time you knew you weren't alone. I mean *knew* it. The problem with children--and even many adults--is that they float through life like protagonists in some fiction. Other things, even other people, are just props in *their* story. The selfishness isn't malicious; it's naivete. The myopia has to be broken by another, like it was for you by her, as she wore that jean skirt and laughed at your friend so loudly she snorted.

Beyond teaching you that you weren't the only character in the world's story, she taught you that your character could be better written. She adored you, but sometimes she was also hurt by you, and that in turn made you hurt like nothing ever had. It made you weep and scream and get stronger and better. She helped you squeeze your stone into diamond. Not for yourself, but so you could be something more worthy of her presence.

Most people don't realize that indices spend the majority of their time at All Time Highs or damn close. Relationships, good ones, are like that. Searching for new, forbidden parts of the sky--coasting until a break in the clouds is found. Bad days and months come, but once you've survived enough dips, even big ones--corrections--you start to laugh about them. You both know you'll dig your way out of the hole. Like you did every time before. And afterwards, your diamond will somehow be a bit harder and more beautiful."

Joined WSB late last June so I’m by no means a seasoned vet or anything (had to say that cause of the retards who have been lurking a week longer than me will get a full torque superiority complex stiffy if I don’t self depreciate a little) but before GME I’d probably only seen “short squeeze” mentioned a couple times, and I sure as fuck had no idea what it meant cause I would have to read some Motley Fool article or some shit to figure it out. And even if I tried, as soon as a see a decimal point and a “%” pretty close to each other on my screen, I’m out. 

But these days apparently 3 out of every 5 stocks are going to moon because of a short squeeze. Oh this stock that you probably just bought into also has a 783% short interest? Cool, all 6 million of us should collectively buy it immediately! No anterior motives there"

I’m so fucking sick of this shit. Either the dumbest person in the world or just blatantly lying. If you’re making money on GME, that’s awesome—I know I have been—but spreading just complete bullshit is not a good look for this sub. GME’s stock is not worth $500, it’s not even worth $200, and anyone who tells you otherwise or makes you feel like you’re making a value play is either lying or stupid"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Houston we maybe have a problem.**

Can someone explain the escalating repo ops I dumped into Excel and formatted for our smooth brains to understand? Basically nothing all quarter then HUGE surges the last 3 days totaling almost **300 Billion** with a B. The amount today was higher than any single amount during the REPO surge the second half of 2019. Reverse Repos are used by banks to lend to businesses to stabilize them, buy assets, basically allowing for a short term cash injection.

WTF is going on???

See **screenshot** here: https://imgur.com/gallery/2bZRKBs

Edit: the last time we saw a 140B repo was April 6 of 2020. 😐

Edit 2: By request ELI5 addition: The government will loan banks money on very short terms which the banks then loan to struggling businesses. Repo picked up in late 2019 as a signal that some large companies were struggling, and then really took off in late March and early April last year (because covid). What interesting is yesterday and today’s repo amounts were the largest since April 6 and higher than all but 5 amounts the first week of April 2020. What does this mean? Some massive loans are being made to businesses who are at risk of failing and no one is talking about it."

Theories held up, for the most part, with smaller countries and trends for decades. But now the main global economic superpower with the global reserve currency is challenging all of it at a fast pace. If the infrastructure plan passes this year, about ten trillion will have somehow just appeared in about 20 months just in the US. That's a shitload of money printed(duh). The very concept of Keynesian(?) economics is getting the mega stress test right now.

Tl;dr: if old economic theory holds up we're fucked, if not, well who knows. We're living in an experiment."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not investing in gme but their is an argument to be made e commerce could be shifting much the way regular retail and consumer goods is. Look at chewy . Amazon is like the Walmart Of e-commerce sure it has a lot but navigating it to find a quality item is a nightmare especially for pet goods. Gme could be the same thing. It’s foolish for Walmart to think they can compete with Amazon in e commerce. But if there were individual boutique e-commerce stores that provide the same service that could be viable. Say there was An amazon for pets one for video games one for toys.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"squeeze is impossible - short interest is crazy low and there are a lot of outstanding shares. not the same as GME at all. The only reason GME squooze the the point it did was because GME was a company that was being shorted even though it had decent fundamentals. AMC does not have good fundamentals. look at their balance sheet, even if they open up completely and don't have restrictions they don't even have enough revenue to pay off all of their debts *interest*, let alone the principal. this is why they want to offer more shares so they can pay off their debt.

people will say ""yeah but theaters are opening!!!"" that doesn't matter. do you research and look at how much debt they have from their Q4 report. a squeeze will never happen.

you can hold if you want, but I'll be surprised if it ever goes to $20 again for at least a few years."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dunno.  But I think it will hit low $20s in the short term.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah if you own a stock you technically own the companies assets and free cash flow . It’s one of the reasons tech is so valuable because you own part of the ip
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You do know the share price goes down by the amount of the dividend right it's not free money
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Covered calls are pretty baller and even writing way OTM weeklies for like .10 it adds up really quick.  If you actively flip CCs by closing one out and opening another at a lower strike on intraday dips it winds up being pretty good money relative to the risk of losing upside.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Also, that’s not really what goes on here. That’s for the stocks sub. This place is more about bad ideas, doubling down on them then posting loss porn."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possibly up to 130 before earnings and then immediate reversal back to 120, just like every AAPL earnings. Over the next year it’ll seesaw up to 142 target estimate consensus."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Asking WSB at 4:30 in the morning is the wrong first step
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This ain't the place to get solid advice tbh. Learn the fundamentals elsewhere, like r/investing, then come back here and use those fundamentals to lose everything on a shitty bet"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is honestly the place to get trolled. My advice is never invest more than you can afford to lose.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might wanna go to /r/investing if you want to learn how to invest for the long-term. Investopedia is a valuable resource for the basics too.

This place is more about high stakes gambling and stock market shenanigans. It's ok if you want to stay here and screw around with the rest of us, but just keep in mind that this place is a bit... wild."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If I could have been told one thing it would be to buy companies you believe in.   So that way if they go down you feel inclined to buy more shares..   so don’t invest all at the same time.    Buy with 20 percent  first then wait then buy with more and more and more and keep nibbling at the stock as you build out your position. Basically have conviction in your plays! Or else you will sell when the stock price drops.  Also have an exit strategy. Where do you think the stock will top out at?   No one goes broke locking in profits.  Good luck on your journey to the moon young ape! 🚀

I personally suspect if this commodity supercycle is going to happen the top of it might not be for another year or two, hence the Jan 2023 calls."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The US are really good at making some of their citizens money slaves lmao. This situation just shows the fucking nonsense of that wash sale rule. Like who cares? Let people wash their positions
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,From what I understand of the wash sale rule it only penalizes you if you try to play some loss harvest games into the next tax year. It should balance out to have no net effect on taxes otherwise
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have to keep trading and carry the loss into the next tax year. So if you close out all positions 30 days before the end of the year, I think this means your good. Keep trading past that date and all losses roll over to next tax year. 

This I think is a scare tactic to get people back in line."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here ya go, [T+2 is the amount of time that it takes for a security to be settled](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/T%2B2)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i think they were just click baiting personally.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"But that doesn't make any sense.    
    
You buy 100 shares of stock A for $15 per share costing you $1500. It goes from $15 to $10. You sell them for $1000. You've recorded a loss of $500.

You second guess yourself and the next day you buy it back at the same price of $10 per share for $1000 total. You were right to get back in and the stock goes back up to $15 per share. You're happy to have your money back and sell it for $1500 to break even.    
    
You lost $500.  
Then you gained $500.  
You net ZERO dollars profit. However, due to the ""wash rule"" you can't use that $500 in losses, so now you're taxed on ""$500 of profit"" even though you didn't make a fucking penny.   
     
How is that okay?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Other way around. It prevents people from selling at a loss. Then rebuying back in for profit. 

For example. If you bought GME at $150. Sold at a loss at $120. Then immediately bought back in at $120. And sold at $200. The $30 loss is considered a wash sale.  Normally that’s tax deductible but instead it just calculates the gain differently. You have to wait 30 days before buying back in to get the tax deduction."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"wait what? don't claim the lost? so don't sell? 

or you mean if you sell dont buy back in for 30 biz days?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't how wash sales work at all.  The $500 loss is added to the cost basis of the new position.  All that happens for the current tax year is you can't claim the $500 loss on your capital gains worksheets.  If you sell the stock at $15 after repurchasing it at $10, you are taxed on ($1500 sales proceeds) - ($1000 purchase price) - ($500 cost basis adjustment due to wash sale) = $0."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The loss is still there but you can't claim it until after you sell your newly purchased stock and wait 30 days before buying in again.

The way large investors did things before the wash rule allowed them to take profits tax free."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's scary
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You still only book a $50 profit though right? Not sure how gains can dwarf loses unless losses came after tax year end then you’re fucked
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course they instate this during the gamestink volatility period. 

Wall st really coming at retail investors"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea that sounds restrictive and stupid as fuck.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you can sell you just have to claim the loss after thirty days. I have a limited understanding of this though, so don’t listen to me lol"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe put a few beers in his refrigerator as well. Just make sure you shake them up first🤔🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale = no taxable deductions for same stock, bought/sold in 31 days, otherwise Uncle Sam has got you by the Balls🤬"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I'm fairly sure you are correct about the $50 profit.  The $30 loss is not tax deductible, but rather applied to the cost of buying back in.  In my example, when the person bought back in, they incurred +$30 cost to the purchase price of $120 making the actual purchase price $150 when it comes to taxes.  I'm pretty sure.  Its something I avoid doing so I'm not certain.

Its a weird story and uncommon, I think.  It shouldn't happen.  The guy was day trading 2 million dollars on a single stock 10 times a day and probably scalping 1% gains and consistently lost wash sale after wash sale all year long into a new tax year.  Its a bad idea to begin with... and evidenced by the fact he did it all year long and walked away with $45k profit.

Morale of the story: diamond hands or sell and move on."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Past experience, Uncle Sam sent his cousin Joey to come Help Me explain my profit/loss couple years back.

I bought into DISCA, and a few options for DISCA and DISCB (just because).  But I think I am going to toss my hat into the VIACA ring.  And for those smart enough, you might want to, too.  After you do your own DD of course.

# TLDR; $ROOT has a rare Short Squeeze opportunity with a Short interest of 47.36%! In addition to it being undervalued.

# So What's Root?

**In ape language:** It's a car Insurance technology which relies on machine learning to provide personalized insurance rates. Their business model has fairness and modern customer experience as core values (Check their app/website).

(Boring details) **Details about ROOT:** Traditional Credit-Based Car Insurance Perpetuates Economic and Racial Inequalities as one in three American cannot afford essentials because of car insurance premiums. $ROOT is the only insurance carrier where 100% of customers have the app installed, which $Root uses to collect better data that gives it **a “four-year head start”** in being able to better price insurance on actual driving behavior.

With over 10 billion miles of driving data and hundreds of thousands of actual claims, $ROOT has the best data analytics in the industry, As the company noted in it's S-1. The objective is simple, 50% of the claims in dollar terms come from 10-15% of the worst drivers.

# Big boys invested in ROOT

Five months ago, Silver Lake and early Snowflake investor Dragoneer each invested $250 million in $ROOT over 100% higher at the IPO price of $27.  Hill house also added to their previous investment at $27.

Two years ago, $ROOT raised $350 million in its Series E Funding from top tech investors including Coatue, DST Global, Red point Ventures,and Tiger Global at a valuation of $3.65 billion **or over 20% higher than ROOT’s market cap today**. Ribbit Capital, which is founded by MELI board member Meyer Malka, participated in ROOT’s Series E Funding and then proceed to buy 1 million shares at the IPO price of $27 and an additional 754K shares in the open market at $16.55.

(important) **Rarely, do investors get the opportunity to invest in a disruptive technology company at a significant discount to the prices paid by the worlds leading tech investors  who had the ability to do a deep dive into the technology and cohort data.**

# Why did it get FUCKED by WallStreet in the last 3 months?

Last year was a bad year for an auto insurance company to go public with so much uncertainty around the future of the business due to COVID. Even the bears will admit, $ROOT has great management that knows insurance and technology. However, $ROOT has done a poor job of telling their story to WallStreet(Fuck WallStreet, I'm hopeful that Retail will believe in it as much as we do in $AMC).

The good news is that this can easily be changed while $ROOT has built the hardest part(The technology). $**ROOT has experienced its share of short reports and fraud claims and broken business models arguments...**

The original bear argument was centered around $ROOT’s high loss ratios vs.competitors.  However, **ROOT disproved the bear case with additional disclosure in the company’s Q4 2020 shareholder letter showing that it is important to consider** that ROOT has a younger customer base and to analyze loss ratios by cohort rather than on an aggregate level given that ROOT’s loss ratios improve significantly as the customer base ages.

# Root 2021 Growth

Growth is Re-Accelerating Based on 3rd PartyData. After intentionally pulling back on growth last year due to uncertainty around COVID, management is focused on accelerating growth this year. **As noted by ROOT CFO Daniel Rosenthal on the Q4 2020 earnings call:**

“We were able to show strong growth despite the decision to pull back on marketing spend towards the end of the first quarter resulting from the global pandemic and surrounding macroeconomic and regulatory uncertainty.”

“We plan to more than double our sales and marketing investments in 2021following a COVID-driven pullback in 2020. This investment in marketing fuels an accelerating growth trajectory throughout the year.”

This step up in sales and marketing investment appears to be paying off as there is an acceleration in ROOT daily and weekly app downloads this month based on a leading 3rdparty app data(App Annie).

**Daily Downloads – ROOT (Green) vs. LMND (Blue)**

&#x200B;

[Daily Downloads – ROOT \(Green\) vs. LMND \(Blue\)](https://preview.redd.it/ruourewtreq61.png?width=846&format=png&auto=webp&s=673dd2afdb04c6097a4659c4690f30e51572c496)

# Now for the Most important Part!

**$ROOT has a short interest of 47.36% Float as of 03/31/2021(Fintel). To put that into perspective, If there's a short interest of %10 that's considered high. If there's a short interest of %20 or greater that's considered extremely high. When $GME hit %140 short interest that was a rare event. Now $ROOT has 47.36% Short interest Float!!!!!**

In comparison, as of 03/31/2021, $GME has a short interest of 18.81%, $AMC 17.31%!!! %ROOT is sitting on 47.36%(FINTEL)

# Price Target

Without factoring the massive short squeeze potential, at $LMND multiple **$ROOT would trade at $65** and if ROOT is successful in capturing 2% of the $266 billion US auto insurance market then just the insurance side is worth **10x(120$).**

BUT... instead of doing Voodoo math, **there is no reason this stock is worth less than its IPO price of $27.**  This is at the cross hairs of disruptive technology that is too strong to ignore.

""This is a disruptive tech company and investors have an opportunity to buy the stock at bargain prices vs. what the smartest tech investors in the world paid just five months ago."" C\*Tron

**If a full short squeeze happens, In my opinion, this can reach 50$+ short term.**

On its current trajectory $550-750 a share is a reasonable (my worthless opinion) price point, with or without the squeeze. Not only is buying GME a play on the squeeze, but also a deep fucking value bet.

Fair warning, you'll develop a wrinkle of two if you proceed... but don’t worry my fellow ape brethren I’ve included charts, with colors, to make visualization easy. Let’s walk through these figures one by one and tell the story of Gamestop’s transition.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

# Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Let’s start with the ugly before we get to the good stuff: **Operating Loss**. An operating loss occurs when a company's operating expenses exceed gross profits. Gamestop has had a fairly significant operating loss for many years now (peaking in 2018), as it faced the challenges all brick and mortar stores faced: theft of sales to the e-commerce giants -- the convenience of online downloads and pre-ordering on the internet. In the last two years, this loss has come down significantly. And what impresses me most about Gamestop is their cash on hand (currently $635M). Very few stores with operating losses have that level of cash. Most are in debt, and require the sale of shares to float by during rough times.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/dyyd0zf7req61.png?width=1544&format=png&auto=webp&s=e3e553bc397243f7b97702eb68d52d1a462c1431

And this is the key misstep the HF’s made in shorting Gamestop. There has been a stigma out there about brick and mortar stores going under (Toys R Us, and Sears as example)...  feeding frenzy, blood in the water you get the point. Sharks (HFs) have been getting more and more bold (reckless) in their targeting. Gamestop was the wrong target, for a very specific reason. It leases its stores. By comparison, consider Walmart needing to reduce stores, or Target. They’ve built massive buildings with parking lots to house their very specific store needs (huge upfront costs, sunk), and they rent (or own) these buildings under much different contracts. They can’t easily get up and leave one of their stores. Ask yourself, how would Walmart leave a store? Who would buy it? How could the investor renting to them turn it into something else? Maybe a city might want it to build an expo center. On the cheap. WalMarts costs are priced into this (it’s expensive). They can’t move as easily. Point being, Gamestop doesn’t owe anything to shut down a store, it simply stops paying its lease and moves all it’s stuff out. They rent strip mall locations and mall storefronts. This allows them to liquidate stores and downsize with little to no sunk costs. They can also reposition themselves much more efficiently. This is why we see this fast turn-around in Operating Loss last year (a major component of Operating Loss is storefront costs for Brick and Mortar). News of Gamestop closing stores isn’t bad news. Remember that. The media will try to sell it as such.

Because of the focus, Gamestop is eyeing Digital Sales, for its future.

# Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

It is clear to everyone, at this point, that Gamestop is looking to move a large portion of its business into the online space. In 2020 Gamestop did $580Million in sales online, and in Q4 alone their online sales represented over 34% of all Gamestop sales; Gamestop did more in online sales in the 4th quarter of 2020 than it did in all of 2019.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/80l9ei8breq61.png?width=1539&format=png&auto=webp&s=e16f718577f208643498038b3885b21f0e330092

So what caused this? Ryan fucking Cohen. And he’s just getting started. When we see the sales in 2021 first quarter compared to 2020 the trajectory of this massive shift will become even more apparent. We have only to look at Chewy’s online sales figures under Cohen to project what’s to come for Gamestop in the next few years.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/rg3g528dreq61.png?width=1565&format=png&auto=webp&s=c83e58af632d1e9cc06f4e1da6c7df5f9c371f5e

That’s right, Chewy grew from $205M in online sales to $3,500M (17x) in 3 years under Cohen.

Gamestop Announced in it’s Q4 earnings report last week what it’s intentions are... *“Our emphasis in 2021 will be on improving our E-Commerce and customer experience, increasing our speed of delivery, providing superior customer service and expanding our catalogue.”*

Which brings us to our next chapter on the entire Electronics & Media space in ecommerce -- let's make sense of what potential exists for growth in this sector...

&#x200B;

# Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales

If you ever wondered where Amazon makes all it’s money. Look no further than the category of Electronics & Media (Gaming, computers, electronics, digital media). In 2020 the company did 120.9 Billion in sales, and 54.6% of that fell into this category. There are plenty of other players in this space, but only Apple is close to Amazon’s market share. Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/im8t7lwfreq61.png?width=1529&format=png&auto=webp&s=52e086ce497c34d9e352cfed9fce99f50d2ce723

Amazon itself projects this space to grow 34.2% in the next two years. Meaning roughly $40B in new Electronics and Media sales will emerge in the online space for these companies to grow into over the next two years. Might be a good time to mention that Gamestop listed GPUs for sale on it’s website earlier this week, and they sold out instantly. With Gamestop doing $580M in online sales in 2020, and most of that coming in Q4 it is safe to say Gamestop is positioned to grab onto this space in a way that will shake Amazon’s growth models for the next two years. Have you noticed how Ryan Cohen is leaning on his Amazon (and Chewy) relationships to pull talent to go after this space. If chewy is any indication, I wouldn’t bet against him eventually grabbing a large percentage, even the majority, of it.

So let’s get to the fun part… valuation

&#x200B;

# Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

Valuations are a funny thing. Companies are only worth what people think someone else will pay for it in the future. Often we start with fundamentals, but in the end, hype and excitement over growth and continued growth leads to higher and higher valuations. I’ll start with a simple comparison just to prove a point.

Gamestop ($12B Market Cap) and Roblox ($36B Market Cap)… we’re all gamers here, right? We know what Roblox is, right? Two completely different companies, but let’s look at the figures anyway and then I’ll get back to comparing GME to the online retail giants. Roblox did $920Million in revenue in 2020 (up from $435Million in 2019), and it’s valuation rose from $4B to $36B. Hmmm… why? Well, it went public. IPO is a great way to hype a stock. Get people excited, maximize valuation, so those angel investors can finally get paid off. So how does this compare to Gamestop (minus the hype of an IPO). Well Gamestop did $6,466Million in revenue in 2020. Yep, seven times what Roblox did? So why the major difference in Market Cap? Well for one, Roblox has very few employees and no stores to spend money on (is this tickling that little feeling you have about Gamestop’s move to becoming primarily an online ecommerce giant, it should be). If Gamestop were valued the same as Roblox, right now… it would move it’s price to approximately $5,157 a share. That’s not a squeeze number. That’s simply an IPO hyped valuation number on growth. Gamestop is moving that direction, minus the IPO, but they are aiming to grow (like Chewy did).

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ipbngvoireq61.png?width=1519&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a35214d7048744cd86debfee8cedda28b748b0f

So let’s get a better comparison to the other giants. Apple, Amazon Chewy, Target, Walmart and Best Buy. I’ve chosen these because they represent a wide range of Brick and Mortar vs ecommerce. Price to Sales Ratio is calculated by dividing the company's market capitalization by the revenue, this gives a general sense of how much the market is going to value a company relative to its revenue. Value players (like Buffet) are often looking for the lowest P/S ratio to enter for a fundamentally solid company, and companies with a lot of growth potential and hype can grow their P/S ratio (similar to P/E ratio) to levels that are very high. One thing you’ll notice in this chart. The more online a company is, the higher it’s P/S ratio can go. This directly impacts the Valuation of the company. While companies that may be online, but still rely most heavily on their stores, have a lower P/S because they have a lot of overhead costs. You’ll notice Gamestop in the middle, because it’s transitioning to ecommerce. Last year you would have seen Gamestop with a P/S similar to Best Buy and Walmart. The reason this is important is because as Gamestop grows it’s online business, it’s P/S is likely to rise, and moving to the Amazon level would represent a share price of roughly double what we currently see for Gamestop, while not changing anything about it fundamentals.

&#x200B;

# Final Chapter: Conclusions

Ok you’ve been patient, and I told you I’d eventually get to what Gamestop is worth currently, and next year (projection). What the market hasn’t caught onto yet, that we all see in Gamestop is it’s deep fucking value. So what is Gamestop worth, right now?

Well **$191**, that’s what it’s trading at. It’s only worth more, when people see these numbers and get excited about them. The numbers show that Gamestop is growing exponentially with its online sales and Ryan has brought on a team to accelerate that growth. I don’t know what Q1 numbers are, but I can guess a lot of Apes, are really excited about Gamestop, and becoming more and more loyal to its brand. I know I wouldn’t buy anything from Amazon, that I could get from Gamestop right now, even if it costs slightly more. It’s because of quality, and support for the brand.

Lots of things are increasing Gamestop’s valuation, but growth of it’s online sales will be the most significant one. What most analysts are ignoring (or simply missing, if I’m giving them some credit) is just how massive Gamestop’s online sales growth were last year, despite the pandemic. If we project Q4 numbers onto 2021, and ignored the dream team Cohen has brought on board, one can expect 3-4 times as much in online sales next year. That will tip P/S higher and people will stop seeing Gamestop as a failing brick and mortar and recognize it for what it is… an Amazon killer, going after an $88B market in Electronics & Media by 2023. On top of that, growing an esports brand (I suspect) that will engulf a $200B annual industry that is likely to only grow to $300B by 2023.

Project these figures onto Gamestop as you’d like. I’ll take a stab at it. Right now Gamestop should be valued at $662 a share, based on it’s Q4 figures and projection into 2021 from it’s finish in 2020 Q4. By this time in 2023, we will see Gamestop at a $50B valuation from $12.5B in sales, and a P/S in the 4.0 ballpark - that puts it’s per share price at $795 - conservatively without hyper on the growth (that you know will amplify that by another factor of 2-3). How do we justify a growth from 580M to $12.5B in two years… Ryan fucking Cohen is how. Multiple current sales by 17. Go back and look at that Chewy graph if you’re wondering how that’s possible. There is a gaping hole in the Electronics ecommerce side of the market, growing. Amazon and Gamestop can both grow incredibly without stealing from one another…

I have another DD in the works on The Squeeze (no dates, no times) and a look at how high we might go (spoiler, there is no accurate answer, but there is a lot to look at, and be excited about to try to make educated guesses).

Here is a teaser… When Volkswagen Squoze, it temporarily became the most valuable company in the world. Gamestop doing the same, would put it’s price north of $31,800 on it’s way to the moon (not that we heard a bell yet as we flew by that mark).

If you needed one more reason to HODL, it’s this… you will be at least 4 times richer a few years from now, even if you went into a Comma and your wife’s boyfriend lost your password couldn’t get to that sell button on the way down from the squeeze, because at $191 a share, GME is still a deep fucking value play squeeze aside.

And if you’ve ever wondered how Phineas and Ferb pay for their projects… I think I figured it out

Behind these names we are all humans and we all have our own stories. If you need one more reason to HODL -- I have (had) a terminally ill child (no I do not want anything from any of you) that has a life expectancy of 25ish (she's 9). She survived what was estimated as a 1 in 1000 chance of making it (nine operations and three open heart surgeries as an infant-toddler), which is why she qualified and received a wish from Make-A-Wish (the best damn organization I could have ever hoped for). I have to also give the largest kuddos to this community. On the r/ PoGo board, when I posted about my daughters acceptance by Make-A-Wish to follow her dream of living our Pokemon Go in real life, this community was a critical part of making all that magic come to life. From volunteers who attended the event (400+ costumed members) to connections that got in touch with the animation team in Japan (they drew her a special sketch and all signed the back). Niantic also put UNOWNs of her name into her account after one beautiful soul reached out to someone high up in the org to tell them my daughters story. Why do I bring this up? I want to give my daughter the ability to live out her retirement when she's 18. Travel the world. Experience as much as she can. **If you need one more reason to HODL GME... I'm not selling until I can give her that.**

Don’t lose who you are in the wealth that may (or maybe not) suddenly fall into your lap based on your investing performances. I see mostly fucking amazing souls in this crowd of Apes. Let’s make the world a better place.

I don’t know how the stock market works.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree with most of it but I work in mall management and that isn’t how leases work. A perm tenant like GameStop will sign a 10 year lease. They pay a base fee on the square footage and a % of their sales as rent. If they stop paying they owe what’s called a lease cancellation which is the remainder of the years they owe at that base rate. So it’s not as easy as not paying rent and moving on unless somehow every GameStop that closed was at the end of their lease. Again I love GME and have 20 shares at 127.13 but that’s just not how the leases work.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Daily dose of confirmation bias ✅
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I came for the confirmation bias, but I stayed for the fatherly vibes. Godspeed, fellow autist."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of this is wrong and every point is based on not understanding anything. So it's prefect for the new wsb.

Chewy was always a 100% online business. Cohen is the co-founder. Nothing changed when he came on board because he's been there from the start. 66% of their sales are from recurring subs for pet food because pets always need food and destroy toys. Do you eat your games or consoles? You need to buy more physical copies of both each month?

The online increase from Gamestop sales have nothing to do with him. It was caused by covid and people not being able to goto stores plus the release of the new console generation. Sony has literally released a console version that will cut GME out of any game sales as their whole infrastructure has been based on ripping people off and reselling their games for a 1000% profit.

So where does GME fit in the online space? Physical sales of a consumable that isn't available digitally. Even Amazon shuttered their attempt at game studios to release their own games after they realized they didn't know how to actually make one.

GME's online space is limited and a challenging one. There are many big and established competitors who have taken over that market and some who failed at it while over-expanding with physical stores (NCIX).

HFs and whales are the reason this is actually going up and down. It's an easy few million bucks for them and you're just along for the ride.

None of this makes any sense whatsoever and trying to do a DD is stupid. The original DD by DFV made sense because that was back when it was supremely undervalued. Now you're trying to pretend like GME is worth multiple times more than Walmart, Best Buy  and Amazon while being a niche provider because someone who has zero experience in physical sales has hired some folks who also now have to somehow manage thousands of B&M locations. 

They can definitely shift into the space, but pretending like they're going to somehow be a leader anytime in the next couple years is bonkers."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Love you guys
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much lower will sales be when the peak with the new game consoles has passed. Very difficult to estimate. Regarding game sales. It's tough to compete with Steam so I don't expect a rapid growth there to continue for too long.

GME is a good opportunity but I find it difficult to see a huge upside after 200$ unless there's a squeeze. Reddit is an echo chamber so I doubt the general public cares for gamestop that much. They buy from whomever has stock and good price."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll be honest, I skipped most of the post because your major points are such nonsense.

> Chapter 1: Gamestop’s Advantage in its Transition to Online.

Yes, 2020 wasn't as shitty and there's a great reason for it. It's called console releases which are the largest revenue quarter for GameStop. 

> Chapter 2: Digital Sales Growth

LMAO. Yes, Ryan Cohen magically caused people to buy online. Maybe you don't leave the house, but COVID kept many more people indoors in 2020.

> Chapter 3: Electronics & Media Sales
> Here is a chart to visualize the largest players (Gamestop is #10 currently with their 2020 sales, the tiny orange slice):

That's definitely inaccurate. The numbers shown represent 99.5%, that orange chunk is the last .5% which is not GameStop alone.

> Chapter 4: What is Gamestop Worth?

$5k? lol there's a reason you're working a shitty job desperately hoping for this reality. It's because you're an idiot and this post really proves it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why on earth is this tagged technical analysis?

I got into this whole GME thing thinking I could make a quick buck, and now it's starting to look like I need to hodl onto my shares a lot longer than I planned...like that freaky ring from the Hobbit, guess I'll just have to wait until we reach the fires of Mordor to finally pull the trigger and save humanity with my millions."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have so much “research”, and yet your evaluation is freaking insane lmao. $550+ even without the squeeze? For executive hires (that wouldn’t have been possible without the squeeze, but irrelevant) and.. what exactly? For an average online presence at best they should have already been dominating in games and pushing toward general electronics? Should they really be this far behind in finally supplying computer parts (which is still so minimal)?? How about advertising? Ever see any special deals or new additions to their online presence?? And what can they now, all of the sudden, do differently and better than NewEgg, Amazon, BestBuy, TigerDirect, MicroCenter, on and on and on.. who are all WELL established online? What about Fry’s?? How were they not able to make the retail to online jump given their big name and presence and bulk? What can GME do differently seriously?

I’m not saying they can’t figure it out and they obviously have the right people. But simply showing me a couple years of stagnation and a big outlier year (more on that later) for GME, then showing me what Chewy’s is doing, doesn’t convince me that a online pet store with no retail presence is going to be able to fix a retail gaming and electronics(ish?) store with little to average online presence. Numbers are pretty, and growth is nice, but translating one company’s success to another one that is dying isn’t exactly as easy as hiring big names. Again, I don’t know what they could do and by all means they could knock it out of the park, but we shouldn’t base an outlandish speculation on a couple new hires with good track records. It’s ridiculous. 

And going back to your GME graph. I can’t believe you honestly thought that was solid convincing data to show growth and positive trends. 
I mean yeah this would be more convincing (although broken down by quarters is more informative but this is obviously quick no biggie) if this was 2015 through 2019. This would be incredible and really great to see!

However it isn’t. It is through 2020. And we all know that 2020 was a next-gen console year, and this is the absolute cream of the crop/ superbowl year for GME and other gaming / electronics stores. 

Using 2020 in this kind of future evaluation is just a blunt lie and should be 100% thrown out because it is not at ALL representative of GME online sales (again need Q sales to really understand how 2020 broke down). I mean yeah no shit their 2020 Q4 did better than all of their 2019 sales, and 34% isn’t really that exciting for a company transitioning to online, especially during a particularly busy season.  

It’s really unfortunate you hyped up 2020 and Q4 as though it’s showing unbelievable growth and potential without even so much as hinting at it being a possible inflation due to rare increase in demand. 

All in all, this analysis is as GME- apes/diamond hands -fanboy as it gets, and it’s completely detached from reality / common sense. It is highlighting unique high sales as growth / executive new-hires and trying to quick-sell you into thinking this is true and makes sense to get you to dump more money into GME. The more money everyone dumps, the higher GME goes, and then despite what they tell you they have an exit-strategy because there is 0 point in buying and never selling- you might throw your money down the street. 

I think a GOOD value is between 30-50 a share for the foreseeable future after this short-squeeze is wrapped up, and prior to any significant online success which could take several years to implement correctly. 

Please don’t be fooled by this bogus fanboy bullshit seriously this is absolutely disgusting and is preying on people trying to make fast money."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"nah, they're worth about $10 fair value without the squeeze shenanigans playing in, and that's *if* they successfully transition their business model properly. too many depreciating assets, plus the run on the new game consoles means their only near-term tailwind petered out before it even started blowing. 

problem with transitioning their business model is that they don't really have a niche or anything proprietary that Amazon and Walmart cant do better, faster, bigger, and cheaper through sheer volume and efficiency. that's why the company was struggling before the pandemic, and will continue to struggle long after. 

The other major concern is that the digital storefront competition is *vicious*. Do you know why Sony started selling an all-digital version of the PS5 for a cool $100 cheaper than the disc version? I'll give you a hint: It's not because the disc drive costs $100. It's because they will make far, FAR more in sales through their storefront to people that bought that version. No key sellers, no green man gaming, no third parties of any kind, no sales, ***Only PlayStation Store***. That's the only place you get to shop at if you buy that version, and guess what? The *instant* they think they can get away with it, Sony will make that the only kind of console you can buy. Then GameStop will make precisely $0 selling new PlayStation software, digital or physical. Because it will all come direct, with no middleman. 

Microsoft is having similar discussions behind closed doors. But they don't have the goodwill to push it, so they'll let Sony lead the way and announce a similar thing when it is safe to do so, maybe as soon as the next generation after this. Once that happens, this company is obsolete, no matter how many funko pops and magazine subscriptions it sells. The clock is ticking. Tick, tock."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say that yes their online sales were higher but it was also a pandemic and more people shopped online. I fully agree though this company can grow to be a powerhouse.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a GME holder (30 shares) and I very much like the stock. However, this is just not accurate:

“Gamestop is undervalued considering its online sales numbers and ecommerce focus - analysts haven’t caught up yet from Q4 Earning report; add on top of that all the hiring of Amazon execs and VPs and Gamestop Valuation is about to explode upward.”

Sales numbers and fundamentals have nothing to do with this stock price. As an actual retail company, GME is worth a fraction of its current stock price.

The current price ($190) is a result of exposing short positions, insane volume, and a bit of wild speculation about the future of the company. 

So no, on fundamentals this is absolutely not a $500+ stock. BUT IT CAN STILL GET THERE. If the good people in this sub hold, and hold, and hold, as the short squeeze continues."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they also massively underestimate just how much all this free publicity has been worth and the fact there are now millions more customers who will go to Gamestop rather than buy from anywhere else.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree completely with you and wish the best of luck on the retirement and all the dreams and places she will go. #Staystrong HODL

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I pre-ordered my X Box Series X from GameStop.  It was only possible because of their brilliant plan.

You see, all other online retailers were absolutely ravaged by bots.  The average consumer stood little to no chance while the ~~scalpers~~ opportunists raked in units.

GameStop sent a tweet that they had units and YOU could have one.  You simply needed to go to a physical store and pick up a Golden Ticket.  You would then return to the line and the store EE's would process your order THROUGH their online storefront for shipment directly to you.

So these all counted as online sales, real people were able to get their hands on these highly prized units AND made new GameStop friends.  I had all but given up on GameStop, but this move brought me back and made me a fan.

In short, I believe that they GET IT and they will bounce back with a vengeance as they continue their transition into online sales and offerings."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, just wanted to say your story about your daughter is so beautiful and really resonates with me. I lost a similar best friend a year ago last week. We met when we were 14. She was going through a midlife crisis at the time. When she was young, cystic fibrosis life expectancy was 25, but it was 40 by the time we met. She thought she'd get a make a wish, and she wanted to use it to visit me (we lived at a distance and only saw each other a week or two every few years). But life expectancy was too high for the foundation by then.

We faced her crisis and depression together, figured out her goals. She skipped university, against her parents wishes. She married her childhood sweetheart. We were each other's maids of honor. She ended up leading and growing an international youth group in her city, one she started taking over around when we met. She mentored numerous women facing health issues. She was super passionate about raising money for refugees camps along the Mediterranean. 

COVID took her just a couple days after her 28th birthday. I miss her like hell but I'm so grateful I got to share the hardest part with her, because she lived the rest with all her heart. I hope your daughter gets exactly the same."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I usually post on here relating to my wife’s boyfriend, but on a serious note. 


I have to say the story of your daughter is moving on a very deep level.  The worst thing for these greedy bastard hedge funds is for their media fear campaigns driving traffic to this site to read posts like this one and the story of the OP’s daughter and why he is doing it, there are many other stories of a similar manner being posted as well. 

Now, who else is excited to tell their wife and her boyfriend about this post?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of charts. Very cool.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhhh broz listen. Game Stop. Is going out of buisness. I know your all blinded by mooning this specific stock.  But this company has been losing money every year. Year after year. They just closed 600 stores.  

Now let's think about e-commerce. Game stop sells video games. Over 80% of all video game sales are now digital and by 2025 over 95% of all video games will be sold digitally. Gamestop is just another link on a chain xbox, playstation and Nintendo don't need.. 

So pc and legacy games then?

How viable is a buisness that sells only games for only consoles?  

Do you think a single PC gamer will buy anything through a gamestop digital store front? 

Game stop may be viable as a e-commerce legacy games retailer... and there stock will be worth 1$ a share. Because at point with almost no physical stores left.  Maybe just maybe they are worth 200 million dollars as a company.  Likely more like 20 - 40 million if it's even possible that many people want physical old games.  

Which I don't believe it is. Sorry.  

And game so shares over 10 dollars a share.  In reality take the # of shares and divide that by what Game stop. A failing company for 15 years is worth.  

The only reason GME is worth what it is; is back of this pop culture but GME moment.  It's not likely that now people buy and hold then did already. GmE is a massive P&D at this point. It's not worth what you think it is.  And alot of people are going to lose a lot of money here. A lot of you are going to lose alot of money.

Not trying to be negative but let's face facts. This is the largest P&D ever Put in by the internet."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the post, and I'm not trying to be a dick here, but take a look at this chart of year-over-year growth and look at when the last two major consoles came out, its always a significant bump, but doesn't last.
[https://iili.io/qkkqmX.jpg](https://iili.io/qkkqmX.jpg)
Couple this with a pandemic with brick and motor stores closed, of course there's going to be a giant spike in online sales, but unfortunately there's no way its going to sustain beyond 2021 Q2 at most. 
Hopefully people make the most of this squeeze while they can and don't get burned.
Peace and love apes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, this is kinda crazy talk."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Uuuugh ANOTHER GameStop DD? Jesus...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I have some problems with this DD. In fact I think it grossly misses the mark. I'm gonna put aside the emotional parts (my heart goes out to you man) and just focus on the facts.

One of the first major flaws I see is the Roblox comparison. While I don't know much about the company itself and its growth potential, I have a problem with looking at something that is incredibly hyped, trading at a very high multiple, and then using that as justification for why another stock should do the same. One could easily arrive at absurd conclusions by using that logic. For example: TSLA currently has a P/E of 1054 as I type this (god that is fucking insane). Toyota is trading at 15.6 times earnings. If Toyota was trading at the same multiple, the share price would rocket from $154 to $10,423 per share. That would be a market cap of over 14 trillion USD. And the comparison is even less reliable when you try to use it on companies in two different segments, like GME and RBLX are. You don't compare an airline stock to a tech stock, why would you expect GME and RBLX to behave similarly? Sure, they both fall under the broad umbrella of the gaming industry, but their businesses models are *radically* different.

Secondly, I think you're being overly bullish on the digital sales growth. You spun it as if the 2020 online sales were in *spite* of the pandemic when I'd argue that really it was BECAUSE of the pandemic. It's no secret that industries related to at-home entertainment did well last year with everyone at home. With many stores closed and COVID restrictions, consumers were basically forced to buy online more than before, and GameStop didn't have much choice but to expand their digital offerings. Not to mention the new console coming out in Q4, and of course holiday sales are always the biggest time of year for the company. I think it's a mistake to look at the explosion in Q4 online sales and project that growth to continue at the same rate in all of 2021. That growth was likely caused by the pandemic, the new consoles, holiday sales, and didn't exactly start from a super high point.

Let's look at some facts here. Online sales increased in Q4 by 175% vs Q4 of 2019. FY 2020 saw  a 190% increase in online sales vs. FY 2019. That means other quarters had a bigger percentage increase than Q4. Digging a little deeper, on page 26 of their 10-Q for the quarter ended August 1 (aka Q2 of 2020), they noted an 800% increase in e-commerce sales vs. the same quarter in 2019. So why would you attribute 2020's online sales growth to anything Ryan Cohen did, especially when he wasn't even on the board until recently?

Furthermore, why should we expect GameStop to be able to become a huge player in the online space? You kinda just hand-wave it away as Ryan Cohen being such a magician that he can take a huge chunk of the pie. It's one thing to do that in a space without a lot of competition, it's a whole 'nother ball game when you're going up against established juggernauts. Why would/should consumers order from GameStop over existing options like Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, Microcenter, and of course, Steam (or Sony/Microsoft online stores, for console games)? The point about the graphics card selling out quickly isn't impressive considering how many hardware shortages there are right now. Go ahead and try to buy a 3070 from any of those players I mentioned; it ain't easy. 

I'm not saying they can't massively expand their e-commerce and gain a major foothold there, but simply glossing over all their obstacles ""because Ryan Cohen"" isn't a strong argument IMO. And of course, I wouldn't look at the 17x sales growth from Chewy's early days as proof that Cohen can do that with a brick and mortar business, especially in just a few years. Yes yes, I understand it's not just a brick and mortar retail outlet, but that IS its primary business right now, and it takes time to change that.

As for how to value the company, I don't know. But I also don't trust the numbers you came up with. I wouldn't use Price/Sales as the defining metric for valuation, but since you threw that out there let's take a look. If any on that list is comparable to GME, it would be Best Buy: a primarily retail-oriented business with also significant e-commerce offerings. That trades at roughly 0.6 times sales. Using the same metric on Gamestop would suggest that its market cap should be less than a third of what it is now. (again I don't actually like using that to ""value"" a company, I think it's not a good method, I'm just pointing out how flawed I think your argument is here)

Now you say that GME has such a high multiple because it's transitioning to e-commerce, but I don't think that's the case. In reality, the multiple is probably so high because this generation's Occupy Wall Street movement thinks they're gonna get rich while bankrupting hedge funds by simply buying shares. People are speculating and have driven up the price well above any justifiable value and I would be absolutely *floored* if the stock ended 2021 above $100. 

One last little consideration here is that I believe there's a good chance GME dilutes its shares. Now this is definitely speculation on my part, but they mentioned in their 10-K that they're considering expanding their ATM offering to sell more shares (currently they can raise $100 million at any time, which would add \~500k shares to the float, about 1.25%. Not a huge effect unless you're holding out for a squeeze). I don't expect dilution anywhere near what AMC has done, of course, but at these prices it must be an appealing proposition to issue new shares so they can raise capital without taking on debt. They're not in danger of going out of business anytime soon, and their assets exceeds their debts. But if you want to invest in the company to transform its business, and you have a golden opportunity to raise money without having to burden yourself with debt, why wouldn't you take it? 

TL;DR: GME has potential. But at $190 I don't think it's a good investment."

You can't out-Amazon Amazon and there are lots of other large retail players in the eCommerce market. A bold move would be to acquire a known commodity like GameFly and then use that as a footprint to build out a streaming video game service. People keep talking about GME becoming the Amazon of video games but they should be talking about GME becoming the Netflix of video games...."

I agree with the sentiment that the chewy model applied to gaming will be massively successful. Chewy did to pet supplies what amazon did to books( and online commerce ) and now gamestop will do the same for gaming. If they pull off being the product aggregator for all gaming parts, products, speciality items and can break into events and esports there is absolutey bothing stopping them from being a 200bb company. This will take years though so the best thing you can do is just buy in now during the dips and wait a couple years to retire. No the wsb way but hey money is fucking money"

Nintendo, Sony and MS want you to buy their game in their digital store because they make waaaaaaaay more money when you do so. Gamestop cannot get a piece of that pie unless it sells you a code (which are exclusively controlled by the console manufacturers). Selling codes is an inelegant solution and the supply is totally controlled by the console makers, so having an alternative marketplace for them is very tricky.

Any ideas on how GME can turn this around?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had to stop reading when OP started comparing Chewy online sales to what GameStop will look like in the future.  
  
Decided to take a look at the conclusion and laughed even harder. “GameStop the Amazon killer” will also own a large slice of the 200B esports market apparently (where it currently doesn’t even exist)? GameStop moving into esports would be like Target or Best Buy moving into esports."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Come on man, I'm sure Cohen will figure out a way to do better digital distribution than the other players! It's not like Microsoft has any expertise in this area... Not to mention everyone seems to forget that selling games is Sony and Microsofts bread and butter. They often lose money on the consoles just for the opportunity to sell you the games - they aren't going to let a dying brick and mortar eat their lunch.

I suppose they could always go for the PC gaming market but hard to see steam, epic or origin giving up much ground."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">decreasing on average 20% YoY with 5 billion in revenue in 2020. A reminder that gamestop lost 200 million in 2020

While this is true, it's not entirely fair. RC only stepped in what, november 2020? The company as of now is not worth the valuation but it's got huge potential. The big question now is how precisely is RC going to transform the company? The recent earnings call from sherman did not reveal any specific (new) guidance. (Also, why didn't they announce the new board members in the earnings recall, but chose a later point in time?). GME has gained non-stop publicity for 3 months now. Let's await the earnings reports for Q1 next year and the year after.

Remindme! 1 year

Btw, what do you think is the reasonable valuation atm?"

I think being forged in this difficulty, she is in this constant state of giving back. She literally thrives off of it. It's amazing to see. I can never feel down or out about myself in any situation after seeing what she has faced and survived, with a smile and focus on turning it into something positive.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,">New gamers were created.

This is spot on, at least in my brain. I have no data that would back this up but I’m willing to bet money that there were a lot of people who either picked up gaming or started gaming again when the pandemic struck because there was nothing else to do. While it’s obvious that a lot of them will probably go back to not gaming as much when we regain normalcy, there’s still probably going to be a significant amount who continue doing it."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you missed that it was a metaphor for a turnaround. I’m not calling GameStop a $2 Trillion company. I’m saying that the current market cap of $13 Billion might not be fairytale land if you think Ryan Cohen is going to pull a Chewy and turn GameStop into the primary online destination for gamers. In my opinion, such a place does not exist. The closest might be Twitch.

I’m not saying anyone should invest. I’m not saying it going to $50,000. I am saying that the valuation is not crazy right now if you believe in a turnaround.

Why did I write my original post? Because I saw the same story in the late 1990s that Apple couldn’t be saved and was going to go bankrupt - they lost the PC wars and had multiple years of losses even after Jobs returned. Everyone was doom and gloom. I bought several thousand shares because I grew up an Apple fanboy. People told me I was throwing money away. In 2010 my financial advisor told me to diversify. I should NOT have listened.

Again, I’m not saying GameStop is Apple or will turn out the same way. Just that when predicting the future of GameStop you either believe in the losses or you believe in the turnaround. Your future expectation dictates the price you are willing to pay.

Positions: I 💩  on the GME trade and DD through November 2020. Bought before Christmas 2020. Sold at $350. Bought again at $40. Bought again at $90. Bought again at $120. I like the stock. It is not Apple."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Beats me - OP here suggested it was easily worth $550-750 a share and I was just curious what they would even sell that could see valuation in that territory

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not so sure but it's a guess. It may be smart for GameStop to put Steam in their sights. Steam (for the PC side of things) does really well in the digital market, and competitors have had to ride in with exclusive titles to compete in any meaningful way. If GameStop could make progress into that market, while using the discount philosophy steam uses to such success across more platforms it could put them in a place where they could take a decent percent of future platform gaming revenue while also competing in the PC market.   


I think they are poised to be real competition, given the amount of capital on hand that they could throw at it while also clearing their debts. Pretty good place to be in, really, to actually stand a chance.

2021-03-31 22:23:27,wallstreetbets,"Ubiquiti Security Breach and Short Opportunity Heads up apes, Ubiquiti (ticker: UI) is about to take it up the tendie hole from shorts. They are a manufacturer of internet of things devices like routers, video recorders, and cameras. There was a security breach announced in January that was severely downplayed and suppressed, and now a whistleblower has alerted European regulatory bodies. From the article and another post on the system admin subreddit:

>“The breach was massive, customer data was at risk, access to customers’ devices deployed in corporations and homes around the world was at risk.”  
>  
>\*\*“They were able to get cryptographic secrets for single sign-on cookies and remote access, full source code control contents, and signing keys exfiltration,” Adam said.\*\*Such access could have allowed the intruders to remotely authenticate to countless Ubiquiti cloud-based devices around the world. According to its website, Ubiquiti has shipped more than 85 million devices that play a key role in networking infrastructure in over 200 countries and territories worldwide.

The money quote:

>Adam says Ubiquiti’s security team picked up signals in late December 2020 that someone with administrative access had set up several Linux virtual machines that weren’t accounted for.  
>  
>“Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances with networking connectivity to said databases,” Adam wrote in his letter. “Legal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes within the relevant period.”

[\^Article in question](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/03/whistleblower-ubiquiti-breach-catastrophic/)

And now, a law firm that specializes in securities litigation has just opened a case against them. [Article here.](https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/shareholder-alert-ubiquiti-inc-investigated-184800904.html) Supposedly Ubiquiti was the real target in the AWS hack a while back. Anyone remember that story of a casino's mainframe being hacked [through a smart thermometer on a fishtank?](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2017/07/21/how-a-fish-tank-helped-hack-a-casino/) Well, this is a hack that was apparently much more invasive (infiltrated all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies) and this is a company that manufactures *security cameras and routers*. If a smart thermometer could get dataframe access at a casino, imagine the damage that could be done here to any business with an Ubiquiti product hooked into their network. I'm not saying they haven't patched up a good portion of the breach, but at this point it's hard to tell what else might be compromised if they swept it under the rug this long. Anyone smoothbrained and smarter than me please feel free to explain in more depth.

Ubiquiti has dropped 12% on the day and this news has not hit mainstream networks or media yet, just a system security blog and a small Yahoo Finance alert. If this gets any more publicity, or there are any major updates with the litigation, this thing might see a 50% drop like SolarWinds did during their hack which I expect to play out over next couple trading days into next week.

Puts have gotten more expensive, but personally I'm in. Buying puts $240 Apr 16 and May 21. Companies that have this level of security incompetence and are this negligent towards their customers don't deserve to be valued like this. Let's bring this thing up (down?) to the moon.

2021-03-31 22:02:51,wallstreetbets,"Canoo $GOEV - State of the Union - First Earnings Report **TLDR: Canoo's deal with Hyundai was terrible. Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing top hats, factories and etc). Production and model timeline is still on track.**

Monday's earnings call was Canoo's single largest event since it deSPACed ($HCAC => $GOEV). For those who don't know me, I've written the original [Canoo/BangBus DD last year](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jzioed/mega_dd_bangbus_ev_going_public_everything_you/) which speculated the Apple partnership ([which turned out to be true](https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/12/22225026/apple-canoo-acquisition-investment-electric-car-goev)), I'm a mod on r/canoo, I'm active in most Canoo channels (Reddit, Twitter, StockTwits, Discord and etc) and I love to share whatever I stumble across (like [leaking the Canoo pickup truck](https://www.reddit.com/r/canoo/comments/m208cq/canoo_pickup_truck_leak_pics_and_specs_inside/)). This is not financial advice, I am not employed by Canoo nor represent them in any way and I do have a position in Canoo (see below).

I'll start off with this number: **$8.9m**. This is how much Tony Aquila (Canoo's Chairman) personally lost between Monday's close and Tuesday's close. While we've all lost in the past day (I personally lost six-figures), Tony has lost more than any of us. While I'm not apologizing for him, I'm sure he too feels the fire of deep red in his investment. However, much of what Tony said, absolutely needed to be said. The moves he made has set up Canoo for long term success and I'll explain why.

I was looking forward to the Contract Engineering revenue and became disappointed when we did not see it. I truly believed this additional revenue stream would've been huge in the short term price movement. After all, OEMs are reaching out to Canoo for their expertise, while other companies are rolling trucks down hills or [trying to build vehicles that don't erupt in flames](https://www.thedrive.com/tech/39788/lordstown-motors-endurance-prototype-caught-fire-ten-minutes-into-first-test-drive). Having listened to Tony's reasoning and looking at [Canoo's financials](https://investors.canoo.com/news-presentations/press-releases/detail/52/canoo-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2020-results), I completely understand why he nixed the Contract Engineering.

Let's go back to the end of 2019. Canoo was a young company. Developing electric vehicles is very capital intensive. Canoo's liabilities exceeded their assets, and at the end of 2019 they had a mere $31m in cash with $11m in current liabilities. While Canoo developed a great product, and held some cash, it may have not been enough to continue to gamma stages let alone enough capital to build vehicles for their subscription model. On the heels of Stefan Krause being ousted, Canoo was in turmoil. Senior members saw the writing on the wall, and started to leave in 2019 to early 2020. So, Uli Kranz (CTO, then interim CEO) and the remaining engineers did what they do best, find projects to work on. Enter Hyundai.

While the partnership with Hyundai may not have been ideal, it would've doubled Canoo's cash on hand. With a world-class engineering team on idle, it seemed like a really great idea to reallocate resources. As the saying goes, one in the hand, is better than two in the bush.

However, in hindsight, it turned out to be a terrible deal. Keep in mind Canoo's skateboard cost $250m to develop. We initially speculated the Contract Engineering revenue was $34m, but on the earnings call, it turned out to be even less at $25m. Furthermore, it's very difficult to differentiate your own IP versus the work you've been contracted for:

* If you developed a better skateboard for your client, you cannot use this superior skateboard as it belongs to the client.
* If you developed a worse skateboard for your client, you've now knowingly given your client an inferior product (see [Tesla vs Fisker](https://www.motortrend.com/news/tesla-vs-fisker-the-epilogue-or-why-tesla-owes-fisker-11-million-3052/)).
* If you give your client your skateboard as-is, the client just received a skateboard that takes 3-5 years to design/engineer and possibly billions ([Faraday](https://www.businessinsider.com/jia-yueting-faraday-future-tesla-rival-bankrupt-2020-1)) if not $500+ million ([Dyson](https://electrek.co/2020/05/18/dyson-cancelled-electric-car/#:~:text=Dyson%20has%20unveiled%20its%20abandoned,on%20its%20own%20electric%20vehicle)), for a measly $25m. Congratulations, you just played yourself.

As you can see, none of these scenarios are ideal for Canoo. If I were Hyundai, I'd be all over this deal too. No wonder Hyundai was so quick to jump on this deal, especially after announcing their partnership with Arrival just a month prior.

**Upon closing the SPAC, Canoo is flush with cash. They no longer need the Contract Engineering revenue, and are actually better off without it.**

With this conflict of interest, I now see why many automakers are turning their backs to Apple. Why help a competitor to make a better product, for very minimal upside for yourself? As an engineer that signed up to join an exciting start-up like Canoo, would you be happy if you were pimped out to another company to engineer something that's not better, but not worse, but not the same, as something you've already created?

With that being said, Tuesday's price action was absolutely blown out of proportion, and I took advantage and bought GOEV warrants ($GOEVW) with both hands. Remember, we never knew details of the deal with Hyundai. Now knowing that the Contract Engineering would've produced minimal revenue, no royalties/on-going income, while delaying core projects, wouldn't you have cut this too? By killing the Contract Engineering, Canoo can now focus on projects that will set them up for long term success (e.g. designing tophats, factories and etc). For quick math, Canoo foregone $25m in contract revenue. Let's assume Magna would've charged $5000 for each vehicle. If Canoo instead reallocated resources towards building a facility, they would earn all that lost revenue within the first year ($5000 x 10,000 vehicles first year = $50m saved), while protecting their own IP.

Also, an important fact to consider was that Tony revealed that the contract value was based on labor of engineers (e.g. hourly rate), not value of IP. Meaning, Canoo charged a mark-up on top of their existing employee’s salary, rather than charging based on the hundreds of millions (if not billions) in IP they were receiving. While I do think Uli is a great leader, this was a great misstep under his watch.

With all the focus on the Hyundai agreement, we lost sight of gems uncovered in the earnings report/call:

* Internationalization. Lots of demand in Europe. International sales coming online soon.
* Better idea of cash on hand and operating expenses.
   * We are in a very healthy financial position. One-third of our market cap is cash. Canoo also has a mere $27m in current liabilities and <$7m in long-term debt. **If this isn’t a deep value play, I don’t know what is.**
* Timeline and order of models have not changed: LV, MPDV, PU. We are still on track for production next year.
* Working closely with State Governors to obtain the greatest benefits/incentives.
   * These discussions could save tens or even hundreds of millions down the road. While I would’ve liked to get confirmation on Monday, we cannot rush this crucial process.
* Acknowledged Investor Relation's lack of communication.

Tony also stated some milestones to look out for:

* Gamma vehicle progress.
* Reporting reservations vs pre-orders.
* Lock in geographics and contract manufacturing partners.
* State level partnerships.

As of Tuesday’s close, Canoo had a $2b market cap. Canoo has $700m in cash, and IP worth anywhere from $250m to $1b+. In comparison, Fisker has a $5b market cap and virtually no IP, no engineering and no proprietary technology. Lucid, which has a \~$40b market cap, is worth 20x Canoo, yet, they are only months apart from manufacturing. Canoo at a $2b market cap (<$10 share price) is an absolute steal in comparison to other players in the field.

**My bull case from last year still applies. The $18/$25/$30 price targets for management's earn out shares applies. I still have a $30 price target, which I'm confident we'll hit this year.**

**Positions: 130,001 warrants.** These warrants should be worth $18+ once $GOEV hits $30.

[$GOEV - 130,001 warrants](https://preview.redd.it/gb6dtnwwkeq61.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e87d38cc703d91c43b8d227e121187d7e3f0c12b)

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Completely agree. Their engineering is clearly sought after. They shouldn't be selling it to other companies. You don't see Coca-Cola helping it's competitors develop new flavors.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a number of things I’m disappointed in  on the conference call, but the biggest thing is the apparent move away from the consumer market. I was actually looking forward to buying Bangbus 2.0 and getting a Daddy Pig Camper wrap on on it"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really think the news was blown out proportion, and people will realize it soon and start piling back in. I bought another 5000 warrants today for the next leg up."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the club! 🙏
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"More upside, but more risk."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,More leverage. Like calls versus shares.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. 1 warrant for 1 common.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea you can buy sell whenever, but watch out for redemption. If stock stays above $18 for 20 days GOEV can call warrants for redemption and that will give you 30 days to redeem for $11.50 or sell."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll invest if Elon dies. GOEV is a bet against Tesla and that is not a sound decision.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy GME right after DFV's next loss porn post.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They said in the earnings calls they don't have any outlooks for an acquisition.

Their Hyundai deal fell through and they want to focus on producing cars... I was a Canoo bull until I heard they're not open for contracting their skateboard tech or open for acquisition..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Canoo is the one who ended this deal...not Hyundai. Canoo essentially got everything they needed; their engineering design was legitimated and now they can capitalize on their IP. The stock drop is just a knee jerk reaction.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. Saw another comment I think you did explaining the right to buy until 2025. Like a long-ass LEAP, crazy that they're $3"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I figured, thanks"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think most companies announce they want to be acquired, it just happens if the price is right. Not saying they'll do it but I wouldn't rule it out."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Subscription model was one of my concerns. Cars are incredibly personal. It's a cool idea, but the only people I can see liking it is, IDK, college students renting for a semester?

I'm personally way more interested in the ""we're building this for the second owner"" truck than the LV"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The one thing I learned from this whole GME fiasco is that the more FUD is spread the better the value. Unless actual employees/owners out to admit fault like with Nikola and Lordstown.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"thats huge for long term, shitty for short term. not surprised by the sell off but i've been accumulating at 12 and welcome the sale."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only product that could work with the subscription model is the MPDV. I can see it being leased as food trucks or micro retail space. Other than that, I agree with you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe Canoo is going to shine in providing delivery fleet vehicles as well as rideshare/traditional taxi vehicles.  Not really a direct competitor of Tesla at all.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There did appear to be a sedan under a cover in one of Canoo's videos, FYI.  


Still, I think Canoo is going to be aiming for a lower price point and commercial market, which would probably make VW and Ford their main competition (though I think both are looking at vehicles as a service in the medium-long term) while Tesla and Lucid fight over the higher-end market."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that makes wayyy more sense B2B with companies needing a bit of fleet. Subscription covers insurance and repairs, can increase for peak seasons with no large up-front, etc."
2021-03-31 21:43:14,wallstreetbets,$YEXT YOLO UPDATE. I had to average down a bit. How retarded am i ? 
2021-03-31 21:36:25,wallstreetbets,"Listen you dumb fucks (deferred revenue) & IVY roll out $BB So, I was pissed yesterday. Then I read between the lines and other boards and I believe they would have outperformed the revenue line if not for the patent sale upcoming.

Chen said that yearly income on patents is 250 M$. 250/4= 62.5 M$. Now, look at the deferred revenue line you apes between q4 and q3. It went up 61 million.

This is not counted in this quarter's revenue because if they sell the patents this revenue will probably go to the buyer and BB will get what they sell it for.

Clearly, people want it to go down but without this patent sale, they would be in line if not outperform the revenue expectation of 246 M$.

**So what about IVY**?

The timeframe for the IVY release day is coming sooner than expected! We can expect it in February 2022 which is insane, I was thinking we’d have to wait many more years to see that released. Yes, you read that right, February 2022!!

The thing is, so many people still don’t know Ivy exists and once we start seeing live demos of Ivy in action I expect new investors to flood in and the price to go up significantly. Nothing like Ivy exists on the market today and there are endless opportunities with this technology.

In the meantime, now that the quiet period is over I’m expecting a flood of new releases from BB and I’m super excited. Another catalyst will be drones, hoping to hear more on that sometime this year.

Furthermore, BlackBerry now has design wins with 23 of the top 25 EV OEM’s, up from 19 of the top 25 last quarter.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What? He was perfectly clear.

250mm is the estimate in patent royalties, but, because they are in discussions to sell the parents for a lump sum, they couldn't also license them. So they didn't get any licensing revenues recorded until the sale goes through (or doesn't go through). The clarity will come once negotiations are over.

I thought it was a valid response. He can't just go out and lay the terms of a sale before it has happened."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Important point. Everyone bangs on about how tech sales should be up up up using zoom / slack / trams as a metric...they are not a metric they are having a boom due to worker remote enablement.

Blackberry doesn’t really compete in the remote sharing space asides from ‘Workplaces’ of course they know they’ll never take a decent slice of that market, that market is for the big dogs.,

So enterprise security is where Blackberry shines. But any enterprise that is not insane already has a vendor providing that service for years. It’s difficult to oust an entrenched competitor since IT is busy at home scratching their balls and doesn’t want to look at any vendor stuff unless absolutely necessary.

But it’s getting necessary. The recent exploits around MS Exchange & hacker groups show the prestigious position BB has and why it wins big government contracts.

Blackberry is going big in enterprise security, sales are coming, maybe another quarter or two.

Easily worth $15+"

""Under the terms of the agreement, BlackBerry grants OnwardMobility the right to develop, engineer, and bring to market a BlackBerry 5G mobile device. Working closely with BlackBerry and FIH Mobile, OnwardMobility will ensure the world-class design and manufacturing of these devices.""

BB is no longer in the device space, they are not using these patents. These would fall right in ""their patent portfolio that aren't being used by current products""."
2021-03-31 21:13:58,wallstreetbets,"Discovery (DISCA) and ViacomCBS (VIAC) are trading at a discount now. Hello Autists,

DISCA and VIAC are trading at a big discount due to the latest  Archegos Capital Management  Debacle. Archegos had to liquidate their positions since they failed to meet margin calls last week. 

[Read The whole story here](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/31/these-stocks-are-trading-at-a-discount-due-to-archegos-debacle/).

Long story short, I think DISCA and VIAC are great buys right now, but i'd love to hear what you think as well. Has anyone already invested in these stocks?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted this elsewhere and wanted to share it here. The real play is at VIACA:

I will be posting a long form DD over the next couple days on VIACA. In short, the banks, GS MS Nomura CS, all built enormous positions over the past seven months (hint hint Archegos) and now are tripping over themselves to sell VIAC. Given the insane volume from the past few days, that selling looks close to, if not entirely, finished.That makes the setup for VIACA very very similar to DISCB with a pretty underpriced company underneath it all. Arbitrage teams may have been caught offsides there, too, which makes me wonder how they are positioned in VIACA/VIAC.

I am in the April 60c and 70c for a lot, built the positions over the past two days and probably will keep buying tomorrow.

High risk, speculative, mildly informed, and retarded. The true WSB way."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Zoom out on VIAC please before you throw your last $50 down a hole.  It's complete trash stock, it was only up massively this year literally because of the blown up fund propping it up single handedly.  It was a pyramid scheme."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"DISCA has not precedent to be as high as it is right now, but might swing viacomCBS after gme since its got nice oscillation history between 30 and 60 dollars. Could be 50% gains per swing as long as ViacomCBS doesnt randomly bankrupt

(not financial advice)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am in this
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy low and sell lower on dips
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"$VIAC looks cheap after the crash, from a pure p/e perspective right now, doesn't it?  They issued shares, so maybe a run up to $70 is more reasonable?

I'm in hard on $VIAC, $BIDU, $VIPS as a supply imbalance play, as well as, relative discounts, post meltdown.

Would love some thoughts on it.  Thanks guys."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,VIACA > VIAC
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom is worthless. They have potential to stream but will get bought out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CS also is getting hosed by Greensill - good luck
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,yessir!!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit WTF!!! DISCB pops the fuck off and I'm here holding FDs in DISCA with a small flacid pp. I'm pissed 😠. This shit makes no sense to me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dividend is tomorrow, 0.24"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the VIAC volume today. Even if you add up GS, CS, MS and Nomuras cumulative exposure, they should have been able to get out by now. No one can call the bottom but it's looking pretty close to here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at VIACA if you want a similar setup to DISCB.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Emily in Paris > sold to Netflix. 
Jack Ryan > sold to Amazon."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIACA! Less shares in VIACA, makes it easier to raise the price with buys."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you change it to VIACA?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,tesla valuation is absolutely fucking retarded though is the thing
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a couple $50 calls with 4 weeks to get there, let’s go."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC has dividend tomorrow? 

As you need to be in by close tomorrow in order to receive?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"\> "" 95% of the DISCB is owned by one guy, media executive John Malone ""

So really there were only roughly 305K shares to be bought of DISCB today (at most). MUCH smaller float than VIACA. Orders of magnitude. So, maybe some bump if enough people buy, but likely nothing like what DISCB saw today.  


Edit: MarketWatch puts DISCB float at **228.45K** and VIACA float at **10.52M.** Not even fucking close."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have 587 mil shares, a volume of 90 mil is not so much. Think about gme, they have like 70 mil shares, and in some days the volume was bigger. Dont buy it all at once, each day buy like 20% from your total investment, in this case you can average down or up )."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,you are absolutly braindead if you think this can go in mid 30 range
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, it's trading pretty close to my entry price. What's the case for $VIACA?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not how stocks work
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah and go to cinemas where they watch viacomcbs movies.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"On one hand it's def overvalued p/e wise, but on the other hand it shows how much people want the future to be self driving EV. Just an example of when the brand is worth more than the financials."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"VIAC has 502 million outstanding shares, with a very large percentage of that being float. So trying to buy those up to drive the price upward is gonna be difficult. VIACA on the other hand on has 52 million outstanding shares, with a float if 10 million. It's much easier to affect the price through buys. It's the same reason DISCB shot up in price, because they only had 6.1 million shares VS DISCA which has 168 million shares."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's my investment strategy
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You could also think of this like GME vs AMC. Both were heavily shorted. But what worked in GMEs favor is the low amount of shares (50 million), where as AMC had significantly more (400 million). Yes it is possible that VIAC will moon, but it would take one hell of a push from everyone to make that happen. And right now I'm not seeing that. If the same amount of people, that believed VIAC would moon, would move over to VIACA, then I think we would see some really good and quick results."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I made my bet that something similar happens to VIACA. VIACA is the voting shares where people may be offsides.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't see why they would sell streaming right to any of their content with competitors like Netflix anymore once any current contracts end.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"the answer is yes, eventually. Lookup paramounts list of films, no way they aren't wildly successful as paramount+ slowly becomes the only place to see any of those"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would, but I’m in Phoenix. Too many cacti, jumping cholla, and feral javelinas"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some people would pay extra for that, probably."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people come out here for the hiking trails and campgrounds. Meanwhile, I’m over here thinking cinnamon toast fuck, why?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Virgin google hates national security, hates the military, probably sells your data, and hates the idea of America being a great country.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the fam. Pls leave your vape by the door.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol where are you getting this squeeze bs from? Palantir is a long term buy based on fundamentals. Nothing to do with shortie shorts. I dont think short interest is even over 10%.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sub was founded on the idea of speculative gambling from your phone with options, and in the past 6th months it has strayed from that and most people are just posting about buying shares of meme stocks (not that there’s anything wrong with doing that).

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Por qué no los dos?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see. I'm in the wrong industry, I'm mid 20s on track for around $120k a year at that age (which i thought was good haha). Please tell me atleast your hours are as miserable as mine."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"In my analyst days, yes. Typically worked upwards to 100 hours a week. Your hours get a lot less as you move up. That said, the job doesn’t get any less stressful from there..."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Poor mans covered call are a bad idea. If your call moons, the poor mans covered call takes all your profit. Not worth it for the chump change you get selling them."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$33 by end of year? This hit $45 in January.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But isn’t this risk also with covered calls and shares?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a good idea if you sell the calls right after a large moon and it dips some.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re learning from someone who is a newb too. You shouldn’t hope your OTM covered calls get exercised as it is extremely rare and won’t happen.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You should feel that way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your point?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for replying appreciate it!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Partially why I was so confused knowing exercising is basically 99% the worst option but I know there are still moves to be made that I have no idea about. Still learning all the greeks but I'm gettin there.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks? I get it now lmao am I supposed to just know as much as you?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Stoked for you OP
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,so this was the real short squeeze for the year. DAMNIT!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,My man is wicked smaht
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"same thing could happen at VIACA (not VIAC), plus VIACA has options where DISCB has no options, I grabbed some VIACA this morning when I saw DISCB pop, who knows how the arb play is stacked on VIACA and VIAC, could be the same, worth a shot"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck. was looking at VIAC as well, congrats on the profit  
maybe i'll buy a few shares PM"

(Noob here, just realized this is being discussed below-ignore :). )"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why B over A 🤔
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good Job

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck made you get into DiscB?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the move
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was gonna buy A, but just watched. That would have pissed me off."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$127 now.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you find out it was going to go up?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a short squeeze on that specific ticker. Other related tickers will likely not see much movement, at least that's directly related."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,WTF what about DISCK
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,lol those are boomer stocks now
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck. Yes. 

I’ll be watching closely for my in tomorrow morning.

I like the stock 🤷🏼‍♀️"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hang out for a few days. Voting is important but not the end all be all. A and B will move towards each other in the next week.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Smaht pahk!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please send me an update on how it goes for you tomorrow.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I chose this one because it was showing the most volatility. It has the biggest buy wall on level 2 data. But mostly because it was moving.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$200 today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme squoze from 50 to 150 the first day, then to 350 the second day. I'm going in today. This is not finanical advice, this is my grocery list."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. I got back in at $115. My sell order is $128

Update: sold at $127"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I went with VIAC because who watches the Discovery Channel.  Shows how much I know
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,More like some pair trade going the wrong way. That's how the VW squeeze started as well. Maybe someone really wants those voting rights (10x for DISCB)? On the other end is some arb hedge fund that tries to capitalise on the spread but got squeezed out.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep! Market cap is under 1B. Where’s my bot?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How did they find out about the short?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So should VIAC
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't. It was purely accidental. I think if I found out it may go up it likely would have been too late. That's not at all helpful, I know, but that's what happened :)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh it moved alright. Bag city population me.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now I understand why you bought more today- smart. 

I’ll trade a 90 day time-out for gains happily. Good luck bud"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I just don’t get how people think AMC is gonna move
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny, we had similar shopping lists 2day.  🦍"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why only $128? Not yolo?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought disck 🤦‍♂️ wtf
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So apparently there's DISCA ($42.63), DISCB ($111.70) and DISCK ($36.26). They are basically all shares of the same company Discovery, Inc.

The difference is in voting rights (1x,10x,0x) and float, there just a tiny amount of DISCB shares. If you substract DISCK from DISCA, you arrive at about $6.40 for one vote. Multiply by 10, its $64. Thats very similar to the difference in DISCB / DISKK ($75+). Someone really wants those voting rights."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dad loves bitchin’ rides, maybe boomers really still are running things"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if there’s more left 🤔

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What? Now there's a DISKK????
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exactly why I'm fed up with the GME crowd lingering in here (despite still having my own shares). It's gotten much harder to spot this stuff in a timely manner when 3/4 posts are GME
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously! What do I pay you people for???
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't need to understand voting to make money in the market! Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"By this logic, it’s important to know there’s two pennies in your pocket.

Point:  Your vote will be worth less than 2 pennies.  Stfu with your lame attempt at gatekeeping."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean how was this supposed to reach the front page anyways? Anything that isn't GME is being downvoted by apes because ""iTs DisTrAcTiOn bY hEdGiEs"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed far too hard at this 🤣
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻👏🏻

We ain't goin around to every financial sub we can find looking for DD, we're looking for the stupid shit like ""ay that's hilarious I'm in"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't really know, but I would guess they're so close because people recognize the votes don't really matter when you have institutional investors who are going to control it anyways.  Also, Google stock is so highly traded that it's going to be pretty efficient on pricing (whereas Discovery has lower volumes and a lot of volatility recently, so it's a bit more all over the place).  No idea why they are flipped on pricing!"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean Michael Burry went down like 40% over 2 years and finished above 400% gains in 08
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you checking for with the inflow/outflow?

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,how do you know what the moon price is or if the moon was passed already. I mean it's staying up so it seems like we are still on the way. If you set a limit price of too much you miss it and too little you miss it. I have no idea what I'm doing...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta kinda LOL at the comments about “it’s easy to make money when you have money” like this is fucking ANYTHING


Guess what pussies and people bitching? 
I saved every dime of this serving in restaurants before I started my own business at age 25.

And guess what. In YOLO’ing 95% of my MONEY in GME because I have the fucking balls to.

If you’re bitching. Go bust your fucking ass at a restaurant. Don’t eat out. Don’t do anything for yourself but save. And then have the balls and stomach to gamble it on. Don’t be mad at me that I put my head down and took chances instead of bitching. 

I LOVE the stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, when it first went to $40 i was meh fuck it ill buy some more and then everytime it dipped i just kept stacking it up.  I didnt even really intend to but as the FUD spread and Hedgies kept trying to flood the airwaves with how all retail investors were Ewoks (not worthy of taking on The Empire)  I decided that I want to watch them burn.  Keepin about $10k in cash just to ensure I always have enough liquidity to buy into a dip."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I went from 10 at 100 to 5.5 at 120 :/
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, set alerts at 100 increments and deleted my trading apps."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,They no covered there shorts. Stock is high. We hold all shares. Maybe even more shares than available. No need to think it’s a sure thing. It’s in front of your face
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I sell on the way down from moon
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine took 1 1/2 business days

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure when it moons we will all know haha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,❤️🦍🦍
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that GME and Disney are similar is pretty interesting.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only started just under 2 months ago. I put in some of my tax refund and stimulus. Wish I had added more from both. I wasted the rest on I dont even know what. I dont even do anything.

These people yoloing 10 or 100k didn't always have it (well, outside the rare lucky trusties). Its the bad way to look at it to be comparing yourself to people yoloing 10k if you can't. If you invest smart, you will have more money than you had. Im sure there's a point where it isn't really going to ever make much of a difference.

If you worked at amazon making 15/hr, you could save up a few hundred a year, easy -- if you didn't have some other priorities (family, drug addiction, only fans simping, whatever)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i managed to avg down GME to $87, then sold at $125, net profit around $26k within 23 days. then bought some more again recently avg cost $185 x 158. i'm a millionaire but it hasn't always been like that. i look at other players here on WSB who have turned $200k into $8mil or another ape $70k into $4mil. i know it's possible to be a multimillionaire. what the other ape said it's true. it's 80% psychology."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's awesome/reassuring.

I sold some at $340 and bought again at... Shoot I don't remember what price point but I ended up at 180 shares @ $176.

I have yet to cross the $500k net worth mark, so this is all new to me, as I've only gotten serious about my net worth in the last 4 years ($30k in 2017 to now $300k)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why they would do that, as they need to let people sell. I’m worried they will start selling off peoples shares at the start of the squeeze though."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you think fidelity ui is bad you should look at vanguard mobile.  Stock prices only update every 20 min.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That too... i fully expect people who dont listen, the ones who dont use limit orders, and just sell on request, will see sales for MUCH lower than what the ticker shows"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,PS.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I say Xometry is besting them because it seems like most of our prototype business has gone to them recently.  I think we still use PRLB if we need molded parts because they'll run our resin grades, but we've been doing a lot of machining in the last 6 months and I think 95% of it's gone to Xometry.  


We make a lot of small plastic parts.  I design the 4-bar linkages that control automotive HVAC doors/valves.  Machining Acetal is difficult and they still outclass anything our in-house shop will do but from what I understand, but they're occasionally off by \~0.5mm.  It's like they're using reground bits or something."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the bids would need to be higher than the ask prices to do that, right?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We really do need to do this in squeeze aftermath. Brokerage firm/trading platform... all that.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"....are you pooling money with other WSB users? Or managing theirs?

WSB is a hedge fund about as much as ""retail"" in general is a hedge fund."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Naked longs?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because you get through a lot of hormones/puritanical thoughts of bodies and conception/ knowing you have a child somewhee.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope that doesnt happen but DO hope you make it on the train as it passes at the station.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"True but the price is $190 today.  If you want to invest in GME, 190 per share.   There’s a reason it’s not $10 and a reason it’s not 1k, but the market cap of GME around 20b makes sense to me.  What do you think it’s worth? I think at $190 the downside is half, so $95 a share.  The upside with no squeeze is probably 50%.... so $190 is fair value.  But there is a potential for a squeeze.  All the DD and GME management seems to also be in line for the upside and also along for the squeeze. 

My opinion, a large stake in GME is totally worth the risk if you believe.  Watch this fucker moon... honestly I think people are going to regret it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re exactly right
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess you can do all three with that
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Dammit I have 12 ................ Do I get 1 more tomorrow?? What's $200 between apes :'(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya i would agree actually pretty much on point with your assessment. I got my tickets to the moon but even if it doesn't it's already at about fair value.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your problem with palantir? Genuine question as the only thing I know of is their deals with ICE.  every other criticism ive heard just sounds ridiculously overblown.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like compiling the deportation of illegal immigrants is not so bad for you? Let alone the “anti terrorism” work they do with the army and CIA. I mean the fucking company is named after Sarumon’s orb which sarumon uses to spy on the hobbits, how can you rationalize it as fine"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol k so its literally just cause you dont like people getting deported? I'm sure you want to feed every starving kid in Africa and free the north koreans but the truth is you cant. Poverty and corruption sucks but fixing it is not something the world will change for a long time. In the mean time we have rules made by people we voted for and people that break those rules face the consequences. ""But but but what if YOU were trying to survive and escape to the US?"" Well m8 I guess that would be pretty shit wouldn't it? Makes me thankful that I dont have to.

Also,  sarumons orb is fucking cool."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But why?????
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down and hold BB is good long term imo
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So...now is the time to buy more. Got it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s always gotta be a bag holder on the other side
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought today was a very good day for BB. Bounced off of 8.36 which is what December 2020 on the monthly chart opened at. Can only go up from here? Hopefully lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down apes time is now! I did today why not!?!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Boii u better be selling covered calls to at least monetize those shares. You’ll probably make more money than the company itself.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Still holding.. willing to buy more.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,At the time that yolo call would have seemed just insanity
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen it today 🙌🙌 wheeeeee
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would be stunned if BB doesn't rise substantially by end of 2023; let alone 10 years.

At its height it was a $120+ stock phone company...they made bad bets in that space, and plummeted down to the $3 range for quite some time desperately trying to regain control in the phone space.

They realized that wasn't happening and decided for a complete turn around; and brought in tech-company re-brand specialist John Chen, who's taken two different tech companies from the brink (similar penny stock ranges) to $50+, in less than 10 years time each time...He's currently coming up on his 8th year at BB, and nearly his entire payment structure is based around him getting BB over $30+.

His goal has been rebranding it completely away from phones into cyber-security; which they already have some massive contracts for throughout major governments and major private companies...but the real long-term goal has been IVY/QNX/SPARK, which are set to start making strides later into this year, and further into 2023 (strangely enough, right at that 10 year mark he brought Sybase to $66 a share from nothing). They're already heavily tied too many major EV partnerships, and drone partnerships, anticipating this software.

The earnings report was ""lackluster"", but it was explained that they are selling off almost all of their phone patents (as they're completely leaving that space), and the payment plans for them are long-term; so they won't see a huge sudden revenue from them, but instead a steady stream...and all of that planning is to help roll out the aforementioned programs on time. People here were just disappointed because they were expecting some crazy multi-billion dollar revenue from the FB lawsuit to appear instantly, and moon the stock to $50+ overnight...but that's just plain unrealistic.

Idk, I just find it hard to believe that a complete re-brand behind John Chens proven track record, isn't going to net big gains in the future. In my mind it's similar to something like Cohen with Gamestop.

IVY would literally need to be a complete flop, or never release for some inexplicable reason, for it to stay at this point."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"A smart play would be to average down.  This discounted price right now is worth it in the long run. BB reminds me of Burry's (Bale) quote “I may have been early, but I'm not wrong.”"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hell, I feel for you. Hope it doesn't fuck your mind up regularly. We all have those ""what could have been"" stories, but that was pretty significant. On the other hand, do you think you could have held everything to 90+? I doubt it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lesson learned. Buy stock you like, never sell. Got it."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck I thought I had it bad. I had 108 shares at $10 and sold at $13. I’m sorry man.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gaining back 4% when you lose 10% yesterday is a snooze. 

$BB is a huge disappointment."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats the communication between those cars using QNX and BB? Are you sure these cars are sending or streaming that data? I don't think they are.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That $BB is looking like a great discount right now because they’re one of the leaders in American telecommunications/5G/Jarvis AI Techbology aka infrastructure help My $BB?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think so. It's just gotta be tough to hold faith after losing two thirds.

That's kind of funny from a profit point of view I think, however I thing that there's a place for a third player in the cellular phone/software scene, we are forced to choose between to players now a days and the biggest difference between them is monogamy vs gang bang, one say I'll screw you and make sure no one else do and the other is welcoming everyone else to join in, if BB can Ofer cellular phone/ software that offered more privacy even at the expense of less apps I think I'll be intrigued by that"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting hammered today :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Mine too! I sold it for like $7 back in June of last year. I have made money on options since then but damn I should have just thrown all my money into their stock!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CGC isn’t the play
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely. Not sure ACB is still in business. Leadership has been the worst. Wouldn’t touch it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Which share will be worth more when the merger hits APHA or TLRY?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! I feel same way...holding CURLF for 2 years and APHA for almost 5 years..🪴🍃
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. And I get down voted for this. Makes no sense
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They def can't buy a big 4 MSO, however, a merger with almost any MSO would make sense for both sides as it would create a global cannabis leader since eventually MSO's want access to other countries, which TilAphria will have assets in 16 countries"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLRY, bc APHA won't exist, only .838 of it will."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,CURLF is of ☝️my fav. You’ll do well.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess I'll explain my reason for supporting it. ACB currently operates in 25 countries, second largest cannabis company globally. It's currently supplying experimental cannabis to France for it's new medical cannabis program ([https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/27/aurora-cannabis-and-tilray-to-supply-experimental/](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/27/aurora-cannabis-and-tilray-to-supply-experimental/)).

&#x200B;

A lot of people often talk about the negatives in it's leadership and stock dilution but lack the understanding of what's going on. It needs to generate cash in order to expand Cannabis is a growing market you can't just expect them to make money right away what is most important for the future is how wide it can expand and it's production line, ACB has actively taken measures to expand both of these, the leadership thing is concerning but the current CEO Miguel Martin has experience and connections with other CBD companies.

&#x200B;

Aurora reported positive revenue growth, year on year but a lower operating income and net income. Recently we've seen ACB cut off and sell some locations to lower this operating cost. I personally believe ACB has the best chance of any of the Cannabis companies to grow just because of how large they have expanded globally.

&#x200B;

Just for disclosure purposes im 1000 @ 10.80"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Good point!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lighter volume today ahead of Good Friday break for TLRY and APHA making any substantial moves up unlikely.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a believer until being burned over and over by scam battley and the gang. The board was taking enormous salaries in comparison to the companies revenue. They just waste money constantly. I won't touch it again I learned my lesson.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel you buddy, however much of the board has left since 2019. If I get burnt out then it's entirely on me. Don't know why I was downvoted for my opinion on the stock."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It should get you in cheaper...you just have to do the math day before merger and if it's less value for .8381 of a share then you sell APHA and buy TLRY...I think the gap will hold enough that you get a small 1-2% discount but that could change and go the other way.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Down votes on reddit are weird

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah as everyone knows CDN companies are not allowed to sell to the US market and vice versa. I dont think its ever been done in fact. The countries are in a dire feud ever since Canada put up that 300 foot ice wall.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah so we both stand to make the tendies. WONDERFUL!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) No company is moving weed across international borders.  Not until Federal Legalization. Which won't happen before Federal Decriminalization. Which won't happen for a few years, at least.

2) All the better to keep those ice-zombie-Moose bastards out.

&#x200B;

P.S. For the record, I'm bullish on APHA and have some shares, but my personal reasons have nothing to do with NY state or U.S. federal drug policy..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The states will legalize weed nationwide guaranteed. We will see how fast but I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any weed stocks rights now. That industry is still in its infancy and I expect it to be massive in a few years.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy FUCK. I've been holding shares since January, but never understood the full extent of what is happening until now (and I still definitely don't know it all, I just know enough). I never really grasped the gravity of this situation but this shit is fucking huge. I'm just some idiot who bought in on a YOLO because of some convincing DD that said the stock could potentially blast off past 100. Now that I've finally read through most of the DD I've found on the situation I realize that these dumb fuck hedge funds could theoretically blow up the entire system because of their greed and malpractice. I held because I thought I knew enough, shorts have to cover and it'll be glorious when they do. But this shit is a whole nother level."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Repeating myself again, but notice these $12 deep ITM calls being bought... ask yourself: **WHY would anyone buy these??**

**The Deep ITM Calls are actually Melvin, Shitadel and friends using them to conceal FTDs.**

* Explanation: synthetic longs can be used to conceal short interest.
* Purchase a *s*ynthetic long position, (they aren't actual shares) but you can use it to report a *net even position* since you're **short the real shares** and **long synthetic options.**

**If I borrowed 100 bananas , rather than buy back bananas I owe: instead I'll buy a coupon (call options) that says ""I will buy 100 bananas."" It appears I've covered the bananas I owe... withought actually having bought a single fucking banana.**"

Take my love, diamond hand  
Take me where I cannot stand  
I don't care, I'm still free  
You can't take GME from me.

  
Take me out past the moon  
Hedges shorting to their doom  
Burn the land and boil the sea  
You can't take GME from me.

  
Leave the hedges where they lay  
They'll never see another day  
Now '08's just a memory  
You can't take GME from me.

  
I feel tendies reaching out  
I hear its song without a doubt  
I still hear and I still see  
That you can't take GME from me.

  
Met some apes, found diamond hands  
We like the stock, this was not planned  
There's no place I can be  
Since I've found WSB

  
And you can't take GME from me.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know. I need to see if they got autopay so I can just not worry about it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I used aapl pay this time which is linked to my cc so I should get them points this time. I need to use my cc more I’m such in the habit of using my debit tho like a pleb
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it.  But there are definitely other places with better pizza.  Most of them are not pizza places.

I grew up in Chicago and I used to be able to order Rosati, Giordanos, Lou malnadi's, etc.  Now that was some damn pizza.

Dominos is acceptable."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They got good crust.

And I will fite u over the cheese bread sticks.

Even *before* adding the petroleum dressing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I forgot about that.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting. Saved it read again tomorrow bc I’m too tired right now
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. ^(delete tho mkt cap smol)
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah this one went public on the 25th
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Close your blinds then dude it’s like you’re asking for it.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it wasn’t that interesting - I bet a good portion of straight girls have had the same situation.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I already asked if it was theycallmeryan but figured I’d try again if it was missed?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tall for a bunny anyway 🤷🏼‍♂️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone downvoted you and it wasn’t me 🤨 

But I’m not mean you’re mean"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess I need to relinquish my 3 sub mod positions... I’m east
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Which makes this the new thread and that the containment zone 🧠
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised it took this long
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly around this time it’s tolerable the kids are all tucked in at this point
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What if I told you my name was Tom tho 😳.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Redoing now . Sigh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah he should get it back because it’s how we recognize him.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we do a hostage trade via flair now? I want donkey punch to stick around. 🥺
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Posted and included my notes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell Parker what?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I skimmed it mostly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg in highschool is when the purest gay relationships happen because you two are discovering yourselves 🥰
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Futch is a mix of femme and butch, it's what Carrie is.  So futch for futch would mean she was into another futch woman."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh so you were more femme in highschool?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice try yiu aren’t getting me
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,LCID. Why?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦🏼‍♂️ not that this guy is a gay mod that starts with *T*

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"WHY DID YOU DO THIS TO ME 😭😭😭

NOW I’LL NEVER HAVE A CHANCE WITH AOC 😭😭😭"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Close enough 🤷🏻‍♀️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What about this one
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Cesspool? 😦
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than a quarantine zone 🥴
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,How about a top and bottom ten? It’s the middle guys I’m struggling with tbh. Some of y’all never talk on WSB or you delete your history more than Rich

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just went on new, crypto shill, easy ban"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said I have the urges, I never said I don’t act on them.  Plenty of people breaking rules for bans to go around."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking hate that shit. It’s not a loss if you hodl it as it crater below the Earths crust 🙄
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The say yes guy had a post up for 15 minutes.  I think you missed one.  Already permad him again.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh how kind of you. u/Richtofin115 ‘s avatar is already nood- he prolly will serve as tribute

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That and being under 25 is still why I haven’t bought my dream car. Way to damn expensive especially for what I want 🥴. The Prius will do. 

ALSO: get a dash cam and take a defensive driving class and tell your insurer they’ll give a nice discount for that too."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can PM me w/ questions anytime. 

But get a realtor through Redfin. They’ll give you access to pre-market listings like any realtor, charge less than they would normally and give you a check back in the end. 

I own a few properties for both business and pleasure..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck me, I just keep on finding out more and more people here live in the ATL area."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,With either morals of gold or the dirtiest hoe of all of us
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The DD you were sharing! I knew you were bullish but damn - shits about to pop
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well Vancouver has a lot of foreign investors. I’ve read stories about students owning a $10M house. Weekends the downtown core is like a ghost town with empty apartments. There is now a very modest tax for I think it’s empty properties or foreign investors (same thing) and that drove some to invest in Toronto.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No I think I have but it was such a disappointing experience I chose to forget it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair point now you’ve got me excited 🥰
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"basically ICLN and INRG are going to be rebuilt and lots of new tickers added.  Tickers that run up while part of ICLN are going to get sold off heavily, like PLUG.  Tickers that need to get added, like NEE, will see about $400mm in new buys on or around 4/19."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh gotcha, the hydrogen-ish one?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife wanted you to watch...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well generally speaking if home values are going up its because people want to live there.  Home prices in my area are not going up because the population is in decline.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,_I_ thought it was interesting 🥺
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Flair checks out
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I said was their username starts with t, that narrows it down enough for any further questions I will neither confirm nor deny"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🥺 we don’t down vote here 🥺. Where is u/callnput to give us insightful poems to help us remember that we are best buns when we need him!??

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know if mentions go out if you edit it tho. Might need to post a child comment tagging em.

Worst case, they get twice the notifications ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I got it lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok. But it stays pink.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First word in their name is the.   That should narrow it down to 2
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,u/memetron9000 knows who gave the flair and it starts with t and that’s a lot of mods
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just impressed you were able to read it at all, there's no pictures!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well we discovered I was straight and she was not
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah ok thnx
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess looking back she was more feminine but that’s just from a personality thing. Like I took woodworking.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🙃
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Noooo you’re supposed to say... CCI
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhh sorry yeah he’s in 14th place

We figured out the mystery. It’s the ice cream man"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that like Ritalin? I burn through high doses of Ritalin in less than 2 hours. I do XR because I’ll forget to redose
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It does hit different. It’s helped with my coffee problem and now I sleep like a baby
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Her heart belongs to Jesus
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess he got demoted 😔
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s back bro
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Got demoted
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😡😡😡 You probably don’t even have a wikifeet page
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.  A fun place to be tho.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That works, and you can update it as you go.  I don’t think there’s a rule against ties tbf."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like pretty good advice.  You could even write the letter in scratchy red ink, same color as a heart."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Might want to inverse yourself
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Make sense.  I didn’t think you’d be asking for it since you’re like 42...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happened to the truth shall set you FREEEE or is it REEEEEEE? 

I forget..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet you only did a 3 day 🤭.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,~~He unbanned us all I think~~
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear there’s another place to post grievances about r/fuckwsbmods called r/fuckthefuckwsbsmodsmods
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there one for the OG r/fuckwsbmods members too? I’ve been there since day one.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's BlackBerry, they aren't going bankrupt.  He'll hold it for a year and be back to where he started."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh. But it's my whiskey time.....
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's a capital idea. I just hope those aren't the last words I utter on WSB, lol"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s true. He’s also the only person to know my age and promised to keep my secrets safer than the secrets he kept for u/four1six_
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dunno, seems fair to me 😊"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Tied for last with Fanny
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in last place though so it won’t hold up much ☹️

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Parker with the big brain today
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fr? I’d do the defensive driving class. Just don’t know how I feel about a dash cam video still.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😟
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup read this too. I’m unsure if anything is priced in at this point though
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I don’t know much or any above hydrogen clean energy but it seems like it could pop
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That does not narrow it enough
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s happened before. I’ll suddenly notice all my stuffs been downvoted too - someone’s salty in here sometimes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not the count of the vote that counts, feeling in the heart beats them all! I called in an early night yesterday 🤗"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What else you got? I thought you were one in 🤫
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Soxl, fizzy, retardbets. I still can’t tell if I should be insulted or honored to have been asked to be mod there"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,We’d lose foot 😩
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Open your mind 💆🏼‍♂️.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You do get them if they link you in an edit as long it’s fewer than three
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fine
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit had dick rules man
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok but his flair is “Cpt. Donkey Punch”  🥺👉👈

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I had to google to confirm
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo V, that’s fucked up bruh..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,... ice cream man?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, similar to Ritalin.  It works fine for me for the most part."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😱
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,#🥳
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That is true I don't
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the pinned?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds good. I left mods with less access out too since they may not be fairly rated.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,🩸
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m 69 but look 22 and chiseled
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I usually do for crypto/microcap, unless I’m unnecessarily pissed and it’s bad shilling/account was only made to shill then permanent."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, I just posted. Finally, justice."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I never got a thank you btw. Had to go through r/fuckFannyPackPhantom
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm shadowbanned. Please deposit enough karma so I can comment.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s this one, they’re synonymous"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The long game 😎
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But then he's taking time-value losses.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What if we bribed the mods with whiskey?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't you 35
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys have secrets from bunbun? 🥺

Et tu u/four1six ?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your secret is still safe, along with that other one from earlier/yesterday 🤭. You’re the only one I told how old I am so you gucci"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You think it’s fair that u/fannypackphantom and I are tied for last?☹️
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😨🥲
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,What's mine
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The cop is a furry?? (Is it still a furry if the animal doesn't have fur 🤔).

I feel like an octopus in the bedroom would definitely fulfill a masculine role though what with those tentacles if you catch my drift."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m an old soul in a young body 👀
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah tell them. Lol it’s peace of mind more than anything. I still drive like I’m a race car driver I just don’t do it while in traffic. I got a car totaled and got off thanks to bystanders. I want more than that tho.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it's your own dash cam so unless you're consistently running down pedestrians (and therefore ending up in lots of criminal investigations) you don't have to share the recordings unless it helps you."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me neither. I'm kinda skeptical on the business-viability of hydrogen right now so I've been staying away. Tech/science-wise I think it will have it's uses in the future but atm I feel like the businesses are just running by on the novelty factor right now.

Of course, like I said I don't know enough about the business/industrial side of it. I could also be totally wrong sooooo"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That's literally the only way I was able to afford anything. Can't get financing because of student loans so I had to do it myself. $10k + Stonks = 🏠
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s only 8 mods who’s username starts with T, only 6 of which have flair perms."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder who it is? It’s not me even tho you hurt me sometimes
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Subs wise? I’d do - technically 9. I’ve made some for random people and they ditched so I got em back. Need to delete some
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah idk if I’d mention that one haha
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Or we all go to fizzy 🥵
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife and I have become best buds. She said it’s Tim
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok.

Figured that was too advanced for Reddit to handle!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,First word there is they not the
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I know all the mod names now. Which should be impressive because 2 weeks ago I knew 5
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm sure the lack of pictures helps in that case!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. We did for a while, she ended up having a kid actually and then a few years ago she was in a car accident. Which is why I didn’t mention it before."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. She got this new girl named Chenille or something
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He gave u/parker2020 the scat porn flair. I’ve had to negotiate with u/memetron9000 for 2 days to find out because Parker quits fast
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I wished it had worked. It was so much cheaper. I’d just crash and get an awful headache
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t have one... yet
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,😒
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This thread is where you go to chill, if I’m ever in pinned it’s probably to ban people for some rule violation or another."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a cesspool, but not a fun place to be.  That’s the difference."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly like that, yes."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s the worst mod honestly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He's not taking literal time decay though that would bring him down to zero.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhhhh
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No just sometimes he tricks me and the. Screenshots statements and holds them over my head
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Never 🥺
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Please never tell V1 or I’ll never be free
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, just that I'm 3rd :)

And that Remy is 1st. Seems like a no brainer there."

It isn’t fair

I just defended u/VactionLover1

And I want my flair..."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah not me either. 

🕵🏻‍♀️"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well damn. I need to step it up.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol yeah prob not. I became an approved member there during Christmas break when it was started after doing a v v dumb shitpost then modded a couple months ago randomly
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not enough fizz lovers 😒 we just have to boot the bots somehow. Maybe get some ladders
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well fucking Guh ok. 

The icecreammansbro2"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no :(
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Waaa lmao
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He's on the floor kissing my toe bro. You jelly?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I only saw your comment before the edit - I would agree 😊
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, not theta decay, but opportunity cost for sure. Every second his cash is languishing in BB it's not sitting in an appreciating asset like... almost anything else.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. They also have a great play in the IoT market which is evolving about as quickly as cloud did in 2015-2017, which helped drive Amazon’s price tremendously.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,At least I got my chicken! One of the walking legends of cyber era
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin call isn’t on Netflix. I did watch Big Short on Netflix though.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the people were real, thought thats not how it actually went down because its a film, but yeah I thought the people were based on real individuals."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you fill me in?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Patrick Bateman is a personification for society at the time the OG book was written, and slightly reinterpreted/recontextualized in the movie. It’s worth noting that the movie was directed by a woman, who, with the film, took Bret Easton Ellis’ original critique of society at large, and lightly pointed out that it was in fact rich, white men and misogynist/patriarchal culture at the root of these problems. I love the movie because she does this with very little effort, the movie doesn’t really deviate that much from the heart of the book in any important sense."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The monologues definitely struck me as they sounded like they were mostly transcribed from interviews and not written by the hollywood hacks that wrote most of the dialogue.  (Not that the dialogue was so bad for the time period, just very, movie-ish.)

The monologues had more depth, efficiency, and a ring of truth.

Sort of like the writing in got first season versus final season."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like on the movie and kevin spacey and house of cards? No, that’s a lot of time. Watch house of cards then Google Kevin spacey and then watch baby driver"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There's the other interpretation too. Where he has killed a bunch of people and everyone around him is to oblivious to notice or are themselves motivated to cover it up. Eg the realtor
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I partly agree except I don't think it was a race commentary as much as just showing the irony that psychopathy itself lends to his material success
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not the bees!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Office space was one of those movies that I thought was funny until I started working in an office.
My life is miserable because of that movie."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nouvelle Vague started in 58, bruh.  Easy rider was 69."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,That scene did not in fact rely on green screen. They literally created and then destroyed a styrofoam 'bank lobby' with the human actors filmed right on that set
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The visuals and that punch of the music - the way they synchronized it was beautiful.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a buy to me!

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It's been a day and you still haven't replied to the people asking for a source or how you know this. I'm guessing it's pretty safe to assume you were full of shit by this point?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Android autocorrect man
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No because the information is always historical. That's why people pay $24K/an for a Bloomberg Terminal. To get a slight news advantage over the retail crowd,"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,T'was just a mere joke.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks good on the resume (for some places) and can open doors for you. The networking opportunities are also likely a positive if you're a careerist. So yes, money, but maybe some intangibles as well.

Disclosure: I wanted to work there many years ago"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,To be honest its not even about the money. I just want to make lots of money.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,But buying puts and then dumping the stock till your puts become ITM would only end them up owning the same stock again...
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"WSJ article is a good source but beyond paywall - [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704201404574590453176996032](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704201404574590453176996032)

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Biggie Smalls?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an arm of the US federal government, the SEC is ""supposed"" to protect the interests of the American public, for example from predatory financial institutions like Goldman Sachs.

Unfortunately, once institutions like Goldman Sachs stopped trying to steal from the state, but instead, turned the state itself into an instrument of theft, the SEC now does the opposite - it protects financial institutions from the public by acting as a smoke screen...

But I think that's a different discussion from the one we are having here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, the go to college after highschool during a recession because literally everyone says ""if you don't go to college, you'll end up making nothing"" 

Go to college get a bunch of debt.

Finally after months get a job that has very little benefits and guess what? Your debt to income ratio is already 3:1!

You think okay if I buckle down I can pay this off in 3 years no sweat!!!! Oh wait taxes, oh wait you have to pay medical expenses and take unpaid leave because American health insurance is overpriced garbage and your employer doesn't cover anything to save money. 

Oh wait your parents get sick and lose their job so now your supporting yourself, your parents, your sisters dog, while supporting Fannie mae. Your job skips you on a promo because? ""We just don't have the funds"" as the entire business unit hits their 37% profitability goals. 

Now you're working paycheck to paycheck, never saying for retirement. And guess what? You see big businesses get PERMANENT TAX BREAKS. 

I know we're constantly called the ""entitled"" generation but is it because we just want what our grandparents wanted? What they told us was possible? They took om debt which we'd eventually have to pay for.... 

Rant over"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats whats great about it. You either win or lose. Personally i think i can outperform them. Unfortunately, i didnt go to Harvard or whatever."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was under the impression the stories of the work culture are widespread already (kind of well known at the ivy I went to). I think it was in a Fortune article where it was described as a place where ""if you are very smart and willing to work very hard, you can earn a lot of money"", which seemed to me like an honest way to put it.

LOL @ ""Looks like I missed you"" post-its on people's workstations/doors left at like 4am stories though."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is the laws, written by lobbyists and greased with donations. Shut down GS and new (or the same) bad actors will just form another company and continue the same types of bad activities.

Ferocious competition is one thing - the markets and the economy at large is a competition. However fraud is quite another.  I have no idea about the veracity of the claims here. Perhaps the real lesson is caveat emptor when dealing with GS.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"right. the only way to properly shutter them is to legislate their job away. 

It'd be great."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been on here at least a dozen times, but [here](https://i.imgur.com/NOWAWCH.jpg)"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I'm just saying that currently banks literally loan access to capital and provide growth. That's not bad in and of itself. But the fact that they have a monopoly and unfair practices is a huge issue.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Banks are about to be dead thanks to defi and related technology. And good riddance!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which book, because the one I remember reading didnt called it a traveler's bank and pilgrimage trust,  (but it was a texas broad swatch European history text so it being super dumbed down is likely) and it actually being called goldsmithing sounds like that would be an awesome book to read."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,are my Jan '22 calls gonna be OK?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure but they pay dividends. It's a value stock, which generally keeps their stock price relatively stable."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,mRNA vax has been researched since the early 2000s and was scaled back due to costs in the 2010s. Covid changed everything so everyone went into promising yet risky mRNA tech so to speak but its hardly some new voodoo science...

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,4/20
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why isn’t anyone talking about the short interest spiking from 14% to 36% on fintel.io!? This could be big if we break resistance.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you sold for $20 you can get back in cheaper rn. Agree that it's by no means a done deal regarding US. They do have exposure to Canada and Europe too. If US legislation fails and it dips hard I'll be looking to pick some up for cheap.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not doing either, just holding apha."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wah!! Honestly I did not expect 100+ responses in less than 24 hours. Same in other reddit channels as well.  Jim Lebenthal a value analyst on CNBC halftime is recommended CLF few months back when it was $8 and since then I have been buying and even bought yesterday. 

And if u look at CLF guidance today  they gave blow out guidance in my view and stock up decent 16% today as well.

pete najarian ..options guy on halftime also bought more CLF calls today. Combination of steel prices and demand is what the reason. Not trying to sell..but fyi

US Steel/concrete been buying since my first video a month back.  Understand ""buy rumor and sell news"". I am buying these companies any day and selling some covered calls for protections, compared to SPACs or meme stocks."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always average down if you saved any gunpowder like everyone should. You only lose if you throw in the towel or if it goes to zero.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup! I bought some BB today. Hodl with your Ape hands, you big gorilla 🦍"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This company is a great (ok maybe longer term)investment. But I think the results will be better than most expect possible 10X. They’re not a cellphone company anymore but people still associate them with that. They’ll be in most EV’s and their security contracts are huge.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you sell CC?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like you can afford 300 more!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,oof.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like others said, it has potential for a long haul winner. During that time, maybe sell short term calls to scrape back?"

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You are still retarded.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,that's why there is so much negative sentiments for the past couple months despite given every good news every 2nd day.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought therefore I am
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I now know you are not as retarded as I once thought you were once.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re not going to lose it just hold it
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 5 more today to average down to $12.85, might buy some more tomorrow but I’m worried haha. I’ve had $300 buying power for the last few weeks and haven’t bought anything out of fear, I always buy stocks that dip after I buy them 😂"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Same with Durect and TherapeuticsMD. As soon as I bail...Ocugen is another as is PAYA. Cheap and no one buys them. Makes you feel like THE sucker😡
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think there's still exist that negative sentiments from past experience investors from long ago, looking for some other new companies they have not heard of. When IVY rolls out the world will know, and if you ask me I like to keep ourselves low for now until we're truly ready to execute. Those shorties will be so sorry they couldn't get much richer than they wish for."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,There are a shitload of companies doing that right now. BB always has some good news about them. I wonder when fundamentals start to matter to the suits? 🍌🦍
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Unsustainable? But you had no thoughts about unsustainability when it rocketed up 240% in a week? BB was shit hot back in 2005.. ..now not so much.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,$14.94 here

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way

True they aren’t in the business of hardware, but they’ve made huge leaps in the software services and OS sector.  If you can only understand that BB doesn’t sell phones anymore and think that their going to die because they don’t, then we’re at an impasse."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,i bought some at $10.45 thinking of buying some more around $7
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I am not holding bb full disclosure... AMC/GME mün
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it this way. You bought 100 shares of AAPL at $140. It's currently trading at $122, which is ATM. 

If you tried to sell a call for 4/16 at $140 for AAPL, you'd barely break even and you'll make just $8 out of that.  If you sell a call at the current ATM price of $122.5, you'd net $253.

Now imagine you went out and bought 100 shares of AAPL at the market price of $122. Your average cost/share is $131. Great, you can sell 2 CCs for $32 at a strike price of $131. 

What if you went and bought 300 shares of AAPL at $122? Now, your average cost per share is $126.50. Now you can sell 4 CCs for a strike price of $127 at $86 each - or even spread them out between $125-129 (depending on your appetite for risk).

What if you went and bought 900 shares of AAPL at $122? Your average cost basis is now $123.80. You can sell 10 ATM CCs for $183 each or do a spread. 

Ideally, you want to bring the price down to as close to the current market price as possible - but only if you believe in the stock.

If AAPL's price goes up, you are guaranteed to make not only a profit on the underlying stock but you also get into more and more comfortable ATM territory and can therefore collect higher premiums.

Now let's do the math. 900 shares of AAPL at $122 + 100 shares of AAPL at $140 = $123,800. Let's say you can keep wheeling for a year at an average of $180 ever 2 weeks. That's $180 x 10 x 52/2 = $46,800. That's above and beyond whatever price AAPL increases by.

However, now let's imagine the opposite. Where AAPL keeps tanking. If AAPL hits $100, getting a strike price of $124 and above would be hell and the premiums would be peanuts. Yeah, you invested $123K homie but you really would be getting those $8 premiums. That's $8 x 10 x 52/2 = $2080. And on top of that, if your underlying keeps losing value, you are also losing money. At some point, it doesn't make any sense at all to keep up the CCs.

So if you choose to average down, you need to figure out which of those two scenarios is more likely. If it's AAPL with its $2T+ valuation and history of innovation and incredible quarters of revenue and earnings, it's easy. Sure, there maybe a few bears but in the long run I know I'll win the game. All I need to do is wait for a quarter and then I can continue the wheel. If I do the CCs for two years, then I'll pretty much recoup all my investment - that's on top of whatever profit I made with the underlying, not to mention annual dividends of 0.67% (82c x 1000 = $820/year).

But if it's with a company that's a bit more sketchy, you just painted yourself into a corner. Not only can you not sell CCs to be profitable, your underlying also loses money.

So that's why it's important to figure out whether or not averaging down makes any sense."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sounds like I'm full of it but here goes....when I was a kid still in HS I took my first stats class on the way to a corporate finance/accounting career.  One of my first jobs was as a book keeper for a rich small business guy (I had a CPA auditing my work) and I started trading as a young retard.  My mom helped me open my account.  All these guys were into the stock market, real estate etc.

At 15 I developed an idea I called channel analysis.  Essentially the same idea that later in the 80's made John Bollenger famous with his bands....stocks run in a channel...the bell curve ...two standard deviations etc.  It's the same idea that later was on the Net at [ChannelingStocks.com](https://ChannelingStocks.com).  Let's just say like their old commercials use to....if you do it right you can retire early.  I did at 40.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's really not that complicated and your broker does the math.  There's two important things to look for early on: theta neutral where your short calls cover the extrinsic value of your long calls and this is the minimum I shoot for on a position that isn't a yolo.  I don't pay for time.

The next one is risk-free.  That's the position where your short calls completely pay off your long positions.  It's all gravy but you have to work for it, typically by legging into spreads.

Otherwise, there's just straight theta gang where you get paid for your time.  Low rewards but regular and predictable.  It's all a sliding scale of risk analysis.  You balance risk with fun and pretty quickly grow numb to huge risks and have more fun. That's WSB.

You really don't want to get too complicated with your strategy.  If you have a complicated mess of different holdings in one underlying, then you at least probably have a simple strategy like laddering in a new trade every day to make a lot of smaller bets on a singular underlying.  Like selling 500+ day expiration SPY puts.  Small individually but guaranteed to spit out a small piece regularly.  And, importantly, easy to understand when you step back and look at it as a whole using the Greeks."

> You really don't want to get too complicated with your strategy. 

The simpler the strategy the easier to see how it is going and to react when needed.

But that's sometimes the most complicated part of all.

Yup, Wheel and so on. IMHO for the normal run until you find something really interesting to YOLO in is not a bad idea.

I got in VIAC and DISCA at pretty good entry points, but I think most people are just waiting to see if banks are done selling (rumor is they haven't), it could take 1-2 weeks to see it really start to move, by then it should return to a much higher level, but nowhere near where it was. Both stocks have been downgraded so maybe a 30% gain on both within 6 weeks is more likely than a return to the top."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it staying flat isn't bad given the high short interest (around 20%). It seems buyers are stepping to stabilize. It will be a massive short squeeze if/ when it happens.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree, I think they overspent on acquisitions and improvements to theaters. I don’t think they fully got the chance to capitalize on their self investments given when Covid struck. It was at the peak time when they were making improvements to their theater infrastructure by way of improving theater rooms with new seats, liquor licensing and installing alcohol vending services, as well new improvements to screens and architectural upgrades. I think when you remove debt from the equation it makes AMC and very profitable company. That’s why a strategy from the company to eliminate debt swiftly is part of my thesis. I look forward to Q1 earnings to see if I’m correct in my thinking."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or when GameStop themselves decide to sell to raise capital.  At that point, it’s all over.  Luckily that is unlikely until the price starts to climb to higher levels like $300+.  If GME hits $300, GameStop will sell to raise funding for their turnaround.

Hopefully, I’m wrong because I love and own the stock ."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had a similar thought and I asked why we shouldn't expect this with everyone saying the floor is 1MM. The answer I was given is that at this point most of the loaned out shares are from institutions, so for them to sell, their shares need to be returned, which means purchased back( likely from retail). Over the past couple weeks we've seen many many posts encouraging users to move away from Robinhood, switch to cash accounts or expressly forbid lending of shares where applicable. This hypothesis seems to be supported through other posts claiming new members at more reputable brokers are waaaaaaaaaay up. It makes sense to me and gives me more hope we will see GME pass 10k/share realistically."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"do you know if any wash taxes can be applied even if you had a net loss for the year?

example: you have 75k or something disallowed wash sale but a net loss of 10k total on the final statement"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same shares or something equally equivalent.  I know this sub doesn't buy boomer ETFs, but you also can not sell SPY for a loss then immediately buy VOO.  You could, however, sell SPY/VOO and buy VTI or vice versa."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Because wash sale has nothing to do with net profit. It’s all about the timing of your purchase after you sell for loss. And really it all depends on the last transaction and if that 75k is all from a single wash sale. If your last sell was still a wash then it gets moved to next year, and you will owe taxes on your gains. Because you technically don’t have a 10k loss then. That’s what happened to the kid in the article. You just need one gain after a wash sale to set it right. I’m not a tax advisor btw."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see, I guess I don't fully understand what gets taxed in general, in my example I was referring to a bunch of different stocks versus one big one, but reading more on here!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have an example in my reply to the other guy you can check out. I’m also reformatting my first reply to make more sense. Wash sale is per stock. But if you lose the loss on one stock, then your total net profit goes up. You bank big on GME, cool. You buy AMC and sell for loss. Sucks but alright. End of year you pay tax on the profit. What if you have no profit? Well if you have a job that pays income, you can take 3k of the money you lost on stocks and deduct against your income. The rest can rollover to the next year. 

But let’s say you buy AMC back right away after selling for a loss? Now we are talking wash sale. And now, that first loss, gets added to cost basis of this second time you buy. And you have to sell it before end of year. Whether for gain or loss. If you don’t, then it’s like the first loss didn’t happen so you’d only have that big GME gain for taxes even if you technically are down for the year."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The -3.50 goes into your cost basis with a wash sale, so the +3.50 becomes 0.00."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"They use 3D printing for the engines, which are made of Inconel, the carbon fiber is just the body. Also they appear to plan to switch from carbon fiber to metal for their next rocket, Neutron."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Look in the long term I’m very very bullish on 3D printing especially in terms of construction. I just think in the short term we are going to watch a reversal on it as a means of production as the industry follows elon to steel. The steel being used on starship is incredibly malleable and easy to work with in earth temperatures. A hand full of skilled welders would be able to compete with the best 3D print currently available. Also since the industry is going through massive leaps in innovation as it goes public there will be a rising need for improvisation in design and production. Humans are much more flexible in terms of variation of construction then 3D printing’s highly regimented production cycle. 3D print makes more sense once the industry has innovated all it can and the technology of rockets becomes common place.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elon never 3D printed the body, just the engines, and the engines aren't being made out of steel, so I don't believe you know what you're talking about"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,He 3D printed the fuel tank he made out of carbon fiber for starship right before he made the jump to steel. He literally said carbon fiber and 3D printing were taking to long. Yes I do know what the fuck I’m talking about.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That never flew, and Falcon was never 3D printed. When you talk about SpaceX and 3D printing, most people mean the Merlin engines"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I’m not talking about engines. Engines are a well understood technology. There isn’t a need to innovate them, thus making them good candidates for 3D printing. Everything the fuck else on the rocket is subject to change, heavily, for decades to come."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have it backwards, the tanks are the simplest part of the rocket that won't change and the engines are finicky and complicated. That's why SpaceX keeps crashing their Starship prototypes. Their new engines haven't had all the issues worked out yet. 

Rocket Lab uses Carbon Fiber and 3D printing but not how you understand it. They 3D print the engines and the tanks are carbon fiber."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,See ur the one who doesn’t know what ur talking about. The reason starships have been crashing is because air bubbles (helium) keeps getting into the fuel lines as it does the final swing on landing. Every single SN# has had a differently design fuel tank and header take as they try to solve the air problem. The engines being used were built months and months ago and all exactly the same. I literally watch live streams of Boca chica and watch the construction of each SN# rocket. You can literally see the difference In piping and Assembly of the tanks. I’m way to nerdy for u to win this conversation bro.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I studied Aerospace Engineering in college but go off dude. If steel was so supremely better for fuel tank tech then how come Rocket Lab, who uses CF tanks has only had 2 failures, and SpaceX has not yet had a successful mission with these steel tanks?

So once again how does having a private middle man really benefit the average consumer of healthcare? Would you rather a private company provide you police insurance?

Also you are spewing a lot of misinformation about Canada’s system. For one you don’t have to wait 3 months for healthcare they treat you based on need. If you are deemed to medically need something you get it ASAP. If it is an elective surgery they put you on a wait list. Also once again if you want to skip the line you can pay under the table to do so. But at least if you are less well off you know you will get care.

>Overall, 2060 referrals initiated between January 2014 and December 2016 were included in the analysis. **The median national wait time 1 was 78 days** (interquartile range \[IQR\] of 34 to 175 days). The shortest waits were observed in Saskatchewan (51 days; IQR = 23 to 101 days) and British Columbia (59 days; IQR = 29 to 131 days), whereas the longest were in New Brunswick (105 days; IQR = 43 to 242 days) and Quebec (104 days; IQR = 36 to 239 days). Median wait time 1 varied substantially among different specialty groups, with the longest wait time for plastic surgery (159 days; IQR = 59 to 365 days) and the shortest for infectious diseases (14 days; IQR = 6 to 271 days).

Are you saying the Canadian government is lying about their own wait times?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The existence of hundreds of private health insurance providers each with dozens if not hundreds of plans and many sets of billing codes to sort through is what creates the administrative bloat. If you have a universal payer of care (the government) they have one set of codes and can negotiate one set of pricing across hospitals and hospitals systems. Also the governments in other countries are allowed to cross compare costs by having all the data aggregated and an ability to do lump sum payments for hospitals (hospitals can say it costs X amount of dollars per year to run this and the government can pay X).

The simple existence of this massive unnecessary middleman is what causes this bloat. You can get rid of any and all regulations you want and simply having these massive private companies all having to bill and go back and forth in the system is what causes billing to be so much higher. You could do price controls and universal billing codes and other socialized regulations but that too still doesn’t get you to not having this massive administrative bloat. What value does your private plan provide you? Do you benefit in the US from Blue Cross Blue shield being a middle man? If the US took the money it spends on private insurance costs and spent it on a universal system it would be the best in the world with universal access. Instead we buy into the framing that countries spending 40-50% less having issues means that we gain much from a private system."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a doctor in Canada recommends you as high medical need then you skip the line, if you can wait as your condition isn’t urgent you wait (or you can pay to skip the line under the table). So no that number is accurate but it is only for no urgent patients. As far as police the example I bring up isn't privatizing police but rather paying for a public service (police or hospital) through a private intermediary in a complex web of private and public plans that create insane billing and insane administrative costs that adds no value and just drives up the costs."

>You can get rid of any and all regulations you want and simply having these massive private companies all having to bill and go back and forth in the system is what causes billing to be so much higher.

Canadians pay half the cost per person on healthcare but have on average a near 3 month wait time for specialists. If you think trading double the cost for 3 months of your life when you need medical care is worth it your insane

> Instead we buy into the framing that countries spending 40-50% less having issues means that we gain much from a private system.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Canada spent double the amount of money they do on their healthcare system their wait times likely would not exist while providing their citizens with universal affordable healthcare. You keep comparing the US to Canada but Canada spends 50% per-capita on healthcare and they have similar if not better outcomes with universal coverage. Also other systems have drastically less wait times and better outcomes while still being vastly cheaper. What value does having a private middle man offer you? 

If the US spent double per-capita what Canada spends per-citizen to provide healthcare to every citizen you would have very little wait times because the money would unlike the current system actually go towards providing care and not to paying people to figure out the billing codes, coverages and figuring out rates and plans. The US doesn't have the most doctors and hospital beds per-1000 people in the world. The UK which has a fully government run system has about the same if not slightly more hospital beds and doctors per-1000 people. 

The US could spend vastly less on administration and eliminate profit among other useless costs and put the money towards providing universal care and expanding the doctor and provider pool. Once again if the US had the best system why is infant mortality and other healthcare outcomes not even close to being the best? If your for profit middle man adds so much value why isn't the system better than above average despite being the most expensive by a long shot."

Doctors are not specialists, you dont understand the fundamental issue.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once again if Canada spent double on their healthcare they could pay doctors and specialists more and import more doctors. Money solves a lot of the supply issue in Canada but they don't want to raise taxes massively to import specialists and retain more specialists. Their health outcomes, failure rates and general rankings are even or slightly above the US despite spending 50% of the money the US does. If Canada doubled its spending they could pay more specialists, raise payouts to doctors and in general provide universal high quality. 

By your own admission you state Canada doesn't pay enough but then say their problem isn't money? Which one is it? Also your anecdote about your uncle is just that an anecdote. Many specialists in the US actually end up going bankrupt because they aren't really able to run their own businesses effectively because they weren't trained on how to administer a business. Regardless of that for every specialist that runs to the US for profit system there are many others (including a high school friend of mine) who stay in their countries universal systems to make less money but have to deal with less overhead and less time dealing with non-sense insurance. 

I can't find any data about specialists per 1,000 people, only physicians, if you can find actual data then I could support the idea that the US system has more specialists than any other universal system. Right now I can only go by physicians and hospital beds per 1,000 and the US ranks pretty mediocre in that respect despite spending the most money.

Just buy when it's at rock bottom. that's it. 

Nothing more to the calculus here."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember you calling the top with zoom puts, which printed for me. Whats your reasoning for this play?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a degen and there will always be sports and other degens in the world. Right now online sports betting is only available to 25% of the country and their earnings are incredible. Imagine more and more states legalize it? Draftkings is the next Amazon of sports betting. They make deals and aquire new assets almost every day I feel like
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if that’s the case and they have this cushy deal, why did the banks force the liquidation on themselves? Why did they call out Hwang and start this big payoff?"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did not hold any shares, but his creditors did. The deal he did works like this, the bank owns an underlying and does not like the risk, some idiot would like to have the upside of an underlying but lacks the capital to buy it ouright. So the idiot makes a deal, the bank pay's ythem when the underlying goes up, and the idiot pays the bank when the underlying goes down. They also pay a fee.

What happened here was, the underlying tanked, Archegos could not pay the bank, so the bank sold the underlying. Because the position of Archegos was so big (but spread over several banks) it tanked the underlying further."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look when you buy a call you controll the upside of 100 shares of the underlying with out ever owning them. Since your Broker, or Market Maker, or the r/thetagang trader on the other side of the call will want to hedge his position, they will buy shares of the underlying. 

Archegos did not buy calls, because you have to report calls, and they did not want to have to report positiosn. Instead they did something called a swap. It works like this, the bank owns an underlying and does  not like the risk, some idiot would like to have the upside of this underlying but lacks the capital to buy it ouright. So the idiot makes a  deal, the bank pay's them when the underlying goes up, and the idiot  pays the bank when the underlying goes down. They also pay a fee.

This is nice for the bank, they have limited risk, and an regular cahsflow, which looks nice on the balance sheet. And as long as the underlying rises it's nice for the idiot, as the bank pays them the upside. It sucks when the underlying drops 30% as the idiot have to pay the bank. But this is still not a problem if they have the capital lying around."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like an option contract. You don’t own the underlying.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Usually your broker will adjust your cost basis to reflect any losses or gains for that year. Losses up to $3,000 can be carried over year-to-year. It would depend on what your average cost basis would be for that stock."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you never make more than your initial investment, and just break even, despite buying/selling the same stock hundreds of times, are you paying any taxes on it (assuming you sell before December to close out your position for the year)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"EXBS assistance for Singapore in 2016 totaled $250,000. Also just because the US calls it forgoing aid doesn't mean thats what it is, its a pittance of a bribe to maintain regulatory alignment which is for the interests of the US.

Are you actually kidding me with this? The US pays out all manner of bribes for regulatory environment but 250k is literally piss all to a country like Singapore. 

Singapore is a mega wealthy country and easily lives within their means with massive reserves. Its in much better financial shape than the US because of its favorable environment to business and low taxes. I assure you it as nothing to do with the 250k your government throws them. What an American take on things lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,If you don't trade the positions again for 30 days then you should have a net-0 profit and so pay no taxes.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure I follow /u/southpark.

Why would he pay taxes on 39k if his NET is a 14k loss?

Say I invest 10k, lose 5k right away, but rebuy/sell the stock several times over the course of a few months to get back to 10k.

Let's say I do this until my cost basis is over 100k, but my ""proceeds"" still don't surpass it. This is of course assuming I sell in November and don't rebuy back into the same stock again.

The way I'm reading some of the replies in this thread they're making it sound like I'd be taxed on 100k, but reading comments like yours it seems more obvious that it's just the ""final number"" that matters."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man. Sometimes you learn something. I have no problem admitting fault. I knew a lot less about foreign aid than I thought. I know civility is not a quality most Americans are known for. I still feel the wash sale rule is extremely fair and it prevents tax fraud. Happy trading to you.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect, thank you.

Actually contacted my financial advisor this morning and they confirmed the same. Sounds like the guy in the article was just a dumb ass, and it's very interesting that they left out the fact that he could have easily avoided this issue. Almost like they're trying to scare retail investors."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"in his particular case, he has disallowed losses that he cannot use to negate his gains. that's what ""wash sale disallowed"" means on the statement. his brokerage has determined that he has not met the ""wash sale"" rule on those particular trades, and is doing him a favor actually by noting it. in reality YOU are responsible for ALL your trades across ALL your brokerages to note and document wash sale losses and not claim them on your taxes. if you claim them by mistake and the IRS audits you and finds that you claimed unallowed losses you're going to pay penalties.

&#x200B;

So in your example you are buying and selling the same equity to try and ""get back"" your losses, except your not meeting the wash sale rule while doing so, every time you make a ""gain"" in a trade that's going to be taxable, but your losses will not be, UNLESS you make one last trade at the END of the calendar year and sell and STOP trading so you can claim the adjusted cost basis on your final transaction which will capture all your long term ""losses"".  So your key word there is that you sell in November and don't rebuy back within 30 days so your final sale allows you to claim the adjusted cost basis loss (not a disallowed wash sale trade at that point).

&#x200B;

IF you re-purchased the same equity BEFORE the end of the year and BEFORE the 30-day wash sale window occurred, then you would be on the hook for all of your gains and your adjusted cost-basis would carry forward into the NEXT year, but that leaves you screwed for this year. It's a costly mistake to make. The final number matters IF you follow the rules so you can recognize your losses in the ""right year"". if you carry the loss forward, and you don't have sufficient gains to ""claim"" the losses on, you're limited to $3k in excess losses that can be claimed against other earnings, and the rest of the loss can be carried forward to future tax years (claiming $3k per year at a time)."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also commented on the wash trading law without knowing what i was talking about lol.

Appreciate the civil discussion though. A lot of the time when people disagree with you on reddit their first move is to attack your intelligence etc."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"> UNLESS you make one last trade at the END of the calendar year and sell and STOP trading so you can claim the adjusted cost basis on your final transaction which will capture all your long term ""losses"".

This is the key element that it really seems like the article should have made clear.

I contacted my financial advisor this morning and they confirmed the same, so thank you for the detailed and accurate response!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real problem is this rule isn’t obvious or clearly stated up front on these “day trading” apps like Robinhood, so you see a lot of first time traders getting burned like this guy when tax time rolls around."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, brokers like Fidelity make it very clear, and I thought I understood it correctly. Then I saw this article and got worried that maybe I didn't.

However after further research it's become obvious I do understand it and this guy just made a very costly mistake.

I read the article again and they kind of allude to it, but mostly it just seems like an article aimed at scaring retail traders.

>The example reinforces the importance of understanding complex trading rules and the tax implications of certain strategies. More broadly, it should serve as a loud warning for the new crop of do-it-yourself investors."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooo....  does that mean that apes buy banana?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was actually a good thing. All he's saying there is at that time there was not reason to go public, they just didn't need the money. In fact, they still don't.

A lot of times, when you see a company go public, it's because the private equity/early investors want to cash out. In this case it wasn't because they wanted to cash out. Like you see in my original argument, RKT went public to attract talent to the company. Also, Dan Gilbert has openly said he would want to acquire a fintech firm. You can see that here.  

> “We want to use our stock as currency and potentially acquire more fintech organizations and put them in the mold,” said Gilbert, chairman of Rocket Companies, which he founded in 1985.  

I will add that it turns out that the 20m shares sold was not due to Archegos implosion, it was actually Dan and Jennifer Gilbert selling a piece to fund a $500 mm initiative to revitalize Detroit neighborhoods. 

I'm not sure how the market will react to that, seem the market isn't so sure either. I personally think it's good news, they sold to a diamond hand institution and it gets the company closer to qualifying for the SP500, and revitalizing Detroit neighborhoods will look good on Dan and the company and help attract talent. (That's not why he does it though, he genuinely cares as you've seen from the interviews.)

Take it how you will though, not an expert not financial advice."

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I already have laughed and will continue to regardless of whether or not you make money because your play was nothing short of retarded. Not only did you go all in but you bought options right before earnings which means they were jacked with IV and had a much higher chance of expiring worthless than not. You've probably been ""investing"" for 2 months now and will trick yourself into believing you made an actual smart and education decision just because you made money but the fact of the matter was that it was a retarded YOLO and if you make money it was only because of luck and the happenstance of buying the options during a correction followed by a recovery."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,So learn me.  Should I be selling to close the 30c options while the IV is high today and rebuy on a dip?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that guy. You made a good play
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"From your latest post it looks like you're around breakeven or slightly in the green. If I were you I'd sell everything back, educate myself and start out with much less capital. The fact of the matter is that you have no idea what you are doing. It's nothing to be ashamed of; everyone started out like that and 95% of this sub is also the same way. You need to realize that, learn as much as you can from the infinite resources found online and come back once you know what you are doing. Just look at all of the loss porn posted to this subreddit. 90% of the time it's options losses and there's a reason for that. Just go start doing research and learning and I guarantee you will look back on yourself in a month and cringe at how little you knew and understood about the stock market."

Everything about this play screamed risky and improbable and you're in conscious denial if you think otherwise.

I refuse to take huge loses so I sell at small loses and a couple of times I get lucky and buy an option that only goes up. My strategy is to milk the 10% of my options that profit for as much as I can and sell as soon as it dips.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it just needs a little patience. 1. April is not ""The Date"""
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I’m $37 closer to a Tesla so this wasn’t a loss for me. Thanks OP! Lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time I see a trending DD, the stock is up like 1000+% in 3 months. Y'all clowns."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excuse me, how did you get smashed? Price is near 21 again and you have half a month for your calls to be exercised. We have at least 2 more weeks of seeing the price do it's thing before the 4'16 calls end

I'm only slightly in any way. 4 $20 calls @ 1.65 price. All I had to spare lol."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,2 weeks before April 16. Chill.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,AMRS's volatility has taken years off my life. But I will continue to hold as well
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,https://youtu.be/ErvgV4P6Fzc
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wish it was more! Still holding. Disagree with market reaction yesterday, hopefully next transaction is better received and we make some larger tendies"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Thatd be half of my position
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions? April 16 is still over 2 weeks away?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was down $25k yesterday...so that's how I got smashed. Recovered a decent amount back today, so doing fine all things considering. Will see where the close ends up. No plans to sell shares for years. Hopefully we get the second deal next week, hoping for a better market reaction"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you think thats bad, i bet my whole retirement fund on it too!"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully my shares average is $18.88 looking forward to a $26 if you are right.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s Thursday tomorrow boss.

100 to the World Wildlife Foundation and I’ll buy 10 shares of GME ride or die if you’re right and it rockets."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, first thought was that you closed your 16th april calls. As a GME nut, just keep holding."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you’ve taken a really big loss
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've trimmed a few of them, but still holding onto a shit ton of contracts. Def not throwing in the towel, I'm no paperhands"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,No I meant doesn’t webull give you free stocks when you join - were they trash or actually high value stocks
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Not as bad as you guys but still pissed at 353@11.53
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that good news?
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel you, I just added 150 more the day before at 11.50, terrible timing."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's insane news, they aquired 5 million shares at 9.5"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I started at 16 averaging down to 11.53 for the freaking  stock to crash. I still like the cars and what they have to offer as a company but not as a 2year investment anymore. Its more like a 5-7 year investment now. Will keep averaging down but not aggressively. Maybe after my GME goes to the moon... lol
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Sucks when it is so cold the romex breaks when pulling.
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, the unevitable I told you so lol, that sleazeball is dumping

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those  who disagree with the tracking feature of Root....your smartphone is always tracking you anyway, even with location services disabled."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this is factually inaccurate. Semesterlagen 12e paragrafen states you have the right to 4 consecutive weeks during the months of june to august."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry my dude. We had really strong unionization and push for workers' rights. It's getting weaker, but I doubt they'll ever be able to take our paid time off.

I probably shouldn't tell you that if you work overtime, that time can also be used for time off instead of cash."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you have the right to. Most people do, you need at least three consecutive weeks to properly relax. I believe there have been studies on this here.

Also, parents with small children will generally also take a few weeks of paid parental leave, so they get 6-10 weeks summer holidays.

You can still take that 1 week later (25 days is work days), and collect paid overtime to take as more paid time off."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn't aware of that paragraph, but if you read it, it says this only applies if nothing else has been agreed upon. In other words they can just put a line in your contract when they hire you that says this doesn't apply at their company. 

I mean sure, it's there, but it's not like it changes things. They still don't have to give you vacation in the summer."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curaleaf is already one of the largest operators in the United States and internationally now w their acquisitions. Tilray has no entry into the us. The us is not legalizing, it will be decriminalized and left for the states to decide. Many of the states limit their licenses so if all the licenses are already taken, the foreign companies will have to merge and acquire with companies already operating there.... so it maybe lucrative to own Canadians, but it will be even more lucrative to own the USA. It should also be noted that all of that is with standing the fact that the largest US companies are fundamentally way stronger companies on a revenue, profit, management.... overall quality basis than the Canadians, just look at their earnings reports.... The Canadians consistently under perform and burn cash while the United States operators make money"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,The only reason they are penny stocks is because of the technicalities behind legalization and the market structure. their market caps rival those of the Canadian LPs even with the set back of being OTC. their revenues crush them and in pretty much every other comparable metric... Canadian LPs get slapped around as well... so what’s going to happen when the “best in class” companies also get to list on the American exchanges??
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree. National legalization, shit that will probably never happen. You can’t just legalize a schedule one drug in four year lol. This will be state by state thing probably forever."
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,"How the fuq is it an oligarchy lol, it’s a vertical Integrated business with plenty of competition with licenses past to other companies to operate within the state as well. Eventually these smaller companies will merge and we’ll be left with Three Big Companies. Business always follows the rule of three"
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,This is AWESOME!!
04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,Proof or ban. I refuse to believe that someone is threatening an obvious troll account.

04/01/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought over 1000 shares of MVIS between $11.80 and $13.00 averaged at $12.20. Lol. Today was great for me too. My buddy bought some FD's on CLF because of this post and made 8 times his money in 2 days. Fantastic.
