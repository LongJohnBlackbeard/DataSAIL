03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So front running is legal as long as you pay for the info?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I heard Chase's platform is trash..

Is that true?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tastywork is apparently good for option trading, but support to 3 days to answer an email.... so... idk"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Front running is illegal but there's not a way to really check for retail investors.

You just have to come up with your own conclusions considering brokerages like Robinhood gets fined constantly. And the fines are very small relative to profits so there's that.

Also, you have to assume SEC does its job properly."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to buy the computer real estate as well.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have absolutely no idea. Never used Chase brokerage.

Am a Fidelity user. This data is making me quite intrigued to test opening a Chase brokerage when I have time.

There's stuffs like execution speed and quality which are also important factors which I cannot find for many of these brokerages. I am curious what the numbers are for Chase."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"*None of what I say is financial advice, and you shouldn’t trust a random guy on the internet… but I hear you are looking for tendies - if you follow me to my van, I can show you where you might find some.


Amyris Tldr; They have used machine learning and AI to solve/map genetic pathways in yeast to create almost any molecule at production scale. I believe that the price could hit 2k-4k per share one day


Once it runs, this is literally a fucking money printer.

The modded yeast eat sugar and shit out a more expensive molecule (like CBG/CBD). They already have mapped out 400+ molecules. It’s like they have a machine where if you feed it a dime, it spits out a quarter. Even a retard can understand this math.

They have the google maps for yeast and everyone else is navigating by the stars. And they patented the shit out of all the major streets so no one can follow them.
If green sustainability had a dick, it would have such a huge hard on for this company. They replace dirty chemistry with clean, sustainable, low cost, and better organic chemisty.

How did they get so fucked in the first place?
They tried biofuels but gas prices went down so they got boned and couldn't compete. They pivoted to flavors and fragrances because that stuff is worth more per kilogram than fuel. So they rested there like a wounded animal while still dumping 70M into RnD yearly. And now bankruptcy is off the table. Their consumer brands are taking off and they are rising like a goddamn yeast phoenix. It cost them 2B to get to this point.

Why should you buy? - Pick from the list below. I know you've put your money in tickers with less potential.They are a part of BioMade which is the U.S. initiative for a syntheic bio industrial revolution. Think about it, fermentation plants across the U.S. and it becomes the largest chemical/raw materials exporter.

-13 molecules at commercial scale and 18 in the pipeline. They can take any molecule to commercial scale in under a year.

-they are making a protein platform, beyond meat and impossible foods better watch out.

-they can claim ""all natural"" on all their products

-The golden goose tendie machine - yeast map

-vaccine play - they produce squalene which is used as an adjuvant to boost vaccine efficacy. It also saves millions of sharks from being killed

-they teamed up with IDRI to create a 2nd gen vaccine an SA-mRNA vaccine that can be stored room temp for 8months, longer if kept cold.

-they worked with DARPA living foundries program to develop their machine learning

-they make sustainable jetfuel with the Navy

-they are working on a monoclonal antibody platform, no more twiddling hamster ovaries

-also HMO (titty milk sugars) platform, and an mRNA (printing vaccine antigen) platform.

-they have created next gen sweeteners which will help our fat asses consume less sugar without the fake taste. and they are partnering with Raizen on it

-they are a cannabis play - they produce CBD and CBG at commercial scale (there is a lawsuit but it looks frivolous, just look up the lawyers on both sides. Amy is going to be fine)

-Its P/S multiple is around 10-15x and similar companies have 100x.

-its only 3B mcap. This thing can run.

-5 years ahead of competitors

-800+ patent wall. They have locked yeast down.

-their tech is being applied to other organisms too


Imagine an economy that can produce chemicals sustainably and if a pandemic arises, it can immediately shift production to counter it.
This is a ten year trip to Tendie Town. You can hop off whenever you have had your fill. You retards are looking at the next (Genetic) Microsoft. Machines are here to help us master DNA. Synthetic Bio is the future.

This is the Amy starter package - an intro to the tendie machine.

Part 2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




And for you monkeys that are having FOMO, we’re just getting started on our trip to Tendie Town... allow me to explain.


500M dollar protein platform deal expected to close before the end of March
-It’s only a ~5B dollar company, we’re all retarded here but that one single deal compared to the companies entire valuation is easy fucking tendies boys. 

-It's a plant protein platform. Like what Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods does but better. Amyris has perfected yeast, they will be able to be more cost effective.

-This is just a single branch of their company. Think of Amyris as a BYND that can make any molecule found in nature - not just proteins.  

-mRNA platform and mAB platform

-Both of these platforms are set to come up later this year and be more active early 2022.

-mRNA platform - they already have the best adjuvant that can make vaccines last 8 months at room temperatures. To take it a step further, they are in progress of being able to print out mRNA. This would be massive in cutting costs and also making an absurd amount of vaccines in a short amount of time. We’d be sort of pandemic proof. 

-mAB platform - monoclonal antibodies are like artificial antibodies that can be programmed to target cancers. Extremely valuable but a bitch to produce with current methods (you have to twiddle some hamster ovaries)

-There is no need to do any inventing or research to develop mRNA or mABs, that is what Amyris’ customers do. Amy just mods the yeast to pump this shit out.

Amy is the kind of girl that doesn't forget to play with your balls while she is blowing up your account with the Gluck Gluck 9000. That is the kind of girl you keep around. Amyris is the 10 Year Tendie Play. I’m going to be here for a while, you’re going to see more and more of my gains. 


You know how you wished to get into TSLA when it was smaller? Here is your chance. It is a company with even more potential and a better impact on the environment. I only covered three branches of this company. How many more branches are you going to let slap you in the face until you realize this is an amazing buy at any price.





Part 3
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------




~500M of deals will close for Amyris around the end of the month. I know this because I am on every conference call or presentation they give. I don't believe the market has priced this in because Amy is still relatively unknown. So if you ever wanted to become a Yeast Bro or (if you have the monies) a Yeast Beast… do your DD and consider this stock.

And by popular request from the comments…

The Bad Stuff and why you shouldn't buy this stock

-881M lawsuit by Lavvan, read it yourselves and form your own opinions. I saw that John Doerr added way more knowing all of this and so are many institutions. So I am not too worried. (This shows you how valuable that yeast is)

-Capacity capacity capacity. Their current plant is already maxed out and they are working on another one. They need this second plant to come up without any interruption so that they can continue with their future projections. If there are any stalls, this would be a problem because each plant costs 70M and can return 200-400M per year in revenue.

-It has I think ~100-150M in debt. I think they are planning to pay 50M towards it this year

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife works in medicine and my stupid brain didn’t understand any of that but she knew all the big words and said holy fuck invest in those guys! Not dd/advice!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Breathe, relax. Is that off your chest now? This company makes protein powder and jet fuel for the navy? Will it suck my dick and rub my back at the same time as well?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wait that’s my wad of cash from not listening to people who overhype shit. Sorry 🤗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,(Chinese father) Series B? Why no Series A?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But what you don’t understand is that the CCP can pull the plug on any company in a split second
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck China.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chinese stocks? Aw hell no. 

Ain't touching that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck China. They're Gov't screws growth. Look at Jack Ma. China is a red herring that pretends to dance on the world stage but they've got concentration camps, shit working conditions, and an oppressive Gov't.

I wouldn't invest in a Chinese stock if someone paid me. Rather invest in boomer div stocks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have JD, but I don’t like that they create a new stock for each subsidiary instead of keeping it under the JD ticker.  Seems they water down the value to me"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ali baba is the real Chinese amazon 
JD is secondary"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,China? You mean false income reports and fraud? They can't even think for themselves and copy legit everything. No thanks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is good stuff. I’m in BABA but JD is a good bet at current price for easy tendies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have heard of this company and am very interested. Will by shares after I TP some other ventures.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm you’ve got me interested
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,BABA for me.  In @ 160.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You misspelled BABA
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,SHORT
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I always lose money on this goddamn thing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jump on RLX too since it got beat down today ready for reverse
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also these numbers could be easily inflated. Numbers out of China should be taken with a grain of salt.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it pull the plug on a company competing with an American one and bringing in billions in revenue and Chinese jobs? Be realistic this country is trying to surpass America it is relying on companies like JD.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here here, fuck China."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't Jack Ma is crazy though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Baba for me isn’t as good value, 6x higher market cap but fairly similar revenue for 2020 as JD although admittedly net is far better in Baba currently"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps, although they are independently audited by Deloitte who I fundamentally trust as an audit standard"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If it becomes too powerful. Absolutely. They’re all about govt power. As soon as it’s threatened (I.e. ant) they pull the trigger
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets," 'who I fundamentally trust as an audit standard'

Who do you think pays the auditors?  Yet they call themselves independent.  It's all smoke and mirrors."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Deloitte China though. I’ve worked at a Big4 accounting firm and they’re all technically separate entities by country/region so the risk is limited to that area. Just proceed with caution

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He also sounds a lot like Duncan trussel if you know who he is
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a great show on HBO called Silicon Valley. Loved it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Silicon Valley. HBO
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How so?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Duncan Trussell is a mighty sexy God. I had the honor of meeting the dude on his You Are God Tour.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He called in a fake bomb threat on a train once. Real strange fella
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried shorting TSLA once. I’m homeless now. This hits hard.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 800 calls for june at 690🥲
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha. In the end, TSLA running into APEs hiding in the jungle"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That last 5 minutes though
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Last year tsla burned me. This year different story I already know when to dump my calls or take profits. I've missed out on big gain but I've had no losses over $100

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Great ... but for some reason I'm really in tune with this stock after trading it for ten years. It has hurt me that odd time but I still have my left testicle. It feels like it gonna tank all the time.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thee yall nexth year
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA is over valued. Change my mind.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It will dip to 420 in june right before your call expires and then next week it will hit 800. This is how it usually goes with my Calls. 1 week too early
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Teach me your ways oh wise one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer? Boo yah Jimmy Chill!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold the $700 Calls and bought the $705 Calls when it was at $690 today. The little bastard makes you hold overnight if you want to make gains on the long side.  It's been a gap and crapper lately.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,is that you Elon.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you mean TSLA that was $80 a year ago? Overvalued at $700 you say? I don't know man. So while agree with you didn't Cathie Wood just go long on it?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Value is in the eyes of the stock holders. Like Elon says...If you think it’s too expensive. Don’t buy the stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wookies live on Endor

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gap and crap! First time hearing that one 😆
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? A company with 3 production vehicles, false promises of a roadster for almost 10 years and a truck that hasn't even been hinted about actually going into production any time this decade... Not to mention it's market cap is greater than ford, toyota and honda combined. 700$ sounds like a steal to me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumb it down for me I eat crayons
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain that a bit more? Is this a formula to know what option to buy? When to sell? How many contracts to buy?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed I’m dumb too
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a classic KFC sandwich play here if I ever saw one.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Kudos on actually owning the stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That earnings call baby. Ready to 🚀 to the moon
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Get ready for another wave of short attacks and upward squeezes. Those shares have to be bought back somehow.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"UPST was showing signals but honestly, most people see pops like that as a PnD these days. That was some steady climbing for multiple sessions. I’m sure puts or exhaustion will retrace this a bit. 

Congrats to anyone that rode that 🚀🚀🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in. I saw that lock up expiration is June 6th so there is only a number of shares available
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Upstart gains were nuts. Nobody noticed either
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you find these stocks before they take off?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"UPST is the real deal, and I believe it's just getting started.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got turned onto the stock after he went on Josh Brown's podcast....The Compound...has made me over $100k on that trade.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FWIW, this one really wasn’t. It was mentioned like once pre-pop."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,👍🏽
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I listen to his podcast too. How did I miss it? Must of been on a while ago. Josh Brown is one of the funniest dudes in finance. Lol."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Animal Spirits is pretty good too!  Same wealth management firm.  Ben and Michael give Josh a run for his money IMO.  All in all great content creators.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I catch them sometimes. Check out the podcast ""On The Tape"" with Fast Money guys Guy Addami and Dan Nathan along with Danny Moses of The Big Short fame. I love when Dan gets salty about how some names are going parabolic. Lol."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats on being the first post I've come across all day that actually deserves to be a post. 

Thanks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This feels really niche which I typically don't like, but I totally see a bunch of covid-abused socially fucked individuals taking trips to Vinyards to figure out how to be in a society again. Much like my portfolio, could go either way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They landed a great ticker. That’s the long and short of required DD.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I prefer to invest in physical NAPA , not paper NAPA"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. 

I work in the alcohol industry and sell both wine and beer. I have a couple concerns for NAPA tho. 

The wine market is incredibly over saturated. Duckhorn has recognition which helps but wine drinkers are very promiscuous. A lot of their repeat business is going to come in the on-premise where I predict will never be the same. 

Them missing they sales number is concerning as well since beer and liquor suppliers all had record years. This indicates that they are too reliant for on-premise sales or consumers traded down in 2020 to less premium wines. 

I think NAPA is a phenomenal company, but I just do not think I could throw my money into a wine company in this market."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like their wines
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I could see people doing that, just like I can see them going to the movies. Might be a good payout.

As a former Firefighter, I can also see California burning again this year and ruining profits.  I'm just cynical towards anything in Cali that isn't in the desert... the majority of the state flares up faster than herpes on a $2 hooker."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That is what I am thinking that it feels really nice. All the people that were going to get married last year but didn't and they wanted to go to a vineyard for this occasion maybe. Plus all the sophisticated people couldn't be sophisticated all last year so I feel like when the vineyards can open they are going to see a huge amount of reservations. I agree though I am going to watch this one and see where it places in the market first.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Covid abused and socially fucked? You didn't stay inside the WHOLE year did you? Sounds like projecting 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you and wish you luck through the offering!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,what price was VIAC at when you bought these calls?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Down 4% after hours from a stock offering. Curious to see what tomorrow brings for you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to already be pretty well off to make plays like this. Still tho congrats
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"$3Billion is a lot of money to push past these prices of ATHs with 1/3rd volume today...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda sold today probably
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,New opportunity to buy more calls at a discounted rate! 👁 will be looking at $100 call options tomorrow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You should check his history on VIAC calls. He played it phenomenally so far.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I still have plenty of time on those contracts. I will probably be buying up more calls depending on how the price moves tomorrow. Will wait for a bottom to make my entry. I can easily seeing this bounce back up to $100 very soon 👁

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The tldr didn't clear anything up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for taking the time to post this. I am looking forward to future posts from you, followed"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not this shit again
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, ok....buy at 2, sell at 3, rebuy at 4 and resell at 5.
Perfect strategy!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My theory is citadel is going broke.  And there pulling out tendies elsewhere for a epic final battle that will be the most retarded thing we see in our lifetime....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally saw this coming last week. First fibos now elliot waves. So predicable.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a big believer in TA and even I’m not dumb enough to buy into this shit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love surfing! 😂Never had the chance but I skate like a mother fucker at 38. 👴🏼 great read tho all jokes aside! ✌🏽🦍🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Commenting to find this later. Just started getting into this. Thanks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,....so ABCD pattern for short?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"While you are likely going to get downvoted, I like your idea of a stick and balls theory and have begun drafting blueprints for people to trade off of. Already I can tell we are going to have one giant dick rising from the balls that have already formed"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No doubt it is. Absolutely. But it is self fulfilling. People do trade off this shit therefore it actually plays out. Sometimes. Maybe. 🤷‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Astrology for dudes. Market didn’t like JPOW said last week. Notice the ball pattern shriveling up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Will do. I'm writing them as we speak
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. This is why trading can be more profitable than investing. Boomer investors diamond hand their way through the dips, while traders sell on the way up, buy the dips and make wayyyyyyy more profits. There's actually a whole chapter basically on this exact point in the book I mentioned. Tendies, baby, Tendies!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm riding that rocket too.  Just got a lot of baggage is all.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,381 shares @ 26.22 checking in. Happily holding

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where else can you find a stock that is growing and profiting so much that they’re issuing billions in buybacks, paying special dividends, having a P/E of < 10, part SaaS company and a fucking industry disruptor, and also heavily shorted? Incredibly small downside risk here with rates staying low, the growth trajectory, and their insanely low P/E.

Also their CEO will fuck the shorts, and we will join him in Valhalla.

Unbelievably beautiful setup, it really is an incredible and rare opportunity. A snowflake and a gem in a sea of other crap.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep RKT posts coming we need the fucking volume for tomorrow.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You think RKT has anything left in it ? What's the  current short % of float? I only have a 8hr set up which looks to be firing Neg here into close man...does not look bullish here at all...sorry change my mind...but just don't see it doing much sorry ..

I intend on buying more shares with divvy tomorrow. Wednesday payday for me, so I’ll exercise my last 18.89 option too. 

Volume tomorrow would be a great boost to get things moving again."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT in general is very undervalued. Low % float doesn't take much to move this rocket.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's decent, don't think it's gone down at all actually since that last run up, I'll have to check on a Bloomberg terminal to get the exact number...or close enough I would think....yeah yahoo and the rest are a couple weeks behind behind in report short data, think they all are pretty much even BB.... needs a hard push then cuz its been selling off all last week .....will see , as I mentioned my 4hr went off neg into close and the 8ht next so you should get some lower prices tomorrow and then for me everything needs to set up on my system before I can get active....good luck tho bro, really hope it works out for you....🙏🏼💰🙏🏼"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No. That. Is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What is percent return on a one month covered call somewhat out of money? Looked shit last time I checked
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is not a mortgage company. It’s a company that sells software to mortgage brokers and provides consumers access to brokers through their mobile app. It’s actually a marketplace business with workflow software built in for the participants. It’s a pretty brilliant business.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT isn't just a mortgage company you idiot lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The way jose
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When someone says they sell covered calls does that really mean that they have gay sex with condoms only for the price of a share?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No I just generally think before I speak early thats an accomplishment you have yet to succeed at...good luck....bro good luck is all I can pray for you...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on this if eps is $2.10, that means the p/e is trading at 4.16. I believe rkt is currently trading at a 6.8. In q4 2020 Uwmc had 54b in closed loan volume in with 305bps of margin. 

For q1 2021 they guided for closed loan volume of 52-57b and total margin of 200-235bps, their going to have roughly 20% less profit q1 compared to q4. 

This would make their P/E ratio closer to 5. Still undervalued and I’m not sure how much of their guidance, if any factored in the relaunching of their jumbo loan program. 

I can see why the stock didn’t take off After hours on this release, there isn’t really anything new in this that wasn’t already factored in. 

It’s definitely trading under fair value but it’s going to need a new catalyst in order to get this back over 10, I.e index inclusion, blowout q1 earnings etc. 

I have a boat load of 4/16 calls but I think time is pretty much up on those and will be taking the L and rolling them out to august calls.

Edit: I had to look this up on my mobile so someone please correct me if I’m wrong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All I want to know is if my UWMC position will gain value in the near term or at least eventually.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,...just a 715% YoY increase...nothing to see here...move along
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus.  To put this in perspective, if TSLA had those numbers, they'd be worth about 5360 a share."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm going to buy some tomorrow.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please summarize...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So I’m glad I purchased more in the dip this morning.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Printer go brrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr

Buying the dip tomorrow morning"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, I literally dropped 10k in this stock today, then you post this 10-K filing. Are we soul mates?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Does this mean calls have a possibility of printing now?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does the 10k include charges related to IPO cost? That usually causes large losses for newly public stocks, so don’t look to deep into EPS losses if they are included"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Edit: EPS is $2.10, based on net income of $3.38 and shares o/s of 1.61bn"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What is EPS ????
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this here?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t have it in front of me but RKT PE is mid teens if I remember right, not 6.8."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For this to work you’ll want to see aggressive home sales data for March. A good source for this movement will be [National Association of Realtors](https://www.nar.realtor/research-and-statistics/housing-statistics). The stats here will show existing and new home sales. If there is a favorable spike it should have a lifting effect on originators, wholesalers, and servicers. 

Of course If yields spike that would be bad. So keep an eye on both and you’ll have a sense as to whether the trade will work for you!  

Good luck!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as you bought shares, sure"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Personal position 115 shares >$9 and I'm not going anywhere for months-years
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,💎🙌 I ain't selling shit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The group had a great year! \~$2 EPS
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I just skipped to the balance sheet and was like holy moly.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Another 20 K purchased today. 6000 shares in total. Lets go !!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The balance sheet shows a loss though?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm going to hold mine. April 16th still a bit off and today wasn't the super red day people were expecting when the Russell exclusion news was dropped Friday. Fuck it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This 10K doesn’t include UWMC in the financials, it’s strictly the financials from the SPAC. In the notes the net income is 3.38Bn for FY2020 from UWMC. With 1.61Bn shares outstanding EPS is $2.10. 

The first 10-K post SPAC is confusing. Essentially this contains no new information."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also this is massive, a 715% YOY increase.

 From the 10-K filing:

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1.61 BILLION outstanding shares. That's a pretty big float. Current market cap is at \~$14B. EPS will be closer to $2.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We need to figure out this EPS number ????
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings per share
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings per share
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Basic diluted eps was $(0.12) eps as of December 2020 for class A and class F shares
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao. You expect us Apes to read dem fancy financial statements?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I pulled it on mobile I got 6.8 so will definitely check when back on computer. 

But for example pennymac is a mortgage cash cow and trades at a 3 p/e. 

I like UWMC and yolo’d into 04/16 calls but just based on other similar company multiples they all trade at shit p/e and are undervalued. So it’s hard for me to see some near term catalyst that will change that. 

Definitely hope I’m wrong though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we get a confirmation on that?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! That's what I'm hoping for!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome! I got 50 at about $9.05 I'm still new to this stuff but looks like it's got some big potential.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, as u/daddyspain69 pointed out, looks like a $2.10 EPS."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, pages 61,62,63. They made a fucking ton"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LFG!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"8-K and earnings report reflect net income @ $3,380,000,000. I'm seeing 103,100,000 outstanding shares (per Yahoo), which results in an EPS of $32.78. The closing share price was $8.78, which would then imply a PE ratio of ~0.268.

We're not considering dividends, but something seems so off."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you get 1.61 Bn shares?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like including Mat Ishbia and Gores Group ownership total shares are 1.61 BILLION outstanding shares. Applying that to UWMC net income of $3.38Bn you get EPS of $2.10.

&#x200B;

Took a bit since it was confusing that UWMC business is not shown in the financials since this is the 10-K for the newly form SPAC entity and UWMC will be included going forward, hence the net income loss despite UWMC stating in the notes that they made $3.38Bn this year.

&#x200B;

EPS of $2.10 is fantastic!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean number from 10K ... anybody calculated yet
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Number ???!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"8-K and earnings report reflects net operating income of $3.38bil, while the 10-K is showing a loss. I'm obviously missing something here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So uwmc loss money ???!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Posting in case there’s at least one literate here. 

Move along, son."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Take a look at who pointed that out to him... :/
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I put together is this. 

The 10-K financials reflect the newly formed entity post SPAC. That is shown here ""At December 31, 2020, the Company had not commenced any operations. All activity for the period from June 12, 2019 (inception) through December 31, 2019 relates to the Company’s formation and initial public offering (“Public Offering”) described below (p.71)""

&#x200B;

Then it talks about the actual UWMC business. That is why I think what you need to do is apply the shares outstanding to the actual UWMC net income of $3.38Bn. When you do that thought, it seems very very high like you said. 

&#x200B;

Definitely confused."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you can look it up on a reputable brokerage site (I saw the value on TD Ameritrade). You can sanity check it by taking the market cap and dividing it by the current price per share. Lesson here is that Yahoo sucks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the 103M just the amount issued via the SPAC? And the 1.61Bn includes Matt and the Gores group ownership?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah - that’s making more sense. And yes, that EPS sounds excellent! That would put UWMC roughly 1/4 of RKT’s PE ratio"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So share outstanding is 1.6B shares ... 3.38B( next income ) - .115M ( dividend pay out ) / 1.6B share = ~ 2 ( EPS) is that make sense?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sorry - I’m a little slow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. The 8-k is amended for the transaction (hence the /A in the filing). That is a better representative of results than the 10k. I imagine they will shortly file an amended 10K as well
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What you’re seeing in the 10K is not inclusive of merger in January of 2021. The 10-K is backwards looking and as such is not consolidating operations of the combined business. Hence why it’s interest income does not meet the operating expense items. You’ll see a trust account of $425MM reflecting the pending Spac transaction. Subsequent filings (10Q) should better outline profitability
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone can look this up... You also don't provide any useful insight.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sorry, u/Jebraun !"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So share outstanding is 1.6B shares ... 3.38B( next income ) - .120B ( dividend pay out ) / 1.6B share = ~ 2 ( EPS) is that make sense
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's filed under news lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They made a ton of money

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All good! It can be easy to miss a lot of the conversation.. Thanks for posting the SEC filing. I think it'll be great for the community to get more people familiar with these documents and discuss how to break them down in a more digestible way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone knew this already. It is in all earnings summaries. Again, what is your insight."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've seen a few statements like this one, from Motley Shills. 

""United Wholesale recently went public through a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC), and while it has released its full-year 2020 earnings, it has not filed its Form 10-K. The Form 10-K contains a detailed financial review of the company's operations. When I first wrote about United Wholesale, I said that I liked the company's business model and that its use of technology gave it a distinct advantage over many of its competitors. The only issue I had with recommending the stock was the lack of a 10-K. I still stand by that.""

Well, here it is."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should be viewing this as they were being decimated. But what happened just after, a giant bubble burst."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"the interest rate fear in the last weeks was nonsensical, what will probably happen those ""experts"" will forget about it, will buy again tech stocks, then tech stocks will rise again and when nobody expects the bubble will burst, because bubbles never pop when you expect it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It would be amazing if that drastic drop in 2021 is due to Retail going after HF short positions. Literally game changing!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Terrifying graph if you're a bull.... Being presented as a great thing for bulls. I wonder how much further we can go.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I Literally don’t understand what the fuck you are trying to say.

Dude, according to this graph, the % of SP500 stocks being shorted right now is extremely low, 1.5%, which means than investors think the SP500 companies are strong (aka, investors are bullish) and don’t want to short them because they expect them to go up.

It was the same in the 2000, because who the fuck would short a tech stock when they just went up instantly and never down... until the bubble exploded.

I am having a rough time processing what “short sellers have been decimated” mean. Like, do you think short sellers are a tribe or something? What exactly do you think short selling is? Becase if you are not short selling stocks... then what the hell are you doing, just buying bullish positions and that’s it? Lol

Plus, what has the SP500 being strong right now have to do with... anything 

Seriously, I think this sub has a mongoloid problem of some kind. Wtf?"

My guess:  the latter 2 of the 3."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to burst your bubble, but we’ve been on a very long upward trending run; this is probably a result of that rather than the activity here"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It isn't about destroying short sellers or hedgies. It's about making money.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Median? Does this mean this is the short interest of stock #250 of 500 in the SP500?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers getting decimated is not exactly a good thing, nor is it a bad thing either. Same way bulls getting crushed is neither good nor bad.

Short sellers are actually very healthy for the financial market. But a lot people new to this sub, or investing in general, don't seem to have much knowledge of financial market history. Even recent events like the Valeant drug scandal or Longfin fraud are unheard of to them. 

Short-selling has been a feature of the financial market for over 200 years, and short sellers have done a lot good for the market in the last 3 decades. What remains a problem is the weak bookkeeping around modern short selling, and the existing regulations are just insufficient to force financial firms to practicing more stringent bookkeeping for security lending."

Short interest = capitulation and a race to but to cover when gamma squeeze happens

Having such low short interest is a sign of a market top and that the most likely push is to the downside"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they getting out of dodge?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at where short interest was when the market bottomed in 2011
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FREE THE MARKET!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

💎🙌"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Payback gonna to be a bitch
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There will be no shorters in the next epoch! The world will be ruled by retards!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks just like 1 year PLTR chart damn
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Terrific, 😮😮😮
And it's not even the end 🙏"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not all that bet against stocks sell short. That is the only thing they keep track of. Still bears out there. Look at TSLA today... another failed break out as volume completely dried up. It can't get a leg up despite the short interest being super low on it. GME taught a few shorties a lesson this year and the news sure played it up to scare the other shorties out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,#MOAR!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I csn get behind this, kill the short positions!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a minor detail.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They did not print 6 trillion last time though
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Last time was just a fluke no worries can’t happen again
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Please keep the busting of bubbles in my wife. Thank you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This time it’s different bro
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree. 
Would give you gold but don't got any now."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The top is in 🌈🐻

SPY 3/26 $385 put

UVXY 4/16 $10 and $20 call"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost like the short sellers make the market more efficient or something. Crazy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get rich off GME, pull out till the pop, proceed to buy everything on sale. Wait. Watch the world burn."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I don’t think value outperforming momentum this year is off the cards"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is: you don't expect the bubble to pop?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m thinking 4-5 more years but who da fuk knows
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,In GME?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They are hiding it really well is my guess.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,just wait until the yield keeps creeping up !
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Dumb
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There's also a difference between healthy and abusive (illegal) shorting.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, fundamentals left a long time ago pal.

The rules have always been just guidelines"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes... that’s what many people today on WSB dont understand. 

And we are more than lucky with GameStop cause the shorts got their shorts wrong with GME ."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Short selling is BIG gay tho
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to lose the short sellers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That is not a problem for todays me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point idk if this is sarcastic or not, but every time there is some sort of explanation as to why it isn't a bubble. The explanation is different, the end result is the same"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Any certain stocks you are gonna reinvest in?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I follow this guy, [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX\_KAGQ\_HXk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AX_KAGQ_HXk) he is a hedge investment manager and he rocks, predicted months ago, RKT, VW, NOK the rotation into oil"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been ""a bubble"" for the last 12 years. Every single day someone has been saying it's a bubble. Maybe it is. Maybe it will pop tomorrow. Or maybe in another 2 years. Or 10.

Or maybe COVID let a ton of air out of the bubble and let it re-inflate. Or maybe they brrrrr'd so much money the U.S. is fucked for generations. Maybe the U.S. economy as the world knew it is already over, never to return. Or maybe it's just getting started.

If you didn't invest 8 years ago you'd have missed out on some of the biggest and most consistent gains in history."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over any given amount of time, sure. Nobody can time it but the two situations are entirely different so no point comparing"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I worked in casinos most my life, good analogy.  What you described about players working for the house that play that actually exsist, there called poker props. If there's not enough players for a table and they need more players they can send in a poker prop to keep the game going. As far as if a casino had more wins than normally you'd run into a liquidity problem very fast, a casino is required to keep a certain amount on hand but how they cycle money eventually it all ends up in the machines tied up, until the drop team comes in to free up there money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">They just aren't allowed to make too much too consistently.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Predicated on the institutional bagholders being ""small enough to fail"".  

Using the mob analogy, if a minion makes an expensive mistake, he gets whacked. If a made man makes a big expensive mistake, he gets whacked. If the big boss makes a mistake, he doesn't get whacked - unless his mistake was so big and embarrassing as to bring down all the families. If there's half a dozen families and one of them makes an incredibly bad mistake that could bring down the whole mob, yeah, he'll get whacked. But if whacking him brings down all the families, they'll rally around and get through it.  

I don't think a market maker handling 30% of transactions in the market is going down to give a bunch of apes a flock of Lambos. If it's just killing Melvin Capital, sure, they'll go down. If it's killing Citadel (the market maker, not the hedge fund), they'll figure out how to fuck us even if it makes them look bad.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rake and “session fees” are norms.  Smaller games usually have rake and session fees are for bigger games.  But to say “only underground and small rooms take rake” is just simply not true.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it depends on your locale- rake is still very common on the west coast but then again I only play in Washington Nevada and California
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It was just a simple device for conveying a point.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just let them lose their money. Someone writes a long post and they think it’s some genius stock guy who’s rich when it’s just some dumb fuck.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It depends on the table limits, but yeah, maximizing the pot isn't the end all be all and poker isn't a casino's main source of revenue... But that's not at all the point here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only poker staff care about the poker rooms.  The house makes dust from running a poker room. When I say “dust” they still make a shitload of money but nothing compared to all the table games and slots.  They make the majority of poker money from tournament fees.  Rake is small.

Rake is the “no fees” Robin hood version for amateurs. 
If your game is busy you take session, if its small and slow you rake so you don’t bust your slow players too fast. Its not beneficial to rake unless you uncap it which is only done in underground games. So yes ONLY UNdERGROuNDs aND SMALL ROOMS tAKE ThE RAKES."

I am having downside protection. I may not get infinite gains, but I will keep on rolling ITM options to further dates and make some gains... and will keep on adding shares on dips...or on big dips cover the short calls...."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,he wins on the Downside then?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I use E*TRADE and RH. RH sucks for writing covered calls in single transaction.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say I hope you get to fill that but...I'd be lying.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"But your 100 shares will be the sole single reason why it doesn’t squeeze!!! In all seriousness, good for you, make some money my dude"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">... looking at momentum , sentiment, and DD I think GME has potential...

YES, wil double down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"trust me it's changing for good if you play it right my friend... looking at momentum , sentiment, and DD I think GME has potential..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ITM will be assigned automatically. My life long strategy was and will be to roll them out for few weeks to get some more premium. Though it may not work for deep ITM due to bid ask spreads!! But I have sold options for AAPL for 40 dollar strike which I am rolling for 2/3 years!! Never got them assigned  before expiry and always rolled out to get some premium.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Having covered calls isn't exactly downside protection. You're gonna keep rolling them out until at one point you can't anymore and you'll be forced to cover or get assigned. You WILL get assigned on those, and unless you cover subtract your average from the strike + premiums and that's the max profit you'll get. If you have ITM calls, you should hope it tanks.

Honestly if I were you I'd hope it tanks in the short term so I can cover. No use in diamond handing if you're not gonna see any of the profits."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sort of. He wins if it tanks to below his strike but still above his average. It's like an iron condor.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wouldn't buy underlying/write cc in a single transaction regardless. Is this an etrade screenshot? I used etrade for a while a few years ago but transferred out so havent seen the recent UI. Desktop or mobile?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. The volatility is just all over the place. Don't want to hit the reset button after getting gains for the first time.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro if the price drops to 150, 100, 50 that would benefit us bc people would double their positions and the squeeze would accelerate. Let the price drop, I’m still going to buy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk gme could drop below $100 pretty easily lol. Its a bad company
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s excel sheet after downloading past transaction in csv format for GME to think on tomorrow’s game plan.. :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the meantime there's $1000+ a week in covered puts you could be getting, see a dip, sell 150 put, let it expire or buy it back (or next one closer to itm of same day to avoid day trade.) Not financial advice lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh sure but no one gives a shit about the fundamentals of GME lol. I'll bet you a bj from my wife it goes past its old highs before dropping to 100 again ;)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine going to WSB on a GME specific threat and commenting this. What type of crazy narcissist are you?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You better have a real wife.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Theres a reason it had such high short interest, and that would be the fact that it has been a failing company for years. Who knows maybe cohen will change it but right now they aren’t doing good"

To follow up on your comment.  The cost of staff in the office, rent, paying billers (6.5%), utilities, malpractice, medical staff licensing and fees, state fee, DEA fees, continuing education costs, can add up.  Then Uncle Sam wants 40%.  That’s assuming medical school loans are paid, and doesn’t account for life costs like housing, auto, and groceries.  I would not complain if I legit got to pocket $1000 a case.  But sadly not even half that before taxes."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been holding Amyris before the split happened. It’s been a wild ride, but I’m still holding"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats! Do you think it’s finished it’s run or still has some headroom?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dayyyyum, fuck this guy over here."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pfft... Shoulda sold at 420,069"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha . Every other account is 50-60 days old. Do you really think this is working you shills? Grow up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry can’t support Citadel.

But congratulations Sir."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at my last post someone posted some great DD, and there’s a Seeking alpha post I linked somewhere in the thread which goes into all of the spaces Amyris is involved in."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the beginning
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A real OG
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Still room to move at least $50 by EOY IMO.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been swinging it for the past few years, but loaded the boat long last year when I saw a big shift in the co."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Waiting for $420.69....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, cause citadel yolos their life savings on one stock, but thank you sir"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting.... is there a lot more room for growth? I have 10k I’m looking to put in wherever after tomorrow GME earnings, I’ll be putting my whole portfolio somewhere where I could hold for a year"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Really a nice stock. Consistent high growth. Wish I’d found it even 3 months ago. Thanks!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice and fuck you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just the beginning of the upward movement. Read each of the items I mentioned above and you’ll see that there is potential to disrupt almost every sector with their technology.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks I’ll definitely look into it congrats tho that’s insane!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Classic handle and cup pattern
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this. This is some real WSB material. He got loss porn in his gain porn with a loss porn exterior.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait...

Did you *combine* meme stocks and options.

Oh my sweet summer child."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If the pattern continues you’re going to 31k then 125 😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m getting really good at the “buy high, sell low” method!!!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And by Friday 25k
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The big problem is the options
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn bro what did you have?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried 500 € in options. Still have 200 fuck yeah. This ship is going down.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"just starting trading options this week in my third year of investing, lets hope I'm not back with loss porn"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda looks like a toilet bowl if you squint just right.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,positions or ban
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"be safe is an over used cliche.  

i love risk."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This was literally my portfolio
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy 1 at a time for no more than $50

I don't think I'm doing it right"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All I see is a cup and handle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holly shit, how did you gain access my account?! Missing today where I’m down to $100 though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you did it right"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I see the problem. You're using Robin da Hood
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is clearly false. No one learns about options and goes from $2.6k to $22k.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a cup and handle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You cup and handled on your chart 😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like your cup got handled. Sux. But you can always roll em over.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t even want to learn options lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this AMC skit???
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lel
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What are options? I’m still at step one and I am confusion
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Learn about not being a fucking idiot. Your meme is garbage. Fuck you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not a casino
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Once I saw 2 girls shit in a cup
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been making that joke since 15k. The handle is a little too long at this point 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,looks more like a boob to me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone rich needs to Venmo you $100 cause your comment is fucking awesome and on point.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Options on meme stocks before they become meme stocks.  Or puts on meme stocks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m dying
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that miracle happens, I’ll send you 1k for being Nostradamus incarnate and speaking that into existence."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah yes the infamous cup and handlen't
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,3/26 800c on the one and only company should do the trick to perfect this cup and handle.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Chance this is the burner
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My AMCs worked out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If it hits 300 by friday can you buy me a cup of coffee?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,mostly long ITM calls

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Super serious. If I make that much I’ll venmo you. There is a .0000001% chance of that happening but if shit gets squoze enough this week then it may come true. If anyone wants to help me get this guy his 1k, send me suggestions for the week. Idk how I can turn 500 to 25k but if it happens, you’ll make us both very happy"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you meet 25000 of us behind wendies you will have it in no time
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I swing traded $NNDM a couple times. Made decent cash. I want to go back in when a couple of my current positions pay off.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost money on NNDM... then I used the money on GME while at 100. I was able to recoup some.

I'll go back to NNDM once GME hits 1M/share."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok fam, good luck on losing money"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Karma checks out 🤣🤣🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Delete - Bot - Schill - No Karma
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Facebook is just essentially an over-engineered birthday notifier at this point.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  I used to check the FB app multiple times a day, now I only open it if I'm killing time or looking for something on Marketplace.  And I'm old, my kids just look at me crosseyed if I mention FB.  No idea what FB looks like in 5 years.  MySpace part 2?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to be dumb to continue putting money into FB in 2021. Even Instagram is becoming dated and cluttered.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got rid of Facebook over a year ago along with all my close friends. It's nothing but trolls and elderly people now. There is not one thing on FB that's relevant. I used it for the year prior to deletion to follow a couple grilling pages then realized it's much easier to follow a few youtube channels and get my fix without all the drama of FB. 🖕FB
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Zuckerberg is a massive douchebag
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What the heck is this book of faces you speak of?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Deleted my FB last week. The stars are aligning. Puts it is
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t stand Mark Fuckerberg! I hate shorties in most cases but FB deserves what it gets. Just my 🦍tard opinion not investment advice
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Trump social  media. That's sure to be good.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,positions or ban
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope fb fails.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only reason I’m here is cause I was banned over and over for a year from fb. Thanks fuckerburg! 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Im excited to watch Facebook crash and burn. They have over stepped their bounds and have been censoring left and right.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Puts on Twitter, idk about you but I feel like a trump social media site is more of a danger to twitter"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What is Facebook?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 175 and sold at 275... Made about 6gs.  And then made my peace with what ever the price will do after.  I was just sick of riding the waves from bad press.  It's price is highly dependent on people's opinions I give zero ducks about.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao this is the single dumbest bear case for FB I’ve ever seen. Congrats 🎊
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I pulled out of fb when they started censoring everyone. Screw that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"my space, facebook ....who is the next social media leader?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol just said fuck facebook on another dd.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trump social media platform will not replace FB. I hate FB, but there's no way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Facebook is pretty much dying now. It’s trying to stay alive inorganically. Tik Tok is king. One thing I don’t understand is, if your platform is winning big, why let other social media copy your ideas? Literally all of them copied ‘stories’"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you expect FB to crash, why would you sell puts on it?  That seems like some real smooth brain thinking."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trump Social Media will he just like Trump Taj Mahal, Trump Casinos, Trump Steaks, and Trump University. He sucks them dry then moves on, leaving debt and lawsuits behind. 

As far as FB, they're adding 10k jobs and possibly another 5, looking to buy smaller companies/tech, and still has what, 3 billion users? 


Tech stocks may be rounding the corner, and are definitely becoming value stock that are long term wealth builders. After all, the market only goes up! Just look at Momma Cath and her outlook for Tesla.   



But you do you, fellow ape! They're definitely going through enough regulatory lawsuits that puts could definitely pay off in the shorter term. Best of luck to you!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trump who? He is no longer relevant. FB has 20% of their employees working on VR - FB is arguably the best way to play VR.

Long and strong FB."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I only use Face Face Facelook
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So positions aren’t posted anymore?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All I got is puts of FB and If trumps social media goes public…get calls 🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Messenger is half decent
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,God I hope so. The demise of fuckboot would be damn spectacular.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FB is absolute trash. Every time I get so bored and want to open FB, over 60% of the posts are fucking targeted ads and not even my “friends”"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They placed me in fb jail for 90 days before for a post so I haven't been back. Fuk Zuk.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Instagram is facebook. Instagram has not even peaked. FB is a buy as long as IG is a thing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As an oldfuck when it comes to social media stuff, what's the alternative now? Facebook is geezerville, twitter is boomertown, and now I'm hearing IG is ""dated""? What's left, Snapchat? Or is the new generation just moving straight to Onlyfans?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shill / not detected

very effective. just look at our country (PH). they manage to vote the biggest clown"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,can't wait for the IPO
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You weren’t banned. You were liberated.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Both Twitter and Facebook work together so if he takes them both out that's fine by me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, all the Trump apologists left already after he got banned, but I would wager any amount that they are still on Facebook."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah their chart looks super bullish rn...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You are under estimating how many people want a non censored social media platform and if that what he plans on doing people will go to it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No one said anything about replacing. These big tech companies hate sharing market real estate.. thats why they buy all these small companies that do different things. You are an actual retard if you dont think his social media platform will go off the charts with new consumers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I don't think it will take marketshare from FB as well.

Plus they are venturing into so many different fields."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They haven’t hired anyone... I’m willing to bet that spike in job positions is a mistake
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They put me in FB jail for 2 days because I called fagot a very good friend of mine, because that is the way we talk all the time, and FB told me that is not a good word to call a person, WTF?? They gave me a warning first, and then they blocked me, guess what? I deleted the app from my phone,  haven't use it since 2 months ago."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Zoomers moved on to Pornhub comment sections
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Twitter and Snapchat stay pretty busy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Instagram is it. Not dated. Not going anywhere.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL.  still playen some gangster shit on myspace... what i miss?

This. So much this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole point is to avoid segregation of social media by which side of the aisle you fall on. As it stands, one side is being targeted by the side that runs the platforms. And despite what myths get propagated, it's not just the ""crazies"" that are targeted. Segregation by thought is absolutely dangerous, and good on Trump if he wants to push a platform where every way of thinking is welcomed."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh so now you going to bring politics into it but you know politics are not allowed here Define The Crazies..... The people who disagree with you lololol come on man you can't fall for something so stupid
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Heard FB hire ten thousand ape.  Pay two 🍌 per week.  Ape say fuck you I Robot Cuckerberg man.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Small cap stocks aren’t permitted here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RAIL just makes me think of my wife’s boyfriend.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When is the merger and do you get any shares for it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,While it is a decent jump I would hardly call 25 percent the moon
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,OUR wife’s boyfriend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not a merger of the company I own, but others in the train industry, this is good for me since RAIL is a train car manufacturer/refurbisher, which means this will boost their business"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok thanks do you think it’s too late to invest in it or do you recommend I still go in
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is a very volatile stock, look at the 1 year graph, stock moves in a fairly normal pattern. If you can time it right and are willing to hold, then yes"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just here for the answer :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Told my dad I was thinking of investing in this and he looked at me like I was retarded
I mean I am retarded so probably fair"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dad was the same way, given it was at $1.32 a share then, but I had faith in my research and gut feeling and dove in and am now up a crap ton"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m undecided if I should put my money in the garbage disposal or in the fireplace. Either strategy would likely yield better results than today’s foray into suffering.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man fuck this shit wtf, I make back half my losses in a month only to lose that half in the last fucking hour wtf. And I'm still bagholding those TSLA 720 strikes. Shit man fuck me in the ass"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Day 1 of many green days to come. Volatility often makes you think one big green day would be followed by an even bigger red day. Bears believe that and I am sure they loaded up on puts again. But it only works until it doesn't, and quite surprisingly it only works for a short period of time. We have already been going through a highly volatile down trending Nasdaq. But recently there has been more green days than red days. If you are a TA guy, the chart also suggests an inverse h&s breakout. Other reasons to be bullish on Tech right now: Oil not skyrocketing anymore; Yield stabilizing and declining, EU reopening not looking promising in the near term as was originally expected."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The year is 2037. GME is $230 per share.Both sides have held their positions for a decade plus, at a complete stalemate. The trench warfare has led to distinct cultures and ways of life.

Shorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.

GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents’ flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families. The vehicle of choice is a Tesla Short Bus, and everyone prays to Deep Fucking Value each night. He answers their prayers by holding, and they honor him by doing the same."

“The question is frequently asked: Why does a man become a options addict?

The answer is that he usually does not intend to become an addict. You don’t wake up one morning and decide to be a 🌈 🐻. It takes at least three months’ trading twice a day to get any habit at all. And you don’t really know what options sickness is until you have had several habits. It took me almost six months to get my first habit, and then the withdrawal symptoms were mild. I think it no exaggeration to say it takes about a year and several hundred trades to make an addict.

The questions, of course, could be asked: Why did you ever try FD's? Why did you continue trading $SPY and $TSLA long enough to become an addict? You become a options addict because you do not have strong motivations in the other direction. FD's win by default. I tried it as a matter of curiosity. I drifted along making trades when I could score. I ended up hooked. Most addicts I have talked to report a similar experience. They did not start trading for any reason they can remember. They just drifted along until they got hooked. If you have never been addicted, you can have no clear idea what it means to options with the addict’s special need. You don’t decide to be an addict. One morning you wake up sick and you’re an addict. """

That's disappointing because my 3 biggest targets for ""value breakout"" were DIS $200 and VIAC $100 combined with LUMN $15.

I think all 3 stocks had potential for 20% gains after breaking those levels but now it's just DIS chasing $200 and LUMN chasing $15.   Those two should see big momentum buyers roll in after breaking those levels.

Maybe VIAC pulls off a ""full retard"" move like TSLA when they sold extra shares and went up on the news but I doubt value investors ever act like that.  AMC sort of a unique case because it became a meme here."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If AMC could open at $10 that would be great
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is financial advice, BUY GME 🚀🚀🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm an old school wsb investor GME is still the only move.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like everything about GME is negative. All the positive comments are removed
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch hedgies lose money

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still think GME is still overvalued, so I'll probably buy some leaps in the auto sector while VIX is low. Trying to decide which company will produce 3+ quarters of positive earnings and then sell them in 2022."

This is a casino I’m here to make money not hold for eternity."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I admittedly was drawn to the sub because of GME, but had been investing for a couple of years before this. Once GME has run its course im pretty sure most people will lose interest and the sub will return to how it was."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the kind of confirmation bias I like to hear.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A constant stream of mango tweets and increasingly worse covid outlook 😔 truly was the most conductive market environment

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"anything over 100% is pretty high, but certain stocks are just more volatile than others, so sometimes you can get away with it. I'd say it's a good idea to avoid anything over 200% like the plague"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"you got a lot of reading to do more so than just IV at least understand delta and theta in addition before you start buying shit. when the stock price gets fucked you get fucked on options, thats why they make money. youre leveraging 100 shares."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That was my move for today
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a pretty good interview/offer success rate. Best tip - walk the fine line between confidence and cocky as close as you can get. I always mentally tell myself who gives af about this job and you never have to see this people again if you don't want to. Act like you want the job but don't *need* it - they can smell desperation a mile away

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holding 100 shares at $15.98 average like a fucking clown. BB will fly again, just not any time soon."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This place is fawked
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s satire right?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it says ""this is not financial advice"" I immediately disregard everything that was posted. Gotta be a complete tool to think that something you read on WSB is financial advice. Gotta be a complete tool to thinking that saying ""this is not financial advice"" would absolve you from any guilt that would result from the complete lack of fucks the SEC will give about your shitpost.

So baeically ""this is not financial advice"" = retards leading retards."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can hear his neck beard rustling against his moobs.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""If you bought in, its a battle.. a movement""

They can take the social justice bullshit back to fb."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been day trading for past 3 weeks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Choppy market. I go cash gang a lot now.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I recently read an article that showed that almost all the real movement of the market happens when it is closed. It seemed well researched.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,See you on the FD train next week friend

They responded,

 “No not really it was pretty nice you just got to stay away from the 2 city blocks where people are acting like idiots but the rest of the City was actually pretty fantastic” 

Fucking Newsmedia always blowing everything up and over hyping to get people to stay tuned to them and living in fear off everything they say. Clickbait bitches"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,by cockroach do you mean dirty puts? because i got them and i hope so.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,might take awhile but will almost certainly out perform 99% of WSB
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lisa Su will get us there.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,$5 billion shares outstanding will do that to you. Poor investment until they buy back shares. Look at the price for the last 10 years. Hasn’t moved
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes losing all of your money and no more than that is the worst case scenario. AMC is more or less guaranteed to go down but getting the timing right will be very difficult. AMC isn't a good yolo (I say this as someone very bearish on AMC). reconsider.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say what you will, those lacy thongs are *comfortable*."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s after close

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great prediction. The apes in the megathread are convinced retail investors is why the price has so much potential to go up. Whales will determine their risk tolerance and will act accordingly. So when they move their money out of GME a lot of these cultists will be stuck holding the bag wondering why they listened to the DD on here in the first place.   


I'm convinced some of the DD on here in favor of GME is an employee/associate of an institution and not that of a retail investor."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it being manipulated when you were up or when you were down? You're allowed to take profits.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're still up 50 or you're down 350?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you have it any other way? Lol

Put: buyer has the right to *put* the stock up for sale. 

You can reword those in terms of the seller, i.e. a seller of a call has the shares called away and the seller of a put has the shares put into their account, but it's just a convention at this point.

Still kinda retarded because you could interchange them to say the seller of a traditional call is *putting* up the right to buy the stock at the strike price"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao nice tinfoil hat loser
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hot take from the genius here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But surely prices are not where they are now because of earnings expectations? Not sure prices care about earnings at all.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sideways all day close 190-200 Wednesday depends on any positive news about the future of the company.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If I were him I’d hold till the end because I don’t want some angry redditors at my house trying to kill me. He’s smartly already cashed out a lifetime of earnings so it doesn’t matter for him anymore.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Means he's retarded
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He could be just selling calls against it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you think a shelf offering is unlikely? Seems like they’ll need cash for the transition to e-commerce. No position btw

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It'll be interesting to watch. I've stopped trying to predict which way it will go because it is so detached from fundamentals.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get having some GME. 

I get having a lot of it.

Why the hell wouldn’t you leave yourself dry powder for other opportunities though?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The wave of bagholders once GME falls will be quite the sight. Imagine just willingly giving away your stimulus check as your bills pile up lol

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do I unlock this ""ya win some"" mode?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ride my bike all over Portland and the only danger I've been in was when the MAGA crowd came in their trucks and almost ran me over twice that day.  

Your friends are right there's like 2 blocks where the police beat on Antifa. It's hilarious. That people are scared of antifa is extremely funny to me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wendy’s are open late
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeh honestly it’s sucks for AMCers but literally anyone who has a single wrinkle would have seen that coming 

I’m a mega GME bull, been holding since December, and if they announced they were even considering doubling the float with a stock dilution I would get the fuck out and never look back (until the dust settles cuz the cash would boost long term prospects)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not trying to physically drive down the price of the stock, I’m saying there is no possible way a company with their track record can have any sort of long term success."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally the first true statement in this thread.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaahahaa chilll
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Talked to a financial advisor friend of mine and his company’s models say end of summer is the time to get out. So really get out in august before institutions dump

OP...these will print. JD is a $100 stock"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,they’re selling a literal cat in a banana plushie. I don’t see them looting the business and screwing shareholders like AMC management

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,boo? you must mean boo-urns?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I seen a few posts when it jumped from 60-100 then everyone started saying they were buying puts lol.  Now look at that fucker
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This...sounds about right
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha i actually got it during the first wave of pre-orders months ago
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The one thats been sitting on my desk for months says otherwise ;)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wasn’t asking you to lol that’s just what I’m gonna do
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m well aware. No one knows how it will react on earnings. I’m fine losing a couple hundred.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You say that until Porsche reveals they own a 75% stake in NIO.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They already have the existing one, which allows them $100M.  I should add this to the bearish list that they might execute this.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I’m just speculating. Before it use to be so positive. Now I hardly see any. It’s like there’s a diversion
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,bull call spread or FD?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So say we all
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!  Not my post but definitely helpful.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,thank you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lool IV dropped mid day. My average is 1.93. I got 12 contracts. Should be fine tho I hope
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask for a refund. You have 30 days.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""It's up so it's just going to keep going up."""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got burned last week on them. But, I'm kind of tempted to jump into them again. No way it can sustain this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I felt this in my soul
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"sure, but for institutions holding much earlier it's good news to leverage the high stock price. they would be incredibly stupid not to offer shares given how long the 150+ price has lasted. it's basic corporate finance. they need funds to finance a strong showing into e-commerce. gamestock execs don't care about the people trying to participate in the ponzi scheme."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok you convinced me. Happy birthday buddy! 🎉
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindME! 24 hours.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What can I say. Easy come easy go.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m also curious about this split, I keep seeing chatter about this and I’m not sure I understand why it’s being floated as a possibility?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t blame you. Hopefully the finale to the GME saga is this Wednesday.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,..so u mention GME...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,turns out not everyone likes the stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,WE ARE SICK OF YOUR PYRAMID SCHEME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I've learnt about how offsetting works. Turns out that it's offset for the entire year (so if you made $1000 in short term gains, then lost $300, you're only taxed for $700 not $1000 if it's during the year). I was speaking hypothetically because I'm literally 100% in NIO.

So yeah... $NIO better get its butt going."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this is like the rebuildup of GME a few weeks ago. No down days despite the rest of the market... then a week of bleeding
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I haven't paid much attention to what people's thoughts on a split are, but I'm going to assume people want this to happen as it would force accounting for synthetic / fake shares?  My wrinkles aren't very tight on this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss the volatility.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Good luck tomorrow.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Recently bought 18,000 RKT @ $24 even so I hope you're right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"200 @ $26
When is the buyback happening?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,540 shares and approx 15 contracts. This thing is going to moon one way or another....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,25@ 23.50
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"5,101 shares and a ton of calls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 100 at $20; sold 50 at $40; bought 50 at $37; sold 50 at $41; bought 100 at $25.

So overall this stock has been very good to me and I’m ready to ride my 150 shares even higher than the last boom."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,81@ $24.79
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,275 @ $24.00
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went all in, this is an amazing firesale :)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT today looked kinda like AMC on Friday, it got to a solid number and seemed like it was purposefully kept there. I doubled down to lower my average a bit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought shares because I keep screwing myself with call options. I’ve decided I can’t buy for a squeeze every time the idea comes along. The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,65 at $23.62
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100@$30 😩
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,2100 shares @ 23.25

5x 23.39c 
10x 25.89c 
All expiring Friday. 
Will exercise last 18.89c on Wednesday.
And buy more shares with divvy tomorrow."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is a much better company than UWMC and will continue to grow over the next several years. I will be spending my dividends to buy more shares.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail owns about 30% of the stock. Maybe more. Assuming 80% reinvest dividends, we can expect that to account for 1.5-2M of tomorrow’s volume. So that means, between 20-25% of tomorrow’s volume could come from just dividend reinvestment."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100 at $24.60. Just waiting on you beautiful bastards to send it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would it go up when the dividend gets paid and not on the ex div date? Give your orderly his phone back.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's important to say that the payout is tomorrow but you may not get it right away, i know i'm not expecting the divi before wednesday"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think we will ever get enough volume to squeeze lol. We barely break 12m everyday .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your entire portfolio in one ticker? Especially this one...

You got balls son"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Please stop with this BS.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rkt just another distraction
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,52 day old account wow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro. Ex div date was 3/5.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same here holding 3,000 at $24"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"2,600 shares @25 let’s launch this RKT 🚀💎"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"At about noon central, volume was 5.4m. 4 hours later...7.7M. No action to push it up, so I find it impressive it held the $23 (+/- a few cents) line for hours."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We coming back for u buddy 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are not alone, we Apes are with you, I have 23 @$40dlls in one account, and another 30 shares @$25, I haven't learned anything, at this point I dont know if it could reach $40 in the short term, seems like the real value is @$20, but I hope I am not right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow.....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what? There's potential if everyone re-invests their dividend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because there are tons of longs who are going to reinvest their dividends. Just a guess based on the general sentiment I’ve seen on rkt threads
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for pointing that out. Op really has no clue and lowers the quality of this r/
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's payable tomorrow and should be there at 9am
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think people are trying to squeeze this stock. It's a long play. I'm retarded tho so i could be wrong.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It IS wallstreetBETS not wallstreetinvests
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,With reddit yes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I had to change to the 1 minute charts to see the penny movements lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol hourssss
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You needed to have 20 shares to get 1 share essentially.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will go down the amount equivalent to the dividend paid per share. If everyone reinvests their dividends, it will be back to where ever it is today. Isn’t that how dividends work?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,..... a lot of ppl will reinvest these dividends
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"People aren't buying RKT because it's moved sideways since IPO, and CEOs are looking like clowns for calling out shorts when they're fucking them raw. But I still buy calls every week so"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So when you walk into a casino you throw your entire balance on red?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. I thought my chart was broken. Then I thought they stopped trading. First time I've felt panicked over a $0.00 move for hourrrrrrsssss.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes thank you, that is how math works"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the drop of 1.11 happened on the ex dividend date 3/9. The options were also adjusted accordingly to reflect the dividend price
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just turn your screen 90 degrees to the left. 

I am not a financial advisor."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not sell far OTM covered calls and profit instead?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't know why all the downvotes probably because it's not GME or AMC... 

But yea that's how this sub operates.  Usually through options but stonks approved with enough money's involved"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s funny how the movement in price is pinned in specifically during trading hours when... you know options are traded lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell? You mean own shares sir this is a casino.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, most people don’t just yolo their entire savings on one ticker. Those are few and far between but I’ll admit they are the funnier ones to see."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my bad I didn't realize you only like to lose money. Gotcha.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,See the thing with options is.. you may lose a lot of money until that one goes through And before you know it you didn't lose shit and you have a fat profit. But keep holding until 2050 brother you got this lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you unironically retarded? 

I'll keep collecting that sweet premium for those far OTM options you're buying and if it moons and it's exercised I still win and the dummy that exercised will be holding the bag after it drops.

The only situation I lose is if the stock drops more than my short call premium's are getting

Lol imagine thinking you can't hold shares and still do options. All you're doing is buying a lottery ticket. I'm selling you that ticket on top of any other profit. So who's really winning here?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The good old fire your 10k highest paid employees and replace them for cheaper strategy from the Zucc
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They need more folks to spy on your cookies!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably means they're getting ready to fire 15,000 people."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck facebook.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do people even still use Facebook?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They need 'em to investigate all the ads I report as 'Misleading or Scam.' I wouldn't trust any business that advertises on FB.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What kind of jobs? Developers or moderators ? They might be hitting people to push moderation because parler issue was lack of moderation so cuck can be eyeing perspective of crackdown on fb.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The only job worse than this is AT&T customer service.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something to do with theta, Apple is possible on board and Sony is on board I think they are gonna go all out on it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it will short tomorrow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They might be doubling down on VR following the success of the Quest 2
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe they will finally make a customer service center that you can call and talk to a real person
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They finally decided to implement the dislike button.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well they need people to run all the new programs that mind control everyone from the covid-19 vaccine.  Say hello to your new overlords  


\*puts tinfoil hat back on\*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They have 20% of their employees working on VR currently. This hiring will just widen their current moat as the VR leader. Facebook is going to be the leader in AR/VR.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably expanding the Ministry of FactCheckers in preparation for Biden's scheduled ""retirement"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t match for the amount of people that are closing their account left and right on Facebook, Which I’m sure they will never speak about."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Converting their temp agency headcount to full time?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re grabbing up anyone interested before Trump launches his new social platform.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL right, sadly probally true"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Like everything else... prolly farm those jobs offshore.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😆 There aren't that many conservatives in all of California
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats it! Im taking them out the oven now.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They found that 10k conservatives work at facebook and they are cleaning house, LOL"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They suck. 

But they also remove and report the most child porn BY FAR among ALL big tech companies. More than the rest combined including google."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried doing business a couple if times. Both companies stole my money both times. Never again.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you forgot about AOL customer retention. Kept my grandpa on the phone for an entire day. Seriously. That dude's entire shift was talking to my grandpa trying to wear him down so he would hang up. Read him word for word contracts, terms or service agreements, transcripts of the call the call."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, and obligatory requirement to apply for a job position: positive test on covid"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I for one welcome our new semi benevolent overlords
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because you put words together doesn’t mean they make sense.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have... it’s in their filings.

Some whiny Karens in North America aren’t changing the momentum of the company. 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when you pay folks a shit ton of money then tax the hell out of them?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This would not surprise me at all.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha, now THAT is a goddamn joke. That explains all the sexbots latetly"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must also receive 5 vaccines, wear 3 masks, sanitizer bath on entry, and lastly here is your personal bubble that you can roll around in"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was saying, using slightly fanciful language, that they are hiring more ""fact"" checkers to fight ""misinformation"" related to Biden who may soon be removed via 25th amendment.

It shouldn't have been hard to understand."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s true
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I live under a rock, why would he be removed?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude this forum has been infested by q-anon retards, trump fan retards, and normal republican retards. They are pushing conspiracy theories..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"His rapidly declining health? A border crisis orders of magnitude worse than anything under trump?  Both things becoming major stories in spite of the media's best efforts.  

Prior to this election, the democrats were very vocal about the 25th amendment, and fairly vocal about removing the nukes from Biden after the election, so the idea of them removing him from office to save face and place a hand picked vp that would never have made it through election process is quite reasonable. 

It was also widely believed that Biden was merely a delivery vehicle for Harris, and that he has always been planned to be removed (supported by his has repeatedly calling her the  president, and even saying in an interview that he would resign and blame it on health reasons if they ever had a serious difference of opinion)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This whole place has been ruined.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bless your heart.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Truth is rough to tell, it's why the media [brags](https://time.com/5936036/secret-2020-election-campaign/) about no longer dealing in it. But I just can't deal in lies. Thanks for the blessing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember buying 500 shares at $1.90 and thinking “man this is risky” that was like earlier THIS year.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So the company produces extremely bearish signals and you decide that this is the point to catch the knife?

Power to you, if it works.

But... CEO gifts some 750k shares away on Friday to his relatives (who don't have to file if they sell, IIRC). Great timing.

And yall literally just voted on AMC proposing to dilute shares for a ~~first~~, ~~second~~, ~~third~~, ~~fourth~~, *fifth* time in 12 months.

Until the company produces *a valuable promise of a ROI + boon for days* i absolutely do not understand why anyone would participate in such a selfless charity stock.

Reopening business as usual and sacrificing share holder's value is not the way.

You're a sheep, walking to slaughter.

Don't just downvote me, because you don't like seeing that. I'm not a shill. I'm just someone with a perfectly valid and reasonable opinion based on what they're seeing. And I don't like seeing the absurd hype behind it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing the lords work
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the same order for 1000 shares. You never know
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🙌🌝
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold that mess I’ll come back at it later
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you made 0.20 a share but I’d get out asap
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc does not equal GME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Downvotes incoming...theaters may be opening, but there will be no soppy cups of coke for $10 or 2 heavily salted kernels of corn for $15."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was in at $7. I felt the same way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dilution here is appalling, was nice of the CEO to acknowledge the meme movement but that’s like saying thanks for the Pump, watch me Dump."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[CEO Gift Link... I had to look this up. wow](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1032673/000141157921000025/xslF345X03/primary_doc.xml)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s hilarious is people trying to say he bought the shares LOL.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,amen
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny how dumbasses come in here not realizing this is r/wallstreetbets and not r/investing. 🙄
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My understanding is that the vote for dilution is in May
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes you do.

Yes you do know.

If Gamestop announces tomorrow/Wednesday that they are diluting shares... I AM GONE.

Lmao."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He bought them days earlier, before the run-up"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly (forgot to add “at the current price!”)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m right there with ya!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RALLY THE TROOPS FOR TOMORROWS VOLUME

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shiill


Shiiiiillllllll"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No you’re holding cause you’re bag holding right now😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shilllss everywhere!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is pure scam... It is not GME.

GET OUT !"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying shares is a yolo ?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bag holding would imply he bought it at the high when it was going for $40. At an average cost of $25.86 they are far from that mark.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You think RKT is overvalued? 🤔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not GME it must be a pump and dump or a shill, right?

This isn't GMEBets."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,*sigh* Yolo's used to be weekly FDs super OTM.  Now with all the new people we get STOCKS.  I guess I'll take it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s easier to say you’re here for the long haul when you’re in the red
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve been a 🌈🐻 for 4 years?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do know these ETFs are not long term holds, right? They have parasitic losses baked in to them."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sucks to be a 🌈🐻.  

Sincerely,
🌈🐻"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very retarded. I like it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Still losing money even after the covid drop in 2020. That's some cold shit.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, just the nature of that ETF makes it go down everyday. I would not hold for years, next time haha"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol 🤷‍♂️.  All my other positions are longs that I don't intend to sell, I consider this one more of a hedge.  Maybe makes me half 🌈🐻?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, 100% aware.  Life happens, and you forget about things a bit, but then every time you check in, your thesis still fits... sort of like that toxic girlfriend you always told yourself you wouldn't keep around long, but then 5 years later, there she is."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😂🤣😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It makes you a 👋🐻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is that I should bend over for Daddy Musk and get reamed by TSLA puts again?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically I should have sold my tech stocks already? I guess I will be holding bags for the next year then.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good shit. 

I was talking to my tech friends on Saturday. Their portfolio is pretty much all in RSUs (restricted stock units) that their companies give them and other various tech stocks. I warned them back in 2018 a few months before the correction and I am warning them again. Are they gonna listen to some economist that works for a bank? Nah.

I'm currently about 50% value stocks, 25% SPACs with covered calls, 20% tech stocks, and 5% precious metals. I expect a small disruption on my tech stocks, but higher interest rates will mean value stocks with good dividends and strong P/E ratios will perform better."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very interesting and exhaustive explanation. If I may add: Joe Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus proposal prompted investors to believe that inflation might rise dramatically in the coming years and this has sparked a huge sector rotation among professional investors. The latter meaning that large funds began dumping growth stocks (like technology) and buying instead cyclical stocks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we hit 2% on 10 year yields and that's where I buy tech and speculative stocks again. Though Tepper seems to think 1.75% is the equilibrium but he assumes the Japanese will buy our bonds (except I think they just tightened their own recently). I think the Fed doesn't mind some market bubbles popping here or there so long as the blue chips hold up. They'll sit on the sidelines until the DJIA starts sliding too much.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Auction was worse just before the election.  If it goes to 99.2 or 98.xx would be a bad sign
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this good for my oil/energy calls? XOM and XLE 4/16 and 5/21 down huge on both positions
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,where are the damn emojis?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,what is this wallstreetboomers?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How high do you think inflation will get? The Philadelphia Fed Survey of Professional Forecasters have us hitting 2.75 on the very high side with a median around 2.3 for the next 10 years. 

I know JPow and friends are aiming to balance inflation out at 2% but this doesn’t seem all that scary. Will suck for a little bit but long term it’s nothing too spooky"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Next time emoji
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only way to do it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks are fine. Options are kinda dangerous. It's not going to be like 2000 hopefully because these are real companies making real money.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the bond world where I come from, there's a slight nuance to that: inflation is expected to rise dramatically from 2023 onwards (when JPOW is free to raise rates or is forced to). The curve is going to look really weird... up to 2, 3 years it's flat and then just explodes upward. I'm expecting every tenor after 2023 is going to 🚀, which is bad for all investment."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm 100% buying AAPL after the tantrum dies down. Rising yields are not bad for the market. Just violently rising yields.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So this isn’t a casino ?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so market expecting rates/infkation to rise dramatically after 3 - years. Isn t that going to be bad for housing, I suppose mortgage prices will shoot up and those who hold a floating rate mortgage better swap it to fixed rate immediately?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold some puts for aapl. Might let them exercise depending on how aapl holds up from here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah bro, casinos make money. This is more like a back alley dice game."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess you can say it's going to be like an ARM loan curve, but with the entire economy. In all honestly, it won't be that bad because the Fed could just simply raise the short end of the curve by selling, taking that money and buying the long end."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we know when this will be available on VHS?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Add a planet of the apes scene at the end with Caesar and this would seriously be the best movie trailer ever in the history of history.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ugh. UWMC is not a squeeze, it's not a meme, it's not a p'n'd. It's a value play from fundamentals, and no one should be buying into it unless they can afford to wait several weeks.  


If anything, the stock needs less attention, since every over-the-hill losing-their-edge greyhaired analyst loves fucking over WSB darlings now that it's a household name."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It has a low float, yes. Gamma squeeze.... no. Short squeeze, really doubt it. Its a good long term play if you have money to invest and wait. And by invest, I mean buying shares, not retarded options. 

With that said, this is wsb, so fuck investing. Start buying FD's. 

Seriously though I know there's about 8 million noobs reading these things and thinking ""easy money"" ... it's not, it's a good long term play (investment) or a gamble. 

Positions: I've been selling CSP's because if I get called on I don't mind holding for the long term, and then selling Cc's against it as time progresses."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Begging for a stock to be shared and get more exposure in the TLDR lol what happened to negation of P’N’Ds

least Matt can do is send me some of those kilo's of coke he does on the daily."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> What this stock really needs is exposure. If you believe in it and think it’s undervalued, **you can share $UWMC posts or make your own DD to give this stock more exposure.** 

Why do you believe in UWMC? You have provided some TA but literally no information about the stock at all."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said it already on threads for $AMC and $GME, I'll say it again and again

DAILY SHORT VOLUME IS MEANINGLESS FOR ESTIMATING SHORT INTEREST

Look at all stocks ffs. Every - single - stock is expected to have a daily short volume in the 30%-40% range. Why is this? You need to understand how market making works. Market makers basically hold no shares, ever, and do their money on spreads. When you either buy or sell stock, your most likely counterparty is an MM. When you buy, the MM will \*short\* the stock and wait around for a seller willing to sell for a penny less than you bought. Once said seller comes in, MM covers their short. Daily short volume still shows 1 short.

Hence, 30%/40% short volume is normal and healthy for a stock. This happens all day long, many, many times during the day.

Now, if a stock had a 50%+ daily short volume, well, that's another story of course"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't read shit, but I'm still in and will continue buying at this price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I've bought quite a few shares (for an amateur) because I think they have legs long term as a solid investment.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Im patiently waiting for $UWMC to moon. My calls have been bleeding enough for this month.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo dog, not everything is a squeeze. Don’t muck up a legit fundamental play with #trending words. What’s your position, I’m guessing you are stuck high when people were looking for a bargain RKT during that hype"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it just me or at some of the 4/16 calls pretty cheap?

For example the 9c 4/16 is going for 0.65 right now but at the currently traded price the options calculator says it should be worth 0.88"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Low float means the stock is easily to manipulate which is why we have seen a bunch of bots pulling the UWMC ticker for the past 3 weeks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Daily short volume has nothing to do with a squeeze. That’s mostly intraday trades. UWMC has a short interest of like 10%, that’s not really interesting. There’s some very good squeeze candidates out there if that’s what you’re looking for (looking at you ASO). 

UWMC is a multiple week play in an undervalued company. It’s not a get rich quick play.

Disclaimer I’m in UWMC and ASO"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,In for 8600 shares. Huge fan of this stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm getting major ""boomer shill trying to talk like WSB retards"" vibes.

Don't get me wrong, I think UWMC is a good value play and I hold 1,000 shares but the ridiculous CEO, bots and shills, and cool-guy posts like these are huge red flags."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Quite a nice recovery today I'll say. Glad to see everyone still sees all the value. Earnings are the beginning of May so don't put call players out of the money just yet. I am sure they're going to have another record quarter.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao 39? By when, 2045?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys look silver squeeze!!!
No? okay how about... $RKT!!! *jingles keys*
Ok fine.. $UWMC??"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You lost me at UWMC.  900 @8.45
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If the CEO was in such an ass hat and a grifter I would definitely consider investing
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Since it is not entering Russell I think it will be stagnated a little more
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,forget not the 4.56% divy on this while we are at the whole investing thing...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahhahahaa. No.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a genius. UWMC is the Way. Most shareholders are long term too. Pays fat dividend.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some 7.50 calls so squeeze away!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1000@9.05
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If you are here for an option play, this is the wrong place. You will most probably get burned.

too late!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dunno bout that squeeze, but I’m long on UWMC."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also the 10k and 8k filings released just hours ago are $$$$$ more buys at $8 for $UWMC
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a position and is a great play.  The most important thing is outstanding shares.  Will 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah.... I’ll just hold for the 4.56% dividend

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how waiting several weeks has become a fundamental value play here 🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously. UWMC is my breaking point when it comes to giving the meme stock crowd sympathy. Stay the fuck away from this quality stock with good ole fashioned fundamentals. STAY. AWAY.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't really know why people are marketing it as a squeeze. There simply is not enough elements of a squeeze, it will not squeeze.

I'm in it for 240 pieces @8,96 and I'm definitely expecting to wait months for any tendies to come out of it. Balance sheet looks good, future of the company looks good. It should be a pretty boring ""play"" as it will steadily raise it's value."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">no one should be buying into it unless they can afford to wait several weeks.

lol i like the timeline"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,several weeks? man here i was thinking it was a year or more play... it'd be great to see it in a few weeks but I'm still hesitant about that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, the less reddit talks about a stock, the less it gets fucked with."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weeks? I am in on this till Dec/Jan.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been wheeling UWMC for a few weeks now and making awesome premiums, selling monthly 7.5p and 11c, buying back at 50% profit and making a few hundred bucks a week on \~10k at risk."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, if they want to make the price pop, my $9 CCs just expired so I could use the boost in premium for the next round. Today wasn’t the day for it, but it did recover nicely from the housing shortage news."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Et tu, ThetaGang?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy knows what’s up, I guarantee he makes money at this. Seriously all you noobs better listen."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep! the 39$ price target guy! had several parts of stupid DDs repeating the same crap. Had some 5 part DD with no useful info whatsoever and chart scribbling. Please donot confirm your “bias” with this guy. Will post his other account series shortly 😂

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"i'm down half my portfolio due to bad FOMO strats, but I'm also doing fine on my August $9 calls and January 2023 $7 calls. Premiums are still dirt cheap so ITM calls with long expirations are still pretty legit in my eyes. Ofc buying shares is great at this price range but I'm trying to do quick turnovers for compounded gains atm. Only reason I use long expirations because I want to outlast the market manipulators"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If this is the poster in thinking of they have older DD's. It also mentions that in this post.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All these UWMC’s information is fucking crap... the only words they know is squeeze and good fundamentals and they don’t show the fucking fundamentals. I’m surprised if any of anyone bought in without being paid by shills.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's all it said anyways
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Join the gamble if you like the price of entry and have some balls. I don’t have balls but I do have a smooth brain so I still bought.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yea i got those but paid $1.00 - was really nice and green last week when SP went briefly over 10 but did not sell waiting for more upside on the Russell catalyst - well that's what i get for not having exit strategy ...

Is it even real DD if you don't say ""squeeze"" in it?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It will probably do a spike like RKT then go boomer for a decade.

Bought more calls today in prep for the possible spike tomorrow. Let’s hope my luck holds with high risk high reward gambles 🥴

Positions: 
13 3/26 39.89c 
3 3/26 33.89c
2 3/26 24.89c 

I can taste the red crayons already 😋"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's some more RKT fuel for you: change in open interest on 3/26 calls from Friday to today.

* 22.39 +100
* 22.89 +400
* 23.39 +1500
* 23.89 +300
* 24.39 +300

* 27.89 +1500
* 28.89 +200
* 29.89 +300
* 30.89 +1100

That's 7900 OTM contracts that are new today. Given RKT's low delta, that's probably another 500k shares that have not been purchased if a gamma squeeze happens. Sadly, I forgot to SS the OTM puts so can't be more accurate.

There is 74% institutional ownership, so using that as a proxy for dividend reinvestment with 113M shares float, that's 4M shares that need to be purchased. 

Shorts have obtained shares that are about inline (6M vs 4M) with dividend reinvestment purchases, so hopefully we get someone buying in heavy tomorrow (share buyback maybe?). Shorts will be out of ammo and MMs will have to buy shares. If a bill appears for first time home buyer credit, that will also do it.

Hopefully the tendie gods will show us favor tomorrow."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""But's I'm a long-term investor, it's a great company, I don't want it to become a MEME stock...""

Here's what bothers me about this argument. It ALREADY IS severely undervalued. Doordash has a current market cap of \~$43Bn. Rocket is at $45.62Bn. You're telling me the most important mortgage company in America, that has no signs of slowing down with the post-COVID rally of people buying homes, is only worth \~$2Bn more than a food delivery company? If it was 100% higher in market cap, you could still argue it is undervalued at it's current rate of profit and future growth. 

If people do reinvest their dividend tomorrow + a few other lurkers jump in - this could not only be a gamma squeeze, but the elevated price could stick and the shorts will have to step away from the stock.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recommend not choosing a mortgage lender based off their stock market activity. Once you realize their closing costs and interest rates are higher than most local banks, you’ll choose a different lender. 

RKT is good because of convenience and they don’t sell loans but people who do their research/shop around typically don’t go with them. 

As an investment, the stock has potential. Their market share will likely grow. Now that rates have increased, people won’t refinance away from them. However they will be able to survive when rates go up and enroll new clients where as smaller lenders might struggle. I own about 100 shares, I plan on increasing it a little bit. If they have a run up like last time, I’ll be selling."

Devil's advocate: You've got it backwards; it's the other way around. DoorDash has absolutely no business being valued at $43B and is severely overpriced.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I definitely think we'll get it soon. We have to fight for it though. I've been seeing a lot of shilling for UWMC and hate on RKT for no reason. We have to be out there explaining the difference.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I'm sure they have, in fact I've seen posts about it. But they had choices to make. RKT was on WSB radar BEFORE the GME pop, that means the calls that were sold were Pre-GME. They had a choice to short to prevent the calls from being in the money Friday. Just because you see something doesn't mean you can prepare for it. No matter what they do, a large influx of ~$160 mm will be difficult to stop, especially when you've spent all the ammo defending the calls that were expiring last week."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure there are several reasons, but the top 2 in my opinion is they were caught off guard by the astronomical earnings they reported and have been scrambling since. Second, the interest rate concern, which is a legit concern but RKT has been successful private company through much much worse economic conditions and succeeded.  Speculative reason - there is a rumor that big daddy Dan was caught with a few of the HFs wives, but I can't confirm this"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold it like a peeled banana.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's largely my point, DRIVE it into the stock, I'm not trying to get a nicer price per share, I'm trying to bust the shorts so more people will notice RKT. When more people notice RKT and research them (like myself), they will get their mortgages and car loans through RKT. This, going forward, increases the value of the rest of my investment. I may lose a few dollars on the shares I purchase with the dividend, but my other shares will benefit. This is only unique to RKT and GME because the retail investors that invest in them are also the consumers of their product i.e gamers and first time home buyers."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly don't know. I'm sure it depends on your broker. I tried to set up auto re-invest with mine but I wasn't able to. Give them a call would probably be best.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't choose RKT based on stock market activity. I researched them after noticing them on WSB. I like what I've seen, their leadership, their culture, their integrity, the ratings that the CEO has received, how they treat their employees, how they treat their customers. 

I don't believe everything is a race to the bottom, you may save some money but when something goes wrong, maybe you're having payment problems, whatever the case, having someone who will actually handle the problem is important, as opposed to just being on hold and being passed around for hours.

I, and I think many in my generation, would pay a premium for that. 
Thing is, you would never know that unless you did the research. You definitely don't know that just from seeing ads."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"after the Expected Dividend date, because anyone holding before that point would receive the dividend. This is the the dividend payment date, which, if everyone just took the cash payment, would not normally affect the stock price. I think RKT is in a special position that most if not all the dividend will be re-invested."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Already did on ex dividend date
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, did I not put that?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see what you mean, but you would have to understand the specific circumstances that RKT is in to know the nuance. It isn't just another stock, the insiders own something like 95% of the stock and they haven't sold any since the lockup expiring. When you do further research, you realize that's it not about the money with them, they are passionate about growing the company and restoring Detroit (Esp. Dan Gilbert, the founder and majority shareholder).

So I imagine you're saying that once the Re-investment starts, people would start dumping their shares and there would be a larger pool to borrow from, but the reality is wallstreet, for one reason or another, has severely mispriced this stock. People who bought it know this, insiders know this, hell, even the shorters know it, but they can't let it go up because too many calls have already been sold. 

The fair value of the stock (given current market conditions) is actually a lot higher, so no, I don't believe anyone will be dumping their shares of an undervalued stock. 

Of course, I could be wrong, that's why I don't recommend just buying weekly or just options. Shares at this point are a no brainer to me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, you really don't know anything about RKT then."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didnt know special divs werent auto reinvested. Thanks for the heads up. 
Ill probably only be able to buy one with what im getting but meh. Ones one"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct, special dividend does not qualify for a automatic re-investment. Most, however, will re-invest because it's clear that the price is being suppressed. Price suppressed means great entry point. $160mm entering means price goes up. Like I said, I don't recommend options play only, shares are the way to go."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well technically... neither you nor I could recommend it 😉 GL my dood
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooph, good luck man, that's why I say shares. Options have cost me a lot too, (Had about 80k of options expire worthless last week on RKT), but damn when it hits just right it hits so good."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. I bet tomorrow we will see more volume since people will be spending their divs on more shares
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually agreed with your comment. Millennials/Gen Z would definitely step in if the rally is strong enough and the shorts have to dip away. And why wouldn’t they, as it made over $9BN in net income (!) last year (it’s frustrating that this has to be repeated over and over again).

This is a profitable business in an important market segment for the foreseeable future of Americans who want to own their own homes. It would make sense to shut down the shorts who want to keep this down.

For those who are comparing it to GME and/or saying don’t reinvest, it could be:   
\-Shorts who don’t want to see a rally   
\-Institutional investors/retail investors who want to keep buying low for the next few months until Q1 earnings when this inevitably takes off

But like you said...I’m ready for a YOLO tomorrow. Fuck waiting. Fuck the shorts who have made RKT shareholders miserable for months. Let’s bring this stock to value. $50/$60 tomorrow, I will not feel bad at all for the shorts. A $100Bn+ valuation for a powerful real estate giant in the US does not keep this company at overvalued territory."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats an apple taste like?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are most certainly not reading that right...
It’s time for you to google “options”"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, you are definitely right with the 95% insider holdings and buying shares could also be fine. But I don't see the parabolic curve you assume.

So I just want to warm people not to buy any fancy calls like 50 USD in a week or so."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know it's a pipe dream to think it will ever go up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"it made 100+M in net income.

the other incomemis listed as managed assets due to share structure.

need to understand the share structure to be ok with why this isnt moving right now."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Purple.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Red or green?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,how exactly do you read this?  he has a fraction of an option at a strike price that doesn't exist? hahaha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and I agree with you. I've also been warning people to not buy options and shares instead. As for the Parabolic move, I think that's a possibility simply because the Options chain is still loaded from last time. I genuinely believe that even a move to $50 would be justified because of the passion and leadership I've seen in this company and where they are heading in the future, but of course I wouldn't suggest to anyone to expect that kind of move in a week."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Curious, why would income from non-controlling interest be an issue?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,importer/exporter?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sigh....plz go look at the options chain b4 you start commenting. He clearly said that he bought a call contract for 94 cents a share or $94 for the contract to buy 100 shares. And he got it at a $25.85 strike price. For those who have seen the options chain for RKT, the MM’s have created multiple options for us to purchase. Including $25.85. It doesn’t just go $24, $25, $26."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"rocket companies only owns 3% of RHI IIRC.

so shareholders right now get 3% of the umbrella of 14 companies. the biggie is quicken.

until the umbrella is rolled out to rocket companies the share price can be easily manipulated.

if the shares are introduced to the public through insitutional investment then they have a price tag.

longs are waiting for Dan to 'sell his shares' (at higher valuation)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"can you look up and tell me where the 25.85 strike price is?  all my RKT options have ended in .39 or .89.  i got his point a while ago, you don't need to be so smug while you are also wrong.  maybe you should go look at the options chain.

I have 500 shares @ 22.99 and 10 3/26 24.39 call options"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Anddddd I’m sorry. I was being an asshole. Exhausting day watching my Tesla calls go from being up 200% to down 30%. U r obviously right about the options chain. My bad.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the response. Good luck this week
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"no worries, i know the feeling, hope they bounce back tomorrow for you!  cheers"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would seem to be the note of movement is what caused the tweet, not the other way around. For the SEC intern in the crowd"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,now if they could all tweet around 3pm tomorrow that'd be great
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for putting this together!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t buy Facebook on principle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guy bought calls on the discovery channel, you truly are an ape..."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why fuck me?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Call options? I bought calls on both companies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d rather not invest in something like Facebook principle b4 money
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,laugh all the way to the bank bruv
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a saying around here. Or I guess it was a saying. You're supposed to ignore the fuck you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure - how does that work?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That and their intentional manipulation of their platform  https://techcrunch.com/2014/06/29/facebook-and-the-ethics-of-user-manipulation/
So no I don’t like Facebook I believe it’s an unethical company and has been for a very long time.  Claiming ownership to photos posted on their platform, to their data mining without your knowledge those are just the tips of the icebergs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you not like facebook?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You just buy and sell them like shares. What trading platform do you use? You really don't know what calls are?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This  explains it very simply...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you live under the rock?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I read a huge explanation piece on them but was advised they can be danger zone
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No what are they doing with your data that you don't like?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you can lose 100% of your investment. But if your right you can make +1000% returns.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whenever you find the time, watch this my fellow ape

I watched it twice over the weekend now I’m super smarter 🦍🖍🖍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you direct message me bud - smooth brain ape would like to develop wrinkles
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks buddy you da man
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I turned 50k into about $400 when I first discovered options many moons ago. Be careful.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smart move, it's cheap right now"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup it goes like this
GameStop won’t stop, buying GameStop!!! Why? Cause I like this stock!!! Wit Diamond handz and rockets ships apes goes bananas for a moon landing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes sir, it says cash don’t it?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy some more to bring your price down. I’m retarded cause I keep buying more and my price per shares keep going up, but it’s ok."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you insist😏😏
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's see your PUTS, then.

Then again, this is not financial nor medical advice ;)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't be scared of stores closing .
Starbucks is consolidating their brick and mortar as well.

I could see GameStop becoming Lego in the video game space and making their retail an experience.

I would love to see GameStop focus on becoming the #1 destination for online video game retail whether it be digital or physical, and invest in the growth of e-sports with a possible cross promotion with AMC to outfit one theatre in each AMC with hardware to make and e-sports Arena!

I like the stonk"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great move, amc is liquidating non-income producing assetts, smart move. So let's give the execs another bonus, lol..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A simple Google search will show they are closing hundreds of stores this quarter. Save your gas money
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀📈
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. RadioShack shuts down most of their stores in prep for e-commerce. They will be back bois
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice shitpost lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Cut costs = 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's so much truth here, I'm dying."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have mentioned before I’m a Landlord of 5 GameStop in 3 states. This is standard and nothing at all to worry about. Even the best retailers shed anywhere from 5% of their physical locations annually.  Either consolidation / overlap. Etc ... what I was looking at is creating a WSB Financial Franchise office. Staffed by a local ape who has intimate knowledge of the trade area. Think Liberty Tax. The good folks cranking out 100 returns an hour offering nothing but the finest in tax and financial guidance. Could open 250 per year and have over 1000 local branches in 4 plus years.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"One kidney, half my liver, an eye, a testicle, some of my colon, ive got plenty of skin... yeah. I'm with ya!

Edit: do they still give money for sperm? Wasting plenty of that if that's the case 😂🤣😂😭"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish DD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry lad, I'm in on GME but this is not a DD."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Clearly, the pivot to e-commerce is moving faster than any of us expected and this thing is going to take off any day now."" next thing he knows ... GME goes bankrupt"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"SCREENSHOT x 200,000 bananas"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was one by me that closed.  Always seemed like a bad location to me.  Main Street, bars and restaurants  everywhere.  Sure lots of foot traffic, but real-estate prices insane and shitty parking.  Not somewhere I want to do a quick pickup.  If I was out for the food and drinks, I probably wouldn't stop in at that time.  Still a few others pretty close."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The level of sarcasm I was sensing in this post almost had me questioning my assumptions BUT it did not succeed
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No need for R&D, game stop doesnt make anything, they are a middle man, and not even a good one at that (price/locations).

I dont know how you guys like this stock but please dont think its value is based on anything concrete."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to find your mom at your house last night but unfortunately she wasn't there, so she must have been fucking someone else"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It took Starbucks what like 2 yrs during the recession to rebound ?  This is with a consolidation of brick & mortar.  

Buy more. NOW"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel as though there was more DD in this post than at least half of the DD posted here. As far as the efficiency of the data gathered, very low. Def could've just called around and gotten the same DD in less time, or even more DD!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Starbucks is closing stores, it's not because they're transitioning to ecommerce lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're close, But almost there....

Gamestop would host co-ordinated local, state and national LAN tournaments in their stores and the events shown in AMC theaters."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Starbucks is only closing locations that have poor take-out capabilities. They actually plan to open more stores that have drive-thrus and cater to take-out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,no one is scared. its a good thing lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Starbucks is going waht now?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish AF
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on Circuit City?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"&#x200B;

They don't buy retarded sperm. Sorry, I know, it sucks for all of us."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,None of this happened. This is a certifiable shitpost.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you're right.  

Gamestop closing stores isn't 100,% because of a shift to online either.

GameStop like Starbucks was way oversaturated with brick and mortar locations.

Consolidation is a great tool for franchises to get back to profitability."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ypu dont like e-coffee?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as they sell Crayola at the concession, I'm in"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I live within 5 miles of at least 4 different GameStop’s. I do not live in a big city. This many GameStop’s are not necessary. I’d rather they close a couple and focus on improving the rest.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think e-sports is a key area for GameStop to grow and literally cement their position as a video game lifestyle brand by offering a destination and experience.

I also see it as a cheeky opportunity to work with AMC.

Imagine signing up for a GameStop gaming league, qualifying in store and then competing in special events and championships at a movie theatre arena."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only people who drink-in buy 1 small americano then use the free WiFi for 6hrs anyway.

I should know, I'm one of them."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I could be making bank on $CUM but my wife won’t let me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"💯 there isn’t a need for a gme every 10 miles at all. Close em up and make help pull more profit

At least by me there was"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed.  
Fewer and larger shops + a strong online presence is the way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Find a way to adapt the magic the gathering style of in store participation and sales to video games.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GGL I can already see it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fr 
I always thought it was stupid to have multiple gamestops close to each other. Often times I find them near a Walmart too. Like I'm going to stop at game stop if I am already going to Walmart that has all the games anyways.

I look forward to the new and improved gme"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re called Internet cafes. They pretty profitable in the rest of the world.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Losses will now be known as Melvins
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm not touching a stock that just had a 130% run up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, where was the DD ***before*** the explosion?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"9,223B M cap with a net income before taxes of ~6M. Valuation is beyond wild."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Loaded up on April puts, that rally is unsustainable."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Will be down 150% tomorrow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets, Too late
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this dd would've been nice a week ago
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1 karma lol and first ever WSB post bahahaha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mentioned this months ago and no one batted an eye. Already made $2000 day trading shares since Thursday, I think it’ll kiss $150 today and I gotta say April  $100 puts are tempting and cheap

Disclaimer: I had no fucking idea what they did when I following all I saw was a nice chart and read it was a formal Google director, that was enough to entice my smooth brain, get it? Cause I’m retahhhrrded"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid company with profitable and scalable business but the valuation is wild. Atleast it makes money unlike so many other tech and AI companies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hesussss
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes - yes, i've been trying to drop a comment on this here little thing here n there; it's been blowing my puts out of the water since last week ; i just can't catch a break w this one :)))"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Possible gamma squeeze tho almost all of the april calls are ITM max cal is $185
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this seems to be a case of ‘shorted for a reason’
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,May I offer you to touch PUT?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kfbo2i/upstart_upst_ai_lending_ipod_1216/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then you should load up on PUTs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"and he's saying ""no ones talking about this stock"" - after looking at WSB for 3 seconds"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought an 100 April Put at lunch time for $4.50. Sold it for $7.00 35 minutes later. Ape see chart like hockey stick -> putz.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the stock but the recent run and cheap puts seem worth it, 1 $100 April put for fun, if it tanks it’s an easy $8-9k"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"i've tried like three times already started last week when i thought the 120 was high, then today i thought - no this can't sustain 140-150 range and additional 30% run up on Monday - yep - i was wrong... again..... and them puts ain't cheap either...."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with that IV.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Or keep buying amc and gme
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just bought a $100 April put for $5.70, I think it will print"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 05/21 60p
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same I rebought it at $5.50 just now. I was alittle hesitant because I always get burned doing that but it's a monthly not a weekly so it should be fun.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,See you at the bank 😆
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Edit: gulp
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,love it. good strike points too - not overly retarded
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually retarded

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it worth the amount of stress you have to endure before these calls print?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,never go full retard!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Much obliged!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hakuna matata, baby!

Kidding aside, full disclosure, these long calls complement a whole phalanx of other options I have open on GME both long and short, calls and puts. It's more like they protect me from GME mooning due to the presence of some short calls (covered calls, to be even clearer). Literally an insurance policy that can print if GME does end up mooning. In the scheme of things it's worth it even if they go to zero but if GME doesn't look bullish after conference call tmrw I'll liquidate Wed or Thurs and salvage a bit of cash. To be clearer still, I didn't \*have\* to buy these. But I am bullish."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well he will know within a day or two if he made the right choice. Not much stress at all

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You must be more retarded than him
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Gme “profits”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options before earnings is a bit retarded. 

Good luck with IV"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I am impressed with the smoothness of your brain thinking these are long calls.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm doing something similar, except I'm gonna sell my options Weds/Thurs and buy shares.  Hoping for decent gains and just sticking them into more shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Myself included.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you sir.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never doubt it, I just I corrected your statement."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Were retarded
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I just corrected your statement""."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Check out the big brains on Brads!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,welp that was supposed to be the joke
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You set the perfect stage, I couldn't resist."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m too retarded to understand jokes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man dont fret, March 26th aint here yet"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not terrible. You have a decent chance with that one.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"New to call options, just wanna confirm my understanding. The stock needs to hit $13.66 (strike price of 12 plus $1.66 premium per share) by March 26th for this option to break even and then anything above 13.66 should net a profit?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine playing weeklies and then crying when it's only at -40% with 4 more days left lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you squint hard enough the negative sign disappears
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You'll be ok, more than likely. Not financial advise."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"amc is a distraction jokestock run by a board who don't give a shit.

why dont people see this?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Invest in TLTFF and make it back quick

They dont have to file SEC to sell...

Edit: Why would you downvote this? Just because it doesn't match your position on stock. This could've saved you thousands."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeap the theaters re-opening should give us a bump
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 4 days
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Also if the stock looks like it will close above $12 on Friday, OP will have to decide if they want to get assigned the shares and pay $12/each for them, or avoid assignment by either selling the option beforehand (even at a big loss) or calling their broker and tell them not to take the shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are people incapable of writing a comment without ending with a “lol”? Is that the new “tho”?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will be messaging you in 4 days on [**2021-03-26 18:12:39 UTC**](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=2021-03-26%2018:12:39%20UTC%20To%20Local%20Time) to remind you of [**this link**](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/matfpj/ouch/gru6geh/?context=3)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lol no lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you bought in right before the 3 week market bleed. That really sucks man

But hey, 18 years old with 13k was more money than I had at that age lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your next play? I need to know so I can avoid that shit like the plague.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"went straight into options

that kind of takes my breath away"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US!!!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Went straight into options, idk what a share is.”  

This is the way"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You still have 2900 to lose. Get back out there guy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,-Scratches butt and sniffs hand-
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy options on companies that r red today and sell tomorrow dawg or when it goes green
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Dash puts (somehow lost $1k on those)

Exhibit A: why you shouldn't trade options if you don't know what you're doing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You were so fucking close dude. I was in the same boat as you a couple years back buying weeklies. Stop fucking buying weeklies. Don’t touch weekly options unless you’re LITERALLY 100% sure it’s going in your direction and hitting strike. 

Go for 5+ months in options that aren’t OTM and you can easily make 15-20% returns within weeks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Options go down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,First one is free
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Never go full retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gooble gobble, motherfucker"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bananas goes up, bananas go down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you got a “free stock”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stonks only go up, stocks go up and down"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not the sub for this advice but if you are 18 just spend 13k on stocks and wait. You know who has better performing stock portfolios than old people? Dead people...If you bought at the height before 2008 crash and held till now you would still have crazy gains. Just buy some long term companies, put money in sustainable shit, and wait like 10 years man. It will go down and up a ton, just freaking wait."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Never done DD of any kind."" Lol!

You might be literally retarded..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Install Webull. Paper trade for six months. Don't worry about this being a ""once ina lifetime"" market. First, it isn't, that was last year. Second, last year was my third ""once in a lifetime"" market in 13 years."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m all for positivity and all... but dude if you’re losing your life savings doing options... you went full retard.
You never go full retard
Buy and hold shares, because they don’t have an expiration date"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So retarded your high school’s going to hold you back another year
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait...how did OP get access to my account 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"At least you can say you had money, they can't take that away from you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"*read notes*

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Whatever I touch turns to shit”, can relate lmao"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is, well...........awesome!!! Good work sir"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you confused stonks for stocks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's part of the game.
Stay calm, Draft A Plan And Try Again. 
Apes Don't Lose #ApesTogetherstrong"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Skipped shares and went straight to options.  You’re in the right spot sir.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi, I'll have a large #3 with a diet coke"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You truly belong here 😅
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beginning trader? Appears it’s going exactly as it should. Learn from your mistakes and battle back. We’ve all been there, brother"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus!!!! Someone tell his parents to cut him from their cell phone plan so he can stop trading!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy green sell red this is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you’re only 18. Even with the money you lost you still have more than I did at that age lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, maybe not yolo on options when u are not of true retard class still? 

This is hindsight, not financial advice"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You still have buying power, talk about not fully committed"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be investing not trading wtf
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, it's stonks. Stonks always go up."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how you tried to hedge with calls and puts but still managed to lose 80%
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,whatever u think of doing just do the opposite
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,hiding your pain with memes is bad
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks!!! Stonks only go up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stonks only go up, you keep calling it a stock so you're losing money"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure your parents are proud.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"dont be a negative nellie

flip that phone upside down.

See? All betta.

Now go work on how to YOLO the other 20% and you can still come up on top.

Not financial advice."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,TF you buy? Options!?? LOL.... wait ...actually!? Lmfao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who buys calls on snap
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you dove straight into options.

Don’t do those"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Learn to buy stocks first
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beginner and options, dangerous combination."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy shares lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like you bought stocks. What you’re looking for is stonks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you average down? We can't see what you bought into.

Edit: aha... options. If you don't know them inside and out you can get killed more often than not. And never play with more than you can lose. Take the lesson."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know “stonks” go up, not so sure about “stocks” though.."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of loss porn by this one ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|neutral_face)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do consider buying stocks in the future which you are able to HODL more than 5 years or start with ETF like QQQ / ARKK.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You still 3k left to lose. Keep going! You can do it retard!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"the market has been pretty rough, don’t be too hard on yourself"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Put the rest in on options if it all goes tits up just file for bankruptcy you’ll be good by 25.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad you can’t buy the dip on your own portfolio
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,At least there are hookers around when you're betting in a casino. It's only apes in here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel better, most of us have lost more in a day than you lost in a month.  I'm sure you will eventually make that much in a day too! 👍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will have a bright future. I didn’t learn to lose money til my late 20s. It’s never too late, I finally learned how to hold and made a profit and I’m in my mid 30s. Congrats, you will be one of those lambo people everyone wish they were friend with."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you buy SLV?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way! Woulda been better off buying & holding SPY.. But this isn't /investing we yolo FDs 🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks can go down, but STONKS only go up."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ha so funny man, hope the Reddit karma is worth it. Dumb ass kid."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went from being incredibly wealthy for your age to being below the median for your age bracket.

Bravo."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand why:

-You don’t fucking paper trade first

-You invest all your life savings in an extremely risky asset such as stocks instead of making proper risk management

Are you retarded? Yes, yes you are. Welcome."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't funny anymore.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't get it. Why waste so much money with such little knowledge? Looks like I'll be seeing another young soul at pennystocks in a week or two like all of the other WSB dropouts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My 3-26 $NOX $5 looking like world changers! 🤷‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rip in peace my friend

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ahhh so youre the mofo making sndl bleed like my ass the first time I got partnered with my uncle on hide and seek night.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stonks only go up, you sir bought stocks those always go down"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dang! Fell for the old money printer trick! Don't feel bad, you didn't lose your life savings, you just gave them to someone who found WSB 3 weeks earlier and started convincing people all these gains are free money from thin air when in reality there's a loser for every big gain too!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s some real smooth brain thinkin there
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The good new is your life savings is a small amount. In 15-20 years, you can post your real life savings losses for us all to marvel!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck pdt
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep you truly belong here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go up! Stocks go down!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks go up

Options fall of cliffs"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 80? Those are rookie numbers gotta bump that shit up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You had me at “don’t know what a share is” but dove right into options 💀 
Definitely belongs here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Go buy GME puts so it can skyrocket
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy needs to start shorting GME. Instant moonshot 🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No stocks can go either way.  Stonks & FDs only go up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Somehow” I lost money on these puts.


If only there was an explanation... 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,how shitty must your luck be to lose on DASH puts😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This post smells like someone is cooking $50,000 worth of ApplePuts. I can’t wait for your return and your next post.

Btw- to your title of the post. Please refer to my name. You’re welcome."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife’s boyfriend will be so pissed.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is for beginners, just buy and hold."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, stocks only go up.

Problem is you didn’t buy stocks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I thought stocks only went up""

*Buys options, no stocks*

----

Options are much more of a dice roll, not only do you need to get price right, you also need to time it right.

I put a fraction of my money into options."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't buy enough GME 😅.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, that sucks. I'm sorry that happened. It's actually stonks, with an N, that only go up though. It's a common mistake."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Picked the worst month in precisely a year to start
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Spamming this to break that one dudes algorithm that is going to try to calculate how man shares we have for the hedgies.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should invest some time into how to read trends, and hope support and resistance levels work. They really help when trying to figure out when to buy in and when to sell.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Man you should have just put all your money on GME shares. You would be grinning like a mofo now!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When I hear life savings I was expecting a few extra zeros on those numbers
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you lost 80% in trading stocks only, you truly are the worst fomo / paper hand this market has ever seen."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My man you gotta be real dumb to think snap is a good play lol when the market goes back to normal they'll forsure go back to the dollar range that they belong in
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I went up 2k in a week and lost 2.5k in two weeks. The market is a tough place these days
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you buy some puts on amc and gme please.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,!GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't worry brother depending on what you're in you can hold and nay even turn a profit, don't be discouraged. Watch the movie the founder on Netflix. Best lesson out of it even though the main character is a dick is you can really do anything with PERSISTENCE"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Its not lost unless u sell be patient not financial advice
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say you don’t deserve this but man you got what was coming.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I too learnt not to trade by losing money
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You only lose when you sell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember - you only lose if you sell. If I lost that much, I'd just assume I'm holding on to those stocks for a while..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t know the fundamentals, don’t go for more."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what paper trade accounts are for dearie
Clearly you weren’t ready for the training wheels to come off either 👍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rule #1 don’t use RH to hold your life’s investments. Get a real broker like Fidelity I only use RH for quick in and out stuff. Not my savings/investment portfolio
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are you buying weeklies you retard. You’re just gambling and not investing.

Stick to leaps into 2022/2023 or shares only if you want to actually be profitable.

Theta gang is taking your lunch money, kiddo."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,First time?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You got 37 unburned dollars holding up there also
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Went straight to options"" you belong here"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you’re retarded
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Atleast you got the karma
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks go up, options go down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,True retard welcome to wsb
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Learn from it. Take that list you made and change every item on it.   

comment like a retard but don’t invest like an actual one."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll be fine bruh. They go up over time.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us one of us one of us
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are rookie numbers..
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell low."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You read it right to left 😎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"18 year old looses a lot of money in stocks, asks if there is a 30 day return policy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,New trader jumps right into only derivatives portfolio. Seems very reasonable to me I dunno why you lost money.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The market will rise. Don’t sell.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didnt even have 10k as an 18 year old, now we are on even grounds"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do, just turn it upside down 👍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing run.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Please god tell me you’re just holding and haven’t sold. You only lose money if you sell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,you’re buying calls that are waaayyyy OTM
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,tsla call and nio put? what a contradiction lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Retard.    Gotta hold !
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So tell us what you learnt from that -12k?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,you are an idiot...you are looking at your graph upside down.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, I’m also 18 and you’ve got more balls than I do. I’m saving my money for college instead of investing (except in AMC) out of fear of something like this... but seriously, kudos. This ain’t the end, it’s only the beginning! Besides, it won’t matter once GME hits $69,420 looool"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the loss porn we came here for.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy-and-hold game stop and fuck all that calls and put bullshit just buy the shares fucking retarded ape
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You think stocks only go up? LOL you got into the wrong thing mister.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Went straight to options"" 🦍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh come on that’s only 3 10-baggers to 3 millie, duh"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It appears your mistake was not being 100% diversified in GME.

^^^This ^^^is ^^^not ^^^financial ^^^advice ^^^and ^^^I ^^^am ^^^not ^^^a ^^^professional, ^^^everyone ^^^here ^^^is ^^^an ^^^actual ^^^retard."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop looking like a great company to short.....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of your plays were that dumb, you just bought way too short term. Buy one AAPL call a year out versus 6 a week out."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re the greatest short seller alive, you just don’t know it yet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't chase.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your note-taking is well done, so I expect you’ll do well making more money to lose."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you didn't buy GME and held, no wonder you lost so much."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I get off to at night probably bought weeklies for all their options
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The magic of internet ""stience"" of investing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a loss if you sell.   HODL
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"These retarded 18 year old, think this way.

OK bye option at 10 cent x100 share, if it hit like 10 dollar I make easy 1000 dollars. And it will rocket to the moon


But when reality hit, they arw otm, so they lose 18k or worst, they sell nake options and now on the hook for 19k shares at now an insane price. Or they on the hook to buy 19k shares at inflated price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm 29 and I've never had 13k before. But soon...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you ask for a refund?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Impressive. You're still above ground, you've been made a man by the all mighty red crayon. 

ALL HAIL THE GREAT RED CRAYON!

&#x200B;

\*Stonehenge from Spinaltap begins to play\*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you even paper trade in preparation for live trading? I’m willing to bet the answer is, “bro you sound like an idiot. Who tf paper trades” 😂

Sorry for your losses. At least you have plenty of time to recover, being only 18"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why you just dont buy shares and forget for few months...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Run.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The good thing about money, is that you can always make more."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If only your philtrum had the topography of this chart.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Half truth. Stocks only go up... and down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks go UP and then Down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't feel too bad, you are only 18, I'm sure a lot of sugar daddies will give you more than that if your cute"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I hope you learned a lesson. Options are risky and you should do research before using them. The stock market will chew you up and spit you out if you don’t do your homework with them
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you can read this, your screen is not oriented upside down as it should be. Put the crayons down, and do some DD. You'll be fine."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you havnt sold and that ipo didn’t get delisted you havnt lost.  Unless your new and decided to go making calls...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Options at 18? Come on!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What? AAPL options never fail!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So this is who is on the other side of my theta gang plays...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you don’t need money just give it to me 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Alexa play my hero by the foo fighters
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only lose money if you sell.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You bought Calls and Puts without knowledge you were fucked before you started
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Turn your phone sideways. Problem solved.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,90% of day traders lose 90% within 90 days. Good job OP.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Be positive that’s half a cup and handle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well obviously you need to try short stocks instead, you'll make a killing using whatever strategies you used to do this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I was 18 and lost 100k 

Don’t worry mate, it sucks I know, money comes and goes, you learnt something you experienced something. It is all good, it will be dumb to not learn about this mistake and end up doing it again"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only missing trading on margin
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I feel like this sub has pretty wrongful ways to teach new investors. New comers only see options can make a ton and really don’t understand the fundamentals of trading, resulting in tons of lose.
Wish you luck making those back in near future buddy"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you spent 1% time learning rather than throwing money at a dart board you’d do yourself well. Crazy to be that young and rich just to throw away money like that. It’s like boxing without ever practicing or sparring.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me u FOMO’d hard as fuck without actually telling me you FOMO’d hard as fuck
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Meanwhile Benzinga really trying to help you get it back 😂😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy low, sell high. Rules to go by"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My account looks the exact same oof
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, this guy can hang in there and not sell and watch his positions recover"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"stoNks only go up...
Fucking amateur"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""life savings"" He's 18"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"18 years old me 

have a 500$ credit card fully load ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’ve lost a lot of money. I heard investing is a good way to make some income on the side.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I sold you some of those
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying you still have 20% more to go?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You will do well here
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but options fucking expire
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ayyyyye put that $37 into GME. 😎💎👐
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost 80% and still has more than me?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're thinking of stonks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning your phone upside down? Stocks always go up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When beginner traders buy options.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,he liked the wrong stonks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning your screen upsidedown?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep buying the peaks, it’s what I do."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think PDT only applies to margin accounts
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"While stocks only goes up, autists’ accounts only goes down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Should of put it all on GameStop 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your dad who taught you to Yolo short term calls in a sad market was really a good dad.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a 12 k lesson in risk.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They do. Just not that one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here’s an idea: do opposite of everything you want to do. Voila, instant profit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">never done DD of any kind

nailed it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you but all your life savings in the stocks?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s your finance guy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been trading for 5 years and I still wont go near options. I hope you learned an expensive lesson.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahahaha what a fucking idio.....oh wait that looks exactly like my year in review
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It does. Tilt your head to the right and squint a little. Let me know if that works
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They also go sideways but never ever down.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like your strategy can be summed up as:

*Buy calls on stocks that are hyped up and at all-time highs*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't buy stocks, you bought options. Probably should have read a lot about options before dumping so much of your money into it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,3k stills sees big opportunities on the table that’s decent chunk of amc
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They will go back up eventually lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He still has more money left than I do haha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you buy and sell multiple times? You're supposed to buy once and hold through the dips,lol otherwise you just lose money"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good loss porn
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried requesting a refund?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't lose until you sell!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats because your in hobbinghood....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All i saw in your positions was calls and puts and I was like yup, it checks out 👍😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Turn off the rotate feature on your phone and turn your phone over.

You're welcome."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"New to stocks ✔ 
Puts life savings into stock ✔ 
WSB retard approved ✔

Just remember its not a loss until you sell"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. So you legit did ZERO DD before just jumping in head first. Learn from this.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus, looks like Massachusetts, hopefully the cape gets drawn in!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh,  never just start with options before knowing the market,  they can drain even the smartest, most experienced traders"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Annnd this is why I buy shares only lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're to smart for this!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I swear there’s always an event (like the recent GameStop fiasco) that MMs know will draw a crowd in, and they just fleece all the newbies."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,STONKS only go up.  If you were in stocks that was the first miss.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It went up but you bought at the top.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll give you a list of tickers to buy puts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy some gme tommorow you’ll be good
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You paid the Wallstreetbets tuition. When you come back you will be a seasoned trader with the proper experience.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Correlations and factors my guy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried depositing more yet? It makes your loss percentage go down. Otherwise you might try asking for refund since you’ve only been trading for 30 days 😎👌🏼
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mark Cubans son? Invested his daily allowance?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,have you tried asking for a refund?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t you buy some shares of Apple? Shit you couldve bought 10 shares averaged down maybe buy 5 more put half your money in stocks you like hold em and put 5-6 to options but only do like 1k at a time and leave the 4-5k on red days. Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Forgot the N

Only Stonks only go up. It’s a rookie mistake. 

Stick around and keep your head up"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you fail this badly reliably, you can sell advice for people to do the opposite."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Options will do that to ya
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just turn the chart upside down?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,DCA
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You haven’t lost anything you haven’t sold yet. 

💎👐"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I thought stocks only went up?""

Doesn't buy stock, only options

*pikachu face*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's only gone once you sell. 💎🙌

Edit: Oh shit reading more I found it's a lot of options... Sorry bud."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read more, ans when you think you know everything, then you know nothing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you take into consider your wealth multiplier as an 18yo, you lost more like $1,003,000 in future dollars."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You haven't lost it if you don't sell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock go up..........options fuck your face...you mixed it up.

Ps. Gme to the moon💎🙌🚀🚀🚀🙌"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Never to late to work at wall mart
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"beginner trader gambles life savings on weekly options, ftfy"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Options go down tho
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t be a paperhanded beotch and you’ll be fine
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You learn a lot in such of young age. You'll be fine in the future.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All of these comments saying to buy shares are fucking infuriating. WSB was built on options. Shares are for fucking boomers over at r/stocks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Went straight to options. Yeah you belong here most definitely. Welcome aboard ya retarded ape.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Turn your phone upside down and it makes the chart go the right way. 

Also... how the fuck do you have more money than me at 18 where did I go wrong"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re doing a fine job. Now buy more. You’ll fit right in.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're not even investing, you're just opening positions and then closing them after they go down lmao."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You know you are allow to hold stocks you own for longer than a week without selling right?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop buying options. Most stocks go up over time. But an inexperienced 18 year old just getting into the stock market can lose everything on naked options.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beginner trader buying options with life savings lmaooooo so reckless, welcome"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s so good to see financially literate 18 year olds in the stock market these days - keep it up champ!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably shouldn't have invested life savings in stocks that could drop 80% in a month
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,With a little luck it will be looking like the state of Massachusetts by the end of the month
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You deserve this if you invest without knowing what you're doing. God wsb has gone to shit since January
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf would you START with calls 🤦‍♀️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks can go either way. Stonks are the ones that only go up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you flip your phone upside it goes up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the rumor, sell the news. When GME is the leading story on national network news, you're too late."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go up next month. Sorry you didn’t see that part.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"80% of your life savings, but you’re 18?

Ok"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must be doing something wrong, stonks only go up 🤷‍♂️"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this yet another “paper hands, it’s not a loss until you sell” post?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Show your positions or ban
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can only lose it if you sell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""life savings"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Think of it this way. You still have 37 bucks for booze.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You better watch out, Daddy might take away your credit card."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And you don’t even have a wife so you can stay at the boyfriends house! Bruh you’re seriously fucked.  Naw live and learn man. Your lesson was a tad expensive but hopefully you’ve learned something. #1 learn what a stonk is before you start trading ! #2 you need leave options alone lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya know what. We all have had our losses. Just don't give up and learn from the situation....and whatever you did, do the opposite of that next time"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh, I used to have the ‘ol shit finger myself. Do not miss my days of turning things into shit. Now it’s more of a clay finger.  Not great but it’s still workable. It def doesn’t smell as bad so not as noticeable to my peers."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This actually isn’t funny one bit.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Found your problem , graphs upside down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thinking about buying stock or options in Snap, Pinterest, Gamestop or Tesla?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,damn I’d be 100k up if I had your money lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda knew it was options before clicking the 2nd image lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Turn your phone over.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,looks like you lost it all in 2 trades.  Good job
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dudee that money could have bought you a nice car, yet you gambled it away. sad."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You jumped into the market just as demo tards got in.  It was inevitable.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you haven't sold yet, don't. You'll likely come back up over time. Holding is better than selling at a loss.

This is not financial advice, I am currently trying to get a marble out of my nose with a crayon."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not a good idea to go with options when you just start out. For as much as the memes from this reddit are nice, you really need to spend time researching these stocks before making a play."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's *stonks* that go up, no stocks. You got it wrong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Still cheaper than a college tuition 💪🏼
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit I’m 18 and just bought gme shares 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like you came here happy about losing, like it’s cool to lose or something"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Option is gambling if you don’t know what you’re doing
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You should ask a refund lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stonks only go up, options only go ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The market isn’t a only up or a fast cash thing . If you own good shares then hold it will come back . Just don’t look at it but once a week . In July you most likely be up .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginner mistake to trade your life savings as a beginner man
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you didn't sell!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats because this isnt gambling. Leave this sub and educate first if you want to make money. Keep following this and either go for the ferrari or noodle soup for the rest of your life
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t mean to but I gotta lol wtf
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't be all bad, still have $37 of buying power."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will improve over the year with covid restrictions fading out. Just buy the dips on your highest losses now to lower your cost average, you will be fine, but it may take a few months to recoup. It will get there, eventually"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop fucking buying options
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As another 18yr old, I recommend you don't touch options with anything more than 1k. I learned the hard way, but luckily perseverance and a gambling addiction got me 10-fold of what I started with. Just keep learning and eventually, I'm sure you will get it app back."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You haven't lost money until you sell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a beginner, this is a good level of retardness. At least he didn’t exploited a RH gold loophole for extra leverage."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're confusing stocks for stonks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me guess, options?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t lose until you sell! Hopefully you picked legit stocks. At least you didn’t buy options because there’s still a possibility of getting your money back or a percentage of it.

Nvm you did buy options ... I hope those expire in the money for you but the options game is not for beginners

This was gambling, not investing. I hope a unicorn catalyst comes along to save you. PS stop using Robinhood 🤦‍♂️"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s better odds of you wining some money at a casino. If you wanted to gamble why do it here?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Clearly, this is not the way. 

Hang in there, sport!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i did the exact same. hit the 3-week market bleed but somehow GME alone kept me afloat
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I went straight into options and made gold - then bought stocks and panic sold, bought more options and lost

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Uff. Was going to say you only lose if you sell...

Unless you went balls deep into options right out the gate.......then may god have mercy upon your soul."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"stocks do only get up.

what went wrong?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,18 yr olds w 13k have more money than this guy too
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve never had even 10k and I’m like almost 30
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's almost 14k but ok.
Yeah definitely has more than me right now, and I'm 27."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He could’ve just bought SPY with his whole account and have more than he started with. It’s not the fault of the “market bleed.” It’s his incompetence as a trader.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"By his age I had easily done 13k worth of drugs but again I like drugs and stonks, so well... there you are"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,that unemployment money is wild

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit I'm not quite double his age and at the start of covid I had only a little more in savings, but on target to almost double it by end of year (no investing). Now the situation is more  gambling on share numbers of GME I can count on 1 hand hoping to win enough to cover last year's taxes."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try blowout 100k in cash in Vegas at 23  In A few months

forgive my retardation. But what is the 3 week market bleed?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"31 with $11k checking in.

I thought I was hot shit driving an Audi TT that I was paying for by myself in high school. Buying whatever I wanted.
Finally decided to get REAL retarded and start investing last year."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not anymore lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,> was
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't look at the downside that's losses carried forward for 3 years just hold if you lose it all it's losses carried forward for 4 years and change.

That will help with 1099 taxes for the part time job to recoup that savings."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't have 13k right now I'm 27... Infact I never had that much.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I did the same. But down only 15%. Still retarded and will likely loose it all
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s only a loss if you sell.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""life savings"" |= ""18yrs old"" 

Loses $3k when even Wendy's employees make $35k @ $15/hr

This is not high drama, this is the cost of an education.  I see nothing wrong with this picture.   I'm happy he didn't just buy weed with his money and play fortnite.  Parents should be proud.  Would be more proud if he had gains, but this is good."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F is looking pretty nice. Might try AAPL again too. I sold SNAP this morning so it will probably moon pretty soon

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried that. Kept just getting redder and redder
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i like red
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got it, buying puts on red tickers, selling when green"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Red is the best flavor crayon.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s green?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But this way I won't gain 200% per day :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying weeklies is the WSB equivalent of scratchers
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And even then good luck. WKHS was such a sure thing for so many and people lost their ass on it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I understood what that meant. I'd like to learn more! 15-20% in weeks sounds like more than i hope for. Got any links I can click on to increase my brain power?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you even know where you’re posting? Far otm options only retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Or just buy the shares of stocks people are recommending and not the options. It’s easier to get the timing right if your position doesn’t expire
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a DD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,just bought Ford based on this DD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. I'm the poster child for buying literal peaks.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I only have like 2 wrinkles on my brain and I know enough to stay away from options."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB is (was) all about options! Holding shares is some kind of retarded new wave. Like that shitty music from the 90's. Thank God it will probably die soon.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this guy clearly bought options
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No he invested in something even better options.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now it's hilarious!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s 18, he can rebuild his “life savings”. Let the kid be retarded."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Expiring worthless is not a loss!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You realize these are options right? You can’t just hold options forever
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol or expire.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck really? I just bought F during the dip this morning at 12.59 and was feeling all good about myself. When are you planning on buying? Do I need to sell immediately?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I too like F and have been in it since 2005 but it's a very slow ride.  EV should hopefully bring the price up but given their history I never see F really gaining more than a few points at a time over a few months.  We'll see.   For example today it is up 0.16%.  I have over 2k shares so yeah that's a little something, but don't expect any sort of volatility either way.   Not financial advice.  Man sorry about your experience so far.  Hang in there man. Best way to learn is to fail."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t jinx my APPL man:/
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re a young kid, don’t take the losses too seriously. All of us lose money on options from time to time. My suggestion would be to stick to shares until you figure out options. If you do play options, know that short term options are the riskiest shit you can play."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. The secret to the market “only goes up” is *DO NOT SELL* when it is down. You only lose if you sell. While the market does “always go up”, more accurately: “the market always recovers in an upward trend”, which is essentially the same thing but over time. If you sell at a lose you have made someone else rich and you have lost. The only way to ensure your wealth to grow is to invest in companies you believe in and let your money sit.

Don’t invest cash you can’t afford to lose. If you need to liquidate your own investment in the near future, don’t gamble it. If you have the rest of your life to build your wealth, invest and watch it make money over time. Dont chase quick cash. You will lose 9/10 times."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"One tip. Don't try and predict the market. If you insist on trading vs investing then do a ton of research, buy and hold until you gain. You will burn yourself selling constantly."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow. You suck at this. Let me guess, you where buying options?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?! Why did you say F? My 13C expire Friday. Ugggghhhhhh was hopin for them to pull through. Lol been holding hard. Shoulda rolled them two weeks ago. Thanks for screwin me ya speedyhorndog.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since nobody would answer, I’ll give you the tldr. An option is an order of 100 shares at a certain price that you pay a contract for. As an example of a call, say you think that in a week TSLA will be way up, you essentially pay to to be able to buy at the current price (strike price). When the contract is up, if the price is way up, you get to buy shares at the lower price (again, the strike price). 

Since you’re paying to be able to buy, it mitigates some risk, because you don’t have to buy the shares at the end of the contract. but if you’re wrong, you bought something with no value."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this actually true?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Me personally never realized of that fact. Guess most of the people i know in the US are a bunch of lucky motherfuckers
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I see a factoid about American finances it always makes me double take. Like the fact that most Americans can't cover a $500 surprise expense.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't that statistic include mortgage debt as a negative, so if you have more left on a mortgage than you have saved/invested then you have negative net worth?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that true? I know a good handful of people my age that have 10k+ including me and we’re from lower middle class families
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure. There is a lot of bling out there. They just hiding it from uncle Sam.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Like F also. Not just EV but the godzilla is overdue to commercial sector. Stopped selling the epa sticker and give real world results to people that actually haul loads.  My 5.4 with 300k miles fuel economy barely notices when I have 1k lbs in the bed or towing 3k lbs.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"i dont even put my money in a savings account, tbh its a hybrid checking savings account."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">A better stat would be cash on hand (all accounts)...which would be more indicative of ability to pay rent/mortgage and debts.

it would still be pretty low.  even a lot of people who are on paper wealthy are ""house poor"" because everything goes into that mortgage.

&#x200B;

my parents own a house that's easily worth over a million dollars.  while i suppose my mom could technically draw from her 401k outside of her usual monthly withdrawal, before she retired, they would not be able to come up with just 10k in cash on a moments notice.  that mortgage has to be paid, bills, etc.   

&#x200B;

for shitty reasons, i DO have more than 10000 in cash to my name...but 3 months ago, i didnt, even though i own my apartment.  chucking 2000 away monthly and the initial down payment totally killed my savings.

&#x200B;

but, on paper, we were/are WAY better off than most people, with actual property to our names and all the benefits and flexibility that gives.  

&#x200B;

that is to say, a lot of people are just poor, and a lot of people aren't really ""poor"" in a traditional sense, but they still don't and wont have liquid cash like this just sitting around.  so this is a lot of money to most people in many senses.  I dont consider myself poor either, but then, at the same time, im technically a low income household and i didnt have a huge amount of on hand cash prior to shitty life events.  so its more complicated than just ""people are poor.""."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck savings accounts. Most banks limit how often I can withdraw MY money, and pay dogshit in interest. I’d be much better putting it in literally anything else."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, the second I sell it will take off. I sold a couple week ago for $200, to cover my losses, but it kept fucking going up 😂

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then maybe he can charge money and make money?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good to hear, you can do it!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro you're self aware enough to admit you had zero expenses but you still say a ""small loan"" of 20k. That's a lot. My parents could loan me 5k if I REALLY fucking needed it but it would mean no foreign holidays for them until they're retired"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta make money to lose money I guess.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well the fact that they’re already giving out their advice for free doesn’t bode well for the business model!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. The drop in AMC today was because they are asking Shareholders to add 500 million shares. That spooked allot of apes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well under covid 19 that means no foreign holidays anyway. And Trump said that he got a small loan of 1 mln dollars. I suppose what is small is just matter of perspective.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy gotta lose money to make money, so we can pay him for his anti-financial advice. Whatever he does we do the opposite and profit, but we pay him for the good bad advice ya feel?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't even say spooked.  My voting ballot may as well have said sell you fucking retard.  I know they say it's just for the right to issues more shares but they've already shown they're willing to max out the credit card.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Point being a foreign holiday is something that takes years of saving for my parents to afford. But yeah, I guess perspective is important. Not a crime to be born into some wealth, but don't forget that the majority of people would drool at 20k"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you say they fucked their investors?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I wasn't calling you out on buying TLRY. Just realized it could be taken that way. I think there's money to be made in either one. TLRY is more volatile so could have bigger short-term gains. But if you're holding until the merger, I think either one is good to have."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Might be. I’m not the type to get greedy over ratios. I want in on the biggest recreational player through either means
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Plus Aphria doesn’t have the backbone of the deep bag holders who are waiting for the train to pick them up. $UWMC was supposed to make the Russell right... I mean I already looked like an asshole once over that one

If it’s gaining pre market they are buying and selling the stocks all day. They’re exaggerating our losses and gains everyday. So if it starts out bad. Don’t expect much. If it’s going good it will step ladder up all day. It will usually calm down after lunch, but by that time the damage is done or we’ve had a good day."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm actually thinking that as well. People are dying to go out in public but half the country is gonna be struggling from some mental social anxiety after this year. I don't have to worry bout that though because I was retarded before lockdowns.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A Tyler perry movie could be the first movie available and it's gonna sell out. 

People just wanna go out..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s going to keep dipping until there’s something worth buying in the balance sheet
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Negative
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, your only options are ""For"" and ""Abstain.""

Thanks for playing!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When in doubt, buy more shares.

Not financial advice..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GME has always been a share play! Premium is to fucked for retail to afford enough calls...  shares & HODL earnings is gonna to be wild either way💎🙌🏻💎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"ngl if you're all buying these stupid ass OTM calls I'm about to start selling them to you for beer money.

Stop buying that shit. Jesus."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea how to buy options.  I looked at the numbers when I selected them, and there were a lot of numbers.  Most of them seemed very high.  My balls tingled trying to tell me, ""Don't do it"".  So I didn't.  Just buy more shares and HODL."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So we either fucking or getting fucked?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is not ""set"" by the MM, it's called IV for a reason. It's implied. It's an output of the Black Scholes equation, not an input. The IV is high because the price of those options are high. The price is high because of supply and demand, just like all other market prices.

The IV is high because retards are all buying 800 calls despite those CLEARLY being overpriced."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this isn't the WSB way, but this stock needs the shares purchased for the play at hand. The amount of money going into options can cause the short squeeze on its own WITHOUT NEEDING the gamma squeeze.

&#x200B;

Not financial advice, I actually just found my green crayon I was missing and it is now brown"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So in other words- buy some more? Deal... buying a few more on sale 😄
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"| because no one is going to sell OTM calls since they fear the Planet of the Apes. 

&#x200B;

You're not serious with this right? Every single last premium seller has a position collecting premium in GME calls right now..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait a few weeks. Flat movement will make those cheap as hell then you buy them because everyone knows the next gamma squeeze is inevitable with this liquidity
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent news. Apes buy shares.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It feels good collecting $760 for a 300C.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hurry buy more!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They're just putting the tip in it seems
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hiked up the iv?  No the iv is an equation of what the bid / ask or a supply/demand is
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ever since the January run up, the IV has been absurd, dunno who’s buying these insane premiums."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a very high quality post but requires brain wrinkles to read. And, of course, requires reading, so good luck with that. Otherwise I endorse this message."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sooo, if I were to leave out the disclaimer about how I'm not a financial advisor, and say something like, ""buy 🦍, BUY!"" Is there really any consequence, or is that just what we do here?

This is clearly financial advice from an expert in an unrelated field, so definitely do what I say 😆"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t suggest touching them if you don’t know what you’re doing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding forever means never being fucked.  💎🙌🏻😂🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's because apes are fucking apes by driving up the price of 800c like morons.  It's like when you play a cookie clicker game and keep buying grandmas and driving up the price way past the cost of a mass production factory.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, no. IV is set by the buyers and sellers of options. It is not set by an equation. Black-Scholes does not set anything, it models what happens stochastically. The only way it influences the market is that  people do use it to make decisions so it does end up shaping the stochastics.

People buy and sell options and when the stock is volatile people make their own choices in what they think they should do. When they do this they create patterns. Like most people are not going to sell an ITM call for 1/100th of what they can get. 

You can think of the humans playing options function like a hive mind that Black-Scholes models. People use it and better models to try to maximize profit because it offers some ability to understand how the hive works in different scenarios. When volatility is high though these models become less predictive a IV is used to counter that effect.

There are no model to determine prices inside the market. The market is pure buy and sell. People pick their prices(using whatever means such as guessing, gut, Black-Scholes, manipulation, etc) and if one were to  monitor the prices they would behave in a certain statistical way. These ways then are modeled because if you can truly understand them then you have an edge(and this is how they came about and how they become more popular and how they then started to actually shape the markets(becoming self-fulfilling)).

&#x200B;

2000 years ago in some sand market the same things would go on and there were models that could be used, but they didn't have the technology or mathematics to model them so people relied on other means but you can bet there were models being used(e.g., The water god says it will be a good day in the market if you do 4 flapjacks and toss 2 peaches over your shoulder)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like advice from an expert in financial's.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also means never fucking 🤔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding forever means you won't be able to enjoy the profit. Pass it on to your grand kids and make sure you have a clause that they can never sell it. Just holding forever.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we are saying the same thing. There’s no model to determine price, it’s just set by the market. IV is calculated based on the observed market price. I’m saying IV is not a variable that market makers can “set”, it’s just what you calculate when you plug the market price into black scholes."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I just have my BS in Mechanical Engineering. Not smart enough for stonks; I just buy and hold. I hoard stonks so I don't hoard cat fur and empty liquor bottles.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, half full or half empty, buster?  At least we have a glass! 😂🥃👍🏻"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good thing the bloodline dies with me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, then I misread what you are implying. I thought you said it was an actual parameter that somehow the market itself goes buy... again, it is kinda murky because so many people now use these models that it does end up shaping the market and these models end up actually driving the market(self fulfilling prophecies)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well it seems to me that you’re clearly an expert Ape, so it IS technically advice.  💎🙌🏻😂🦍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I may not get to fuck her bc the boyfriend gets that job, but I have a wife that's half-full of SOMEONE'S cum."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then u need to bring your share certificate to the grave. 💎👐 Forever
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm an expert at encouraging my wives to get boyfriends, so yeah, I think you should follow my advice."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly.  You get the home cooked chicken-pot-pie, and that sucker has to make her feel like she actually means something to him.  SMH 😑"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wives? Where do you live?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same question.  Also — who the fuck downvoted my last comment LOL.  If it wasn’t u/KyzRCADD then you’re a certified cuck.  

U/KyzRCADD — you’re cool. 😂👍🏻🥃"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, and I block loonies."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't down vote anyone moron. I have not down voted one comment. Down voting is for imbeciles that think they are superior. Sounds like you've got it figured out though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There  is a certain beauty about averaging down. You are not defined by your  past decisions, but by the accumulation of all your decisions. You can always turn the ship around and start improving right now! A dip is not a  defeat, but the opposite. It is an opportunity to not only change the  numbers in your favour but also change your perspective on success.  Owning the dip makes it a high! Buying a dip is a biblical thing really,  redemption in disguise. Past and missed opportunities coming back to  lend you a hand. A dip is a time machine! Are you willing to seize the  DIP and BUY THE MOON TICKETS?! 🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lucky you, if I had any money at all, I would have bought the dip today. I used my whole stimulus on GME last Wednesday itself, wish I had waited till today."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got a few more today and increased my average. All good 💎🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same was 262 now 230
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s crazy that on the same day you paid 418 you also paid 193 in another order.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We need some cheerleaders out ere’ shouting GME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is exciting!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are so fucking deep you're making me lose braincells
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is a big stock !!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of y’all are gonna learn about IV crush tomorrow after close, if you’re holding GME options"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like that you bought 1 at 196 and 28 at 400 haha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This retard really likes buying high. He first purchased around the January highs and
Watch it go down into the 30’s and 40’s, and just decided to buy high when it back over 100. Whatever works for you 🚀🌕 as long as you have 💎👐’s"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the day where you bought 28 and then just had to go back a few minutes later for the 1 you forgot on the discount rack. Keep up the good work Ape!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the earnings report going to be published today?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That $415 buy tho lol🤦‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What the hell!

Where were you when it was sub 100 like 2 weeks?

The only sub 100 was one bought at $82.

Were you locked up or something?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Averaged down from 250 to 222. Feels good    💎🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,💎🍆🚀🦍🍌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,why didn't you buy when it was 40-50 ?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you have to filter for buy? 🤨
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That looks like my order history. I was at 325@$33 going into the first squeeze and following a series of blunders, I was at like 150@$190 with +$30k cash. Right now I'm averaging at $220something and only +$20k cash. I've done just about everything wrong over the past few months when all I had to do was HOLD at $33 and but the dips. It's painful to think about but I can only look forward and hope for good things to come."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope GME goes down to 41 again so I can buy on the dip.... Probably wont though
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not an expert but it sure seems like 🦍🦍🦍are holding the line today!!  Low volume and price holding up. 💎🙌🦍🚀🌝
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still debating whether to buy more by end of day, or wait until tomorrow to see if there is another dip/flash sale"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip I got my average down from 260 to 220 today. Yolo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I buy dips cause imma need them for the tendies
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude what? You are a certain kind of special for having enough faith in it to buy that much of it but not enough faith to buy more at 39...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wish I had that much disposable cash to invest. Started with $80 in February, and now just have enough to buy my 1 share of GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,188-190 seems to be the good dip area
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just did
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way
All the way
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Likes buying too late lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahaha holy shit dude. You are willing to buy the “dip” but you didn’t get any when it was 40 for weeks? Keep buying and holding! 1k is not a meme!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I got some late to the party at 186.3, it's not much, but it's honest work."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"okay, now show all the sells."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The dip you're buy at is upside down. 🚀🌕
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not going to average down from my position until it craters. Moon or Marianas Trench.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Samesies 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened to “not posting your positions”?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said fuck it and started my transfer from Rh to fid. Also had $5 and I bought more fraction, trying to round one up out slowly. Goodspeed fellow retarded apes. We diamondbacks. Slow is smooth and smooth is fast."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s goo baby!! My activity looks very similar
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought some today to lower my cost basis from $415 to $264.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the WSB way - get high, buy high, sell even higher!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,YOU FUCK
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tasty dips! Tasty dips!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here we go, come on, push it"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The way is this.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got a good discount on that 418 limit order, filled at 415!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice catch!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They cannot hit below 180 I would not be worried. GME is one hell of a drug! In for 20 at 187. I started at 5 and just every dip lol. Waiting for earnings haha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,holy shit are we the same person.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is GME’s supply at the moment? Or better said, how many shares are left to buy?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the FUCKING WAY!! Koodos you ape
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Still averaging share price of $47 😛 mostly because I’m piss poor and dumped savings + tax return into GME early February but I’m still happy with what I got
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ummmmm which one 🤪
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,115 to 87 to 123 to 148. Been a wild ride 🥵
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy some dips in Palantir
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I double my average cost. I just can’t help myself. I like this stock!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm why not change that filter to show us all order types instead of just the buys? If you were only buying, there would be no reason to have to set a filter. GME🚀🚀🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone actually care?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What about averaging up? I was lucky to jump in at 45 and want to buy these dips but driving my avg up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been on this damn ride so long I've averaged up and then down and now up again. I like my average price for both the short-term and the long-term prospects. Hell, I might even average up some more. What can I say... I just like the stock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This was so fucking deep. I’ll buy some more cause you’ve got my loins whispering now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"May the odds be ever in your favor.  A Dip is not Defeat. Buying a dip is Biblical. Seize the Dip! 

I want these on office posters that show snowy mountains or the ocean or a Roaring Kitty."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn I'll buy the dip but please stop making me cry
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,people that buy in later on will give anything to have bought in right now. the dips are part of the FOMO. hope for highs and pray for dips.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Although... there is a point where you have to ask whether averaging down is chasing bad money with good money.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Except for people on etoro haha!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well said
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd get out now before it hits $ 40 this week.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We're coming to get you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the one stock that's worth averaging up with!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,146 to 270 to 222.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i’ll ask my wife’s boyfriend to see if he’ll let her!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,the APES 👏🏼👏🏼 are here 👏🏼👏🏼 to stay 👏🏼👏🏼👏🏼
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,On its way to Cape Canaveral now for tomorrow’s....you know.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,IV will crush post earnings not 2 days before
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What if I'm short options 🤑
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow end of day
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow after markets close
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it was 40, I was waiting for it to go down to 30 to buy in big. It was a big mistake. A huge part of it is that I allowed myself to get influenced by the people talking shit about GME (hedge fund shills, trolls, OG WSB posters who're **""so tired""** of GME posts etc.)

These naysayers kept posting that GME is dead and will definitely go down to $5/share. They said if I bought at $40, I would be catching a **""falling knife""** because it will only fall some more and I would lose money. I wish I hadn't allowed them to influence me. Oh well, we live and learn. I have 114 shares now at a cost average of $205/share and I'm happy. I truly believe in GME now and those naysayers can't influence me anymore."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My average was 275 initially and I didn't buy more at 40-50. To be honest I thought this shit was dead. I didn't want to waste any more money. I couldn't believe it when it shot back up. I waited until today to buy and lower my average to 233.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why not both?

*Mexican music plays*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,porqué no los dos?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sub 100 is
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thx for sacrifice. Hoping for a squeeze, but hopefully you don't get caught in the middle of it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started making the jump from RH to Public last week. Slow going, but we made the right decision. Fuck RH. 🦍💎💎🙌🏻"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,For the love of God not Karp!! 😆🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You cared enough to post a reply to this thread so you answered your own question.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it. Just make sure to brag about being in at $45
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My average was a juicy 45-50 its now higher but I have more shares so ape have more bananas
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Seize the dip. Catchy!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you imagine how many shares I could have if it goes back to $40?  You are getting me really excited!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally impossible considering apes strong together’s position.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you brother, I'm waiting!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I blew my average out of the water that's okay the tendie gains are the only thing that matters 🍗🍗🍗🍗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the spirit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think GME is big no matter what, i think if we ralley up this stock it'll light a fire underneath GME management.  They are in good hands and still striving . If we ralley the stock just how tesla got rallied.. i bet u... jeezzz we alone can take gme to 1k easy. Let's do it  i am Canadian and have always loved eb games and the ONE gamestop in town . Lol . Amc too !!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope we get some good news.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So there's a danger if we buy more today or tomorrow and since earnings come after hours we won't be able to exit our position until market open next day in which it may tank?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the exact same way for the exact same reasons. Felt so foolish when it crashed and then when it shot back up I realized everyone is just as dumb as I am.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a fat limit order at 30 that never executed too. Should have spread them out a little higher and lower.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea trying to time the market can cost .. 
I personally managed to buy some more at 50$ in order to average down and had another buy order sometime at 39$ but it didn't catch (low for that day was 39.5$) and after that it just kept going up :) 

Not sorry either, holding and waiting"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also considering this haha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would only go sub 100 if:

- earnings bad  
- no Cohen  

At which point... hodl if you can, because *will* CEO eventually. Possibly through buying that dip.

If you cannot hodl, yeah. Exit. Just exit if it's bad news and then buy once it flash dumps.

I know nobody wants to hear that, but there are genuine people who can't afford to hodl if it's gonna dip hard.

I do genuinely believe that 170 is a floor though. And the trading behaviour does NOT indicate that retail is selling."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I left a hug load of $CUM shares on RH 🙌🦍✋💎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn't actually make sense but okay...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with averaging up when you're still buying a dip. I bought today's dip at 191 which raised my average a ton since the last time I bought was at 38 but I don't care cuz now I have more shares.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference between being in at $45 or below and fight club?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We shall all be in tendie land soon enough brother ape!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This stock doesnt behave with logic. Flip a coin. Dont think any of it matters
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this is the most obvious shill account I've ever seen.

They want us to think subpar earnings are bad news for the stock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no exit plan here until we are on the moon. This one may not be for you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s generally how it works if you can’t trade after market through your broker
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"While earnings have lately been when most stocks shit the bed, this one could go either way. To my understanding, basically we haven't seen major price increases because of low volume. Usually such low volume would lead to big price drops, but gme seems to hold very well, even after the huge sells of the last couple weeks. Other people have posted DD on here about how any newsworthy announcements about the company since January have caused really nice spikes in share price.

This earnings report, and more importantly, shareholder meeting could have announcements in it that would cause another price spike. Announcement of new cfo, cohen perhaps taking a management position, or best of all, the return of dividends! All of these things and more could cause a spike in volume on Wednesday. With this stock, high volume = higher volitility, but also Generally leads to price rocketing. 

It could be more wishful thinking. It could be just another random event people want to pretend will cause the squeeze, but I am not looking for freak occurrences anymore. I am buying on super low volume days, preferably on dips, and patiently waiting for the volume to increase and the price to shoot up. Until the pattern drastically changes, I'm happy with this strategy. So I'm planning to do my buying before the call, not selling! Not financial advice, either. I just wanted to tell you my tale!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is going to the moon brah, what's your smooth brain talking about?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">...we won’t be able to exit our position until market open...

I can actually hear your paper hands blowing in the breeze and it’s giving me a headache. Please quiet down."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a possibility.  Ah and premarket trading can burn.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a little at 50$ and waited for it to down down to 35$ and even had a buy order at 39$ someday but the low of the day was 39.5$ , looking back I just should have bought more at 50$ :)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I am with you...  Your Day buy order for 125 GME at a limit price of $45.01 has expired. The idiot in me thought I could time the bottom.. forgot to change the limit buy and let it expire at the end of the day. It took off shortly after and guess who didn't chase it as it rose? GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a lot at 44 and 140 and 188 and plan on adding where I can this week
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heads =  🚀   
Tails =  🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not true, catalysts like new news abojt the company brings in volume which is what we need"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for a discussion instead of the typical ""gme will moon bro"". I feel the same however I know with some major catalyst we should see another run up to maybe break 350 but for me earnings might be risky. It could go either way like you said, might shoot up or continue to go sideways for the next week. If I buy in it will be on Wednesday if the price and volume is moving the right way"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where would GME get the money to pay dividends? I’ve seen this and share buybacks floated around. GME has ~$500m cash on hand and this has been decreasing over the years, before it became WSBs darling the primary shareholder complaint was that it wasn’t reinvesting into the business."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets, a lot of people will look back and wish they would have bought at $200 too. buy and hodl
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Side of coin = 🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably a good call. I don't think you would be missing out to wait until Wednesday. And if worst case scenario is it going sideways, that's okay with me too, but I don't know how well I'll handle it if it drops back down to 50 haha. Ive averaged up the last couple weeks so I don't want to see anymore drops."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape. Crayons. Wifes boyfriend. Moon. You mean that stuff? Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have much hope that dividends would be reintroduced. But anything that would cause an accounting for shares would be nice. Also wishful thinking though. I wonder, and maybe someone could enlighten me, but are the odds good that we will hear an announcement of the new CFO, or of Cohen taking leadership? Is there any other highly likely announcement that could trigger volume?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dog thought coin was a treat = 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The big one tbh is Cohen taking a position of leadership IMO. If it happens, gme get another 50M+ volume day. On the flip side, if the guidance is trash it may crater."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this is actually a genuine 50:50

If you go all in tomorrow, you're a god dam mad man.

God speed, retard. God speed.

I think the ice cream tweet bodes well... but it's a fucking ice cream. So???"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean DFV tweeted poker chips and the stock jumped 5 bucks. At this point I expect Cohen to post a picture of his big toe and it to go up 80
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like you still have $7,200.  That's not broke."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Break Even 37.20 LMAO

Love me some morning loss porn"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re  the guy I sold those to!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Help? Where those otm option contracts are going , there is no help."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"$7,000 isn’t broke. And you should never go broke. Only invest what you can afford to lose!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If having $7k is ""broke"" then im totally destitute @ $400."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Must be some kind of bug.  Try rebooting it and starting over.  Usually fixes it for me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,and this right here is why i don't do options. if you don't understand what your doing don't play with fire or you will get burned.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you still have $7,000"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Moon dreams with chimp knowledge. Makes sense. Youre break even shows you have no clue what options are all about. You can either hope it bounces back somewhat so youre at less of a loss but profit is like 99% out of the question baring some crazy news that blows the roof off pltr which isnr gonna happen. That or ride the boat to zero.
None of this is advice, and you shouldnt base any decisions you make off anything I say."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Folks on WSB posting their far OTM gains has y’all thinking this shit is sweet. In reality, there’s a 1/1000 chance that those will print. Sell your contract, take your 7k, buy some shares, delete your app and come back in 2 years. 
Anyways, thoughts and prayers."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Weird you lost money on Robinhood ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Loss porn like this involving stocks you got money in really puts things in perspective.

PS: Currently down $132 for some 4/9 calls."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"LMAO why the fuck would anyone donate money to the PLTR jokefund?

Jokestock is jokestock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not advice: What I would do. Buy a stock you like with the rest you have, not a penny stock, not an over valued stock, not a fast mover stock, not a volitile stock, mid cap.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I'd sell like 2/3 then either roll it forward or buy shares or just don't buy OTM calls. Not advice, just what I would do."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You still have 7k OR 2 months of hope.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry dude...stay away from options of you don't know what you are doing best advise I can give you....you are young young you will recover but for Pete's sakes learn this lesson...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its really gonna burn your ass when you try and sell them and the MM isnt trying to buy them contracts for .91 a piece, oh no. With low OI and volume like that, you might  have ask lower to get the sale to go through."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I never see people make money on this stock lmfao.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask for the 30 day refund. 😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as you bet only what you were willing to lose, then you’ll be fine. Don’t worry about it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rest easy brother
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people downvote? This subreddit used to love loss porn. Now its under controversial only...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Use whatever you have left to try and lobby congress for a 4th stimulus check.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your brain is so smooth I can see my reflection in it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy GME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see a lot more loss potential. 
You know, if you sell calls, you could even lose more than 100%?

Seriously though, I'm torn when I see this. Allow full margin trades with options to retail investor, or protect them? 

What am I saying, I'm 100% for free markets."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR... Don't worry in Cathie ya'll trust maybe she'll let you move into her millions dollar house with her.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,just double down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Cut your losses and pull out. Reinvest in GME make 699999% gains back
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy longer dated calls 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Misleading title for sure, OP still has 29% of money left. I think a ban is in order! JK buddy, you'll be alright. It's just money, and not worth losing your shit over. You'll do better next time"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could upvote you to the moon XD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaoooo

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I've got $46.82 till next month so I'm right there with ya.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Just delete app. All good.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could not agree more, many these days are playing options as a get rich thing...you may get lucky here or there but if you don't know what your doing in options you will get skinned alive literally....the market ALWAYS TAKES IT POUND OF FLESH ..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? You can send me your pittance of leftover and I'll buy $GME like you should have.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, you can get some good loss porn from buying ITM/ATM too."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"BE 37.20, dumbass."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah he went too OTM, needs a miracle at this point."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"$RIDE bottomed out at $13, considering it is the only ev pickup truck company and has hub motor technology I'd say that is a pretty good investment 🤡."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch man but thats more like malicious stuff. Short seller report vs or moon shot
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,/r/lostredditors
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He just needs the stock to go up about 50% before 5/21 to break even. Lmao.  Why even hold those. If i had shares i would be writing these , basically free money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A man who gets it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit dude, ill be seeing ya round back of the Wendy's."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or gouge your eyes out. Can’t be broke, if you can’t see your account balance😵"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just wait until they keep going to try to at least break even
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. It’s happened to me. 
But PLTR at 37 is borderline crazy, with the way this thing moves. But who knows, he still has 2 months, but by then thetagang will be zipping up."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Far enough out to pop on IV.  Probably not to their cost, that's nuts, but I'd still look to sell them on a green candle.  Lots of time to not panic"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t understand what that means
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aren't miracles made of the very same hopes and dreams that wsb is founded  on?

I don't like your attitude 😎👍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Such a trustworthy group of people. I’ll take them at their word any day.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also morgan stanley raised pt to $18.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol just sold 5 covered calls for next week at $35.  Already had 5 sold for $30 for this week.  Yeah I'm getting my ass handed to me at my $28 average but people keep buying them from me so I keep selling....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are we bragging about how broke we are? Are we counting debt here? If so, lmk, and I'll go tally."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, Kinda feel like it tonight. Only 9 days till I get paid. I think I can swing it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you brother ..hopefully it gets back up for you....🙏🏼💰🙏🏼
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Demo day may help but you're probably right. I have some 4/23 and 4/30 22.5c
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, the best play here would be to dump those at the next green day. Even rolling them out into more ITM/further exp would be a good choice if OP is still bullish on PLTR."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cost + strike = Break Even, the point at which you're profitable based on intrinsic value alone.  We'd basically need another ATH day to get there, so there's definitely cause for concern."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you understand the definition of a miracle. Also, what’s wrong with my attitude, too realistic for you?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shorts then? I know Steve burns misled investors but at this price it is a decent buy in, especially in the short term."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will be good iv is high too , that should def help you. 

Worst case keep rolling."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean we could just *flood* WSB with loss porn and debt posts, and make the HF bots think were too broke to keep buying..

.... Wait."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did this clown buy calls on an ATH strike for a p&d stock?  Robinhood makes it too easy to do ridiculous things like this.  Real brokerage apps make you apply to be able to trade options and there are levels
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here bro you need these

 *hands over rose-tinted glasses and a snickers*

Feel better?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know there are options other than go long a stock or short it, right? Perhaps a company with hints of fraud that had already dipped is just something to stay away from entirely. Because there's no telling if it's found the bottom or if it'll gap down again."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I'm just wheeling the shit out of these.  Premiums this week were a little down but the last couple weeks people were still paying insane money for $30 and $35 calls that had literally no chance of getting exercised.  Hey, whatever.  I'll take free money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No my asshole still hurts
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart. I think I’m gonna buy a few hundred shares soon. And start selling these too.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same for my RKT shares. They're not too far OTM to get more of that premium, but even if it does get exercised I still make a good profit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda gone with $GME...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My advice is to put in a limit order for one share that will round yourself to a perfect $69. You do the math.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All you need is to buy a share @$244.48 to average $69.420 per share
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank God your average isn’t $420 lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Average up.

Through the forging of rounded 69 diamonds ape been able to change ape's family's life. Ape going to pay it forward and change the world to the best of ape's abilities with this rounded 69.

Right now I own 100@69 average

sold 50@249.

HODL 100 shares

This is my 2nd best position this year. best is Canaan 200@$5."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree no rounding to 69 or 420. Use a stock price calculator online.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I sure hope so
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course - they sold some fuel to airlines that bought less because of Covid. But does it really matter if it goes down in these ranges? I mean this is obviously not a stock that is measured by its revenue. It's measured by its future potential, which is huge. If you do a little bit of research you'll find that they have

\- A ton of cash

\- A ton of IP

\- A ton of contracts worth billions per year

\- Very concrete plans

I'm not here to convince anybody, but still nobody gives a damn about $GEVO. You'll find there's almost no posts about it - it's not on people's radar. IMHO a huge catalyst will be end of month institutional ownership reporting. If my sense is right, it will have increased significantly from 6,22% and we'll see a huge gap up. I believe GEVO at the moment is worth between $20 and $30 and within 5 years it might be between $75 and $150.

One plant has projected net income of $70 million. With 7 plants planned, 30 EPS and \~200 million outstanding shares, we're at $70 mlilion \* 7 \* 30 / 200 million \~$75, more if things go well, worse if they don't. I'll give them a 20% failure rate at this point. They might fuck up the planning this year or the execution the year after, but if they are successful, they will be huge. Now I don't know if they'll take off any time soon, but volume is picking up and as I mentioned I believe institutional investors got in on the last dip, but well if I'm wrong, I still have the 13k shares for the longer term. This is just a YOLO.

&#x200B;

Edit: Of course the infrastructure bill that is prepared by Biden atm is another catalyst."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe there's some catalysts coming that might put these calls ITM, but yeah it's definitely much safer to just buy the stock."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which app does a new retard can use to buy UWMC I was using robinhood before but I took everything off that and I am using etoro for now. Help a new retard to lose all his money
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ton of shares got shorted this morning.  This has happened before and we bounced back.  Not worried just gonna hold and collect the dividend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried to buy the dip and average down, but it didn't go down as much as some of the haters said it would, so I'm still averaging @ $8.31 ... Sad times."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always falls as soon as I buy, but it's okay, I like the red"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold 100 CSP's  4/16 at 9 strike. If assigned my cost basis will be sub $8. I'm not sure I will be assigned though.. considering buying the puts back at a profit and just buying the shares. I want to own the stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You invest like I do. Or maybe I invest like you do?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Soon lambo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Diversification is important. You need more YOLO weekly calls in here.

Edit: not actual financial advice."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. Picked up a bit more, but not as low as 8.40."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Friday, I tried guessing the floor at 8.71 and missed by a penny. Could've scoped some more at 8.27 today, but got greedy and wanted to see 8.26. Both guess - missed by a penny. Maybe, this afternoon will come back for it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought at $8.3 and $8.35 normal trades this morning.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hyundai vehicles have great fuel efficiency. So you got that going for you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ApeBank - Simple name for simple ape. 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brilliant move! My wife's boyfriend even said so, and he's really smart."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought more around $8.50. Was hoping to get in closer to $8. Oh well. Stonk go rocket. 🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I try to honor my Ape forefathers with bold moves for many bananas.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lots of people bagholding for rkt
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The mortgage industry is unsexy. Or they misunderstand this company's potential even if interest rates do go up. Or they don't like nearly 5% annual dividends. Or they just don't like money. I personally think it's because the name sucks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a real estate investor who has had loans serviced by UWM, I hate them because they are a fucking nightmare to deal with. Tried to quit-claim my loan with them and my attorney spend a week (and $1k+) playing phone tag with them. Never ended up getting the title transferred and just refinanced my loan to another servicer. Fuck those guys"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t belong in this sub. Try r/investing for dummies
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You will make money on this for sure! Or maybe lose money. Possibly break even. I'm not really sure how stonks work.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Diversification hurts my ape brain.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the record, I didn't downvote you. Some people don't like the stock. BUT... I will come back here when I have 3 lambos and tell you I told you so. I'll try to say it nicely."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The path to lambos. It's as clear as day.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Great price point.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bags of money?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nom nom nom
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo...5 year old reddit account. No activity for 2 years. Then 2 month ago started pushing this stock every post. I might be reading the generic replies wrong, but im picking up vibes of a bot or someone trying too hard to be a redditor/ape/autist 

My 2p not worth a shit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate you looking out. I'm diversified, just not on this account. I have a nice boring account with boring gains. This one is for tendies only."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Great average though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Here lambo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had my limit buy just too low and missed the 8.00 premarket dip. I tripled my position but I'm still smol.

It's a solid long term play imo."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you please tell me your predictions as you make them? I'll just add or subtract a penny and then I should be good.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I enjoyed my Sonata with the 80 mile round trip commute I had but truth be told I could hear the wind passing beneath the floor boards. If you turn the radio up enough it feels safer.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking best ideas.... i will be the first in there to get some loan to buy all the fucking dip uwmc
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I DRINK YOUR MILKSHAKE!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn’t the sub for jackasses spamming a stock that’s not high risk and isn’t going to have explosive growth. This stock mention should be in r/investing THAT IS THE REASON
Whether your retarded self can accept it or not is a completely different problem."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think they are the problem.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah man. I'm real and it's real. Had a different account and this one was sitting on a shelf. Dusted it off because other was known by friends/family - started getting comments about what I was doing with my money. This way I don't have people close to me knowing what I'm doing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GG Just Making Sure brother ape safe
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ape go vrooom🍌🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is where you went wrong.... you needed to buy a Honda not Hyundai
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All new accounts come with free banana. 🍌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you tell me which stocks will have explosive growth and when? I'm not 99% into this stock because I expect it to bumps it's ass along. If you've seen the future and there is not explosive growth, please let me know ASAP."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How about 1 800c GME for the nearest expiry date? I am opening my account at 4pm EST on a Friday!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It ain’t this one. Haven’t you noticed the swarm of posts all in a week’s time for this stock? This isn’t coincidental. But, also how many have been removed by mods. This belongs in a low risk investing sub which isn’t WSB."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. What counts as explosive? I believe there will be a 40%-50% increase over a very short time period, I just don't know when that will be triggered. Is a 50% increase in a short time period sufficient?  
I respect your genius, but my crystal ball says your wrong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It varies. But moving from back and forth between 8.50 to 9.50 and teetering here on a large float, not a long timeframe of shorting, low OI, and an existing large PIPE ain’t it. Go to r/investing or r/stocks if you want that advice. There aren’t any brokers for helping you secure your financial future in safe investments here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I YOLO'd $74k (99% of my portfolio) on this one stock. Does it seem like I'm looking for safe investments or helpful brokers?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet GME all over the sub and all its done is go down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ll recover your buy in most likely with small gains. But, there’s no catalyst for this to even increase 50% in a short period of time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a good thing that you don’t actually understand or know what’s happening. Head on over to r/investing and hock your low risk, mortgage stocks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We'll see.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, when then if you’ve done proper TA?

Edit: Exactly. You don’t know of any catalysts and haven’t done shit for TA to determine why this would increase other than low risk, slow growth."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want TA there was a breakout of the trend line that formed over the past couple months and it just backtested that trendline. This is bullish. Fundamentally, they are undervalued. Maybe not once in a lifetime GME type gains but this is definitely a favorable bet, IMO"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s still not an explosive reversal or has any catalysts for large gains made at high risk. Hence, not WSB material."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,good luck.  you can be the first person to make money on pltr options
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this is wallstreetbets
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is scary shit you got there.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t the CEO insult Wallstreet about pressure on short term performance?  This thing will sit in the penalty box for a long time.  I have shares.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The fuck were you thinking and god bless you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,can i feel your balls just to make sure they’re real and not made of steel?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Has anyone actually made any type of money from PLTR lol, I think it's going to be 2030 before anyone starts making some type of profit from PLTR."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha fucking retard

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well on the bright side the majority of the money is on the non retarded strike/date for May.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone with 40% of their roth IRA in PLTR @$28, I must say this is pretty retarded. At least your $20 call wont expire worthless"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve made plenty of money selling them
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know right? Brings tears to my eyes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I call that reverse psychology, fellow 🦍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes everyone here and Karp keep saying its a long term play yet here we are looking at another retarded play.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That imma be a millionaire
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes sir, please feel around"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have quite a few times on day trades. But I've also gotten fucked more often than not. So no.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I had 10 shares. I bought a 100 and sold a covered call and a $20 put. That was enough for me to buy another 100 shares. Sold another covered call and bought 50 more shares. Since the price crashed I’ve made way more on my calls than I’ve lost on the shares. Surprisingly I’ve even made money on the puts thanks to the IV crush.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did, I built a time machine with my profits and told myself to double down. Now I have an infinite money glitch on my RH account."

PPS: They're Planeteers trying to make the Earth (and stock price) go green right?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you think this Demo will be any more of a catalyst than their last demo \~a month ago that caused the stock to jump for a hot second then fall back to earth?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You would be the first with options. I also have trouble believing RH would let you sell it or profit in any way. I also thought WSB was moving to ban RH screens cuz fk RH.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what your goal is. If you just want to collect premium and not give up the shares, you can go higher PT and shorter time frame."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been doing $40 strikes for selling calls. I don’t want to sell the shares and it’s meme status kinda worries me. It’s like a decent earnings call away from jumping up like crazy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,For both of our sakes I hope you're right. I have 325 shares of PLTR as well!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I get tree fiddy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR believes the earth is flat and they are spending billions in marketing to try to convince everyone.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree that what he is saying isn't responsible, he uses preorder, order, and presold interchangeably and none of them are correct. Whether or not this was intentional is irrelevant because investors interpreted it differently. However, I seriously do not believe that their stock value dropping 60% is reasonable response to this. Lordstown motors has the same amount of assets and progress in their product as they did before, and their is most definitely interest in their product. You don't exactly spend hundreds of millions of dollars in order to pull off a scam on investors. They have hundreds of people employed, they already have a means of manufacturing, and their technology is seriously competitive. I'm currently writing a DD for why I'm going bullish on RIDE but regardless I think everyone should consider whether or not a market cap of 2.25 billion is a fair evaluation."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,X1000
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> NHTSB 

Guys, this is what happens to your brain when you look at too many stock tickers on WSB.

[NHTSA National Highway Traffic Safety Administration](https://www.nhtsa.gov/).

These guys collect data on auto safety, and issue recalls on cars, conduct crash tests. Etc. This is a consumer oriented governmental group.

[NTSB National Transportation Safety Board.](https://www.ntsb.gov/Pages/default.aspx) 

These guys investigate major crashes, and all modes of mass transportation in that regard. The NTSB is who you call to investigate when looking for cause of failure causing a crash. Tesla autopilot causing crashes, faulty airplane control surfaces, etc. If it's not a terrorist act like a bomb, it's the NTSB's game. (The FAA helps on airplane stuff as well)

The DOT and EPA are who actually regulate the features of cars though. They dictate where the lights can be, how high, etc, based on congressional act. They use data from NTSB and NHTSA sources, but they are working on the manufacturer end.

the DOT is also the department responsible for transportation of all stuff, they regulate the roads, ships, planes, etc.

ANYWAY.

I agree, until they have more than a single prototype, and have sent preproduction units to the IIHS (not a governmental agency, and does better crash tests than...) or NHTSBSHADOAA to be destroyed in crash tests, it's vaporware.

There have been a lot of BS electric car startups, and some have even almost brought a car to market.

*Almost*."

It's going up because they got finger wagged at for the preorder nonsense and because the CEO is a dogshit PR guy. They still own the old GM plant with the solar field and the overhead welder. They still are flush with cash and primed to have access to the ATVM loan at a 250MM floor at treasury rates.

Check out Millennium's, Citadel's, Aristria's and Omni Partners' 13Fs for examples of how the pod shops are positioned. Fucked floats + lots of SPA issuances + lax enforcement = wild west trading styles.

This is all from a few interviews with the CEO. There is still interest in their product, and its a good product. To imply that there are no real customers out there because of this would be inappropriate.  They wouldn't continue development if they weren't absolutely sure that they had customers.

Rivian, while I don't doubt them, have used over $8 billion (raised over $9 billion). They had to, of course, start from scratch. $RIDE is actually further along in mass development than Rivian.

Another important change is that their leadership lost all credibility. No sane investors should trust what comes out of this CEO's mouth - this is plain to see from the video.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was only planning on holding this through the end of the year anyway. Being first to market would generate some hype and figured the stock price would go up for a bit. However I never had faith in the company long term. The hub motor design has issues and it's amplified by putting it on a truck.    
   
The wheels/rims and in this case hub motors are all unsprung weight. They aren't supported or dampened by the suspension system of the vehicle. This leads to worse handling and, the part I think is important, questionable durability of the motors. On a small economy sized car this would be an iffy decision. On a load bearing heavy duty work truck, this is a death sentence. Work trucks get beat to hell, driving long distances and over rough often unpaved terrain at job sites. I was going to sell about a month or two after the first units shipped in September because of this.    
    
Now people are saying they are years away from a ship date? I saw the frame welding video. That was fake as fuck with only one spot even spitting sparks. Couple that with the fiery prototype, the bullshit orders, and the 10s of millions of dollars worth of shares sold off by people on the board, this all seems like vaporware scam. I hope for the people of Lordstown Ohio that I'm wrong but at this point I'm not betting that I am."

Obviously this isn't investment advice, but I am personally not selling shares any time soon.

It's not like somebody went to Lordstown, opened a curtain, and saw an empty warehouse. I really don't care about their CEO or leadership, because what matters a great deal more is their product.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they don't have a vehicle ready to sell today, they won't be selling anything by their Sept. deadline that they set.  They don't even have proof of concept yet.   Where is their prototype with miles on it.  Automakers typically put 100k's of miles on prototypes before market.  We'll see on 4/17 if they show up in Baja."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you it doesn't work like that

Positions or ban"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not the guy who you responded to to begin with. But I guess it's pretty evident you couldn't read when you brought up brokerages halting trading on GME in response to something that had nothing to do with that.

Might want to take the L bud"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, ok then!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, he even himself says that its a PROTOTYPE. This is far away from a working car as youve stated. I can show you 1000s of videos of cars in the same state, that never saw daylight."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point you aren't even arguing. To say they don't have a sellable product with customers or a means of manufacturing and then not provide any evidence is a pretty poor way of debating. Nothing you said in that response is based on evidence. They have a product, means of manufacturing, and interest in the product. Your opinions are clearly based on sentiment at this point which is what has driven their stock value down to an unreasonable price.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You aren’t the guy I was originally talking about lol your account is 3 years old not 8, but yes, you are not the 3 month old account. 

I have no position in Ride because I don’t like Ride, and like my money elsewhere. I only short by selling covered calls, I don’t like puts

My claim to have things in my fridge ten times older does not hold weight with your account, 30 years is too long for fridge things

Edit: i took a quick peak at your posts since I figured you posted about Ride, but I don’t have the time to look at your dd thoroughly. I’ll try to read it later if I can figure out how to read. The table you made is also very nice, I hope your Ride position ends up as good as that table, but I am not bullish on it"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to ask super politely. Like you have to practically-suck-on-my-dick 'politely' - then I will happily post it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man those ""pre-sales"" are a total joke and there are copies of it in the report, you and me could make an order for 100.000 cars tomorrow, no problem.

Anyways, in 1 month they want to show off their Beta versions and start a pickup at a race. If they have something to show for, one can think about getting in. And its not like this will shoot up too 100$ in 4 weeks. Could be a good potential long hold for the future, but right now it just looks like a all those ""Go Fund me"" projects that never see daylight in their life"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a forum kid not a competition. Grow up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts if you think it will catch fire. Calls if you think it won’t. Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you need a full production vehicle on the street? Any vehicle you see, even the one in the San Felipe race, isn't production.  I guess you're waiting for September. See you then."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Pigfarm. I've just watched The Lady and the Dale and there seems to be some parallels with what happened there. They did take money for Dale orders and didn't put it in escrow unlike here where the CEO intimates they have live orders but are actually only promissory notes. 

Is there actually good evidence that they have produced a working prototype that matches what they promised?

I have never had a position in the stock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since when do I need to prove a negative?

They don't have a sellable products, if they did they would sell it.

They don't have any customers, if they did they wouldn't have to talk about these fake ""pre-sales"".

Because they bought an empty building that used to be a car factory - does not mean they have the capability to manufacture an electric vehicle.

When you make claims, you need to back it up with evidence. Not...

>Your opinions are clearly based on sentiment at this point which is what has driven their stock value down to an unreasonable price. 

Wrong again. My opinion & what has driven the SP down is the CEO lying to investors. 

Now that the leadership cannot be trusted to deliver, I agree with you that the price is unreasonably high. Even you agreed that their +$2billion MC is nonsense.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You nailed it. Anything that asks me to “invest” and doesn’t give me a product (or a share, with a value, traded on a market), I’m out. And SO many of these “companies” are doing just that. They remind me of when Kickstarter first got popular and everyone took the money and ran"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm... not totally sure how I ever tried to make this a competition but if that's the narrative you need to create for yourself to soothe your fragile gargantuan ego, go for it bud. Doesn't make any difference to me. 

I sincerely hope you find the peace you so obviously need."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, some bookie out there would probably take the bet, but the odds cant be that good, if one of their cars already caught fire...

I more on the ""because some unforseen technical problems and time issues with Covid, we arent able to start at this race"" bet"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well honestly, yeah, i would like to see the fucking working product of the company i would invest... 

And stop talking about the race, nobody give a shit about it. Its like talking about mercedes starting in Formula 1 and linking it to their new line of S Series consumer cars..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far there hasn't been any substantial evidence to suggest that they don't have a working prototype. According to their schedule they will have manufactured their first BETA by the end of the month. The information that they have given us about the EV so far (can be found on their website) lines up with what they promised.

However, they still have quite a few opportunities to disappoint if their beta does not meet standards or timelines. Personally, I believe that the company will deliver."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit, that’s strange, so when I click on your name it shows 3y, but then if I fully open it the cake day shows your correct date. I gotta go double check these other two guys real quick lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, after reading the report that was also my first thought ""Kickstarter/GoFundme scam"" 

Remember my best friend and the Son of one of his colleagues was inventing this tooth brush that would clean your teeth in a couple of seconds. And he was adament to spend money on it, because ""i would get it cheaper"" and they had videos and stuff and he met his son once and he had really vision and everything.

After i explained a little about all those failed products there (and he is no PC savy guy, just for work really) and showed him the, at the time current ""Top 10 Fail"" list, he was convinced to wait, because one thing i learned through my short fuckinng life is ""if its sounds too good, it probably is"".

Well and you guessed it, it turned out as scam, there is a law suit going on, the products they sent where total failures, etc

But the funniest shit here is, they havent even SOLD their product. Those thoothbrush guys got 3.2 Million at least, and not imaginary sales..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm being lazy here but is there any outside evidence that isn't from their website? Amazon have plenty of videos telling us how much everyone loves working there. Just looking for a start on the DD for the company and the best place to start is to see if they have a real working prototype.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries. By the way, are you Armenian for real? I'm Palestinian. Our people seem to get along well. Good luck to you, bud."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We should sell gme on Kickstarter, and use those funds to buy our own shares"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just read your DD actually, very thorough and the outside sources are phenomenal. So far, Lordstown motors is pretty much the only source of information on their EV. What gives me confidence in their numbers however is that they will be sending out the BETAs to be reviewed. It would be pretty dumb to lie about the vehicles performance and then hand them out for other people to test. For third party information on it's performance we'll have to wait until the BETAs get reviewed."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I am, and thanks you too! 

I made my imgur account just so I can show you what I mean with the account age on my end. Very weird issue I haven’t seen before

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. I purchased the option when the stock was around $10 on whim, and I'm now paying for it. The options might as well be worthless now compared to what I paid for the contracts."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the stock it had seen $12.4+ the day or two prior? I don’t get your point.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So... I should buy the same thing

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The spike to $13 lasted about one minute and it hasn’t really recovered since. None of the apparent “catalysts” moved UWMC at all. Absolutely trash month
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,5/21 $10c is the move. Those things will print. I only have one currently but my capital is locked up in shares and 4/16s (oof) so just writing calls and waiting for me unfortunately

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options definitely aren't easy. There's plenty of good videos on the subject, but its a time investment for sure if you want to actually know what you're doing"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"See: May 21 $10 calls. They’re only $88 rn and expire after earnings. Like the previous post said, just bc the contract is itm doesn’t mean you profit, but you can also profit if your contracts are otm. It depends entirely on when you buy them and how long you hold them.

Edit: or just buy shares. Depends on how long you’re looking to stay in. +100 shares you can write your own calls and collect the premiums instead of paying them. And dividends too. There’s a lot of upside to both."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it’s shares you’re chilling, options are a different story."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s how a swing trade works, buy low and sell at the high spikes. Sorry you missed it."

2021-03-22 19:48:14,wallstreetbets,"Annaly Capital $NLY Ex Dividend Date 3/30 - CHEAP CALLS TLDR:  Stock holders of NLY on 3/30 will be given a high dividend on 4/30.  There is also earning call on 4/27.   Been in a long upward trend since getting hammered by COVID, as of now $8.88 stonk price and $9 calls are cheap.   

After reading this DD:

I jumped immediately into a $30k YOLO like a retard:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mao0z0/annaly\_capital\_30k\_yolo\_anly\_gang/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mao0z0/annaly_capital_30k_yolo_anly_gang/)

THEN I STARTED READING STUFF ABOUT IT.

This is a slow moving stock, BUT has several catalysts that should easily make for some quick gains (not financial advice) to roll around in or re-invest in GME/AMC/etc.   This reminds me a bit of the short RKT saga, but I am not suggesting there will be a squeeze, just tendies.  

Catalysts:

\- Ex Dividend Date on 3/30, which means buying the stonk and holding to get dividend, or calls for THIS FRIDAY to play on the anticipated buying pressure of others getting in for dividend.   Dividend will then be paid out on 4/30.  This is a REIT with a 10.21 div yield, i.e. very high dividend all things relative, so not a bad place to park your money for a second.

\- Earnings call on 4/26

\- COVID impacts starting to waiver.  NLY is a mortgage REIT, the general consensus seems to be that we are seeing the light at the end of the tunnel with COVID, i.e. stonks like this that got hammered are buy opportunities. 

\-Look at the 1 week chart and call prices.  Calls won't get you the dividend and of course are more risky, so buying the stock or playing the options are both viable depending on risk tolerance.  

See you on the mini-moon ANALGANG $NLY"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You had me at anal gang.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Soon as I bought my calls it turned red lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought my first options after reading this and the DD. Granted, I bought 1 4/1 $9 call and 1 3/26 $9 call because I have no idea what I am doing and figured this would be a cheap way to learn."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hold NLY in my retirement Roth IRA account. Long-term dividend play for me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the symbol was $ANAL. I'm fucked.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how people see a options play and say ""why not buy shares"". Really the point is to turn $1 into $10."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the open interest and volume in the options chain - mostly zero. Buy the stonk if you believe the DD.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a fucking idiot and market ordered my calls this morning and it filled at .30 cents. FML. Going to cover margin and average down. Looks like I’m going heavy into this play 🥴.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You fuckers, it's like the blind leading the blind here. Fuck it, I'm in."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 35, $9 4/1 calls this morning! There has historically been a drop-off in share price after each ex-divadend date. I am betting that we see a drop-off in share price by Friday as MM's try to avoid losing on the $9 calls for 3/26. This could be followed by a large hike in share price the following Monday as MM's buy back in prior to the ex-divadend date. Be careful with those 3/26 calls!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anything that works out to ANALGANG, I have to get at least a few calls.  Especially the cheap ones."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lost me at “slow moving”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your 3/26 will lose value quickly if it stays below 9 and trades sideways due to the greeks. As soon as your value goes above your premium consider selling. Don't wait for the big payday, that's why you bought the 4/1 in case there's more run up. You didn't notice it but your brain did."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I have some fairly high priced ones too, I think they'll still print."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lol.. yes there's always a drop in share price after ex-dividend to reflect the payout of the dividend.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I staggered and grabbed a lot of April calls too."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it be worth it to wait for the possible dip Friday to grab calls?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, real DD is supposed to be honest and give pros and cons :D"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn brain. So if my 3/26, call goes in the money tomorrow or next day for instance, I should probably just sell it and not hold out for Friday? If I sell it and it gets exercised, does the option writer get called or me?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Here’s hoping lol.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,4/30 9.5c here

For newcomers, Purple Innovation ($PRPL), a primarily Direct To Consumer mattress manufacturer was **THE** WSB meme stock before $GME, tribute to the mattress king [/u/dhsmatt2](https://www.reddit.com/u/dhsmatt2/) and [/u/lurkingsince20066](https://www.reddit.com/u/lurkingsince20066/) for that.

Degenerates were ordering $3k mattresses before earnings in an attempt to shore up the top line, yeah so 🦍🦍🦍 buying $20 GameStop gift cards can't complain.

This post was originally meant to respond to the mattress king post here regarding PRPL earnings.

>I am not an accountant and the last call had some weird Tax receivable agreement- [u/indonesian\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) understands it better. I have not been able to find a lot of info on this.  
If he gets this I'd like his take.  
I am expecting GAAP earnings to be really really good and the automated headlines to be extremely favorable. [u/lurkingsince2006](https://www.reddit.com/u/lurkingsince2006/) and [u/indonesian\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) went back and forth last time and there were lots of unknowns, I believe this time they can both agree the warrant accrual is going to be massively favorable from a GAAP standpoint. The adjusted earnings will be the wild card. I still expect these to be good and I'm hoping for 20-30 cents per share.  
The accruals??? wtf- I need help from [u/indonesian\_activist](https://www.reddit.com/u/indonesian_activist/) and [u/lurkingsince2006](https://www.reddit.com/u/lurkingsince2006/) I don't understand why we didn't have a big fat paper gain.

**Tax Receivable Agreement(TRA) and Incremental Loan Warrants, skip this if you're not interested in boring SPAC's tax & loan stuff**

TRA is a common feature in companies that go public via the SPAC route.

Despite it's name, It's mainly a way for the pre-IPO owners to continue to extract value from the new public company even after they've sold all their shares. The TRA essentially makes it difficult to value a company and to predict earnings accurately, because the TRA liability and expense will depend on factors such as

* The public share price during the partnership share to company share conversion
* The gross profit of the company during that Q
* And the applicable tax rate for that company

For $PRPL, good news is that on Q3 2020, the Pearce brothers had exited and converted 99% of their type B shares in Innohold to PRPL, with 99% of the possible TRA already reflected in the liabilities there won't be much surprises going forward. The not so good news, there's still about 130 MM USD left that will eat into $PRPL earnings the next few quarters.

The Share conversions and subsequent sales besides triggering the TRA also triggered an incremental loan warrant strike reprice, This is different from the public stock warrants, it is the warrant related to the loan that PRPL received from Coliseum and Blackwell in 2018. They usually put this sort of terms in the loan to prevent founders cashing out early. According to the GAAP Accounting Standards Codification 480,

[https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm](https://cpaclass.com/gaap-accounting-standards/codification-400/asc-codification-topic-480.htm)

you need to record the fair value of this as a liability. Unlike the TRA, you can calculate the warrant liabilities more accurately, usually they do it using Monte Carlo instead of BSM. Here's an excel sheet that does Monte Carlo pricing though it doesn't account for reprice probability yet

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1paeexI0jD6mlj9n-me59tS4IPpq3bARJ/view?usp=sharing)

And here's a pdf that details Monte Carlo for warrants

[https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c\_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1aVEblipoBpvz35c_Zw0nYl2VzhIxY-TH/view?usp=sharing)

The May 2020 share sales of the Pearce brothers triggered that reprice clause and reset the warrant strike to zero. So for PRPL since the strike is 0 and event reprice probability is over 90% with near DTE, you can just multiple the number of outstanding loan warrants x the current share price to get an accurate estimate. in Q3 2020, it was 24.86 x 2.6 = 64.6 Million. For Q4, since share price have increased further to $31, the warrant liabilities would be 31 x 2.6 = 80.6, a difference of about 16 MM USD from the previous Q. this is reflected in the statements of operations, dragging the EPS lower.

# THE LINK to $GME

As I was analyzing PRPL, out of curiosity I've tried to find its biggest shorts. $PRPL has very low short interest, at only 4.2% of the shares outstanding. But you'll never guess who the top 2 shorts are

I'm surprised though since I imagine you went with ""I'm a stupid American,,"" in the second sentence but the software messed up the adjective 'American' (amerikansk) with the denonym 'American' (amerikaner) which I find strange since I'd imagine the article ""a"" would have triggered the correct version of the word.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,2 million Zimbabwean dollars?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks just was wondering because it dipped & hasn’t reached it’s initial all time high I know it went from 50 back to 200 but I was wondering if people are overestimating the jump it would have to go beyond the close to 400 dollar mark which is going to just end up with people holding on longer term just losing a lot of money.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you ever checked the numbers? I guess not. Stupid sheep.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,very cool! i'll know to never complain about my own alphabet again (vietnamese)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome aboard 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,that is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, I like."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should have just thrown money on the curb. 

PLTR is worthless."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All this gme shilling has deterred me from coming to this forum for a while. This is a breath of fresh air.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. It almost doesn’t belong on wsb, but I will leave that up to others. I’m accumulating some pltr now. 175 shares currently. I hope to forget about this one and come back in 20 years to find I’m a millionaire 😆"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I use my GME gains to buy more PLTR. GME is the mistress and PLTR is the wifey.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So pltr is a good stonk. It seems a lot of people are talking about long term so is that what it is
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Until Peter Thiel dumps his monthly 20 million or more shares this month because he needs to buy more land in New Zealand or wherever.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, not every stock is a scratch and win lottery ticket"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If those insiders could just keep their stock for a couple of months that would be cool
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,By then the stock will be like at $26-27. Then back to $22.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's because shillers bought close to the top. Advertising over and over again getting people to buy it and showing your position. Once it hit 300 they sold it. Literally half gme shillers are gone now. I know this might be early to say now since I've said I wouldnt touch the stock even when it was $50. Good luck getting pass $200 again.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why everybody's thinking they were going to make money on this play within a week. This was long from the beginning.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What price did you get in at?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you retards think the existing home sales released today and the new home sales released tomorrow will give us a bump?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ma-ma-momma said... imma re-re-retard.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m out of the loop why is everyone buying this?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"$25k shares in position needed for yolo post. 10k for options.

Edit: looks like op is fine. They put more than 25k in."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not in super deep but I’m holding. I like the stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Merrill edge?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,FOR THE MOMS! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like it was a 1200 dollar fee to end up making him short the 3,000 Plus is that right?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You shills are embarrassing 🤦🏻‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m jealous. Trust me I was up staring at the clock waiting for 4:00 to see how bad the pain would be. The flesh wound became a scratch pretty quickly 🙏🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was also expecting a bigger drop to low 8s. Still managed to pick up 100 more shares and sold 10 May cash secured puts, so at the end of the day got my shares for free 😀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because there was an excessive pump and dump campaign after RKT blew up. Now bag holders who bought in at 12 want to get a quick exit because they don’t want to go long
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which are my favorite plays. Trust me my jewish mother always wants me to play the dividend game
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How long we thinking I have calls expiring in a few months.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,People were spamming about it being a short squeeze.... Then it turned into a value play now it's not even getting picked up by russell lmao...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,At first? $12+ I’ve had to average down the entire month
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,God willing 🙏🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,She wasn’t wrong 😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Strong fundamentals in a growing industry that is feasting off of low interest rates with a gangsta ceo who makes brokers sign pledges that say fuck off $rkt. Any other questions?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But I’m not a FA. I’m just a retard who likes to eat green crayons more than the red ones
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain the $25k in shares. As the market value of my holdings fell below $25k with the change in stock price but my cost is above $25k. Or do you mean 25k shares?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry 😞
I was provoked by a comment that seemed to question my skin in the game. Never again I’ll force myself to learn that Imgur"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate your reasonable contribution towards our $TLRY cause 🙏🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yessir, like a boomer 🤗"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,She always had my back and she’ll always be my word of wisdom
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry about that don't know why I thought that was a call option ....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No fees. I’m premium with Merrill so I get free trades same as RobinHood just better execution. Just add the market value to my loss and you’ll understand the cost of what I paid for this pile of 💩
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who am I exactly shilling? 😂😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That 4am plummet had me a little scared.  But good 'ol faith holders recovered well for us.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got caught at over $12 with my first buy but was looking for cheap entry on a long play anyway
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pshhh, I'm trying to make buys I can forget about for a few months I don't want to watch tickers everyday"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shalom, my mother was just wondering when you'd find a nice girl and settle down. 

Also I'm here holding with you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a value play from the beginning, FOMO idiots are the ones spamming shorts. 

The price is currently undervalued and has been undervalued for weeks even without the Russell inclusion. Fair market says $12 and still does.

Rolling in fact that it's has a fat dividend payment and now you're adding it to your retirement fund suddenly....

No shorts, no Russell, just reliable cheap money

So before you go running your mouth at least know what you're talking about."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TO WARN PEOPLE WHO LIKE $UWMC LONG, AND I’M WITH YOU, BE CAREFUL WITH THIS STOCK’S SENSITIVITY TO THE RISING 10 YEAR YEILD. I SUGGEST HOLDING A BANK OR SOME OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTION THAT BENEFITS FROM RISING RATES AS A NATURAL HEDGE. ALSO A TECHNICAL GUY ON CNBC WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT THE SIGNAL THAT GOLD CAN GIVE FOR 10 YR AND HE WAS TALKING ABOUT SUCH A SIGNAL INDICATING A THE RISE IN THE 10 YR AFTER MAY."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mmmm. Okay. I agree.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait lol what
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I’m a gen z using Merrill"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine if I did options??? 😱
Do you see my retarded ass timing? If I played the option game I would be so deep in the hole by now I wouldn’t even be able to afford a free reddit account"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All these formats are different I’m glad to explain what kind of skin I have in the game
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was there holding your hand
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re on WSB homie, most people want to get in an out in a month for a quick buck"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My Jewish mother would be proud of ya
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea my mother has been waiting for me to settle down for a while. I tried to take UWMC home to her but she wasn’t impressed 😂😂😞
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A company that does well with rising interest rates? You mean like GME because those shorts are taking increased borrow rates? ;)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m like boomer with my application choice 😂😞🤗
This is Merrill Edge not a RobinHood screenshot"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m weird. Sometimes I just make something sound too complicated for the sake of it. I think you’re taking the right approach. This stock is very volatile and isn’t for those with a weak stomach
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey kid way to be ahead of the curve. I see you 👀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,are you not short???? this SS makes it look lik eyou are short
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Quick buck shouldn’t equal taking stupid risks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry exactly how long has GME been going on?

And how long DID it go on before anything at all happened?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And I love u/deepfuckingvalue as like a role model so please emphasize how our plays work well together. My money is in both places 💎✋🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I personally dislike Robinhood after they burned me on some options a year ago. They force sold them below intrinsic value. I have no desire to ever use them for trading.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh. It’s more of what does Tilray have to do with UWMC?

I felt UWMC was a safe play given my cost basis is 8.36 and their financials are solid."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,👀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,UNREALIZED short term loss now —-> REALIZED tong term gains for my grandchildren
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Total value = current market value of my holding (24K) + UNREALIZED short term loss (3.5k) = the cost of my original investment (~27.5k)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes just like my portfolio, 30% GME, 30% PLTR, 30% TSLA. Very diverse."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heyyy force fucked brethren. I had an option two weeks ago that had a bid/ask spread of $5.40/$6.20 and Robinhood force sold it for $0.78. Luckily it was only a single contract, but still annoying AF that they essentially stole $500 from my account."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Different plays. This was done without much technical support. He wasn’t as excited about this opportunity as me. I appreciate a good growth stock with recent deep bag holders. Once I saw $TLRY was back close to its IPO price I jumped on it. Instinctually like a wild animal. I mean look at the run it had before the pull back...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok got it. Long bois to the moooon
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The (short) made me think you were short
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean kind of. That’s a little too heavy with the idolizing for my taste but I respect your choice in false gods 🤗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically exactly my story. I had been trying to sell it into the bids and RH kept canceling it because it was in the last hour before expirey.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,💎✋🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investing has a ton of multiple used terms to confuse us on purpose. Short (bear) vs short (term), IV on options being implied volitility,  and intrinsic value, etc."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t play with those kind of instruments on my babies
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes Karp, Musk and Cohen are my dads."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to bust your chops too hard but I would never recommend risking your family’s well being on a stranger’s intelligence. If you do your own research and think that’s where your money belongs that’s one thing but don’t put that on u/deepfuckingvalue
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep shit simple and just buy a stonk that I know will hit 🤗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you have a lot of your parent’s money to waste then
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand what you're saying and I would never put other people's money or money that is needed immediately into speculative plays. My parents dont give me money I use my own when I invest. I was exaggerating on the percentages, I do have some money in some safer plays. Plus I'm 23 so I have the time to let things play out and I plan on holding PLTR for at least 5 years. I refuse to just buy because other people do, I've done my research before buying and I'm confident in my picks long term."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry to be like a party 💩
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol it's all good bro we need more sensible people around here with so many going all in on monthly PLTR calls around here.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean c’mon, they won the contracts to provide chips for both PS5 AND Xbox. That’s a mic drop, not a stock price drop. Wake up wall street."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of Amd's products are made at TSMC in taiwan
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m surprised the pent up demand caused by the chip shortage is not reflecting on the stock tbh. Once supply is restored, they’ll be making chips at full capacity for years to come and they won’t be getting any cheaper. I’m not up to date on the fire"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They provided the SOCs for the PS4 and Xbox One as well back and the price of a share was in the low tens. It's not that impressive.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"But you’re a 🌈🐻, so anything you say is highly unlikely"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Semis are overbought, well maybe but realise that the future is in the tech industry's hands. We will have chips in everything."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,AMD trailing PE is under 40. Not bad considering their revenue/profit/market share growth. What makes you think it’s priced in/overbought?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree. I remember someone’s comment awhile back about telling their future kids how they loaded up on AMD sub-$50 to afford the mansion they live in. I have the same outlook today with amd at $80
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i think that's out of their hands. Everyone can't supply due to supply shortage
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Intel is fubar. There was some DD earlier about how they are not doing well with 10nm chips and are power hungry. Maybe thats why Apple dropping Intel chips for their new silicon chips. Or maybe not.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,640K ought to be enough for anybody
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true a lot of cpus/severs come from TF-AMD in Malaysia
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s my concern as well. The shortage should at least have _some_ impact but I can’t see it myself. Anyhow, bullish on AMD with you. Got no positions though"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fire in Renesas factory won't effect AMD at all. Renesas makes chips mainly for car companies. Their process nodes do not overlap at all with AMD's needs from TSMC. Even if it did overlap, TSMC has been booked for years already and companies can't just come in and take supply away immediately. They would have to book it years into the future which would have zero effect on the outlook now."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re going to sell 100 million units of each console. That’s billions in revenue and is a good sign that their chip is the clear leader in the ever growing gaming sector.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I loaded up last may-June in the mid 50’s. It’s been my golden child in my portfolio
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,amd can reach hundreds easy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoosh. Sorry.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I left a job at Intel in January. They are about to complete a massive addition to their plant in Portland and still produce an ungodly amount of chips. They have been struggling to get their 7nm chips within spec. After working there I’m not inclined to invest in them. Massive operation and slow moving to make meaningful decisions. They will continue to be a mainstay in the industry obviously but I think there are definitely more appealing options.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Intel was about to launch their GPU with their inhouse 7nm process. They are still trying to get their in-house 7nm process to work at their fab-42. In the mean time they had a decision to make, outsource production to TSMC or Samsung. AMD exclusively uses TSMC today as do many others, their production capacity is booked for years to come. The other option Samsung is used by Nvidia. Samsung had to shut down their Texas fab due to the weather and is in the process of reopening it, I would imagine that the only choice for Intel would be to use Samsung. 

Nvidia was trading 45 dollars a share back in 2016. Intel is trading at 60 dollars a share today. I am willing to put 6k in into Intel and wait for a few years to see how they due with their GPUs. If Intel fixes their fab-42 to get 7nm process working this year, they will be the only company that owns the IP and Foundry."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not only is your comment not relevant to the fire in JAPAN. 

Also, “a lot” of chips can come from Malaysia, with “most” still being from Taiwan. 

You’re comment provided nothing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the PS4 sold more than 100 million units with an AMD Jaguar APU in it; yet again, their stock price was valued at a few dollars. Look at the historic data. The PS5 and Xbox Series X/S only have Zen 2 processors. They're already old news in this fast moving industry. Of course, it's not a bad thing for console gamers, but that's a different topic.

It's AMD's consumer desktop side of things that has mattered and has been the cause of their comeback. Don't bother looking at the consoles."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,also U.S government assisting american chip makers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was saying that most of their products are not from Taiwan and I’ve have not seen one chip from Taiwan this quarter in regards to their CPU/Server chips
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya I haven’t seen any chips from Malaysia either. Or Taiwan. Or at all. 

If only there was a way to know something I don’t already know. 

In 2018, AMD started shifting the production of their CPUs and GPUs to TSMC, -Wikipedia amd."

2021-03-22 18:30:38,wallstreetbets,"The Wolf of Wall Street Says You're Getting Fleeced By The Brokers and Market Makers **The real ‘Wolf of Wall Street’ has some thoughts about the stock market:** 

>""It's the most expensive 'free trade' you can have,"" says Belfort. ""I saw a marketing demo from one of the big 'free trades' players advertising how they were 'helping the little guy,' and they're hand in hand with the big guys. It was like a betrayal of trust."" He says that market makers pay so much for order flow because it gives them an exclusive window into where the market is moving. When firms see tons of orders coming in for Tesla, they can purchase shares for their own account, pushing up the EV-maker's prices for their clients when the next flood of orders arrives. ""Order flow is everything,"" he says. ""It tells you where the market is going next. It gives the high-frequency market makers a crystal ball and puts the small investor at a big information disadvantage. Seeing all that order flow gives a market maker information that the public doesn't have.""..In his example, if the market maker buys XYZ at $50.01 and sells at $50.09, it makes a fat, 8¢ spread. But if the firm ""worked the order"" by seeking buyers willing to pay a bit more, it could purchase for on behalf of its client at $50.05, and sell at $50.06. The seller gets 4¢ more, the buyer gets 3¢ off, and the trade costs the little guy just 1¢ instead of 8¢. ""Traders' compensation depends on marking up trades and keeping wide spreads,"" he says. ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation.""

What is Payment for Order Flow? [Investopedia Article](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/paymentoforderflow.asp)

>..payment for order flow is a practice pioneered by [Bernard Madoff](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bernard-madoff.asp)—the same Madoff of Ponzi scheme notoriety.The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) said, in a [special study](https://www.sec.gov/news/studies/ordpay.htm) on PFOF published in December 2000, “Payment for order flow is a method of transferring some of the trading profits from market making to the brokers that route customer orders to specialists for execution.” Payment for order flow (PFOF) is the compensation a broker receives for routing trades for trade execution.

[Payment for Order Flow is banned in the UK](https://www.cfainstitute.org/en/advocacy/policy-positions/payment-for-order-flow-in-the-united-kingdom)

[Payment for Order Flow is also not permitted in Canada](https://www.gbm.scotiabank.com/content/dam/gbm/market-insights/etf/october/2019-10-02-Free-Trading.pdf)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine you are selling your house. You list it for $200k but told the realtor you'll take $175k. A buyer comes along that told their agent agent thier budget is $190. The buying agent should negotiate down the price and the selling agent should negotiate up. Instead the two agents talk, and then buy the house together for $175k and immediately sell it for $190k. They then split the $15k between them.

The payment for order flow is 1 thing, failure to best execute is illegal and what should be addressed immediatly."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I only take advice from convicted felons so this resonates with me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mentioned in another thread that there really should be a master list (pinned to the top of WSB) of trading platforms that do and don't use PFOF. It's CRAZY how many people do it. Again, its like free money to the broker because they don't REALLY care about the financial well-being of their customers.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny to hear that guy talking about betrayals of trust
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It goes a bit beyond this actually - It also allows the market maker to decide whether they want to take the REVERSE of the trade... which is important because people like citadel with enough capital can use this to HOLD A STOCK PRICE FLAT.

Scenario:

Buy order comes in for GME through order flow.

Citadel decides to step in front of the trade and take the exact order, but in the opposite direction (short).

Instead of buying from the open market of shares, it is the equivalent of Citadel borrowing the share and giving it to you at that price instead. Resulting in no change to the underlying stock price.

Why would Citadel do this? Certainly it just exposes them to a ton of risk as they are taking the reverse of all of these orders? The answer is CONTROLLING VOLATILITY and PERCEPTION.

Reason 1. Robinhood can make the claim very publicly ""When you place an order with Robinhood, you own the shares. Period"". Umm yes we do, but our buy order was Citadel's sell order. They are TECHNICALLY correct, but placing orders for stock on pay for order flow systems allows your buy order to do NOTHING to the underlying as long as Citadel is willing to front the capital to keep the stock price flat.

So why do it? Controlling volatility is incredibly profitable. Citadel can now take a recently volatile stock like GME / AMC and make it trade flat. They can write MASSIVE amounts of puts / calls knowing they will never be ITM because they control the stock price. It is a free infinite money code.

BUT - Two things happen. One, they have themselves at risk because their short exposure goes THROUGH THE ROOF while they are playing these games - and two, it becomes less profitable for them over time as volatility drops and the premiums they receive go down. SO, it must go in cycles - a cycle of writing OTM options and receiving large amounts of profit - followed by a cycle of unloading their shorts and 'allowing' the stock price to skyrocket.

I believe this is the game they are playing - and volatility will be 'not worth it to them' after earnings because of the IV drop. That is why i predict a sharp increase in stock price immediately after earnings."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can test this quite easily for yourself.  Find a symbol that has a fairly steady price.  Put in a limit order that crosses the spread.  You'll see that your execution price will likely be *better* than the price you specified, ie, you got *price improved* over what the public market offers.  If other people are able to make money, while still giving you a better price than what a professional trader would get connecting directly to the market... what do you even have to complain about?  Just take your free trade, say thank you, and enjoy your stonks.

All of these trades get reported, so these wild speculations that seeing your order flow gives the market maker inside information about the future is just plain ignorant.  They make money by executing your order, even with price improvement.

Say the market is 3c x 4c, you submit an order to buy 4c / share.  The stock fair value is known to the market maker due to skill and risk at 3.6c.  Since you are a retail order, they can safely assume there is little adverse selection risk that you know something they don't know.  This allows them to fill you for, say, 3.8c, pay 0.1c to the brokerage, and still have 0.1c profit *on average* leftover for themselves.  That's not nefarious, it's a win win situation and the core of how capitalism works.  If you are an autist, maybe they will lose on this trade.

The fees for retail traders are approaching zero.  They are as low as they've been at any time in history.  You get access to these technological marvels that give real time, epsilon-close-to--fair-value pricing, and yet everybody thinks it's the worst thing in the world and they are getting screwed.  Yet fees and fairness in US markets are much better than virtually any market for any other product in the world.  Do you get the cheapest price available anywhere in the country when you buy milk from your grocery store?  Is that *nefarious*?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Something something service is free something something you're the product
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But if I just bought once and don’t plan to sell til we moon does this really matter?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean we live in the world of big data. The fact that this surprises anyone is wild. Of course they analyze our data. Nothing in this world is free.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't believe the bs..

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trading 212 the broker I will be leaving shortly did the following:
Stopped buy orders on gamestop just like robinhood
Claim to be free then start charging for deposits after gamestop first big run
They are currently hiding gamestop from their ""Upcoming Earnings'' list despite earnings being TOMORROW. 
I chatted with someone using their chat function and he admitted it was a mistake and is going to tell his superiors. Can anyone recommend more legitimate brokers in UK? I don't mind paying"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Before TDA and other brokers were selling your order flowing and charging commission. Now it's no commission fees but still selling oreder flow. Best will be a broker like IBKR pro where they do not sell your order flow.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This will not get through to anyone and they’ll still use Robinhood because they’re too lazy to find a better broker.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So let me get this straight. The people getting ""scammed"" by brokers and market makers are taking advice from one of the biggest scammers in the market?

Are they just free to get the retail in the door and then hope to convert to paid products? Are they just big enough that instead of PFOF they just have a brokerage for retail then what their own market to front run it?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"can't we just make payment for order flow super illegal then wtf

let the brokers that charge $5 per trade die and let the big banks who can withstand the hits get all the trades going through them"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally, I'm okay with this compared to having to pay $9.95 per trade."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,sorry to tell you but brokers and market makers dont give a shit about your 1 lot in a meme stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They aren't really getting 8c spread anymore on liquid stuff. Sure they could take your buy orders and sweep up the book if they were thinking the volume would move the price higher but That entails them taking risk.

It's just as easy to get caught on the other side of that trade If you are a market maker. Big firms most likely would use that run up to fade one of their institutional buyers a deal maybe improve them three to four cents a share. And walk away with a commission of 5 to 6 cents a share. It looks like they turned a little profit on the commission but they really padded that profit with you on the other side."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah no shit. This was news like 3 years ago.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My first thought when opening my brokerage account was... ""I don't have to pay for this? Don't I pay for each trade or something? No? Are there ads? No? Sooooo, is my brokerage a charity?"""

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm nitpicking over one line but... ""You'd have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation."" Teresa took money from Charles Keating who donated millions to her and let her use his private jet on trips to America. He was convicted on many counts of fraud, conspiracy, etc, costing the federal government over 3 billion USD. He probably served just under 10 years for it all. Teresa said that Keating was a good guy and should get a lenient sentencing. She also believed that the suffering of poor people was good for the world. So, would you have to be Mother Teresa not to fall for that temptation? Probably not."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys know he was a scammer and has no real knowledge of finances or trade analysis?  I don't trust a fucking thing Jordan says.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's why you don't wanna day trade. Buy and hold stocks you believe in and if your thesis is correct - order flow or no order flow makes no difference.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding helps.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If a convicted felon says it it must be true.  They are known for their honesty, you know."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I think the idea that individual investors do get screwed a bit more on their orders is true, but also it is entirely within their control. Most open orders are limit orders, so the buyer or seller says, ""I will only pay $50.01"". The market maker doe not have the ability to ""force"" the buyer to buy at $50.04. All they can do is not fill their order, but the buyer is fine with that. Similarly, you have a seller that says, ""I will only sell for at least $50.09"". 

&#x200B;

In this situation, the market maker can't just ""find"" new people to bring into the market, they just can't do the trade until someone new enters. Then you get the small ape coming in and putting in their order as a market order. If they are trying to buy (cause they never would be selling), then they are saying, ""Ensure I can buy 100 shares at whatever price there is"". By placing a market order, you take away your ability to determine buy price. So the market maker says, ""Ok, there is someone willing to sell, but only at $50.09"", so the ape' order gets filled at $50.09, even though the listed price of the stock may be $50.04, or 50.03."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly why do we listen to anything this guy has to say? He would sell your mother if it makes him money...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won't name names, but I worked with one of the guys on a few real estate development projects who was a character in the movie Boiler Room.  It amazed me how a guy convicted of being a conman and was sent to prison was able to raise tens of millions of dollars and do large projects with his history.  On top of it, his 90 something year old mother was the ""CEO"" of his development company so he wasn't subject to legal judgements due to his criminal past.  He told me prison was the best thing that ever happened to him, but I felt like that was just a line he used."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100% true Robinhood never gives the shares at the price you decide to buy at. The last trade I ever did I tried to purchase at 13.10 got it for 13.48 and what is a percentage of a stock you have 103.56 shares stick with a real firm like Fidelity or E*TRADE don’t trust anyone that says they’re looking out for the little guy be real protect your assets and watch out for your own A$$!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean he got caught, but who would you trust to know the ins and outs of a system if not a guy who profited off knowing those ins and outs.


Given recent events, imo Jordan understands the stock market better than hedge funds. I mean he made money, he didn't lose billions in a couple days through fucking up his investments.


Jordan Belfort didn't get in trouble for manipulating the market, defrauding investors, and gaming the system.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> there really should be a master list (pinned to the top of WSB) of trading platforms that do and don't use PFOF

Would be nice to have but I wouldn't hold my breath if I were you.

Reddit doesn't support that many pinned topics so it'd have to be combined with some other pin or put into the sidebar or wiki where few people will ever read it.

Meanwhile the info can get out of date which is a risk, and maintaining it to mitigate that risk adds workload to the already thankless and time consuming job of modding reddit.

And in the end this is not really a ""let's educate people"" sub is it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I need the broker really care about their customers money that much in the first place? Like commission order flow they’re making money portrayed not based on profits for the investor right?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">I believe this is the game they are playing - and volatility will be 'not worth it to them' after earnings because of the IV drop. That is why i predict a sharp increase in stock price immediately after earnings.

Wait a second. Isn't this basically a feedback loop issue? If IV dropping means price rocketing, won't that also result in IV *rising*? Isn't IV ultimately really a measure of demand for options? And on earnings, IV drop is an *expectation* based on history / norms. But my understanding is it's not necessarily a 100% *given*, right?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So if I’m understanding you correctly (probably not) buying and holding actual shares is still the best plan?

Maybe there is a grain of truth in there somewhere, but overall it paints a highly distorted view of the industry.  It's largely traders complaining that they were exposing their intent to execute large orders unknowingly with their terrible order routing, and claiming anyone smart enough to notice the publicly available information and act on it is cheating them.

edit to say: I like Michael Lewis, he's an entertaining author and Flash Boys is a fun read.  Just don't think you're suddenly an HFT expert after reading it, there's a lot of exaggeration and ""artistic license"" in there."

Odds are he'd be denied a brokerage licence and his firm, if ever he tried establishing, consulting or working for one would be heavily scrutinized and/or shut down immediately. Definitely one if those proverbial 'fool me once' type things. Besides, I actually believe what he's saying because it's true, any basic knowledge of how Wall Street operates will lead you to discovering about high frequency trading.

There are other brokerages out there."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity does not engage in PFOF for buying/selling stocks/ETFs.

It does engage in PFOF for options but it is relatively very low relative to rest of industry (\~10 cents per contract. brokerages like Schwab == \~35 cents, Robinhood == \~58 cents)

That said, Fidelity is big enough to not care overall. It's probably the best retail brokerage overall."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I wasn’t engaging with his opinion on this I was taking the piss.

Seriously though, commission free trade is fair for retail if they have a small account that makes small trades. For example if you are say, depositing < $500 a paycheck and buying some stock with that cash in orders of less than $500 this model is 100% in your favor. You will never get sold to higher than 1% above best available price so, it works better than a $5 commission. Your biggest danger is if you limit buy and nail the bottom, your order just won’t execute. On the other hand if you’re buying in $ amounts significantly higher than that yes you’re getting fucked and you should probably move to IBKR which has a much different model for ordering. As far as “institutions are fucking you simply by having your order data”, they have order data already if your point is that they have an advantage then yes. Institutions are paying millions for data, they do have an advantage. The advantage doesn’t go away when we start paying $4.95 to trade again."

They can manipulate the retail investors at time of purchase or sale - or manipulate timed things like expiring options - but they can't do anything to the folks who are just buying and holding.

That movie is great tbh but it is honestly a travesty to think of how beloved that film and its characters really are, even if it’s fans and creators swear otherwise.

All so that they can do their thing that is of - at best - questionable value to the market. That sounds worthy of a hit job to me.

If not for the free commission, I would have had to pay $4.95 to buy and then $4.95 to sell... I would have lost money even though I did time it correctly. And the stock then went back down, so I would have been stuck holding the stock because it never made it high enough to be profitable to sell it with a fee tacked on.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So the alternative is to just pay $5 for each trade. What I’m showing you is they get less money per trade with order flow payment than they would just collecting $5 on a trade (small retail accounts). There’s no way you can expect to just trade free of charge without someone making money on it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say there are sellers with limit sells at 10.01 and buyers with limit buys at 9.99: Anyone who puts in a market buy will pay 10.01, while anyone who puts in a market sell will get 9.99. If I try to put in a limit buy at 10.00, it simply won't happen even though the last trade could be 9.99 for someone else buying. Someone else got priority because the brokerage is silently adding a couple cents to my trade in order to profit from me on the spread. 

Basically my limit buy 10.00 is really 9.97 on the open market because RH wants to pocket the spread. If I limit buy 10.04 suddenly my trade will execute at 10.02 ""woo RH got me a good price!"" But they actually paid 9.99 for the share and charged me .03 for the privilege."

New brokers claiming to represent the little guy are allowing us to buy and sell free of charge. In exchange they take millions of orders and inform the big hedge funds what we are doin(this makes more sense if we consider the limits that people place through Webull, RH etc.) 

Pretend the price of a stock is $469 And they tell the big hedge funds, ""Hey, looks like we have a 100, 000 shares with a limit to sell at $450""

The hedge fund can drive the price down to $450, to trigger the stop losses and limit sells. The information they have from our small brokers allows them to predict how their movements will affect the rest of the numbers.  After the orders trigger at $450 the price gets driven down to $435, then they buy up more shares than they sold moving the market. Now the price is $460 and tons of ppl just sold for losses at $450. In the end you can see how this is essentially stealing shares from the small time investors, as these were the ones who sold at the days all time low and didn't have an opportunity to buy back in."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My brother in law uses wealth simple. They have a better app design than the itrade. What are the commission fees for WS? A nice thing about itrade is when I transfer money from my account, it is immediately in my trade account."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello fellow canuckians -- I use Wealthsimple for comiss. free trading, CIBC Investors Edge (for options and div growth stock) and Ninja Trader (just for futures and sometimes.. OTC's). If you can deal with the SUPER lag after the bell, that 15min delay difference baby, then I'd argue WealthSimple is 2legit2quit. Here's why -- they do use PFOF and they aren't regulated by IIROC. Yes PFOF is gay, but it comes benefits especially if you want to scalp trade or leverage stocks you already have a position in on other brokers. With that in mind, I'm entirely OK with PFOF on WealthSimple because MarketMakers in Scoitabank (alledgley) get less than what a Citadel makes. Commercial law regulations on banks make payment for order flow harsher on taxes thus what they get paid out is entirely smaller in sum.

That being said you *literally* need a **strategy** when trading with WealthSimple. Never use market orders, I only use limit orders and if you're watching a chart on lvl 2 data those limit orders will be filled during the time the order is sent. I've made a lot of money just doing this process with GME. Carry on my wayward sons!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't trade options. Only buy shares and etfs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno maybe a little?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. I disagree completely. I’d be lying if I said I hadn’t been tempted and taken slight stabs at writing an essay on this specific notion in the past honestly.

Belfort was NOT shone in a light similar to that of your typical antihero, he shone bright and with hardly any honest to god *bad* deeds done. He steals money vaguely in a way that the movie gladly refuses to explain to you how it worked or how bad it hurt those that it hurt, then he does a bunch of drugs and wanders from various random fun problems for three hours, and that’s about it. We never *see him hurt someone*, like truly hurt someone in a repulsive way. We don’t. The closest we get is when he hits Naomi (which is immediately excused, and I’ll explain why, and shone in forgivable light). Belfort says “get the fuck out” to goldfish boy, but it’s always other characters like Donny who actually commit the repulsive acts like eating the gold fish 

We never see the true agony that his victims were left in because of his actions. We never see the true pain and suffering that people in the world felt because of him and people like him. We are shown his party lifestyle, the impending consequence of the pain he’s caused (which, again, we are not shown, almost like it’s irrelevant to the story...) and then how he felt bad about it a little by the end. My other point is that this all lies almost entirely in Scorsese’s direction. He’s a classic Hollywood style kind of guy, so everything’s always going to be shot clean and lit bright and cleanly, and so almost all the ways he chose to shoot, have his actors act, have his sets dressed, there is nothing ever unappealing or repulsive on screen or in the design of the film at all ever. It’s literally clean and glamorized the entire film and especially within Belfort’s character. The closest thing we’re shown that might make us really feel *sick* with Belfort is when he punches his wife once in the stomach at the epitome of the 3rd act of the film, when we already know that *this* Belfort is in a very bad place, and so when we do finally see him do something like this, this isn’t the normal Belfort, we know normal Belfort would never hit Naomi because he hasn’t for the last three hours. This psychology of story; this where it’s immediately excused. And then That’s about it. Everything else is shown in a super glamorized, or at least extremely forgivable, light.

We are never once made to feel “okay yeah, that was really fucked up...” about Belfort. Not once. He makes it home from the country club literally without hurting anyone or any*thing*! You at least never feel in the film, the way you’ve felt with Walter while watching Breaking Bad. And if we are made to feel something was fucked up, it’s only about how many drugs he did, like “haha that’s fucked up”. We’re never made *sick* of how he treats other people and what he does to them, only to himself and even then it’s because it’s funny and *makes you like him*. Depp commits  some *actually* fucked up and morally repulsive behaviors in Blow, and we are shown them, and it is not made so glamorous, especially with the unappealing locations/set designs and the literally “dirty” framing and cinematography style of a film like that, it influences how unfun it all feels to you as a viewer. 

all the ingredients of a movie make it what it is and most of the ingredients to WoWS are very clean and pretty and appealing and fun."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus fucking christ Im tired of repeating myself. Hes not a whistleblower, this is not new information. This has been discussed in depth already, he is not adding any new information to the conversation. 

Posts like this (which have inexplicably been posted on damn near every subreddit that has to do with stocks or the economy) only seek to give the man attention and establish him as an authority. He is not a person worth listening too, he has a huge record of continously scamming people as recently as 2015. Do you honestly think if we give him a platform of any kind, that hes gonna be real respectful and not try to screw us out of our money? 

Like, literally post a source from any one of the multiple people who discussed this and are actually reliable. Do not give this man a platform."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know for a fact they are not.  I've seen this in action.  I've seen how the reporting works to the SEC.  It's not possible to front run client order flow, as the acceptance of the order is marked to the microsecond, and the SEC scrutinizes all trades that get executed between the time of receipt and the client order being executed.

You're wildly speculating that entire firms are engaged in massive coverups in their SEC reporting, order timing, etc, but you don't have any evidence to support your claim.  Yes, people like money.  But they don't generally like going to jail, and the SEC gives huge whistleblower incentives for insiders to turn in illegal operations.

Most PFOF orders are executed *inside* the existing public spread.  How do you front run when you're giving the client a better price than you can get yourself?  It makes no sense.  Everyone loves to hate Wall Street though, so front page here we come."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably 99.9% of people will not make enough trading to have this problem.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Robinhood.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense. 
If you make enough money trading, keep the bulk of your account in less risky funds with a broker that is more secure. 
But I dont see why it would hurt to always keep a small percentage of your portfolio with one of the free trade brokers and just use that to move around in more risky investments. 

Not advice, just what I plan to do if I ever get off this rock.

Edit: Not RH tho"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats basically it.  At such a small level of being on RH/TOS you having your moves sold ahead/front runned hurts you like maybe a 10th of 1 cent.  But scale that up to a few mil portfolio and thats a few hundred bucks then scale up another level and it goes up further.  Interactive Brokers platform and app are kinda trash, but the execution is fast, fees are pretty low/0 depending on account type and its a one stop shop that can accomodate you when you are YOLO'ing GME and when your 50 and investing 1 mil into a dividend paying stock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not RobingFUCKINGHood. Thats the worst broker on this entire planet of earth.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll never be big enough potatoes for your individual moves to impact the market in a meaningful way.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You lose more than you think.

Even a small 500$-account.

RH gives the order, Shittadel writes an IOU for 220$, they group the orders.

Next days they short the hell out of it, buy all your shares at 170$ and cash the profit.

You're being hedged with your own investment.

You never knew it was an IOU."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The amount we lose on this is undefinable, because it looks like natural movements, but in reality they're taking every chance to trigger our orders and limits and make a few shares off us. As shares are typically worth more than dollars, they end up making more than collecting a commission"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no alternative, the system is set against us. We may have done away with slavery a long time ago, but just like China our lowest working class is no more than a ghettoed slave population."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have seen worst things with Schwarz & Lang. The price I saw was definitely low in my opinion and I ordered they just ignored my order even though the price I ordered is higher than the price they executed and that last for 15 to 20 minutes with normal volume. I didn't get any and next day it gap up of course. One has no idea how shady things could be.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's somewhat like when I hear someone say Elon Musk is a technological innovator.  He's not.  He has people for that.  He's a marketing man who has convinced investors he's an innovator or the face of innovation at Tesla.  The investors will find out he isn't when expectations of scaled up production he sold aren't met and he has to deal with 1 or 2 of the Big 3 to make it a real thing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you that easy to manipulate?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems like we have the technology to detect if a certain company or group is doing what you described. Isn't that what should be addressed? Isn't it already ""market manipulation"" to artificially ""drive the price down"" as described above? So the problem isn't that people's stop loss data is available, it's that no one is enforcing the rules and taking action against people who use that information illegally..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for explanation. I just find it hard to believe that the PFOF model/idea isn't used by every brokerage.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"they wont even drive the price down, they will just buy your shares at 450 and sell immediately on the market at 469 and pocket the difference... but thats not ""fruad"" the seller got the price he set and wanted. he should have been paying more attention to the market"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually going to make a post about each brokerage. And it actually seems Chase is the best brokerage in terms of PFOF part for both stocks and options.

I have no idea how intuitive Chase brokerage UI is (never tried). But on paper, it seems one of the best places for retail traders."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Schwab does PFOF for stocks. I am talking about out of the brokerages that don't do PFOF for buying/selling stocks.

Brokerages can do PFOF and still have price improvement. It just means you don't get the complete price back (that you could have elsewhere)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,3 day delay for deposits. 1.5% currency conversion on each trade

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used to be with wealth simple and TD, but I switched to Interactive Brokers. Very cheap trades for stocks and options, and you can convert currency at market rates. I find they’re much better than WS and the value is better compared to TD."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, maybe he had a little good in him. He donated to the poor and employed lots of people. Doesn’t change the fact that he also slaughtered innocent people, blew up a plane full of passengers just to kill a guy, etc.

I watched the Wolf of Wall Street and also read the books, and I don’t think Belfort was glorified either. He had a pretty glamorous life, but it’s made very obvious that he wasn’t a good guy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is a shame that we never see the people that Belfort hurt in the movie 

We just hear their voices over the phone when he’s selling garbage penny stocks to them 

That’s why I like “the big short” better cause it actually shows you homeowners going bankrupt and living on the street as a result of Wall Streets greed"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think we're supposed to be repulsed by Belfort specifically, we're supposed to be repulsed by the financial system and the way it enriches people like Belfort at the expense of everyone else.  Who cares if Jordan Belfort is a creep?  It's not a question worth making a movie about.  The message isn't ""crime doesn't pay,"" it's that white-collar crime DOES pay in America, and it's up to the viewer to be repulsed by that because we all know that we're not in the club."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't even mention that what Belfort was doing was illegal until pretty far into the movie, maybe the third act? 

I like your take on all this. Thanks for sharing."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah different kind of keys bro.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, there is a long history of sidestepping or otherwise evading SEC regulation and enforcement, but sure. If someone told you in the mid 2000s what was happening with mortgage securities you would have said “no way” too. Or abusive, manipulative HFTs that get special order types created for them by the exchanges. No way that would ever happen, right? Except that it did and does. The SEC is so far behind it’s not even funny."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The court would have assessed conditions of parole too.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but that’s what was essentially put out no? I’m good with Thinkorswim. It was how I was papertrading for a month or so (the initial GME surge hit my news page and intrigued me about stocks) and it’s how I actually invested Biden Bucks into GME. I’m a small ape (6shares) but am holding for tendies. If it busts, no worries, I’m only gambling what I can afford and dreaming of lambos (but I’ll suffice with a scale model if the gamble busts). 🤣"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We all have the problem. The whole market has the problem.

It doesn’t feel that way when you look at it from just you as an individual. But Market Makers lend your shares, take the opposite side of your trade. And often times have contracts for difference meaning they never buy any securities you trade. Their just paying you for your profit or collecting from you for your loss.

This behavior on 1 account means nothing. This behavior on millions of accounts and billions of dollars means this tiny loophole they are working is actually working against you and everyone else who retail trades. It only works for big money. 

So if they are using this info to realistically position themselves and not just process orders they very well could be costing you a lot more money then the $5.00 trade would."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"nope.  
I want a good price no matter what. Not a +0.05 price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree, although I don't have any personal experience with them. :D"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that seems to be what I gathered. I’m at a grand total of like $1200 invested in the market, so Thinkorswim works great for me, plus I got used to the interface for paper trades prior to actual investing. I will do more research if this turns into a long term thing for me (investing / gambling). Also not advice, I’m definitely a retard at stocks. 🤣"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The usefulness of commission free is definitely agreeable. The problem is that kinda ends up being the feeder that works against all retail traders. 

There will always be a massive (and steadily growing) number of traders with accounts small enough to benefit from commission free trading. Commission free trading usually means selling order flow. Therefore, the larger problem of big money being able to manipulate the market and act against your trades remains and is strengthened by that very idea.

The benefits of low/no fee services on small accounts are a positive thing, but the poison that makes it possible isn't. Need to find a way to 'fix' the order flow problem while still being able to offer free or low cost trading, as the market demanding that is rising."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure! I’m still small ape, but one day maybe! I’m already retired, so income is fine where I already am.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It sucks there aren't any other trading apps that are as easy to use and understand as robinhood. I think that's why so many people still use them. The design of that app is great

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $0.65 fee is pretty standard in most brokerages. But ya, your options will get sold regardless.

$0.65 is cheap when you compare to Robinhood. If you have a good brokerage, you might save a few cents per share due to sheer execution speed. And even 1 cent in share price with a contract is generally more than worth the $0.65 fee."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It didn't. It changed buys to only limit buys.

Which is what you should be doing with stocks with high spreads and/or low liquidity."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw blitz crash so many times and those who lost their share during the crash which last less than 10  to 30 seconds, no way they could get it back at the same price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"so you mean they put in a stop loss, not a sell order"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put in 400 just before the most recent gme run up, a few days after that update and it took 3 days and I only got 1 share when I could have got much more"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, how does someone get into trading? An interface like RobinHood helps you learn, at least, learn enough to know where all your money went."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know if I'd call it ""great"". ""Better than dogshit"", maybe."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looking forward to it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a good idea, I have E-Trade, fidelity, td and robinhood. Td is really not bad at all, not as pretty or intuitive as robinhood, but easy to find the information you want. Fidelity, for being as big as they are seems to be a little clunky, and the data I'm looking for seems to be lacking without digging in. But I'm new to it, still learning it. E trade I haven't messed with yet too much. Opened it awhile ago to buy a stock I was interested in that wasn't on robinhood."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly is fidelity spire?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it an intraday market halt?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, but it's not intuitive or easy, and most people won't do it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,only if you're on a cash account and turn off instant settlement
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,WeBull has the same business model as robinhood
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Large institutions buy and sell directly on the exchange for a massive fixed price per month not per trade and smaller institutions will buy through a brokerage with a specific custodial agreement.

Bigger retail traders definitely benefit from a fixed $5 fee like I already stated. If you’re arguing for a more progressive fee nobody is stopping anyone from switching to IBKR who has that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Huh? For options, ya. For stocks, no.

For options, you just have to accept IBKR Pro or PFOF life.

And Citron has nothing to do with PFOF. You mean Citadel?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tnx bro!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a lot of resources out there. If someone isn't willing to look past an app when it comes to gambling with potentially large sums of money, I'll say again, they probably shouldn't be trading.  

But that's just my opinion. Robinhood is super easy to use, but then again, so is a slot machine. Ease of use is often a design choice used to part the largest number of people from their money as possible. If nothing else, going in while being too lazy to do any research definitely bumps the risk factor up."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,... fair.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"An offshoot of Fidelity's main app (literally its own app) that has a wayyyyyy friendlier UI. It is not optimized for trading from Spire's app, although you can place trades from it. Its mostly catered to monitoring your account. The UI resembles RH's though, at least a lot more so than their typical UI on the OG app and broswer."

A lot of wsb people have no idea how halting works.

Halt has nothing to do with brokerage. That's entirely at the exchange."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, I am not arguing that anyone should do one thing or another, or that the current situation costs us more money in commissions. Only that the data they collect on these trades are being used to steal our shares and give us more empty bags on the grand scale"
2021-03-22 18:20:45,wallstreetbets,"$JKS is a genuine steal that people have missed in the clean energy sector Correct me if I'm wrong here, but JKS is selling way to cheap by current standards. For background, they're one of the leading provider for solar panels, and industry that will only get bigger over the next 10 years, has a price to earnings ratio of about 17, very low compared with the likes of Apple, and a price to book ratio of 1.2. Despite all this, their market cap sits at a measly 2 billion dollars, despite pulling in $8.7 Billion in revenue. They look severly undervalued, and may be the perfect play for any of you who are into clean energy."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Graded F on swingtradebot. Short and long-term outlook is bad. Why do you think it's going back up, as opposed to just fading away? To me it looks like the activity they did have approaching $80 was related purely to momentum and speculation trading during that brief window where anything that smelled like solar or weed or EVs was bloating purely on election projection. The way it fell off doesn't look to me like ""Buy the dip"" so much as ""Speculators lost interest""."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check ICLN ETF. For some reason all clean energy took a dive shortly after the Biden green deal spike. Possibly that the companies involved got way overpriced. ICLN is still up 50% from September of last year, but it was up around 100% before dipping."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got 20 9c 5/21  hoping to capitalize on a possible good earnings report at the end of April.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,whats the scoop on NLY? why everyone buying calls?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imo it will still hit 9 within the month, and the share itself will pay out dividends next week. Calls and shares are both the play rn"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly why I waited and still felt iffy when they were $0.09.

As you can see, its revenue is growing quite good and the management has said that they expect the growth to continue.

One negative is that, STMP has no debt at all(as you can tell from the interest expense row). One would have expected them to load up on those sweet sweet low interest debt like every other company. But STMP management is highly conservative(that's why they are avoiding guidance, I suppose).

Some of its products have mixed reviews online. But ShipStation and its recent product portfolio have good reviews.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

While some of its products have outdated stacks, they are heavily upgrading their software stack. 1M paid subscribers reached already(churn is low). And with a 77% gross margin, it literally prints money. With net income coming at close to 24%.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

They also serve all the major -commerce players. \*Amazon, eBay, Facebook, Google, Etsy, Walmart, Shopify, BigCommerce, Wix, Magento, Square, WooCommerce and others. We integrate with all of the major small business e-commerce tools and accounting software, such as QuickBooks, NetSuite, SAP, Volusion, ChannelAdvisor and others. We integrate with fulfillment solutions, such as Fulfillment by Amazon, ShipBob and others. And we integrate with ERP and CRM solutions, warehouse management solutions and transportation management solutions. In e-commerce generally, the strength of our partnership network for shipping is unmatched.\* -from the latest earnings call.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Note: their exists alternatives to some of its solutions(even a partially free one), but they don't integrate well with all providers and doesn't have all the solutions, and as a business customer, not having all the cost savings opportunity is not having an opportunity at all.

While when they terminated their deal with USPS the stock dropped heavily, the current COVID crisis proved that the management was right all along and this was the right choice for them.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

STMP is expanding internationally, and its international expansion is being hugely underrated IMO. Brexit may create some difficulty in the short term, but on the whole, it would be highly positive.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Stock is highly volatile, especially surrounding earnings, this I see as a positive for the Reddit gamblers. But the negative is its low volume.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

It has 90% institutional ownership. STMP could also double its repurchase program up to $120M till August. Very low short interest(no short sq ueeze for you).


Analyst price targets range from $280 to $405.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Although I don't trust Glassdoor much. CEO has 90% approval. Negative reviews don't point to too much flaws other than the usual staff. But they have a low diversity score.

And although employees say that they feel like a family, as a result of this, there seems to be some conflicts between STMP lifers and the newer employees.

Management's COVID handling is also praised.

&amp;amp;#x200B;

As a kinda SAAS company, I don't see why you can't invest in it. Especially, when there's rumour of rebranding on the cards. For reference, PLTR is expected to grow 30% for the next 4 years, isn't really profitable and stuff and look at PLTR's valuation metrics(P/S etc). While STMP will not likely grow that much(they grew around 30% CAGR for the last 5), it does have good growth potential in the 10-15% range(along with M&amp;A possibilities).

Also, it's not ATH, unlike some of the other ticker that gets frequently discussed. [CHART](https://imgur.com/a/vDvD8xV)

Not to mention, Alexa web rank shows almost all the various stamps website growing hugely(Metapack declined) in traffic in the last 90 days.

[For the people confused wth this company does. Here's all the details you would need.](https://d1io3yog0oux5.cloudfront.net/_13798a9768558fb36c854714f42a4ef7/stamps/db/641/4666/pdf/2021+Company+Presentation+-+Website+%28Mar-21%29+-+FINAL.pdf)

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Also, to add. IMO, long term trend is that more and more sales is gonna go digital and a big portion of this could be filled by small and medium enterprises who would use Shopify, Amazon etc channels to make their sales. STMP simplifies their work and saves them money in shipping and other stuffs like no other company. I would say, this makes them in just the right place in the right time. So, I would say, it's a long hold(a buy it and forget it stock)


*How this will play out?*
It will jump heavily before its earnings report in June and will dump after the earnings report(most likely scenario). This is how it played out in all the last quarters. It’s a classis case of buy the rumour, sell the news. Do remember though, past events don't really dictate future events

&amp;amp;#x200B;

Bearish case: Company executives seem to always dump their shares when they receive options (I know they gotta eat, but still). This is diluting and neutralising the buyback.

Other alternatives could develop that could challenge its position. While they are not doing now, it is still good practice to remember that it is not impossible.

This stock is not for the faint of heart because of its volatility.

And has very little options volume. So it’s kind of a shares play.

Management also seems to be ultra conservative, always preserving cash and stuff. While it is fine for a Japanese company. US stocks tend to get discounted if management does this sort of stuff(think BRK.B).

Also, their cash position seems to suggest they will likely conduct an M&amp;A which could negatively affect the stock in the short term.

I hope this helped you discover this ticker and you could do further due diligence on it to make sure if it aligns with your investment goals.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks guys, the 9c I wrote is all of a sudden at -259% today."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been held for a while. What are you seeing now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is very good for my confirmation bias, thanks. I'm 1503 units @ 8.94 as of today"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Literally how, the call prices have only dropped 30% from open"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cheap calls, dividend ex date this Friday, then earnings 4/28, all while already in a current upswing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm getting screwed by Analgang.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The option was worth a paltry 6¢ a share to write and looked quote safe from my end, until the apes arrived, bought a bunch of calls and drove it to 20¢."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That spike got me excited, as price continues it's uptrend after the obvious correction, I think we are still good to regain 30+% on option price.  Weeeeeelllll seeeee"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meh, if it gets assigned I'll just hide set a limit buy to get replacements.  Can't option wheel because my account doesn't allow puts yet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are exciting leverage.  In any case it's a call that I wrote and the ""loss"" is only of I decide to buy the call back.  At this point the call still isn't in the money, so if that continues and it expires OTM then I still get to pocket the premium and keep my shares.

By selling the call on my owned shares I automatically profit with the premium plus any valuation changes on up to the strike price, plus they're still my shares so I get the dividend."

Look back at GE last year after they was removed from the dow. Same thing goes with NOK."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont get it. Why nokia isnt shooting up in price.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a shit ton of year long LEAPS on NOK but idk. The float is HUGE like billions. People just aren’t buying NOK. Even after crazy amounts of good news it doesn’t move.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has to get some traction at some point soon right?? Good news after good news, could be a sleeping giant. I’m in!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just the float on Nokia was enough to sell my position this year. Billions of shares available for purchase. That's why this thing never moves.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I loved my Lumia 710.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hammered in tent stakes with my lumia icon/920. Worked totally fine. Flipped to using the screen to do it just to show off, damn thing bent the tent stake. Still no cracks, god tier phone"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Short interest is almost 0.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Due to the recent additions to technology, many people have taken NOK out of play due to other companies hogging the market. 

These 5G deals due include google, as well as foreign countries."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are awfully late to the 5g game, their product is not that good compared to competition, they are a struggling company that just cut down boatload of workers to get some profits on the paper.

At best it is long play that might or might not get you some gains in the coming *years*"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Look how massive the float is lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,because of the Eurostoxx 50.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck this shit is annoying
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Both of you are correct. I have both nok and bb and they do both go down on good news.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I've invested in both and fuck me they could rule the world and their stock would only go up 0.9%
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too. Reminds me of the Roy Purdy Video with BB, PLTR and GME dancing on the street."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also loved my lumia 920. Really wish they had it in that cool Cyan color that Nokia used for a while but that phone truly was the best. Windows phone had the opportunity to be a top tier OS, but they just couldn’t really break through and come across as cool or exciting."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You disgust me.

2021-03-22 17:20:18,wallstreetbets,"GME - Implied Volatility rather low for DTEs at 26th march? Been looking into the options chain today for GME, expecting to see a surge in IV across the board with the earnings coming up later tomorrow. Interestingly enough, the highest value on the chain seems to be 50%, which, considering this is GME we're talking about AND it's earnings day tomorrow, seems a bit low? 

It seems to be capped of at 50% currently.

Here's a look at the near ITM contracts:

Compare this to APPL's chain:

This might explain why so many people have pilled into call options this week, despite the very high premiums:

Now to the question itself, what gives? Does this reflect that market consensus is that earnings will beat and the stock will go up?  (Rocket go BRRRR)

If so, why are the premiums so ridiculously high?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,OP is wrong. IV is over 300%
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a meme stock right now. None of its behavior is logical. That doesn’t mean we can’t make money off it, but normal analysis won’t account for social media enthusiasm"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The math is just wrong, if you calculate those yourself most are well over 300%"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the volatility is high

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry that’s just yahoo finance pre market. See how bid and ask are 0? It will change after the open.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How could you not realize that this data is completely wrong and cross check it with another website? Did you learn what options were this morning? Why the fuck would you waste your time writing this out?

So many retards inadvertently spreading misinformation like this guy because they literally know nothing about the market but want to share their pea brain thoughts with others that know even less."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All you apes be sure to visit gamestops website and order something. Xmas is around the corner and all the young apes are looking forward to cool things under the banana tree from  the Apeclaus that lives in the deep rain forrest.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They have done a pretty good job of flattening the price to keep the volatility out. I was killed on optiins the last week
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah nothing makes sense right now just gotta hold and buy :/ not financial advice ofc
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Their AI/Algos don’t know what do do!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So it's displayed incorrectly on yahoo finance?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol..pea brain. My grandmother used to call me that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So it's high premiums  = effort to curb volatility?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not displayed incorrectly. Maybe you should look at it when the market is not closed next time??

Yahoo option data updates around 9:45. Godspeed retard"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s yahoo finance
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes maybe
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the point of the other guy's original comment. 

People that aren't informed, making BS claims without even bothering to double check their info.

It wouldn't be so bad if it was the old WSB (well, the insults would be a lot worse) because it would be downvoted to zero and ignored, but with so many gullible people here now, posting when you don't have a clue yourself is just irresponsible at best."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a newb, i don't know what the correlation is. I just know that without fluctuations options won't print haha"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only good for financials
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It is displayed incorrectly. The math is the same whether the market is open or not
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ideally you want to buy options when IV is lower, and it raises after you buy the option, I believe. Premiums on options are tied to the IV.

If IV is already high, you pay a higher premium on the contract, therefore needing a bigger break to make money."

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

Breaking these rules often leads to getting automatically banned (by a bot) for a few days.

This isn't personal, we're just asking you to take a break and lurk the community for a little bit. We're... ""special"".

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There will be an adjustment period yes, but these tech companies are now so large in so many different verticals that a bet on AMZN is a bet on AWS, the retail business, Whole Foods doing well, their shipping business doing well. It’s the net of a lot of things. Being able to bet on each individually would be better. I’d love to own a piece of AWS, but I’d pass on the rest."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,what color tastes best

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Thank you. Centralized power is bad, no matter if it's the state or a company. No single entity should simply swallow every competitor until it is the only beast left on the jungle. This can only end poorly.


Which is why the DTCC being the giant monster that controls the market is so bad, by the way - if the DTCC dies, the market goes down with it. What a load of bullshit."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed! RKT has been a floating in the same range since ipo and has only spiked interest because of the divy. This will continue its lackluster lateral movement.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like stated in title, its predictable tendies mate"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got calls im trying to have actually be ITM this week. Everybody get your ass and pick up volume lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for your answer. What I pretended to ask is, if I buy today, do I also get the dividend? Or the dividends are only for shareholders that bought the share before the announcement? Sorry, I'm not a native speaker"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But the share price should fall after the dividend is paid.  That dividend is priced into the share value.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Special dividends are not normally acceptable for reinvestment. Most firms that allow div reinvestment don't do it for special divs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If that happens my 3/26 and 4/1 calls should print nicely
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dividend was stated in their earnings call to only be applied to class A shares, ie if you had financial interest you got paid a dividend, Gilbert, Farner and crew arnt paying themselves"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but my expired RKT calls say otherwise lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, RKT is Rocket mortgage 🤔"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your prize is behind curtain number two 🍌🍌🍌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yall gotta learn that not every post about a stock that's not GME isn't a diversion. WSB existed before the GME craze, believe it or not."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This stock literally goes up and down religiously. Buy low sell high. What's the problem? The stock took the hit already getting ready to adjust for the dividend payment. When it does pay out. If half of those people put that back in to rkt it's gonna jump. Which is good for option calls. 

Gme is all about shares at this point. Calls are way to expensive for the premium. So while I sit here and look at gamestop move. I can at least make money off actually fair priced calls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lackluster? Bitch what? You can literally time when to throw all of your money in.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Funfair my son is 5 and I'm not selling anything I buy for him till he's 18 lol relying on you all gme fam
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the back up homie
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,should we buy silver too ?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,should i change my profile pic to my $23 gme call i bought in november for $600?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gonna get laid by showing off some Chad losses XD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,only for those holding the stock on the ex-dividend date
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s too late now apparently they had a cutoff date
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That happens on the ex-date, which in this case was March 9th."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You had to hold through the x date. I sold out of rkt a week or two ago but will still get my dividend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😂 don’t tell em
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying when I get my tendies I can't buy more tendie tickets?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,just send the money through your wife's boyfriend's account and they'll never know it is the same money
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most CEOs / shareholders wouldn't cut themselves out such an easy cash out. To me this is such a Bullish signal, like they will cash out there shares when the market finally properly values the company."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s rocket companies. Auto, home selling, personal loans, and insurance."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Fuck off.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m diversified but RKT is unimpressive and making bets based on timing past waves is pointless. Point being op’s cost average is already at a loss to current price so already failing the intent of the post.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"IV is around 100% on most calls, while not at GME levels it’s definitely priced in for any divy movement."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck with that, timing the market has always been the better way to play stock... I’ll stick with buying things I believe in and not worry about hitting the waves just right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Will silver be worth alot in 13 years?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you should change it to your lambo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,that already happened but way to look educated
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You can spend it on more shares it just won't automatically buy more for you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol more like ex wife's husband's account XD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Non of the executives sold at that run to 43... that has me extra strength bull on this yolo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Right on!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I mean yea they are pricing it basically how they have to which is fine. But 0dte deep otm calls are still like 300$
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's easy to time it when you see the pattern going on. Stop playing dumb.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So tomorrow I can buy 3k worth of moar shares :) thank God for a second I thought the above post was saying dividends can't be used to buy moar which honestly I thought was silly but wallstreets a silly place amirite?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's because they need to tell 3-6 months in advance that they will be selling. They can't sell on any day just looking at the stock price.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can downvote all you want, still not going to make RKT fly."
2021-03-22 16:36:47,wallstreetbets,Most anticipated earnings releases for the week starting March 22th

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GME conference call is going to be bombarded soon. I hope they upgraded their servers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If there was a pie chart for actual most anticipated I'd bet 90% would just be GME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I literally don't know any of these stocks... Oh wait, I think there's one I recognise..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where my HB Fuller peeps at??

Jk. GME, ride or die."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The always illusive 22th of March. Not to be confused with the 22nd.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My prediction is they sold 100% of PS5 and XBS they had in inventory
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they crack $1 billion for the quarter in online sales alone. 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. about 900million pre-owned games buys and returns at the 7 day mark. no profit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't expect it to be positive tbh lol.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't even know they had a stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, they're severely undervalued IMO. They don't really have any competitors and only got hit due to the lockdown. As long as they don't go under completely, they're gonna come back"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah crazy over-sold. Very strong financials and you compare it to MTCH with a market cap of 41B... Can see it be a 3x/5x bagger this year
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s so bad about it?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"for stocks that are priced reasonably, sure.  good/bad earnings reports means reasonably priced stocks will rise/fall reasonably.  

for meme stocks...the price fluctuations immediately after earnings reports will prob rise at a rate that is proportional to the meme-ness involved...maybe...  

I am not a financial advisor, but I watch a bunch of them on youtube."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do like other things. I just hate play earnings now. Bad earnings go down good earnings still go down. 

So i usually buy post good-earning dips as they usually at least recover."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"holy shiz, i threw a little down on that when i saw it on the massive upswing, got in a hair over $100, figured i'd get out with a small gain or a small loss, but decided to hang onto it for another day or two, and so far i'm up almost 50%!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree in general, but GME might be different. It is entirely possible that they make some sort of announcement (Cohen, CFO, recall, etc.) that acts as a catalyst for a spike."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,nah they're expected to announce a profit even the letter by ryan cohen suggested that they had massive sales
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Like looking at the screen at a racetrack to see which bets you wanna make

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,so your logic for GME not going up is to many people buying it?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao too many people are buying it so it won’t go up? You know you fucked up right...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who has me fooled??? Me after doing my own independent research fooling myself into buying a stock I think will go up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Pooor shill.  Buy a share.  You will feel better.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is a 2020 and Q4 earnings call plus I’m pretty sure pre orders are retained earnings so won’t hit the P/L.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"May i ask, how did you found out about them and decided to invest at that price point?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,since when do you need a reason to go all in into a stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because $BNGO was his $NAMO
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? Now that I know I'll prob invest post GME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely feels like they're also getting dragged down lately by proxy with Chinese stocks down. Was rallying nicely in mid Feb, up to $20"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"my admittedly limited experience watching, is that if a company *really* *really* blows the fuck out of expectations to the positive direction, it'll have a sizeable positive impact on the stock.  Otherwise, it's usually a small blip downwards.  If they really fuck up compared to expectations, then it might crater.

For certain stocks... who knows? we might be treading new territory here."

You mock folks that are hopeful for a wealth distribution and because some of us apes only have a small handful of shares we will top out (at absolute best) multi millionaires and not 100 billionaires???

Do you not get a massive amount of apes are barely hanging on fiscally and have almost no bananas to fall back onto during any hardships at all. I am talking about adjustments in what you eat and the price point of that all because you needed tires rotated or got a flat at the wrong time of the month.

And you just want to call a spade a spade? I do not know what tree you fell from but what you said lacks empathy and compassion.

If any number of apes here manage to not have to worry about rent, food, power for a large portion of their lives and it is due to big money always screwing the little ape, then brother, that is a social revolution.

I get what you think you are going for, 10 million is not even in the same universe as ONE billion, I really do grasp the desparity in the difference of those numbers and **because** of that large gap I am pushed even more to be disgusted towards wallstreet and their kin, I want any amount of change to occur and potentially spark something, anything."

🚀 **Live Thread**

**4:40 Update**

Sorry for the late update. Work had picked up significantly.

Nothing really changed since the last update. It seemed like some thing was pushing up, but it didn't continue after hours.

Enjoy the break while it lasts!

Current price: 194.48

**3:40 Update**

I may not get a chance to update right immediately after close, so I just wanted to give some thoughts if things stay like this.

I feel like the HFs made a strong push to get GME under 200. GME held on for 20 minutes before finally breaking the barrier. After GME stabalized, the HF fired another attack which brought it down to the 193 region. The rest of the day has been quite dull. We saw two whales which brought the price up to 196, but it's slowly settled back down to around 193.

There's just no volume. Nobody is making a move. It feels like not a lot of people are taking stock of what happens today and tomorrow until earnings are announced. It feels like a 4 day weekend.

Tomorrow might be just as slow.

Current price: 192.51

**3:30 Update**

Slight downward momentum so far. It seems consistent, but it might still be general volatility. Shorts available hasn't changed.

I'm not going to do a stock that Reddit is seriously looking at. I don't want anyone assuming that I know what I'm talking about and potentially make a bad decision.

I want a random stock nobody knows anything about that has some hilarious volatility.

Current price: 193.18

**3:05 Update**

Still pretty steady. It seemed like it was going up, but it's more likely just general volatility.

This might be a really boring Power Hour unless west coast retail makes a move during their lunch.

Anyone have a request for stock to watch while we wait for earnings?

Current price: 194.68

**2:39 Update**

GME stabalized again at around 194. That second jump seems like it might've been another whale! 🐳🐳

Power hour is coming up, let's see if GME can make it's way back to 200.

I don't know if a significant portion of people would care if GME ends in the 195 region. Again, it seems that most people are waiting until earnings to make a move. 

Honestly, I feel like HFs wasted their shorts today. If earnings come out great, HFs won't have as much ammo to stop a potential strong post earnings rally.

Current price: 193.53

**2:14 Update**

GME is rising! If GME finishes above 200, I will laugh. They'll have used 100,000 shorts and it would have effectively done nothing.

Current price: 194.65

**1:55 Update**

Whale sighting?

Small price and volume jump at 1:30. Stock went up by around $5. Either a small whale or someone closed some shorts.

If the whale is reading this, hello whale! 🐳 

Current price: 191.50

**1:34 Update**

The reason why earnings will be a reset is because the entire Bull Thesis is based on an assumption of what Ryan Cohen will do with the company. Earnings is a time where focus will be on what the company says. They might start showing their hand which could strengthen or weaken the bull thesis.

Nobody is really doing anything at the moment because most people have made up their mind with the current available information. There are a lot of people including whales that haven't made up their mind on the matter and are waiting until tomorrow.

I have no idea what's going to happen. I'm afraid to even speculate based on previous earnings reports with other companies. This situation is really quite unique, so we don't really have anything to look back on that can give us an idea of what may happen.

GME seems to have stablized again. There's a decent chance we might be chilling like this for the rest of the day.

Current price: 189.80

**1:27 Update**

GME has been slowly trending down. It's broken 190 and it's currently around 188.

Before anyone panics, please realize that volume is VERY low. It seems that a lot of people are waiting until Wednesday. EVERYONE is going to reevaluate GMEs value then, and we'll get a MUCH clearer idea of what the general sentiment is. I doubt that these two days are really going to affect what happens on Wednesday, regardless of which direction it goes.

Current price: 188.38

**1:12 Update**

Another dip pushed GME below 190, but it bounced back, hanging around 191. Shorts available for GME remained the same. I don't have the ability to calculate synthetic shorts (from ETFs), so I don't know what that situation for that looks like right now. 

I still don't know if they're playing for 175. These past two dips seem like their testing to see how effective their shorts are at the moment. They might be doing this to see if they even have the capabilities to hit 175. 

Volume seems very low, which tells me that retail didn't do much during lunch. A lot of people may be waiting for earnings to decide what to do.

I personally am waiting until after earnings to try and get a bearing on what the direction of this week will be. So many different things can happen that these two days kind of feel pointless. 

I want volatility!

Shorts available: 100,000

Current price: 189.74

**12:35 Update**

One thing I missed in my previous update was that HFs took out another 50,000 shorts.

I wasn't paying attention until now because I didn't see any actual dip. There was an interesting dip from 194 to 191. Those might have been part of the 50,000. If they used everything, they've spent 100,000 to drop the price by 4.15%. At this rate, I dont think they can make it to 175. If they can't make it to 175, I don't see any real point for then to try to push the price lower. It would make more sense for them to conserve what they have and just make sure the price stays under 200. If they run out of ammo and GME begins to skyrocket, they won't have a way to stop GME from compounding Gamma Squeezes. There's still a lot of opportunities for GME to grow, a lot of time left this week, and a possibly huge catalyst with earnings.

If GME starts pushing down towards 180, things would get really interesting, however it hasn't broken 190 yet.

Shorts available: 100,000

Current price: 191.30

**12:07 Update**

Lunch time. GME might do something soon?

It's eerily calm right now. After all the volatility we've seen towards the end of last week, I can't tell if things are setttling down for a bit or if this is the eye of the hurricane.

Current price: 194.23

**11:46 Update**

While we wait for something to happen, I figured it might be fun to start a discussion.

[Does a crowd sourced investment firm exist?](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mame8e/_/grtm25v?context=1000)

Current price: 195.08

He basically calls out the failure of the current board to recognize the failing brick-and-mortar business model and pivot to tech and e-commerce and lays out the basis of a transition plan. He has since been brought onto the board and is heading the transition committee.

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last 2 big news catalysts?

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: **83,111,740**

02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020



Next confirmed Gamestop announcement: 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

For those that want to dial in:

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good morning apes! I'm excited to finally update this to *tomorrow*. I've also written out more info in a [longer DD post](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maluw5/gme_volume_price_and_gamestop_news_catalysts/).

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last 2 big news catalysts?

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: **83,111,740**

02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020



Next confirmed Gamestop announcement: 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

For those that want to dial in:

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low volume + slow decline in price = day traders, which means more shares for shorts to buy (bad). We get a few spikes early and late in the day which is either auction activity (centralized liquidity) or quick moves to achieve small corrections or test resistance. Meaning all of this going up or down +/- 5% is meaningless to the larger thesis."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low Volume is dead boring, but it leads to the moon. Just check the volume from 01/12 and 02/23. Take care of yourself for today. There might not happen much while checking a line and refreshing your browser every 5 seconds. Be patient"

I wonder which will happen first, GME squeezing or me getting this job."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestock isn't so great? Are you kidding me? When was the last time you saw a company founder with such ability and movement as Cohen?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until volume picks up when price is moving down, there's no reason to get nervous or panic because that means there are very little sellers at this point.

My best guess is everyone is waiting for earnings announcement tomorrow after trading hours."

There’s no sell off or short attack.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Down 6% and people are screaming the sky is falling 😂🤣 if you can’t take the heat you shouldn’t have bought. This is going to be a battle.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This dip is honestly nothing to worry about. We've seen this pattern for the last two weeks: ladder sales push the price down all day during market hours, just for it to bounce back up in after hours. Bet money we'll close around 200 again.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is consistently compared to Blockbuster.

Watched ""The Last Blockbuster"" last night. CFO at the time said in '08 they were trending up and competing and outpacing netflix and other competitors. BUT they did not have the capital to cover the growth. They had massive debt. 

GME - Has the leadership to turn this around. They also don't have billions in debt looming over their heads. Even without a squeeze (there will be one) this could be 200-500 fair value stock in a few years. 

If you are worried about the risk of holding or the squeeze not happening. Just remember who is in charge. GME is not dead."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For context, the stock is only down 5% in a week (5 trading days). 

This really isn’t as doom and gloom as some are making it out to be, looks more like consolidation on low volume to me. Shareholders likely holding and not selling."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me I'm wrong but I sense actual anger from some of the shills. Wonder if today was a crucial day for them? There was an excessive amount of shilling today. I mean it was just a normal day of holding for us but they are losing thier shirts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Some see a day like this and say it's flat... I see it as one day closer to the fucking moon

Why not?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a kind reminder of my opinion the earnings of Q4 2020 do not change anything, maybe its a positive catalyst but if not, we keep holding and waiting for Ryan Cohen to turn the company arround and grill the shorts.."

What do I know though, I'm retarded."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone who is having doubts about tomorrow and aren't fully trusting of the DD posted here should seriously go and read Ryan Cohen's letter to the board. This is posted on the SEC website so it's legit.

You read that and try to tell me RC isn't taking GME seriously. He wants the board to turn the company around. He is slapping them in the face with their failings. 

I don't want to jump to conclusions but if RC participates in the earnings call tomorrow things are going to be great.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possible scenarios for GME earnings tomorrow?  I figure I'm going to get downvoted to hell here, but let's have an objective conversation shall we?  Would love to hear from both sides.

**Bearish:**

* Execution of existing $100M shelf offering
* New shelf offering (I think this is highly unlikely)
* New console sales are a nothing burger (profit margins are thin, and sales may not be as good as people think, especially with PS5 inventory issues)


**Bulliish**

* Revenue beat on new console sales and likely increased sales from all the media attention (I personally just bought something from GME recently and never would have previously)
* Cohen == CEO
* Kill old shelf offering
* Split ( is the thinking here that a split causes a reconciliation on fake / synthetic shares? ) 
* New strategic partnerships
* Massive increase in paid PowerUp Rewards subs (if you're long and not subbed to the $20/yr plan, wtf are you doing?)

Position:  Currently holding all of 25 shares"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I swear if I see 1 more article about how high a price GME is, and how it doesnt match with fundamentals and earnings etc etc imma fucking snap.

You dont read articles every day about tesla being over valuated?  You know, that company that had consecutive losses quarter after quarter. 

TSLA most recent reported quarter, sure they did 10.74B in revenue, but only made $270M profit on  959.85M shares, for a  643.102B market cap.  share price: $670.  Thats a ratio of $1 of profit to $2381.86 of market cap.  reported quarter EPS: 0.99.

GME:  estimated from new sources:  2.21 Billion revenue, earned \~100M profit, with a 13B market cap  Share price 193 close today.  Thats a ratio of $1 profit to $130 market cap.  Gme:  $1.35 EPS.

So, I wish the media would fuck right off about how GME isnt worth its share price - there are plenty of high demand companies not worth their share price due to branding, demand, popularity, and appeal.

If fundamentals meant anything, no one on wall street would have bought Roblox, and a host of other companies, no hold them long."

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last 2 big news catalysts?

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020



Next confirmed Gamestop announcement: 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

For those that want to dial in:

Having said that I just bought more GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, if this falls because of the earnings report or because of a massive hedge attack I’m ok with it. 

I want to buy everything, so a price drop is welcomed with open ape hands!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda wish I'd sold my AMC when it was at 14... could have bought another GME share or two if I had

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think odds are good GME does a special dividend in the near-term. Not many other ticker shareholders have been through such a ride.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets," With their big change, for me Gamestop can really take a special place in video game business. With good internet, PC, services in their shop he can reproduce the success of coworking in gaming area. He can be the WeWork of gamers. Not just a meme stock, I HOLD."

What is this? Volume for ants!?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont understand the shills anymore, do they affect anyones morale at all? HFs, you should not waste ur money on that anymore, focus on paying us instead."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have tried to avoid getting involved in this, but apparently my energy stock is mirroring GME this past week for like no reason so keep gambling, weirdos. I need this to go up."

I think we are gonna see a decent beat, but HFs are gonna short heavy to drop the price back to it's ""fundamental"" valuation, and the media will claim that everyone was ""brought back to earth"" by the earnings. I don't think that suppressed price will last more than a day or 2 tho."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was actually okay today as I reflected on a couple things.  First, the entire reason I even bought in the first place was as a big flip off to the Smart Money and the system that causes college grads to be in debt for most of their adult years and rich people and relatives thinking we're too dumb to try such risky stuff.  Now, after reading all the DD, I'm confident that this is a darn good company and stock.  Even if it never squeezes, if we are patient, I believe we will all get our money back and then some, even the apes that bought at the highest so far (if patient and holding).

The other thing is that I think Wall Street wants GME to go down, with us in it.  They are doing everything in their power to not let it succeed.  Historically, if you look at FB when it IPO'd, they did the same thing to Zuckerman and squelched it for a month, scaring people who maybe didn't have a lot of market experience but believed that the company was good.  Sadly, I knew some very good people but timid as investors that freaked out and sold at a loss.

Stay strong fellow apes!  Fight the good Fight!"

CITADEL LLC, FORMERLY KNOWN AS CITADEL DERIVATIVES, WAS INVOLVED IN THE CREATION OF FAKE SHARES OF FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC IN 2008. 

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf)

""The largest trading electronic exchange network appears to be Direct Edge, who is owned by Goldman Sachs, Knight Capital Group and **Citadel Derivatives Group**. Knight and Citadel are also registered market makers on the NASDAQ trading the GSEs.""

The Wall Street financial reporters who have analyzed the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac debacle have so far concluded that their demise was a result of the public‘s failure to pay their mortgages. They are blaming the public without considering the massive fraud that was occurring and continues to occur. This fraud resulted in a vast amount of money that was stolen from the marketplace that destroyed the ability of these GSEs to raise their own capital. The GSEs are unable to raise money, as they had in the past, by selling their stock to investors.  Absent the market makers fraud, it is probable that the GSEs would have survived without taxpayer intervention .

 Other stocks that appear to be under stress, as discussed in the news media that may need government assistance or may go bankrupt because they cannot raise capital with their depressed stock prices are: Washington Mutual Inc., Lehman Brothers Holdings, Inc., American International Group Inc., National City Corporation, Wachovia Corporation and Ford Motor Company. **These stocks also appear to be counterfeited.** 

Incredible that this has gone on for so long and they are STILL going to get away with it. Citadel has been doing this for decades."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"### You're wondering about 372?

372 was hit in an unusual buy in which 100 shares were sold at a disproportionately high price. 

**WHY DID THIS HAPPEN**

- GME had very very low volume today and even less volume after hours. After the closing 1 minute candle, 100-1000 shares were being traded per minute. Not a lot, relative to GME's last 7 days. 

- Scenario 1: Someone purchased a large amount of shares in a market order, ate up all the liquidity (of which there was not a lot of) until it started buying shares at an unusually high price.

- Scenario 2: Someone fat fingered a limit order. 

**WHAT DOES THIS MEAN**

- Nothing - this happens all the time. Search through WSB history with the keywords ""did anyone else"" ""AH spike"" and ""google price"". Google's stock price display almost always fails to parse this noise as noise and displays it as if it's the new trading price average. This is why using any REAL broker **which is the only place where price matters** will show the price never even touching 372. 

**HOW FINGER POINTING KILLS YOU**

- There are a lot of people here who likely haven't been trading too long using this Google Stocks 372 price as evidence that the real price of GME is ""being held down"" and finger pointing anyone disagreeing with this as possible shills. This is how the most retarded ape kills the entire pack. 

**WHAT DO I DO IF IM NOT SURE**

- Follow the volume. 372 only matters if there is volume supporting it. Pull up a REAL chart (thinkorswim [free], tradingview [free], bloomberg [fuck you poor]) and look at the price in question and the volume. If you see a small amount of shares traded at a super high price and **NO OTHER TRADES AFTERWARDS HITTING ANYWHERE CLOSE TO THAT PRICE**, THEN IT IS AND ONLY IS **A GLITCH**.

There is no conspiracy here in this one guys. What you're seeing is the difference in people who believe they're right and the people who are right. Look for the people who aren't pointing fingers and throwing poo to uncover who's actually right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Happy Monday you beautiful fucking apes! Remember, GME may go up today, and it may go down. Stay calm, stay hydrated, eat some crayons, and breathe easy as we fuck up some hedgies day! 🦍 🚀"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be another day of ups and/or downs today, so here are some tips for you apes to stay on top of your game.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Safety first - make sure your bicycle helmet is safely secured at all times. Ask a *responsible* adult to do the clips at the bottom if you’re finding it difficult.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If anyone is watching the ticker constantly still they're next level retarded unless they're day trading or planning to buy more on dips.

If this shit moons it's not gonna be over and done in a flash. If there's a big dip we're all holding so it doesn't really matter, does it? Price is irrelevant until squeeze off unless it goes low enough to allow all shorts to be covered, in which case we're fucked and it's game over anyway.

No big action is gonna happen today, everyone will be waiting for earnings tomorrow to decide whether to FOMO or GTFO so today is irrelevant."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you wait for the boom, it'll be too late for huge profits. Buy when everyone else is scared. That was in February. I am sorry if you missed that train or sold at $350 for weak profits, and thought you could get back in for < $100. Sometimes the best move is to hold and buy the dips. The best things in life requires patience and dedication. People are waiting on the sidelines to buy your golden ticket at a discount."

The inevitable is they have to buy the shares at some point , it cost nothing to hold something you own . Breathe set price target alerts and go enjoy yourself . Don’t drive yourself mad , all the dd and also hearings shown they aren’t covered . They are no where near being covered. Go have some fun. Not financial advice ."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm feeling that this low volume and general price stability over the past couple of trading sessions is probably because of 💎🙌.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"An interesting find for anyone wondering about outgoing Gamestop board members who may sell a large number of shares:

>**Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck** [told the board they don’t plan to stand for reelection](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-will-add-activist-investors-to-the-board-the-stock-shot-up-51610384385) at the company’s annual meeting in June. The board will shrink to nine members following that meeting.

Per [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-insiders-sold-stock-before-it-went-vertical-51611760507) three of the four members **sold a large % of their personal stake in Gamestop around January 13.** 

>GameStop Chair Kathy Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $1.4 million, a per-share average price of $27.99. Vrabeck, a senior client partner in the consumer markets division of Korn Ferry, now owns 79,537 GameStop shares. A director since June 2012, Vrabeck last sold stock in September 2015, selling 5,000 shares for $209,800, an average price of $41.96 each.

>Raul Fernandez sold 38,119 shares from Jan. 13 through 15 for a total of $1.4 million, a per-share average of $35.50. Fernandez is a vice chairman and owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, a private partnership that co-owns the NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals. He now owns 29,289 GameStop shares. It is the first stock sale for Fernandez, who joined GameStop’s board in April 2019.

>Lizabeth Dunn sold 5,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $156,700, a per-share average price of $31.34. Dunn, founder and CEO of Pro4ma, an IT services consulting firm, now owns 57,258 GameStop shares. She joined the board in April 2019, and this is her first sale of stock."

Both sides have held their positions for a decade plus, at a complete stalemate. The trench warfare has led to distinct cultures and ways of life.

Shorting hedge fund managers and their progeny now have a cult like worship of black holes. They believe the slow dissolve of their multi-generational wealth to interest rates is their holy birthright. Eventually they, like blessed light, will be absorbed entirely by the One True Lender Bank, and they will come out the other side clean and pure. They must not hasten the process, though, just as light cannot hasten its black hole rebirth. It was born with a direction and held it firmly, for eons.

GME shareholders now live in a caste system. Citizens wear physical symbols of their number of shares, like pieces of flair. Children inherit their parents’ flair, and weddings are arranged so as to strategically join the shares and average price of two families. The vehicle of choice is a Tesla Short Bus, and everyone prays to Deep Fucking Value each night. He answers their prayers by holding, and they honor him by doing the same."

Which means Citadel CEO 🤥 said it was short covering. At that time it was 140% short interest. And CEO of Interactive Broker which also stopped trading, the day before said only 50 million shares available. Which CEO of Citadel and Melvin said kinda of maybe cover 30 to 40 million, which Gabe said it wasn’t shorts covering. Would have need 140% of all available stock to cover, which only 50 million were available and from that maybe covered 30 to 40 million.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would like to remind anyone onlooking at this point in time...

The volume is low. It does not represent the sentiment behind the stock.

Nobody is going to commit to any significant movements behind this stock before the earnings report and the soon-after conference call.

Historically, the last 3 catalysts have all moved the stock some 100% within 3 days. And some of those were just speculative tweets.

We. Are. At. An. Actual. Earnings. Report.

With. An. Actual. Conference. Call.

These are just **mammoth sized catalysts**.

I legitimately don't believe anybody who holds this stock right now is genuinely selling.

This is the same pattern we've seen for over a week now. We had two short attacks test the 170 boundary, both failed. Ever since, it has just had a slowly tapering decay. Who said this wasn't a short attack? It's a *different kind of short attack.*

Every time there *is* volume, it always favours the upside. That's because it is A LOT harder to buy shares than it is to sell them. Every indicator is still bullish.

So wait until catalysts come and go.

If you bought at over 200, you only lose if you sell. If you bought at 40, we are never seeing 40 again unless the company completely blocks RC from doing anything. Unlucky for those put holders, RC already has the go-ahead from Gamestop. lol

So sit back, don't look at the price all day. Have a good one."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not looking for investing advice :P But does anyone know if I can buy on Fidelity using unsettled cash? I was too afraid of transferring from RH and getting stuck in hate limbo so I just sent over money to Fidelity to buy more GME and hold both accounts until after the squeeze. But it's been a few days now and the cash hasn't settled yet. So is it okay to buy tendies as long as I don't sell until after cash has settled. I'm a new smooth brain to Fidelity.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m SO bullish. Volume has been crawling for days. Earnings will launch the volume and we’re going to see a gamma squeeze. Literally a volume day of just 40 mil would launch it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember, it’s Monday morning. We got all week to play this game. Holy moly today is a great sale so just buy and hold"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha it's so funny to see all the negative posts here 🤣

Like you think that you writing negative stuff about GME it will actually lead to anyone to sell? 

Also it's funny that the negative comments always come when we are slightly in the red. Like wtf we are down a few percent down for the day but a few 100 % up from a few weeks ago. I wouldn't even call this a dip. 

I am holding and you can't even pry my shares from my dead cold hands...only my wife's boyfriend can do that after I am dead"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like the hedgies strategy now is just a little manipulation so people eventually get bored and sell at 200. This has been such a boring few weeks 😅

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For everyone waiting for GME to do something, you can stop trying to anticipate it. Also, don't sit around and watch the ticker if you're going to be depressed when it goes down. GME will move when either the whales want it to move, or another catalyst lights the engine. For now, we just hold, buy when we can, and wait for the fun. Shills want you bored, discouraged, and panicking. Don't give them that pleasure. They haven't earned it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys sorry I couldnt take it anymore, just bought more 😁😁"

We got this, they are fucked, its fucking fantastic!

Not to mention this is made by Funko who had a stellar earnings. Also as someone who has worked gamestop corporate (different country) I'll tell you guys that from a bajillion years ago, Funko is a good chunk of total GME ""loot"" sales. So I'll let you guys decide what that means"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not expecting shit tomorrow. You shouldn’t either. The earnings have nothing to do with how many shares have been shorted. There is a small chance that the earnings are great and a whale comes in and makes a catalyst. I’m not betting on that happening. I’m expecting fuckery tomorrow and nothing more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets," Dear Americans, 

we warmly welcome you to the trading floor! Our baby is refueled and happily purring around the earth. It's going to be an exciting week! There is still some time to buy the dip. 

We hold together strong! And will play wife swap on the moon at the end of the week. :)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t expect a pop until Wednesday UNLESS news media starts covering GME today as positive with the preliminary numbers showing a $140 million profit or so. Tomorrow evening will be huge; CFO to be replaced, 3 board members who were in cahoots with Jim (he was actually their lawyer when they sold all their stocks at $30 lol) need to be replaced (which means one more person IF Ryan becomes CEO unless current CEO will take that third spot).  

I was telling my dad that I’m expecting a drop by $30-40 today or tomorrow as an attack before I buy more before it explodes huge.  His mind is blown with all the fuckery I told him of behind the scenes."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings is important not because they can be catalyst for squeeze(they can, but it’s unlikely). Their main purpose is to convince big fish gme worth investing in.

We’re getting all those email from people saying “have you lost your mind?” But we’ve done the research and we know it’s a sure thing. And knowledgeable people on the outside are starting to catch on and want to join us. 

This movie is a great inverse representation of what’s about to happen. Watch it if you haven’t... and dont miss lift off.

Edit: about half way in the little guys are starting to realize how rigged the game is against them. They’re trying to decide their exit strat, and then Charlie realizes they’re still fucked and too stupid to realize it and he goes “I think we should buy more.”

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"stop pinning your hopes on earnings\* - GME is not a normal stock - the squeeze is happening (long hedgies sent this thing flying up from $40 and price has now consolidated around $200).  just be patient and let it play out - the stock can fly at anytime for no apparent reason.

\*(the potential benefit of earnings on stock price has nothing to do with the numbers - its the fact that during the earnings call GME management will for the first time publicly discuss the company's transformation - yes, it could help the stock price, but it might not)"

I initiated a partial account transfer of 11 GME shares to TD from RH on Thursday of last week.

The shares are not yet restricted in my RH account. This concerns me. I was under the impression that the shares would be frozen very soon after the transfer was initiated. Should I be worried?

A Gamer is an ascended being that is the product of millions of years of fine tuned evolution, leading to a specimen that is neither human nor God. The perfect balance between Man and monster. A Gamer is the apotheosis of evolution.

I am a Gamer!

I could hold a live granade in my hand and feel nothing when it explodes thanks to all of my gaming-calluses making

my skin harder than a FUCKING TURTLE SHELL.

What is the most used muscle in a Gamers body? The mind! Over ten billion synaptic neuroscooters all firing at the same time every second, kept healthy through the complex carbohydrates of Doritos and Dew.

A Gamer's senses are three times as strong as an average human being's. We can SMELL the future. We can TASTE your panties getting wet from miles away. We can FEEL when it's your birthday. (Like a fucking spidey sense)

When we ejaculate our cum contains sixteen gigabytes of RAM. If professor Utonium were to create Gamers instead of the Powerpuff girls, he'd use sugar, spice, and The Elder Scrolls series."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me tell you what happens tomorrow. There they are, Melvin Capital and Citadel. Furiously jerking their 2 inch boomer cocks to their GME short gainz. They are so close, edging themselves with ""Oh yeah, the next Blockbuster"" and ""Yes baby, brick and mortar go bye-bye."" They even sit in a circle sucking and jerking each other off, double fisting like they're skiing down Mt. Everest with cocks instead of poles.

Out of nowhere, Ryan Cohen steps in with the most massive and vieniest schlong they've ever seen. He starts eating their lunch and muttering about Twitch and games and they can't do anything because their engorged penises are stuck in each other’s mouths and poop chutes. They attempt to ignore him and try to keep jerking but they accidentally used hand sanitizer instead of lotion. BAM GME starts rising from the ashes and the retards of WSB are lighting the fires. We brought lighters that we borrowed from our wives boyfriend's and they weren't those shitty clear ones. We have motherfucking Bics and Clippers.

Melvin is crying and pleading but we are too retarded to understand coherent English. They see giant red dildos on their screens and their buttholes begin to pucker. They dump everything they have at us in an attempt to supress the price but again, we only understand broken english and emojis. We only understand basic visuals and colors. When we see green, we buy. When we see red, we take out another student loan or CC cash advance and we buy more.  When we see 🚀, we buy. We are fucking unstoppable. GME skyrockets and they start scrambling to pull dicks out of random orifices, but it's too late. Bears R Fuk. After we are done splooging all over their faces, and ordering our wife’s boyfriend a new Tesla, we throw Melvin and Citadel on the chopping block to be liquidated and disposed of.

That's what happens tomorrow."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have submitted a complaint with the SEC. please check up and make sure they don't get to me.

I copied my complaint and edited from this [https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf) 

Let me know what you think: 

GME is a publicly traded stock. The shares of GME have been counterfeited and deliberately manipulated. This is not rocket science; known ownership of the GME shares exceeded the number of shares that were available. Counterfeiting shares of the GME caused their stock prices to collapse. The regulators turned a blind eye to the takedown, encouraged it or were not effective enough to recognize it and enforce the laws against market manipulation that have existed since the 1930s. The industry and the regulators have little room for a plausible deniability claim that they did not know what was occurring in the trading of the GME.

Illustrating the magnitude of the counterfeiting is the fact that, for the last year, institutions that must file ownership reports with the SEC claim ownership of virtually all of the stock that GME has issued for trading. This leaves little, if any, stock available to be legally owned by any other investors. There should be a very small amount of stock available to trade in the public markets. 

At a time when it was obvious that all of the shares were owned by institutions and individuals, billions of shares continued to trade. This should have red flagged the regulators that there was a high probability of illegal activity and possibly a concerted effort to attack GME and decimate their value. The professional market participants have a duty to report suspicious transactions and failed to do so. Cooperation of large prime brokers, market makers and clearing firms was required to manipulate these stocks.

&#x200B;

Key points that need addressing:

\-The number of legal shares issued by GME is not sufficient to account for the trading volume over the past 90 days.

\-All shares issued for trading by GME are reported to be owned by just institutional investors.

\-Ownership other than reporting institutions obviously exists.

\-GME has traded over 2 billion shares since 1/13/21

\-Very low reported failure to delivers of less than 1000 on certain days at the NSCC are in direct opposition to the facts that show delivery failures should be significant. Basically, all of the shares are in known ownership, therefore, legal settlement of these large trade volumes from January 2021 to date with real GME shares, was and is not, mathematically logical.

\-The ill-gotten gains from counterfeiting GME shares.

\-U.S. citizens‘ pension funds, state employee retirement accounts and other important investors in the U.S. markets have been financially harmed in GME investments; while the stock counterfeiters continue to profit.

\-These are violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the U.S. securities laws and may violate the U.S. laws against counterfeiting. Where are the regulators?

&#x200B;

It is not possible to carry out this massive fraud without the cooperation of large Wall Street firms and regulatory complicity, indifference or lack of competence. Some firms are blatantly selling shares that do not exist. It is impossible to ward off the downward price pressure from counterfeit shares diluting a company‘s value. The entire nation‘s value is diminished when the counterfeiting of securities is rampant."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They targeted gamers.

Gamers.

We're a group of people who will sit for hours, days, even weeks on end performing some of the hardest, most mentally demanding tasks. Over, and over, and over all for nothing more than a little digital token saying we did.

We'll punish our selfs doing things others would consider torture, because we think it's fun.

We'll spend most if not all of our free time min maxing the stats of a fictional character all to draw out a single extra point of damage per second.

Many of us have made careers out of doing just these things: slogging through the grind, all day, the same quests over and over, hundreds of times to the point where we know evety little detail such that some have attained such gamer nirvana that they can literally play these games blindfolded.

Do these people have any idea how many controllers have been smashed, systems over heated, disks and carts destroyed 8n frustration? All to latter be referred to as bragging rights?

These people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex.

Gamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.

This talks about known loopholes to delivery requirement. The main point is at the bottom there are ""staff observations"" which show you what might happen when someone is violating Reg SHO, and you can see for yourself that Melvin/citadel/robinhood are doing these things.

[http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html](http://counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html)

This thoroughly explains how bad regulations and loopholes are exploited to create fake ""counterfeit"" shares. This guy also claims as many as 50 fake shares per fail to deliver... there were 10million failure to delivers over 10 trading days in late january for GME.

If you think this is conspirazy type stuff, just check out this article from the SEC. They acknowledge that fake shares are created to tank stocks.

[https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-08-09/s70809-407a.pdf)

Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are publicly traded Government Sponsored Enterprises (―GSEs‖), a quasi – partnership between the private sector and the government. The shares of the GSEs trading in the public markets have been counterfeited and deliberately manipulated. **This is not rocket science; known ownership of the GSEs shares exceeded the number of shares that were available. Counterfeiting shares of the GSEs caused their stock prices to collapse.** The regulators turned a blind eye to the takedown, encouraged it or were not effective enough to recognize it and enforce the laws against market manipulation that have existed since the 1930s. The industry and the regulators have little room for a plausible deniability claim that they did not know what was occurring in the trading of the GSEs. Without the counterfeiting of the GSEs shares and the concerted effort to manipulate the stock prices, the GSEs potential to raise significant capital would have been much greater and it is unlikely that the U.S. taxpayers would be the conservators of these companies at this time

That section in bold kinda gives me shivers. Known ownership of the GSE's exceeds the shares that exist. Same thing as gamestop, and no1 bats an eye

THIS IS ALL TO SAY, idk what's going to happen to gamestop but these fuckers need to pay. this isn't honest short-selling an over-priced stock, this is market manipulation to the highest degree"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need someone with more wrinkles to help explain this to me. Two weeks ago I transferred GME shares to my US Bank brokerage account from Robinhood without issue. Last week I began the process of transferring my WeBull account (that has GME) to that same US Bank brokerage and today received a phone call that the transfer was denied. I called because everything was settled in my WeBull account, I’ve transferred stocks before so I knew the paperwork was correct, so I didn’t know what the issue was. 

The broker that I talked to didn’t know either. He put me on hold and called around only to come back and tell me that US Bank is no longer accepting stock transfers of GameStop as of Saturday. Only GameStop specifically. There were no issues with the other stocks I was trying to move, but the transfer was denied because it contained GME. Why would they prevent me from transferring more GME into an account that already owns a substantial portion of the stock? I can buy it through the US Bank investment account. They just won’t let me transfer more in?

I don’t understand why and the broker that I spoke to said he had no idea either, it had simply become their policy as of this past Saturday."

Except this time it got news coverage lmao. Clowns.

Edit: oh God it's another media-lead push for silver. It's aaaaalways about the silver. Silver is the root of all of my future plays now. I've finally read 10 articles that ""subliminally and effectively"" push me to silver and the wool has been lifted now. I just like the metal.

WSB and the pursuit of tendies has left a trail of rescued animals, a unique and great community, saving companies from bankruptcy and maybe the best fucking memes of all time. . Hedge funds could play an imperative role in the market and still have no financial worries but instead chose to evolve into a greedy disease. I know what side im proud to be on.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine paying citadel 10k for doing jack shit. 

The retards on this sub. Phew. 

Don’t worry, I bought GME at 348 the first time around. So I’m a retard as well."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg. Buy shares. If you don't buy shares you're holding nothing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME IV is so high right now. Buying *any* GME options right now is a truly retarded play. Well done fellow ape, I still wish you the best"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying calls a week out is retarded lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just look at the +$33 :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Beutiful retarded move. Stay positive
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Youre retarded
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus fucking Christ you bought short dated calls 300-400% OTM for *nine hundred and twenty seven dollars each?*

Mega retard here boys."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV wouldn't make that play.  He has 04/16 call options @ $12 strike, but they were purchased months ago.  The strike price may have been at the money or less, when he bought it.

WSB want to copy DFV, but they do the opposite.  Buying far out of the money options that expire within a month is a transfer of wealth to Wall Street.

DFV's last update:  [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0q5bm/gme\_yolo\_update\_mar\_8\_2021/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m0q5bm/gme_yolo_update_mar_8_2021/)"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy shares, not calls"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy the fucking shares. Calls and puts are just trying to time the market.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You deff fuck and I love it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hats off and dicks out for you going full retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still on RH?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"why in the world u guys are going for weeklies with an 800 strike price... it's as good as flushing money in the toilet...or at least buy 3/4 months away... or be close to the current stock price. If I had a ton of shares, I would be writing 800 calls if it's paying me anything above a couple of hundred $s... easiest money ever made.... also it will keep me motivated to keep the stock longer avoiding any thought of selling @ 4/500 share price :)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why I stopped listening to the gme posts here... Like, who do you think bought those calls to sell them to you retards?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They literally wrote songs why not to do this come on man?!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1-800-GAMESTOP

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if those guys who bought way OTM calls stocks instead and hold...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Next time #Exercise
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh WOW 😳 you need to spend your money on actual shares. Don't treat options as your local Casino 🎰🎲
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for buying my 800c
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stick to the tickers and the stonks that your used to.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wish I'd realized this sooner lol.. Originally had some 300 Calls, moved on to 800, realized I don't know when the fuck the squeeze is going to happen so now focusing my attention mostly on $GME shares"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stick to the rivers and the lakes that you’re used to
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, that song is in my head again!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,700s OK lol xD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ill compromise and raffle a $GME share. Give it time and it'll be worth 10x what I lost in calls 👌🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea right, I got my refund last week 🤷🏽‍♂️"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you avg. Down? Or you waiting for your girlfriends boyfriends support payments.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying call options a week out is the rite of passage for most retards on this sub.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I know. I've been holding onto some $MT calls for MONTHS now, but $GME all my logic goes out the window"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You don’t belong here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If I wasn't sober I would have bought a bottle of Tequilla with that $33. To celebrate when the rocket goes off obviously...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you my fellow 🦍 
Here are my obligatory rockets:

🚀🚀🚀🌚🚀🚀🚀🌞🚀🚀🚀🌌🚀🚀🚀👽"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah ATM or slightly ITM calls seem to work best
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He bought 12c when that was 200% OTM
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll have so many tendies that my wife's boyfriend will leave her for me 🙊
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I DO have GME shares. This one post is not my entire portfolio obviously. Just paying my stupid tax now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just trying to earn my place here with my fellow 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have a dick, but I appreciate the sentiment 👏🏻"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a Fidelity account with some $GME I'm it. I dont want to transfer my RH shares out until the squeeze. Knowing my luck I'll start the process and then it happens, and I'll be stuck there with my fingers up my ass"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Brodie what!???
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I def agree..  but I've been in $GME since December. I'm just 🧠🦍

Edit: okay I'm really retarded. This is a song 🤦🏼‍♀️ I'm going back to bed"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if there was a squeeze I don’t think it would get to $800 lol. That’s a really high arbitrary price I think idk who came up with that. Maybe it has a logical reason behind it but I don’t see it getting there any time soon let alone this Friday unless somehow the earnings are insane. (Not financial advice obv)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, definitely averaged down. Down to 165. Don’t tell anyone but I let my wife’s boyfriend show me how to be less retarded."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,MT calls weren’t to be purchased until April...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair point.  He still had months on the expiration date.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No no no, my dicks out for you, ma'am. Good day!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But I think your mooning to fast
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If there was a squeeze 800 is nothing. Compare it to the VW squeeze which had about 2/3rds less short % on it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want logical reason you should be on 
/investing. In all seriousness, this is going past $5000. Easily. I dont even know how to read and I can tell you that

Edit: you have a shit ton of $AMC, I honestly want to know why you think $AMC will moon and not $GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where you an OG MT person? Vito said June calls, I got those in like... December. If I need to I'll roll them into September"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're right 😓 but I do need to point out I've been doubling down on my shares every chance I get. I'm not going to drop $10k on calls anytime soon again...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t trying to poo on GME I also have shares, I was just saying I don’t know how it could get to $800 for example by Friday. I hope I’m wrong though!

Also to answer your question, I don’t expect AMC to “moon” I expect it to go above $20/share as people who severely miss going to the movies flood theaters as soon as they feel comfortable enough to. For me I’ve already seen 3 movies this month at my local AMC, when pre-pandemic I would see maybe one movie every other month, and usually at a non-AMC theater."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, all this AMC ""the shorts have to cover"" horse shit is a bunch of people who dont understand how this all works. Like there was a group that couldn't afford GME shares, that googled high short interest, AMC popped up and it was like $3/share and they were under the impression that because theres 50M shares short, its gonna also experience a short squeeze. 

AMC short percentage is less than 13% of the float. Meaning for every share sold short, theres 8 more available to cover that short.  

AMC is not GME. For it to be remotely the same, 630Million shares would have to be shorted. 

I'm with you, I'd like to hear something other than ""the shorts have to cover"" for a reason behind why all these n00bs think AMC is going to do anything other than return to a fair value."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,what e retard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets," Sir, this is still a song..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy’s"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Recall shares""

If GME says those 2 words during the earnings report, $1000 EOW is a 99% sure bet"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Best comment eveeer 🤣🤣🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well let’s hope for that outcome then! 🚀
2021-03-22 16:01:05,wallstreetbets,"GME: Volume, Price and Gamestop news catalysts Now that witching is behind us, we can look ahead to a real catalyst. I'm sure a lot of you have seen me post most of this in the daily threads, but it would be nice to get this some real visibility ahead of Tuesday:

Just a reminder that there hasn't been a Gamestop news catalyst in a while and **tomorrow** is the next confirmed date for more. Catalysts drive volume which drives price.

Last big news catalysts?

``````New Edit 3/23``````

**3/23** - Breaking news this morning, [SEC filings indicate](https://gamestop.gcs-web.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/8-k/0001193125-21-090320) that Gamestop Chief Customer officer Frank Hamlin is stepping down after a transition ending 31 March. Who could possibly replace him? How about Kelli Durkin, Chewy’s prior Vice President of Customer Service who was [brought on with Gamestop March 1 as Senior VP of Customer Care](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-appoints-chief-technology-officer). There is no confirmation that she is the replacement at this time.

No known impact on volume yet from this breaking news.

**3/8** - [Gamestop governance update](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-provides-corporate-governance-update) announcing a new board for the e-commerce transition led by Ryan Cohen. This was announced pre-market.

3 day action around that announcement:

03/09/2021 Open: $217.71  Close: $246.90  Vol: 39,099,330

03/08/2021 Open: $154.89  Close: $194.50  Vol: **63,565,620**

03/05/2021 Open: $128.17  Close: $137.74  Vol: 30,733,670



**2/23** - [Gamestop announces resignation of CFO](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-resignation-cfo-and-succession-plan-support) and succession plan. This was announced post-market.

*4* day action around that announcement (edited to include the 25th since the news dropped post-market on the 23rd):

02/25/2021 Open: $169.56 Close: $108.73 Vol: **150,308,800**

02/24/2021 Open: $44.70  Close: $91.71  Vol: **83,111,740**

02/23/2021 Open: $44.97 Close: $44.97   Vol: 7,565,215

02/22/2021 Open: $46.69 Close: $46.00   Vol: 19,476,020


**Price Action following these news catalysts:**

[Link to NASDAQ's historical data for GME](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/historical)

Here's how closing price trended around these two announcements:

2/23 - Close: $44.97 -  **CFO announcement after hours**

2/24 - Close: $91.71

2/25 - Close: $108.73

2/26 - Close: $101.74

3/01 - Close: $120.40

3/02 - Close: $118.18

3/03 - Close: $124.18

3/04 - Close: $132.35

3/05 - Close: $137.74

3/08 - Close: $194.50 - **Committee announcement pre-market**

3/09 - Close: $246.90

3/10 - Close: $265.00 - **Day's high: $348.5 - flash crash attempt**

3/11 - Close: $260.00

3/12 - Close: $264.5


As you can see, there are immediate and lasting price leaps from these catalysts. After the CFO announcement on the 23rd, the price spiked and a new floor established around $110-130 until the next catalyst hit on the 8th. The price really took off after that, gaining $40 from open the 8th, over $50 by closing on the 10th, and continuing upward trajectory until the major flash-crash on the 10th brought momentum to a halt. We've consolidated consistently around $200 since then. That's a decent floor considering the next news catalysts are likely to cause bigger volume and price reactions than we've seen, possibly bigger than January's gamma squeeze that got cut short.

**Next confirmed Gamestop announcement:** 

**3/23** [Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year 2020 Earnings](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-fourth-quarter-and-fiscal-year-2020-earnings)

Following that announcement we can expect to hear about a replacement for their CFO, the *possibility* that Ryan Cohen may be taking a new role within Gamestop, and with the end of the pre-earnings blackout period Gamestop will be free to announce any transition initiatives moving forward.

*A note on earnings:* **Gamestop's fiscal year runs through January**. So the Q4 report will include holiday sales, the console release, increased offerings of PC parts, and any additional sales driven through Jan from suddenly getting a ton of free press and consumer goodwill.

For those that want to dial in:
>2020 earnings results after the market closes on Tuesday, March 23, 2021. The phone number for the investor conference call is 877-451-6152 and the confirmation code is 13715567.

**Editing to include some new info I dug up regarding the board members who will not be standing for re-election at the next board meeting.

An interesting find for anyone wondering about outgoing Gamestop board members who may own a large number of shares:

>**Lizabeth Dunn, Raul Fernandez, James K. Symancyk and Kathy Vrabeck** [told the board they don’t plan to stand for reelection](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-will-add-activist-investors-to-the-board-the-stock-shot-up-51610384385) at the company’s annual meeting in June. The board will shrink to nine members following that meeting.

Per [this article](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-insiders-sold-stock-before-it-went-vertical-51611760507) three of the four members **sold a large % of their personal stake in Gamestop around January 13.** 

>GameStop Chair Kathy Vrabeck sold 50,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $1.4 million, a per-share average price of $27.99. Vrabeck, a senior client partner in the consumer markets division of Korn Ferry, now owns 79,537 GameStop shares. A director since June 2012, Vrabeck last sold stock in September 2015, selling 5,000 shares for $209,800, an average price of $41.96 each.

>Raul Fernandez sold 38,119 shares from Jan. 13 through 15 for a total of $1.4 million, a per-share average of $35.50. Fernandez is a vice chairman and owner of Monumental Sports & Entertainment, a private partnership that co-owns the NBA’s Washington Wizards and the NHL’s Washington Capitals. He now owns 29,289 GameStop shares. It is the first stock sale for Fernandez, who joined GameStop’s board in April 2019.

>Lizabeth Dunn sold 5,000 shares on Jan. 13 for $156,700, a per-share average price of $31.34. Dunn, founder and CEO of Pro4ma, an IT services consulting firm, now owns 57,258 GameStop shares. She joined the board in April 2019, and this is her first sale of stock."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Realistically, it doesn’t matter what they say tomorrow because this stonk isn’t about traditional fundamentals anymore. If they announce something traditionally good for the company the stock will go up. If they say anything else the stonk will have a brief dip that everyone buys anyway and the stock goes up.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone explain why a stock split would be good for GME? Is it just cause lower price means more people can buy in, or is there something else that happens?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"**GameStop set to report earnings for the first time since its stock exploded**

After its stock went on a rocket-fueled ride to the stratosphere, GameStop will pull the curtain back on its financials on Tuesday afternoon.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The Finra short interest report for the first half of March comes out on Wednesday the 24th too.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All they have to do is a stock split and its game over. Basically it would enable cash to flow into GME more easily as the higher the price the fewer participants there are. A 5:1 would be the tits since bringing the share price under 50 would be all this sub needs to throw more money at it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone locked indoors all last year plus new console releases has me thinking earnings are gonna kick ass

Digital is overrated."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"not to be negative, but that 3/10 ""flash crash attempt"" honestly worked.

While the price did recover up to mid $200's we haven't sniffed $300 since then....and it's just been a slow dragging decline since."

No good news can possibly convince investors that gme will go up from its current price due to positive news. The price is where it is because investors are waiting for a squeeze.   The only way a squeeze will happen is if investors decide for no other reason other than forcing a squeeze to buy the stock and drive up the price, forcing either a gamma squeeze thus triggering a short squeeze if price goes high enough or margin call.  Unless there are some huge players going long who decide to drive price up, and apes decide to buy not sell when price is going up, I'm feeling like a forced squeeze is now unlikely.  We are likely to see price go down, hf buying back slowly keeping price somewhat high, and this goes on for a long time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME will have ups and downs but will eventually get to it's actual value, 30-40"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's going to be one more sub $100 dip to lure in all the suckers who didnt get on the ride from the beginning, a moderate sub $200 spike, and then this stock is going to flatline like every all female remake of a previously all male film."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe post the conference time?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"a simple audit from the SEC into retail brokers, what was the buy/sell for Gamestop each day from January to March."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Question from a smooth-brained ape. What’s witching?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a baby with my arms outstretched just wanting to be picked up. What do I do?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We should buy the ape sanctuary staff some GameStop shares so they become apes also
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The 3/08 announcement had momentum because of a previous build up. Tomorrow's report will be building off a higher floor yes, but a weakening one. So the situation feels quite different.  


Also, why assume earnings were higher in 2020? Covid, lack of access to brick and mortar stores, and so on. Let's see though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"New here, but, the timing of the ramping up activity around the weekend with literal extra day of ""dark"" activity allowed is sus.  Lots of gains without retail market access."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I consider the implementation of rule 801 to be a catalyst, too, even if we don't know the date. (rule 801 concerns margin calls for sellers of naked options.)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1/1 stock split would be mega bullish
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"when prices were 47 dollars last month, the catalyst for the major jump up afterwards was due to DFV doubling down. How did you not include that tidbit?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So does anyone have any reason good earnings would cause a spike instead of a dip like it has with every other companies' earnings report lately? I guess with all the popularity and hype around gamestop it could be different because of that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dis makes.my peepee tingle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting👍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone eli5 if a split is good for us?  I want as many moon tickets as I can get, but will a split hurt our tendies ?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Steven Cohen for prison 2021
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So something to consider. With the earnings report coming out, the board and company execs can then sell their stock. I foresee a blood bath Tuesday in after hours and Wednesday. Those people stand to make insane amounts of money getting out of their stock at this price point. I hope I'm wrong but if I was a board member who's stock went up 4000% I'd be cashing that out for safe keeping elsewhere."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Banana split?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not that we have any indication a stock split may be in the cards, but would it even be possible? From the original charter I've seen Gamestop is authorized to issue a maximum of 300mil shares. At 69mil outstanding right now, they would pass that with a 5-1 split. Anyone know how that would work?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can imagine how the MSM would cover a 10/1 stock split. ""GAMESTOP CRASHES 90% OVERNIGHT!"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He's not gonna be promoted for another year or 1.5years most likely
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How would a stock split be in our interest?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My only question is... why would we expect RC to be promoted if only two weeks ago they made him a part of the e-commerce transition team? That would be the quickest damn promotion I’ve ever heard about. That would definitely be a huge catalyst, though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Consoles and Pokémon. Earnings gonna be fantastic
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wanna buy an ETB? I got you fam
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well did you get the shiny Charizard or not?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd have to go back and see if those align with any previous gamestop news (Cohen's stock purchase, addition to the board etc), but couldn't that also be a result of more options expiring end of month and needing to be covered?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He probably had a ton of stock and made bank.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was *late afternoon on 24th, the day after the CFO announcement. Volume went from 82 mil the 24th to 150mil on the 25th. I wonder how much of that was driven by the tweet, and how much was just general attention from the CFO stuff."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man I loved MTG growing up, I sold all my cards for like 100 bucks probably 10 years ago now. Gonna sell one share at 10k and buy back into MTG, hope it's still awesome."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yoooooo, I specifically go there for MTG cards!  They usually have some kind of sale before Christmas so I ✨STOCK✨ up"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They sometimes got deals. Everything is better online now. 
But I do still buy from the local Gamestop. Pokemon for my daughter. Magic for me."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All the time spiral is sold out around me :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I should sell my sealed Revised Booster Box and throw the money at GME.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good points. The earnings call is more for them to lose than anything else. If they screw up on guidance or talk about incremental stuff, it will be a reason for a dip. On the other hand, if they outline their plan for the future, including digital, and announce meaningful changes to get there, the stock has a chance to jump. It's not assured though, considering how typically ERs go."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what you’re saying is that

Stonks only go up?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always good to support a company you believe in, just be aware that anything you buy now won't impact the earnings report tomorrow. I'm personally saving my money for more shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think sales from today will show up on their balance sheet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This opinion is dumb and uninformed. People like this make the rest of the sub look bad.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Closing stores sounds negative, but transitioning to an e-commerce company that is the way forward. At the very least it will reduce their debt potential. I expect to see more guidance coming on how they will draw-down their brick and mortar presence, possibly combined with utilizing the stores they do keep as fulfillment centers in addition to retail."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They closed worse performing stores, so in theory their profits should increase. This may take a bit more time to filter through fully into earnings but it's a step in the right direction."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reduce SG&A costs, probably will see better EPS numbers"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They are expected to post profit for the first time in a while because of the new console cycle. They are also somewhat expected to miss slightly on EPS though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They closed a lot of stores, which boosts profitability. Q4 also includes the new console cycle (if you remember, there were actual shortages of PS5s, so Gamestop probably also sold all their inventory) and holiday sales."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"its also worth remembering that if the market is expecting earnings to be up, then earnings being up will have no effect on price as it will already be priced in. They need to be better than expected or worse than expected to affect price. Simply being positive isnt enough"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you like the series X?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure the dial-in is listen only.

Jesus, imagine if the webcast has a chat function? Gonna be ""twitch does an earnings report"" up in that bitch"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully at least RC is letting WSB scroll up as he is doing the report and reads out some of the best comments. A video link with comments scrolling would be legendary.  Especially as he announces a share recount and a $0.69 one time special dividend. Imagine the response he gets as thrusters are engaged.  I would also like to see the share price on AH as the announcement is made.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If we only get the earnings report, who know how it would go with so many positive earnings leading to a drop in stock price lately. I personally believe that any additional news the company drops will lead to a price increase. People didn't know how to take the CFO announcement- whether it was a good thing or a bad thing, and that still drove volume which drove price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think most people feel pretty strongly about 100% digital or 100% physical. In my case it has to do more with the type of game. I own most of the ""party games"" physical, however I don't think there is any benefit in doing so. The rationale being, the game play is essentially limitless. RPG type games without a lot of replayability on the other hand, should ALWAYS be physical IMO. Either to lend to a friend or trade in/sell. 

Another anecdotal scenario is people with low grade broadband. My brother is on Satellite internet. It's good enough for his gaming needs, but slow enough to be burdensom to download games/patches. He can drive the 15 minutes to Target (no local GameStop) purchase a game and drive home faster than downloading. 

Either way you look at it, physical games will always have a market."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do a mix of digital and physical. But I am moving more towards physical only. Less device space taken up, I can swap games with friends, and its faster for me to drive to gamestop and buy a game then download a game on my dinosaur internet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it 100% killed the momentum that was going. I was pleasantly surprised that it bounced back up to close over 260 the same day though. Momentum killer + no real news catalysts since the 8th = I'm not surprised we've seen a consolidation and slow downward trend."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not much of a decline though.  Compared to the first dip where we hit 40 this is basically the same pattern but at a higher floor. So we wait till the nest catalyst hopefully this goes up even higher.

To be fair also, no reason to go up to 300$ if. Nothings happened to cause the interest. Just holding where we have is honestly impressive given what happened in february after the first spike."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"price fleetingly made it to 290-295 on a couple occasions since then (which i'd consider ""sniffing 300"") but otherwise you're kinda right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Original release from Gamestop](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-additional-board-refreshment-accelerate). There's a lot of promising transition talk in there.
>George Sherman, GameStop's Chief Executive Officer, said, “We appreciate the constructive dialogue we have had with Ryan over the past several months. Together, we have reached an outcome that is in the best interest of all stockholders and can enable GameStop to accelerate efforts to deliver enhanced value for the Company. GameStop is in a solid market position with substantial room to run. We are leveraging our omni-channel capabilities, increasing our e-commerce sales and demonstrating our unique ability to serve our customers, wherever, whenever and however they choose to shop and experience gaming. In addition, we have delivered strong progress optimizing our business through a purposeful focus on efficiently managing our expenses, stores and inventory. We are confident that GameStop will continue to accelerate its progress and transformation in the quarters to come.”"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just hoping for a clear-cut roadmap for the coming e-commerce transition that will bring in institutional investors. Sure the retail crowd must own a sizeable % of the float, if not all of it by now, but we still need large volume from institutional buys to see real price movement."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yarr harr, you are a pyrate!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If they announce anything that forces shorts to return shares to lenders it is all systems go and thrusters engage.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, this sub is retarded now"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe that earnings are going to be a blowout, from analyst projections it does look positive though. The real hope for a surprise breakout in volume and price comes from any other information they release with or after earnings regarding the e-commerce transition, new CFO, or anything else that puts a positive spin on the future of the company moving away from their failing brick-and-mortar model."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd say shares is the play right now.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stupid, shortsighted, AND a misogynist!

Dingdingding! We have a trifecta winner here!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/q/quadruplewitching.asp

Quarterly even that just happened Friday."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings are assummed higher due to the 9th generation consoles being rolled out the last year.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Strictly anecdotal, but I got quarantined on two different occasions last year.  Being stuck at home or at least not able to go into stores sucked, but I was happy to pay a few bucks more to go get my game stuff and have the GameStop staff bring it outside for me versus waiting for it to come in the mail.  Couldn’t go into the post office anyway, to get my mail or packages.

GameStop seemed to be really busy with their curbside delivery, at least in my area.  During the early part of the pandemic, the stand-alone store was doing a lot of business that way while the mall store (and the mall itself) were closed."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What I think is more important is that there is a blackout in place since the earnings have not been released. They are deliberately silent until after the earnings report. More catalysts will definitely happen which I think will be up to RC taking over as CEO which it would mean GG hedgefunds
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because this was specifically addressing Gamestop official news catalysts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Going by this](https://www.barrons.com/articles/gamestop-insiders-sold-stock-before-it-went-vertical-51611760507), it looks like a lot of the board members that won't be staying with the board unloaded a large % of their shares earlier in the year. The amount they have left doesn't look like it will cause a major swing even if they all dumped it at once."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it's not called that in the follow-up documentary, they missed a golden opportunity."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Banana split for the fucking win!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You get the sundae, Vinny! You get the sundae!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh. You the biggest brainest ape. Make mesa hungry. More banoonoos make mesa more happy. 🦧
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure that a stock split increases the OS limit by the same ratio. So an OS limit should not be a reason for them to not do a split.

Not sure what effect a split would do to the market sentiment here though. I think it would be positive as basically it would theoretically drive the price down so the idea of Gamestop being overpriced might die down a bit. Even though nothing has changed, I guess that is one way it can be perceived."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looool!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lower buying coat for those whiteout fractional shares...?

Other than that I don't think it's a really good idea"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Historically, stock splits result in price going up, as investors are attracted by the lower share price. Logically, it doesn't make sense, but it's more psychological."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sony has sold literally record number of consols this year! Gotta buy em somewhere.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"
>but couldn't that also be a result of more options expiring end of month and needing to be covered?

If it was so, we should have a daily EOD spike and a weekly Friday spike aswell but we don't. The market doesn't work that way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If RC were to become CEO, why wouldn’t they just announce it on the ER call? Why would they wait till later?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most likely the CFO. Maybe the tweet was to say something like ""this news was just a soft serve, wait for the real sh!t!"" Who knows, I like the stock."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The tweet was like an hour or so before market close.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recently valued my collection from when I was 12 at about 6000 bucks. I had tons of dual lands and other shit I traded back then, if I had all the stuff I once had I could probably send my kid to college on it"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,more shares? ape like that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is precisely why I'm not going to lose any sleep over the report tomorrow. Unless I'm mistaken, the earnings report is covering pretty much everything up until RC came onboard mid January, right near the end of the fiscal year. All the love for RC and people encouraging supporting the stores is justified in my opinion, but I don't believe it'll be reflected in *this* earnings report.

That being said I do have full faith in their ultimate turnaround, and will still be listening intently!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im also buying shares as I get extra cash, but helping out gamestop's next earning statement will be the icing on the banana,,,,o7 fellow smooth brain."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, but it will help in the next QES. Every banana helps,,,,"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Closing stores is only bad for the employees, its very good for the investors. Especially if they have redundant stores only a few miles apart from one another. Go Google maps gamestop stores in different cities. Literally 18 stores in Denver, some like 2 miles apart from each other."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Right on. The holiday sales are assumed right? Assuming people wouldn’t rather buy at Amazon. Gamestop said their holiday sales were down more than 20%.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"were? Not sure about US, but here in Canada it still next to impossible to get PS5 - I’ve checked Walmart, eb games, London drugs, Costco...even fucking Amazon is “temporary out of stock”"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There's basically zero profit in selling consoles.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it, have it on an 8k TV which apparently doesn't do much good.   The load times are much faster than the XBox X."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the series X and i bought my brother a series S. I wasn't actually impressed until i had it in my hands. The frame rates and stability are huge gains over the last generation. The load times are all snappy and the experience is fundamentally better with the new CPU's and SSD's.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have terrible internet, makes in nearly impossible to download large games. Its quicker to drive 20 minutes to a gamestop then download a game"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and IIRC RC openly criticized the CEO with his direction (or lack of) with Brick and Mortar. I think RC is already in control and cant wait until after the call to hear more good news."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yarr harr, fiddle dee dee

If you hold your GME"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So realistically it’s ever be persistent in holding and letting the hedge funds keep bleeding a little on the interest each day or wait for them to be margin called? This seems to be the opinion I’m seeing a lot of.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I fit right in to this sub!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. Give some, take some"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There were also massive, record numbers of unemployed people last year, though. Tough to know which way it will fall."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so. Ultimately all this change in fundamentals of the company has little to do with the actual stock value at 200+ but will be good to see what this does to the momentum of the stock. Don't want to seem all doom and gloom (I am in GME) but just trying not to get a pre-boner for tomorrow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, he appeared before congress and told them he like the stock at current (at the time) price of $47 and subsequently doubled down. Internet went wild. The rise of the price from 47 could be argued to have had nothing to do with official news."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think Golden Opportunity is a good name for a documentary about the previous president of the US...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I can't really get a handle on how a split would impact retail sentiment. I guess ultimately it would lead to an increase in volume since it would remove a large barrier to entry. How many people wanted to get in on GME, but bought AMC instead because the share price was something they could buy more shares of?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A split doesn't drive the price down if the market cap stays the same. In dollar value, each share is less but also they represent a smaller share of the company. So essentially, splits should have no impact on the ""value"" of what you already own."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah at WSB we buy high
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Scizor the goat anyway man nice pulls
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they can’t do it sooner than 60 days away from the annual voting and meeting I think. That is in June.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My take is that it was him taking the new transition committee out for ice cream after their first board meeting. From what I've read, that's kinda his thing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so it was. I assumed since most of his others ones have been after market close."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,OH man I had a ton of dual lands. No kids but I couldve jammed that cash into GME and then back into MTG f me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"a couple of my buddies and myself would head down to the local comic shop after school on friday and we always had these tournaments where youd get a couple packs, open one take one card out of the pack and then pass it along, and youd build a deck out of them and then play a tournament to see who won, ton of fun every friday night. Wow I may have been a loser in HS not sure hard to tell"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Real Estate has become one of the largest operational costs for many of these brick and mortar companies, which is why so many retail companies have declared bankruptcy over the last decade (provisions in bankruptcy code, which is legislation passed by Congress, allow for these companies to reject/accept each respective contract, including long-term real estate leases that can drag on a company's finances for 5-10 years).  Removing this overhead is essential for an e-commerce-based transition and will allow company to be more nimble moving forward.  


This is why EVERY company is reexamining their real estate footprint in light of covid and the future flexi-work environment."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, there are 3 GameStops in my town of 150k people, 100% unnecessary."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yep. That's why I'm more interested in the call after. Chewy is a 40 billion marketcap ecommerce platform. Incredible to get such a valuation as a pet shop, but more astonishing is that they are able to compete against Amazon. If Cohen can transform Gamestop into a gaming ecommerce that can hold its own against Amazon, then I can see legit long term value in GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know that' true for manufacturers. Do Retailers also don't turn profit on them? And there's also games which are the real money makers. But I'll guess we'll know tomorrow how they fare.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""we need another lolocaust but only after the hedgies gib tendies"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[The letter from Cohen to the board is pretty brutal when it comes to business-speak.](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf) Basically, ""here's how you fucked up and why you would be dumb not to let me fix it."""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're not gonna get margin called if the stock doesn't drastically change in price. The earnings report and earnings call after have huge potential to be a catalyst, especially if Cohen takes about the future of the company. I think the earnings will be good, but the conference call will be much more interesting."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That might be a little too on the nose, might get him for manipulation if he did that. His other tweets have been pretty cryptic."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop IG posted this today... [https://www.instagram.com/p/CMuaqmsMfta/](https://www.instagram.com/p/CMuaqmsMfta/)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ice cream cone + apes holding bananas...

No that would be too coincidental lol


... unless"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,stop my pp hurts
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you say Citadel is gonna get spit-roasted? Couldnt hear u
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't see why not, nothing stopping the shills and the bots downvoting a million times."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Legit though, Gamestop runs official twitch streams, they are definitely missing an opportunity if they don't stream the earnings call. Someone who actually has twitter should suggest it.

Whoops, commented this under the wrong comment. Ima leave it though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retailers would buy more, which drives volume up, and makes the price higher for the shorts to cover from the aforementioned volume increase. If borrowed shares were recalled after a stock split had enough time for volume to increase price, the house of shorts would fall."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd buy more, just as with Tesla and Apple. Not sure when it hasn't been bullish."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Speaking of AMC, fidelity notified me today to vote on new things and evidently there is a resolution to offer 500,000,000 more shares at .01c ... ??? Anybody heard about this? I voted Against, but my little 5 shares ain’t gonna do much I don’t think. I don’t know how to get this idea more traction, but it’s something we all have GOT to start thinking about. If we all actually voted at these shareholder meetings, since it’s fairly simple to now and can be done online, we have got to realize we have more power now that is just going to absolute waste by not voting or giving proxy to god knows who."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume is measured in USD notional value, so a stock split wouldn’t matter to the reported volume of twice as many shares change hands every day but they each worth half of what a single share used to"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I just want someone to make the shorts deliver shares otherwise what is the purpose of having a contract? How we have any credibility in the world financial system with crap like this happening is beyond me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My Ape brain says Retail would suck up every single share faster than a hooker at a medical conference sucks....well you get the idea. hehe

It would work as follows: 

You get a share, and you get a share and you get a share and....wait,  no shares for the HFs!!  It would expand the portfolios of small investors while hopefully leaving the HFs out in the cold.  Retail would buy up all the available shares while pointing and laughing at the HFs.  If the price shot back up, which given its history and the way in which Retail has been buying the hell out of anything GME,  HFs would still have to come buy Retail Ape's shares at a very high cost of admission.

Stock Splits ordinarily lower the share price but in this case, I don't believe it would stay low longer than a few hours, max."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely agree in terms of value of what you already own. However, splits do affect market sentiment of people who haven't been following stocks, new investors, etc. i.e. splits do drive liquidity. People are more comfortable buying 4 shares of $50 stock then 1 share of $200 stock in the same sector... I know it doesn't make any sense but historically there has been a strong correlation between liquidity and splits.

One case in which splits definitely have an effect is options. Since you can only buy contracts of 100 shares at the minimum, splitting a $100 share 4:1 would drive a lot of retail traders into getting options that would have previously stayed away from them due to the high buy in cost."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stock splits helps so I can sell more cash covered puts lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,should have bought that black lotus when it was 1.5k 10 years ago...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Send me invites!!! We were just talking about that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not interested in hasbro stock either, but it's interesting to know that a lot of hasbro's profits for 2020 were due to MtG and DnD.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, I just think that's a lot fresher in a lot of people's minds and there might be this vibe that that's been the case for a long time, when really it's been a recent development. It makes me think the next report is going to huge."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Should also include Next Gen console sales and games as well. I know they're all sold out almost immediately just like every other retailer but that should have increased game sales as well.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I did buy  like 5 games the last day of the quarter
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh you sexy Ape you,, I saw what you did there."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit.... I completely forgot about Electronic Boutique.  Buying code books, magazines for single cheat codes, and Mortal Kombat game guides... that was the life."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup. Had 8 here in rural LA, two of the stores basically in the god damn wilderness have closed, no reason for those to have been open."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We had two Gamestops in one of our malls for a bit when they were buying up all the other game stores.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And doesn't Gamestop lease all of their locations? Should be an easy transition as leases expire move product to a few flagship stores.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If gamestop was at 40B market cap rn share price would be nearly $600. This is an attractive position to hold for the long haul.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is chewy so special anyways? They don't even have a canadian store
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Chewy are also yet to turn a profit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it is a straight up indictment of executive management and makes the board complicit. Can't wait!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Roaring kitty posted today though!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm calling my local gamestop RIGHT NOW
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock split would be great. Average folk don't even look at market cap they just look at the stock price. ""$40 to buy GME when it was $200 yesterday!? I'll buy 5 shares that's cheap."""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[You should probably check the megathread for that, in case you missed it](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m97v39/amc_voting_megathread_for_saturday_march_20th_2021/)"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe IV goes up after a stock split.. honestly might buy some NTM calls tomorrow. If they announce a split, the price of the stock and the IV will go up therefore a win-win."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But those puts will be worth less because the price per share is lower. I think it evens out lol.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm like so scared to get involved with something like that because of how much of my time I know I'd spend, but I love it. I remember they came out with an electronic version back then but it was like 2002 it wasn't super advanced, being able to play online would be amazing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Still remember every square inch of the EB I got my PS1 from at launch in '95.  Think I bought every game I played, through at least the last days of the PS2, from that same location lol.  Good times."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i had a gamestop and an eb games in the mall by me as a kid right up until gamestop took them over.. ahh those were the days.. i used to go back and forth between the stores to try to get a better price for games
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In that they are competitive against Amazon. If they can do the same with Gamestop, they can possibly turn Gamestop from a failing brick and morter to a sustainable ecommerce platform"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what's your point? You mean it's failling?  I think that if they can turn Gamestop around to be a viable competitor against Amazon (like Chewy, weather it turns a profit or not), we'll see better fundamentals and thus growth in share price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Roaring Kitty is not affiliated with GameStop though, so he doesn’t have any insider information like Cohen does, being on the board of directors."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did he post? I checked reddit and youtube
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The number of posts about the apple split like: 

""So I can buy $400 puts and then it splits and then I get profit?"" 

Was absolutely bonkers"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have never seen the AMC mega thread lol thank you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they are far OTM options then yeah, sure. ITM options or super close to ITM options aren't though, as they need the MM to hedge by actually owning the shares. 

Regardless, my comment was for the impact of splits on trading in general. Doesn't have to do anything with GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying calls helps us actually because the brokers then have to find and purchase those shares
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I’m saying is that how many people can afford to do a cash covered put with a strike at, let’s say $150? You’d need to keep $15k cash on hand as collateral

If it’s a 1-10 split then strike would be $15 and you’d only need $1.5k for collateral. I could pick 10 different expiry dates after a 1-10 split compared to just one prior with the same $15k cash"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amen, and we wouldn't want to assume otherwise. But he does have quality DD, which we have all taken into account. I'll take that ice cream cone anytime though, even if $1 via the McDonalds drive-thru."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude just likes the stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He is a time traveler
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Twitter
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How does that work, actually, if the stock splits with outstanding options? Do the options automatically get re-written averaging them down the same percentage? And would that be based on the current share price? That does sound confusing"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In reality the best thing for us is people holding their actual shares to keep them off the market, driving down supply

That way any increase in volume is greater when compared to the liquid flow"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The game is rigged, they have the information and they will use it for maximize gains for them and so you loose. Simple as that. It’s a mafia, this is a pyramid scam with extra steps in a massive proportion and blind eyes by the goverment. 

It’s so clear now.

HF and MM and brokers and banks are all in bed together sharing the same pie which is feast on the retail investors money...."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if executed and also super risky, especially for the average ape that doesn’t Understand how it works. There is plenty of DD explaining why options and calls hurt apes and it’s been clear from the start that our play in buy and hold. Please don’t spread misinformation my friend."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like the RKT special dividend where strike prices adjusted down about a dollar and change, contracts will split to keep the same overall value before and after"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if they did a 4-1 split, every one options contract would become 4 contracts?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. And the strike price would be divided by 4

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s fine I have 5/21s and u/fannypackphantom said she’d pay me the money back if they don’t print.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It has sucked since it was 130
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t talk.  Just post dog pics.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"u missed sooo much!!! ^((jk but cashflow\_ apparently did lose his virginity))

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"❤️, Nohomo"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bb
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm no TA god, but doesn't it look like it is forming a handle on the classic cup and handle and armadillo pattern?  We just need to wait for the armadillo to bite the handle and then we have a buy point near 270 and to the moon or at least low earth orbit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You couldn’t pay me to sit though that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There's already one out? Is it insufferable?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! I’m so fucking close. I really thought we’d open higher 😒
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not completely. It’s not chad green at the moment.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it’s on the shame level as SHIT(TC)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nonsense. Silver is heavily manipulated. You can still make money off it I think but there are better ways
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,According to cathie no
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn't yesterday :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just tell them “it’s in my other account.”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,One would think that with the 140k you have as liquid assets that wouldn't be a problem right? ...right?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🙏🏻.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🥺😍🥰
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In before /u/competitivebunny comes in wih ooohh and awwws and 🥺🥺🥺🥺

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dear god the adorableness!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I do *not* like seeing comments like this when scrolling by new. Could we maybe not Guh for a while? Pretty please?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. are you driving through florida? Sounds like florida
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not KTOS
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You just love that emoji.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, my long options are all looking down-er than you would think."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy/wrote this morning, I'm loving it!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Balls of steel over here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My FD right now is surviving the 'rona. Sadly my puts aren't printing :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s ok for me so far. Still trying to recover from last week but really trying to find the right plays to make before I get paid Wednesday.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I drink fizzy spiked water🥴
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lobotomized myself with a magnum of fizzy moscato. Ever since I started doing intermittent fasting to lose weight, HOLY SHIT am I a lightweight."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got some poots. Printed and got out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened to you?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomers need to shut up about their bonds
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So... puts on everything?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good Morning! PM looks green...should be a good day!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bb.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So that’s why my CC went up so much 🤑
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"22 dollar to go to its peak🤡.

Im still waiting"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100%
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not green 😡
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hay
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You okay man? You sound like you are in great pain and need help?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So low effort... ban hammer my boi 😛
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then kangaroo the rest of the year?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If anyone’s a bot, it’s you.

Fuck off, ape. I made money on it, but I hope it tanks back to around 30 on earnings and you lose everything."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop saying GME we use code words in this thread so the bots can’t track us use SPY instead
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's more the meme value. I do see them around, but it's still a rare thing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, been really busy with work, and managed to catch COVID this weekend."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My block of Ford is doing really well TYVM!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Suffering buddies! YAY!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You should come over so I can give you the 'rona.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Soxl 😬
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That great tech recession of MAR18-19 really was a crazy time
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"<select><start> 
I wanna play too."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf am I going to do for 14 days...  lose money faster?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey we actually did do it later after I had a power nap ty very much.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks.  Hoping for CRSR to dip another dollar and I’ll double up on my sept 40c.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nov calls for KTOS look like a steal at the moment. If we knew for aure KTOS will be in ARKX it would be a no brainer.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love that you are now shit posting in r/psth lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to start thinking when a good price point will be. You think it'll hit 20? 25 feels a little high based on absolutely no fundamental analysis.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,#🥵
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That too GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so fucking tense. I don’t get this shit at all
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,👍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah most of the snow melted so just enjoyed some nice 60 degree weather
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,BA that is. Fuck APHA.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea if you’re serious. That’s how silly TA is.

I just buy dips. But they keep fucking dipping for no reason."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not toooo bad, as it focuses on the time leading up to the RH freeze.  So it doesn’t show the cringe afterward."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rootin for ya mom lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhh just keep spamming it shall be true.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The only success worth counting is the one that can be repeated.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You've just never met my other account bc she doesn't go here
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> GET THEE, TO A NUNNERY"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow called out. I’m sorry I love dogs and the bunker is filled with them. 😔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is florida so trashy with... Everything
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, close tho. Gonna to Georgia 🍑"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Come over to SPY to ride the wave 😎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely 🌝
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same 😭😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately I'm stuck in other direction. Like a proper 🤡
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing really...  ended the day flat pretty much.

SPY FDs are down 33% still and CRSR calls now down 25%.  CRSR is a way longer play tho. 

FSLY spreads down 17% after being up 10% intraday."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah. If I do that, BA will immediately shoot up to a new 52-week high."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on puts!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🤡🤡🤡😬
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A thousand flaired users once roamed this town... now it’s just a wasteland
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,On fucking everything
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a steal rn tho that gap down was a total fraud actually tho
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m getting ravaged ✌️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got any of them short squeezes? I could use a hit right now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a gurl, but thx 😛"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"forget kangaroo... market is pegged abdolutely pegged, order flow more important... greed ^ max...   this is gonna get stupid ugly"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here got a good profit. Now earnings tomorrow we'll see if it tanks. But look at the sentiment it's already going down
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I’ve missed the memo. But on the other hand I don’t see how it will prevent them from collecting data... if I read your message so have they."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Take care brother !
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jethus, take care man"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F is indeed for respects. My leaps are multiplying!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thinking about jumping in this/ TDOC or FTCH

I’m too broke to do all three. They are all on the move today but I don’t get paid til Wednesday."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I finally went in today. CB is something like 36. I don't know what it is, exactly, because Webull doesn't like to show you irrelevant information like your fucking cost basis, and that's where what's left of my cash was."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We will rebuild! Tech will be overvalued again
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does she really got it? I'm sorry dude if she does. I've been watching all the movies. Working on The Hobbit now cause it's super fucking long.

Got a Ultimate Collector's Series Awing coming in today. That should help pass some time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard eating ass was covid compliant
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F for respects. Sounds like ypu need to be tested for covid tooo. There aint no winning brother!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We know for 99.8% considering it’s in her Japan thing and they have a space division- what I don’t know is when ARKX will be approved, and will KTOS go lower before then. That’s my concern"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro it’s so fun
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That place has gotten so apey with all the hopium and cringe memes the last few weeks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck man I don’t know but I need to figure this out fast.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last time it dropped to support Cathy bought a shit ton and brought the price up. This is the best I got on charts. I have no idea how to figure this stuff out 

https://www.tradingview.com/chart/KTOS/p6boh1pO-KTOS-Week-of-3-8/"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve got a good thesis and plenty of time...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, NOW you give the disclaimer! At least I'm hedged with SOXL."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice 👍🏼
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"semi-serious. It COULD happen. Then TA will be true forever and ever. If it is, it is only mob psychology."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think it’s saving for the ones I had for today but definitely helping the others at least 🤷‍♀️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We might have to wait till next week for that, lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha just realized the typo.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In nature and in wild, one should not apply any analysis, go about life one day a time, taking into stride all that beautiful Mother Nature presents out there because if you do get too technical and yonder into the nitty-grities of things, you tend to miss the forest for the trees out there and evoke reaponse like we see up here where a mere pattern analysis has caused insufferable pain upon the being that so longingly and lovingly share their abject appreciation for all things canine."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The only time I’ve been hit driving was in Columbus 😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ATL traffic on I-85? That's the reason my commute is an hour and a half 😣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY is a very difficult mistress
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I warned y'all it was just overpriced smh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Noooo it’s just a small party!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,such is life i suppose
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,:'( sorry bb.  I refuse to buy options on IV >70% now and will just sell puts or calls instead.  Let the IV crush work for you!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look into SOS
Buy as far out in date as you can afford"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have full rune armor If you want to be my GF. Will trade
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why we talk in code here.

""Daddy Melvin, please bless us with a nice green day today so we can have more melbucks.""

Go ahead and say it. Its code, I promise."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sadly it looks like it's not terminal. :P
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, vaping hasn't made it terminal yet. Maybe I should order some cigars and straight lung-hit em to make the 'rona stronger?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,P/Es above 500 or don't come to the market 😤
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes pls...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah she JUST called and said she tested positive.  No symptoms...  it was preventative since he co worker had it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well leaps should be dip agnostic one can suppose. It’s already in the trenches how low van it go.

As per market insider it’s supposed to start trading on 03/29/2021"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not _totally_ their fault, spacman is kinda cucking everyone right now even though I still trust him.  That sub has been sniffing their own farts for nearly half a year"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck it. $25.6

Ride or die."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh God damn it, am I really gonna have to pretend like I know technicals?

The white lines are a channel, so it's been going down and staying relatively stable between the bounds of the outer lines. If nothing else changes it would be reasonable for that trend to continue (until it doesn't). The green, yellow, and red boxes don't matter. Maybe the yellow, since it's saying there's pressure to keep the price going below this point, but I have no idea how they calculate that. I think the other boxes are based off Fibonacci voodoo, which is just dumb. I think the bottom chart is probably some sort of momentum indicator like RSI. It's going up, which is good. That suggests there's a bottom in,  and the fact that the price bounced off the yellow box a few days ago combined with the rising momentum indicator is a really good sign -it means that the bear-trend may be over. Stay tuned to see if the bear-trend is actually over or if this is a false signal. Once the action has happened we'll know which it  was!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm yeah I don’t like these lines 🤔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I gave you a chart! I should have just said “stay the fuck away” but it was going back up and if it ran up 3% I’d be a dick for telling you it sucks. Idk 😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless it doesn't happen, then the signal wasn't confirmed and you shouldn't have used it to trade. Convenient."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry that was prob me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah I’m going outside of savannah. 1-95
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I remember you saying that. But.. anyways .... I'm just a stupid woman.. should've stayed in the kitchen..
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,💥🥳🥳🥳💥 I can go for that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why SOS? They look like Chinese PLTR.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,👀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Its about time you longed $CIGS
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Remind me why we're trying to get you killed again?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if she has it, it would be mildly shocking if you don't get it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Call your doctor and get him to say she has a parasite and needs ivermectin.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think any lower - it’s at December prices. Maybe it hits $22, but that’s doubtful. Volume is really really low right now and there is no news that would provoke it. It’s annoying me lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">how low can it go

What have you done?!

KTOS to bankruptcy imminent!

/u/FannyPackPhantom Every time the stock goes down now, it's all because he jinxed it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my ARK LEAPS. I had to bail at only -60%.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I cashed out for now while I could still take profit. I’m sure it’ll be a money maker but the apes, no Q1 announcement, most possibilities off the table now, etc I just didn’t want to hold anymore. If it continues to drop to NAV I’ll probably get back in lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😬 either everyone is going to die with me or make more money than me off of this play 😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Whohoo! I feel smarter already!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should get them redrawn since it’s from 3/5, forgot to put the request in. I hate this though"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically, you can't win 😋"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Works out with the conclusion you want, either way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They fucking flipped!! 😂 it’s not funny but seeing it in real time I was impressed
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's 2021 girl you can bring your phone in the kitchen with you and still trade lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry no 🌈🐻s allowed 😳.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Trade still open
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you want me to keep suffering with you all. Set me freeeeeeeeee!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that would be impressive...  too bad we’ve only been married two years so we still touch each other.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is that 😂.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at it this way. If it becomes a penny stock Fanny with all her investment will be a millionaire by EOY when ARKX blows up like shrek!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just need it Melvin to buy puts and get the apes to buy it 😔

AM I CURSED?????? 😭"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ARK was too volatile compared to KTOS. For instance it had the capacity to go down 50$ and get back up. KTOS won’t fall that bad.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way

Edit: u/FannyPackPhantom guides others to a treasure she may never possess"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My gains from SOXL are perfectly balancing out my losses from KTOS :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like 25 is the bottoms but FUCK
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There's no winning in KTOS apparently. (ס_ס;;)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He's got the flair that I should have tbh lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How much you asking? I could use a new boyfriend. The wife has one and I want to make her jealous.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well in that case, definitely get a cigar, and don't forget to inhale!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kills the virus dead in vitro, good results in human trials, and you can use it to clear your horse of tapeworms."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fingers crossed, lol. I went from ARK to KTOS. I clearly hate having money, lol."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s nauseating.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lies, I've seen you go full 🌈🐻... I think..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Free you just gotta be big spoon
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,May $30’s should be okay but Maybe 35 not 40 🙃
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This time last year I lost about 4.5k in a day on SPXS and SQQQ 🥴 at the time that was a good portion of my acct just blown up.

That was the last time I really fucked around until this recent drop..I did a shuffle and picked up just a bit of SQQQ shares and moved money out of losers, but sold that after a week. Last time it was a loss due options lol."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold!

On an unrelated note, anyone want to buy a call on Roblox armor? The ask is 0.1"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My 5/21 35c are definitely in danger and i already lost a bunch of 30c last week ☹️

I’ve got some 7/16 27.5c and those are ok. It needs news. ARKX when!?! 😩"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope end of week 😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What position do you have?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,May  $30 I just want the momentum
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It just needs to do more of what it just did in the last hour 😩
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Trueeee 🙃🙃🙃 it hurt

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sloppy Seconds Strat: this strat still holds true. When WSB piles in and absolutely abuses a stock the price depreciation is often greater than it needs to be. Picking up stocks once bag holders have been created is fairly consistent for some gains. My current favorite for this is RKT. PRPL is a great example of this strat. Don’t join the hype wait for it to die if you think it’s a good value.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"ARKX launches in 1 week so there could be a run up on space stocks in anticipation, GSAT is very undervalued right now given all the good news they’ve had lately with their Qualcomm and Nokia deals and they have potential to be included in ARKX, there’s also really high open interest on out of the money call options like the 7/16 $4 call which implies that a lot of people think GSAT has the potential to go that high in the next few months. I personally have a lot of calls and bullish spreads on GSAT and think that we could go as high as $2.40 this week or next assuming GSAT isn’t included in ARKX. If it is included, I think that the stock will get even more attention and go much higher. If you want some safe plays, look at the July strike calls around $2-4 but if you want more of a YOLO that could 4-5x in the next week or two, look at the 4/16 $3 calls for $.05 each. Good luck everyone and please feel free to let me know if you have something to add, disagree with anything I said, or would like to share your current position on GSAT.

Are you new to investing?

Are you losing money on a stonk that you were told only goes up?

DONT WORRY! Because I have the solution for you.

It’s called INVESTOR DENIAL

If you went heavily into a stock in one purchase and didn’t slowly build your position while monitoring the direction of the stonk...well you’re retarded but here is my tip for you.

Simply say with unfounded confidence that bags XYZ is a long term hold and BOOM you instantly look less retarded for doing what you did.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Questioned a GME cult member about a price target and how he would take profit when selling is forbidden by their religion, but thought I'd ask since he mentioned a 'payday' that they were all there for (probably the Kool Aid drinking final party where the 'real' squeeze happens).

They literally had no answer. One of them gave a range from 1000 to 10000 percent. None of them would give positions, even after I called out that many of the most zealous cult members had almost no stake in the game. I've never seen anything like this before. It's on the level of fanaticism. It's funny but also just freaking insane."

So I have been seeing Volkswagen in the media a lot lately. Today I came across this article:

"" If the market were to apply multiples similar to Tesla and Nio Inc. to VW’s battery-electric vehicle business, it would be worth about 195 billion euros ($230 billion), more than all of the company is worth now, analysts led by Tim Rokossa wrote in a report Monday. ""

Read the Full article bellow:

[https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/22/vw-might-surpass-tsla-soon/](https://mosttraded.com/2021/03/22/vw-might-surpass-tsla-soon/)

Long story short, Analyst in the article is saying very soon Volkswagen will already be selling more Electric Cars than Tesla.

 VOW3 has already gone up 40% in the last month, but I think it still has a lot to go  🚀

Not sure what exactly Powell can say at this point. He’s made it clear the Fed is going to tolerate inflation as long as it’s “transitory.” Since nobody, including probably the Fed, has any idea what “transitory” means for this purpose, that basically just says the Fed is willing to tolerate inflation. 

You would expect gold and precious metals to be advancing on this, but for whatever reason they have yet to rally. That may be a trade for you. (Friendly reminder that nothing I say or even think is intended as investment advice).

We do have home sales data out at 10 am. Economists are expecting a decline of 3% in February. That’s month-over-month so not seasonally adjusted. Still, if there’s a major surprise to the upside it could (emphasis on could) make some people a little more concerned about an overheating economy."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"ARKX launches in 1 week so there could be a run up on space stocks in anticipation, GSAT is very undervalued right now given all the good news they’ve had lately with their Qualcomm and Nokia deals and they have potential to be included in ARKX, there’s also really high open interest on out of the money call options like the 7/16 $4 call which implies that a lot of people think GSAT has the potential to go that high in the next few months. I personally have a lot of calls and bullish spreads on GSAT and think that we could go as high as $2.40 this week or next assuming GSAT isn’t included in ARKX. If it is included, I think that the stock will get even more attention and go much higher. If you want some safe plays, look at the July strike calls around $2-4 but if you want more of a YOLO that could 4-5x in the next week or two, look at the 4/16 $3 calls for $.05 each. Good luck everyone and please feel free to let me know if you have something to add, disagree with anything I said, or would like to share your current position on GSAT."

If you're still holding GME - you do you, but if the hedgies couldn't make money off of it at this point, you wouldn't be allowed to trade it. This is no longer about ""sticking it to the hedgies"" - at this point, you're bagholding for people who got out like bandits much earlier. I mean, just look at the volume - I see no way this ends well. 

Now of course, watch me say that and then watch GME go up to $420k now that I've sold all my shares. If that happens, you're all allowed to message me saying ""nananana booboo"" and use your GME stonks to buy me a dunce cap."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not even about the money being made or loss for quitting options trading as of today, its because its become a full-blown addiction. I've blown up several accounts in the past year, I touched as high as $65K from a $1200 initial investment during the first GME run up cashing out/selling at around $16K only to lose 96% of it all within a month chasing the losses from doubling down over and over. My problem is that I'm just too impatient which is why my accounts were always over 95% in leveraged options which wasnt healthy. 

Taking extra dosages of Hopium and Copium everyday thinking ""okay, I bought the TSLA dip this is my chance to make a comeback"" only for it to literally die re before my eyes in pre-market not even giving me a chance to get out take any profit I had and lose a significant amount of that investment. (as an example). 

The point I am trying to make here is that, the knowledge to know how to trade stocks/options is there permanently for me so walking away for a few months, shit even a year or two isn't so bad to refocus on the other things in life that did make me happy. Waking up at 4am to check pre-market after spending an hour looking at futures like any of it mattered ruined my sleep and having no one outside of this sub to really to about it was also a depressing thing. 

Anyways, for this who still want to be in this casino, I wish you the best of luck. Mines simply ran out and I don't want to be giving BJ's behind an Arby's just to scrap up enough funds to buy a damn weekly FD only to have that go to zero in a matter of minutes of market opening/closing. I'll still lurk here and there as I ween myself off this sub altogether for a while but I hope someday I can come back being in a better position in life to be able to afford to lose this kind of money and not be affected mentally from it. For now, its just not a good time. I'm 27 for reference, so I have time always make some type of comeback and who knows maybe even have a lambo someday. That's all for now since I need to get back to work but Godspeed Autists, Good luck GME ape gang and anyone else who managed to read this post. 

Sincerely, your boy

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently they have earnings for the first time in a long time. I could see a lil jump happening maybe
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn’t you? Whatever happens tomorrow these guys are gonna spin it and keep the hype train barreling down the tracks

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What they said below,  not unexpected, just cheaper to buy more, don't be surprised by today, was expecting this because of our votes!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,CEO compensation doubled and a share dilution vote that will likely pass
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys voted on yet another share dilution
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC decided to cash in.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you see the vote notice?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine buying a stock that was diluted several times in one year, over 75%, and then thinking they wouldn't do it again when it was trading at over 7x the pre-covid price adjusted for the existing dilution."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol i bet the vast majority of money made of gme is unrealized so far
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,People are happy for those that made money. They are just tired of the spam and low quality of people/posts in this sub now. It’s been overran by Normies
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t want an entire generation to be wiped out but that may do it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme in 1 month
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not in GME but I doubt earnings is going to do anything.

No one who is legitimately in on GME atm cares about earnings or any fundamentals. Not even the hedgefunds."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's a conspiracy, my man"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm bullish, but bears already bought a lambo last month."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,She will practice Satanism instead. Need to sacrifice some humans to get Tesla to 4k per share by 2025.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ur good. Get that 150
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,“I have no idea why our stock is going up” remains the stupidest thing anyone has ever said

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I only have one kidney
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"
INTC is the only US chip fab, it would be really dumb if the government didn't try to support them and get them up to snuff. The new ceo Pat Gelsinger is also a prodigy chip engineer. An engineer of engineers. With a pe ratio of  13.5, this ship is going to turn around big time in two years"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,fidelity is telling you to stop being a bitch and yolo weeklies
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mutual funds aren't priced until market close. It'll go through AM
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, I'm going to have to ask you to leave the Wendy's parking lot."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mutual funds are closed, so it won’t go through til trading stops"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The apes will not be happy about this
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It'll probably tank the stock (I think they will end up offering as well) since the entire premise of the current high price is a squeeze and an offering pretty much kills that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with holding cash and waiting for the right move.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same but lost it the past couple months
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost so much money buying em last week. Fuck that stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep buying them lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Already loaded up. That's probably why it keeps going up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR? Lol 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,NFT hype
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao have you been blind these past weeks? Green monday, down 25% by Friday. Puts would probably pay more."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Im from the future to tell you GME earnings are not what you think they are.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea dude lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,people just dont give a fuck anymore
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No one is probably trading the option you hold. Look at the Bid-Ask prices instead of the mark
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's gilding comments in the daily thread at 6 in the morning? lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,the worst thing is the gain flair on like two shares lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The GME thread is everyone who bought partial shares at $300 and think they are gonna be saved by some stupid squeeze in a never ending war.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Die a hero or live long enough to become the boomer
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I get paid to hold the stock!"" 
Stock drops 80%"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, the trend is to buy at the highest and when it goes down you panic and sell."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m holding personally. I still see lots of upside potential
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pull it together. 
Reserve this shit for after hours yo"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's really not worth killing yourself hon. (I'll take a chance you might be trolling me)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It'll pass. Doesn't seem like it now, but it will. Stay strong. Life is worth living for so many other reasons than women. Once the emotion wears off, most of them are pretty tedious honestly. You probably lucked out and don't realize it yet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there, it gets better."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You'll be okay man. Love if a factor of attraction and time. Give someone else enough time and you'll love them more than you did your ex
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not worth it. No relationship is.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not worth it.  PM me if you need to talk
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shhh you’ll overstimulate some brains out here with that amount of knowledge.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what they said last week. Then the 10 year yield spiked and we were all red again. It could just as easily happen again.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it has nothing to do with the potential dilution
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I went mad up in my account.  25k to 93k but now back to 36k 😢. That was life changing money. Anyway at least I'm not in debt, in good health and good friends & family..... Still hurts badly though"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you come back, just do much smaller positions until you conquer the emotions that ruin your trading."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I once dated a woman twice my age and she had too much libido, I didn't even have time to check my stonks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,but...why?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Bonds are risk free so if the risk-free Return is closer to the Market Return, which is always riskier and more volatile, more people will switch from Stocks to Bonds"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bond market is larger. The return of ""safest"" asset class there is determines how much fund managers are willing to risk in others."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bonds market is massive. When a faint fart of bad news happens in the stock market, money rushes back to bonds. Money pulling out of equities cause a bit of a sell off."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I might just be a monkey but I think boomers think it's a good future indicator
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also note that, at least in the past week or so, bond yields have disproportionately affected tech more than other sectors."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bonds go up, interest rates go up, companies that still don’t make money go down"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty damn autistic considering my calls are probably fucked
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,good. I got an order for more shares if it dips enough
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not good
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So good. I get off on pain and humiliation.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy side bitches happy life is the real motto
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,why do you think it would recover? do you do DD? once the dilution occurs the stock will tank like %50+
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't give you financial advice but I'm seeing a decline from here esp. given dilution inbound from issuance of half a billion new shares. AMC will still be around in a few years though imo.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relax lol, it’s one day"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone waiting for earnjngs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. $23 seems stable. I think we’ll see some momentum over the next couple weeks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because those are the most active threads. By shear numbers alone the entire sub could be renamed GME.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok we will help you find it!✅
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Those powers to be are us. Stock holders. Nobody wants stock from a company that sells out it's shareholders.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, you should do some research on SNDL"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla is all over the place. Never buy at the top 🤷‍♂️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,think stonks go up after that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Rock the vote!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"free money

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It will be soon
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What if a girl cuddled with you and let you show her your favorite anime and touch her boobs tho
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t. Stocks just money. Drink some water.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hire a hitman on yourself and let him chase you around the country.   Least your death will be entertaining and you won't have to build up the courage as we all know you are a wuss.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lol damn bro u must have bought the peak XD

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit I sold off last week😕
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Uhhhhhhhhhh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing to prop it up but the bagholders. Maybe this time next year they will recover.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I will find you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Get back in at 2pm or power hour and lose all the gains like the rest of us
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s over man.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Peak retard. But it’s not so different to TA.

2021-03-22 12:42:27,wallstreetbets,"The arbitrage Michael Burry trade on Volkswagen Michael Burry said **“I don’t own a Porsche, but I own the Porsche that owns VW that owns Porsche”**. Your autistic brain is most likely confused right now, what did this retard say? Let me explain.

**Burry is essentially indirectly buying Volkswagen shares at a significant discount. He's doing this by investing into Porsche SE (POAHY) instead of Volkswagen (VWAGY).**

* Porsche SE is the largest stakeholder of Volkswagen, they own 31.4% of the entire company.
* Porsche SE also holds the largest Volkswagen voting rights (ordinary shares) at 53.3% 
* Porsche SE is not the Porsche car brand (known as Porsche AG)
* An investment into Porsche SE (POAHY), is an investment into Volkswagen at a discounted share price. The Volkswagen shares that Porsche SE owns is significantly worth more than Porsche SE’s current market-cap.
* Volkswagen current market-cap is 153 billion, 31% of that is 48 billion. There should also be an extra premium on top of that $48 billion as they hold 53.3% of Volkswagen majority voting rights. Porsche SE current market-cap is only 31.5 billion. 
* Porsche SE also has other investments in Lidar and software companies such as Aurora Labs/AEVA.
* This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn’t fixed.
* Simply put, Porsche SE has the largest ownership and majority voting rights of Volkswagen.

&#x200B;

Volkswagen recently had their own type of ""battery day"" and showed they're dedicated into investing in a EV future (More than $40 billion). They sold more than 9 million vehicles worldwide last year compared to Tesla's under 500K. Tesla lost double digit EV marketshare in Europe in 2020 and the VW ID3 is closing in on Tesla Model 3 sales. Volkswagen has the large customer base, brand power, assets, factories, and EV tech to dominate Europe in the EV industry soon. 

TLDR: Porsche SE (POAHY) seems to be the best way to invest into Volkswagen's EV future at a major discounted price.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what I'm reading is that as the EV market begins its world domination tour, the VW stock will grow and POAHY will ride the jet stream up.

Thanks to u/doodpaart for letting me know. Maybe its best to include this information on your post OP for european redditors"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm using the EUR numbers here and referring to PAH3, which has the same underlying. Based on EUR 93 share price, Porsche SE has 28.48b market cap. They own 53.30% of the ORDINARY shares of Volkswagen.

VW has 295m ordinary shares. Based on a EUR 310 share price that worth 91.48b.

53.30% of 91.48b is 48.75b, which is 71% higher than the current market cap of Porsche SE.

Based on this my math shows that Porsche SE should be trading at EUR 159 instead of EUR 93 ONLY based on the value of their VW shares (they own a lot other stuff as well).

That aside, i hold PAH3 since december and i am happy with it, i think Volkswagen is still pretty undervalued (compared to Toyota/Volvo/Stellantis, not compared to Tesla)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If this DD is a week ago I’m throwing it all at porsche/VW
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,so buying PAH3 is identical fundamentally to POAHY (as a Europour)?

Honestly, I don't understand what the difference is."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this still at a discount? There has to be some argument for the discount because by the time we (retail) sees an arbitrage everyone has seen it.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s already up 230% this year, no volume, and you know Burry has a big enough positions that he’s been desperately shilling this on his Twitter for a while hoping to dump his bags onto you."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">This is a sort of arbitrage opportunity that the market still hasn’t fixed.

Is it, though?  It's not like you can cash out your Porche SE stake and receive payment in an equivalent number of VW.

Holding Porsche SE means you not only ""own"" a slice of their stake in VW, you also ""own"" a slice of whatever net-negative value assets (including debt) that is dragging their share price down relative to VW.

This isn't an arbitrage of relative mispricing between Porsche and VW; it's a bet that Porsche's liabilities and associated risk are being overvalued by the market.

Which is, like, the play for every stock that hasn't recovered."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This may be a good idea.  I suggest looking at the previous *infinity squeeze* that happened between Porsche and Volkswagen once already though before trying any long-Porsche-short-VW arb.  When a trade becomes too obvious, the shorts sometimes get squeezed... this board knows this better than most.

Buying Porsche because you think their VW holding is undervalued seems reasonable and safe though.  Now you're betting against Tesla though and it's no longer an arb... good luck!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree generally, however you have done very little dd on evs unfortunately. Teslas market share is not collapsing and the id4 are not ""closing in"" on anything. All their sales are fake af. They deliver to dealers and call that a sale, just so they can avoid fines from EU. Absolutely pathetic. 

Big shlong elon is still the alpha in this abusive relationship and VW can only ever hope for one less black eye per week from Elon, if they constantly suck his cock of course and convince him to get less drunk after work.

Other than that good idea, I will read more about this!"

High-level takeaways included VW’s plans to produce 240 GWh of batteries, reduce battery costs by roughly 50%, and add 18,000 fast-charging points.

What the press release did not convey, the live presentation captured. During the antithesis of an early Steve Jobs presentation, dozens of presenters, each with 30 seconds, highlighted how their team plans to contribute to Volkswagen’s EV transition strategy.

In ARK’s view, companies with 'old world DNA' are unlikely to transition quickly enough to dominate the new world. Often the difference between old and new world DNA are plans for linear as opposed to exponential growth trajectories. Tesla's stated goal for 2030 is three terawatt-hours of annual production, 12.5 times more than VW's 240 gigawatt-hours. In an exponential world, companies thinking linearly could be left behind..""

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. VW is not profitable in EVs. Tesla has 10x the margin. Literally never catching up to escape velocity tesla.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is already highly profitable with some of the largest margins in the entire industry. Meanwhile, VW's productivity is well below average. They manufacture about as many cars as Toyota, but they do it with twice the number of staff. That is unlikely to change any time soon due to strong labour unions and political involvement.

The latter is likely also the reason for the discount in the shares Porsche SE owns, because the German state of Lower-Saxony owns 20.2% of shares. However, there is also a federal law specifically aimed at VW that states that no party other may exercise more than 20% of voting rights. This gives Lower-Saxony a blocking minority, which means any voting rights in excess off 20% that Porsche SE owns are worthless.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then just buy on the German exchanges?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol.  I ask about Porsche's liabilities and you tell me about VW's.

""Nuff said"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, they are doing it right now. vwid is total garbage, not at all comparable to m3."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah good one. even if their rosiest projections happen (which is impossible) they will be way behind tesla with no path to autonomy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you are ignorant af. How did tesla sell out 😂😂 china just make shit up about tesla to push nio and xpeng. But tesla will be number 1 in china India and usa. EU can keep their overpriced electric golfs. Actually theres a couple million teslas in europe right now 🙈😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trump made sure, the US was set back 5-10 years in EV market development. Just compare market size for EVs, infrastructure development, government incentives, models on the market etc. 

I would add that the best EVs will come from Hyundai/Kia (awesome tech at a price thats affordable) and VW (mass production capacities and brand loyalty of many in Europe). Hyundai's E-GMP tech is superior to VWs MEB. Both are superior to the rest of the bunch, excluding Tesla, which is on par with E-GMP."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy Porsches.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yup
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget that Germany invented the automobile in 1886.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah didnt know it was a tweet
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ty
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently still is market cap is still below their ownership value of VW.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I did. Their debt to asset ratio is tiny. $39 billion worth of assets vs. $346 million worth of debt. What's your point?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So is buyijg the poahy good enough?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both POAHY and NTDOY is OTC only so end of story retard, it doesn't matter if it's ADR or not if it's not purchasable through NYSE/NASDAQ. NOK, BABA, NIO, and a lot more companies are also ADR but are still listed on the market. Nobody cares if it's listed on Xetra/IBS, the whole point is options available ON the American market."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The arb stops making sense when Porsche SE's market cap is at least the value of their VW ownership + other assets. Basically calculate that market cap, divide by total shares, and there's your shareprice"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Porshe SE is currently at 93 euro, to match the 31.4% of volkswagen it would have to go to around 140 euro"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha agreed. I pulled an all nighter so I cannot figure out a reasonable price target atm. 

Anyone? Price target? Why it's not too late?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,so you saved 38% by missing 1000%?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And it’s up 1000% since this time last year
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just trying to help.. waiting for a dip while it doubles in share price would seriously hurt.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your name is literally throwaway. And you are posting bs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i guess you got some good sources for that?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How profitable is Tesla without regulatory credits? Then consider that VW was probably buying some because of their ICE manufacture... Now that VW is manufacturing its own EVS, will they be required to buy more or less regulatory credits from external sources?"

Stay On The Right Side Of Change"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only sounds ignorant to u cuz u don't pay attentive to news
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that this will happen. VW will stay in the middle class segment it's in, especially with it's pretty good hybrid tech it's selling already (think Arteon shooting brake), whilst asian are not really capable of pushing into the middle class on western markets, else we'd have seen them there long ago with conventional motors. I think the future market will break into a electric city-car market and a hybrid middle-class/long range market, since conventional motors start to shine where e-cars have their limitations and vice versa (long range and quick refuel vs no emission and fast acceleration)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I find german car stocks rather Opelling"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not only that, even the first electric car was built in Germany in 1888 as well"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hired a Skoda Superb for a long euro trip a few years ago and it was really excellent. I’ve hired others for shorter trips in CZ and CH and they’ve been equally brilliant. I’d be happy to own one.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming that they don't have loads of debt which is offsetting that difference.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah agree with you too, lots of the juice has probably been squoze, but hoping someone can math it out and I'll buy if that arb buffer is still big enough


There was a nice run from $7.80 1 month ago through March 3 to $9, that must've been Dr Burry buying in before tweeting"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"38% is 380% of a 1000% run up.. do some math.

As an aside, bashing every other emerging EV every day all day won’t suddenly make tesla more appealing to all the people annoyed by you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You are right but the way your phrased it seemed aggressive IMO
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because people make throwaway account on Reddit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"operating profit margin VW: 3.82%

Tesla:  9.2% and steadily rising every single quarter in the middle of a worlwide pandemic.

You can look up margins can you?

VW doesn't have any 100% margin software business in case you haven't notice. They are selling bricks. They never claimed to ever reach or overtake tesla, not even in their outlandish presentations. Its not even part of the plan. You need to seriously get a clue if you think VW is going to be anywhere near tesla in the next 50 years."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh how precious, you finally did it!  It only took you an hour.

Would you care to guess how I feel about an idiot who can't read calling me a ""dumbass""?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not an EV. I drive a gasguzzling landcruiser. Its a great car, but it has no chance for the future."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I want a GLI so bad
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"literally all irrelevant in EV space, which is the only space that matters. Also Germany has already capitulated to Tesla. They are happy with their new underling position under Tesla and are doing everything to make Tesla happy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you cant explain how tesla sold out. Thanks for pointing that out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hyundai is pretty new to the European market for a car manufacturer. They entered the market on cheap cars but are now selling in direct competition to VW and co. And they do sell those cars. Additionally, the EV market is very new, people are open to new brands based on what's on offer - Hyundai and Kia have already made themselves a good reputation in this space, Kona, Niro were 2 years ahead. VW basically released a car this year that competes with them (ID3), but comes with countless bugs and seems a bit half baked. But the new shining stars are Ioniq 5 and Kia EV6. Charge in 20 minutes to 80%, that's unheard of in this price segment (basically only the Porsche Taycan is as fast). 3 m wheelbase. Vehicle to load. More performance than he directed VW competition (EV6 will do 0-100 in 3 seconds, Ioniq 5 in 5 seconds). Software based on NVidia Drive. Everyone who is in the EV space is excited for these two EVs. VW will leverage their size, but so far their EVs are sort of middling and not very exciting."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Americans will never adopt city cars. That’s been tried and failed. Americans buy SUVs.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a reason because the Holding is quite complex and nobody get it because not popular enough. Now it is a momentum stock. Greetings from 🇩🇪

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"CLA?! Are you a woman?!

C63 Coupe AMG 2009 model, balls deep."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,CLA has mixer under the bonnet. Get a proper car while you can.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They have about 350 million debt
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"just checked their Q3 2020 reporting and they have total debt of about \~300 million € while also keeping \~450 million in liquid assets so they could essentially pay of their entire debt right now if they wanted to.

[https://www.porsche-se.com/fileadmin/downloads/investorrelations/mandatorypublications/interimreport-20/Porsche\_SE\_Q3\_2020\_de.pdf](https://www.porsche-se.com/fileadmin/downloads/investorrelations/mandatorypublications/interimreport-20/Porsche_SE_Q3_2020_de.pdf)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I doubt the share price will follow such a simple calculation, but there should still be a good bit of upside"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I would expect a flag at some point and a retest of $8 support levels.  Especially after this paper handed bitches buy in on a lethargic holding.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its not bashing. VW is nowhere near Tesla. It is garbage in comparison. This is just a fact.

The point is, the super smart dip buyers missed a 1000% run up, just so they can jump on a 38% dip. Its a pretty stupid move if you ask me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh you must be right, hence the downvotes. I need to work on my delivery.."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"VW said on Tuesday that it plans to deliver 1 million EV this year, which is more than Tesla's 750,000.  They also said on Tuesday that they want to be the top EV maker in the world by 2025.  Pretty sure that includes overtaking Tesla."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, not a terminally online retard like yourself"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong, they're positioned for a surprise attack. Bosch made every car sensor for decades. VW declared war and this time they won't lose like WWII.

Stay On The Right Side Of Change

Tesla is done 0️⃣"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I made my points. Ur just too lazy to look up the widely news articles. Maybe someone will blog abt it for u
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, right now VW is still a bit behind for sure, but give them about four years or so. The thing is that it feels like Hyundai has reached what they are capable of atm, whilst VW feels more like they're still going somewhere. And my gf's dad got himself the eGolf a few weeks ago, and that thing's great. Charging time makes it an issue, of course, but here we are again at what i said about the fragmentation into long-range cars and city cars: for city cars a even 200 km with 8h charging time are ok because you don't need the range in a day, and they can charge over night. Whilst the car feels like a VW. Right now Hyundai has the advantage, but until they can enter the european market big scale (don't forget stuff like the fiat 500 e, which locks the entire italian EV market), VW/Audi etc will be superior again."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He may be insightful but he is human and he is definitely not successful on 100% of his trades.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Roughly 1% of market cap for context
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh man. 🤦
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wrong.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao take your meds dude. Autonomy is not about sensors but about software. Tesla has shitty non HD cams they probably buy off some crackhead in a parking lot. It doesn't matter.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No. You just said a bunch of shit and cant back anything up 😂 no need to cry about it though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, it's not exclusive that Hyundai and VW have success. Tesla, VW and Hyundai will probably be the EV players. Hyundai made a lot of strategic investments that are paying off. They seem to be more open to innovation and tech than others, which is also revealed in how their new EVs are designed. So far the Japanese manufacturers have not much to show for, so I assume their market share will go to VW and Hyundai. Stellantis seems to have settled for Transporters and small EVs. Renault Nissan have not innovated much and have lost the edge they had. They also don't have much money to.invest and their technology is lacking."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd blindly follow a burry investment....not a redditor.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Baaaaaaaaaa.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"you not even got the balls to post under clear name. Go, choke on the balls of your imaginary wife's boyfriend."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure about the ""open to new tech"" part, VW currently has a production planned (ID VIZZION) which relies on AR for a threedimensional holo dashboard amd stuff like that, but mainly with you there, yes. Hyundai especially managed to get new tech to work properly, which pays off, the rest of the asian manufacturers will probably play the copycat (bet they already are, but not yet producing) in a lower price segment, so nothing will change that much in terms of market structure"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody mentioning Nissan, their tech isn't great but their Nissan leaf is by far the most common full EV at least in Ireland. I think at the moment with the fear of the unknown of evs, whoevers cheapest wins and VW are generally mid to upper end of the price range"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure the Japanese can follow. They seem stuck and in denial. Especially Honda and Toyota. Their pure BEVs are so limited in basic EV design. Yes, the Honda E looks quirky, but it's not practical with horrible charging and mini battery. 

Hyundai and also VW have a strategic advantage in that they bought themselves a lot of tech. Hyundai has a stake in companies like Rimac(Porsche as well). They reap that benefit using Rimacs tech for 800V systems. They also have bought Boston dynamics, collaborate with Aptiv on a full self driving car etc, either have investment or collaborate with Cannoo. VW also has strong strategic investments, especially in battery tech. That's why I see those two way ahead. 

But yeah we will see."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL yah, terribleeeeeeeee idea."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He made quite a bit of money on both of those trades.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nissan Leaf is severely outdated and they only have the Ariya to follow up. It looks nice but nothing revolutionary. 
Same for Renault with their Zoe. It didn't help that they have a lot of debt, had the drama around Ghosn (who basically forced Nissan to do the Leaf)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bear in mind that especially Toyota has a huge market in third world countries. Eg i've lived in South Africa for a while, and there for one abut two out of three cars are a toyota and also nobody gives a shit about EV. Their main market is not at all endangered by the EV trend, so no need to pursue that"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Burry started the GME trend he even tweeted he's the one who found the sleepy giantss of GME, if it wasn't for Burry's portfolio statements and news of him asking GME to buyback shares then DFV wouldn't have brought it to light nor would the FinTwits. 

Also, TSLA is a great short idea right now because of too much speculation and hype. Real value Tesla is literally worth $32 a share. I am short Tesla. It was a pricey short but reality will hit soon."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's true but I wouldn't say it's their main market. I've lived in West Africa, where it was a lot of Toyotas but mostly used. The few new ones weren't that many. I've also lived in Pakistan where there were new Toyota's but also other brands (Honda Suzuki etc. mostly Japanese indeed) and Chinese brands slowly encroaching. 
I think for Toyota theost important markets are US and probably California in particular and then Japan and then Europe. But nothing would prevent them from developing EVs while continuing ICE production for non EV countries. They just seem to be set on not going into EVs. 
But let's see. They should have a lot of money and can probably catch up at some point."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both me and dfv and i imagine a lot of others were invested in gme a long before the burry statements, and not because of those"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked into Michael Burry's 13D filings and he actually had his first investment in GME 2018, but he sold early 2019 only to buy back in again later same year.

DFV, who follows Burry's portfolio closely, bought GME in summer of 2019."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"sooner rather than later now, esp after a 4% jump from one person: cathie wood"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"At this point I'm convinced the only reason the stock is up to 200 is because nobody is selling, and if anyone starts selling someone else comes in and buys up more.  After the Tuesday meeting we might see movement up or down.  I'm selling half and making more than all of the money I invested in GME back, I'll keep the other half for long term, if the price dips down to reasonable numbers I'll be able to buy much more back this way.

And people complaining about it being shorted at 200, of course it is, almost everyone believes it isn't worth 200.  Anyone wanna chime in on the P/E ratio at 200 per share?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,cuz the squeeze won't be something that just happens in a span of a second - there's no reason to settle for something less - especially at this price point

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, true.  I think I'll still cash out half of my shares, I foresee it dipping in the future and then coming back up.  No reason not to take advantage of that by selling and buying at the bounce.  I like the stock, but I don't think its going to stabilize at 200 or keep climbing in the short term.  I would argue long-term you are right though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't just take their only profitable quarter of the year and then say they have positive p/e ratio. They always make profits on Q4 but will then go back to negative earnings for the next few quarters.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course I can; that’s why its called speculation. Also, if they go back into negative earnings for the wrong reasons, then the price will reflect that. And to be completely frank, you’re talking about historical data of a B&M store, not the potential of an e-commerce store."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate it, I'm just an idiot, who just got into trading right before GME exploded and got lucky.  I still feel like there is so much I don't know, right now I was just feeling really uncomfortable with half of my portfolio being GME when it started at 15%."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"But its not the current p/e ratio then. Its some completely different thing.
And if you are trying to predict the future p/e you dont just take the current quarters earnings and do the math with only that number...

You should never use just one quarter for these calculations. Even if Ryan Cohen turns GME completely around, the Q4 will always have way higher earnings than every other quarter. This year was even more so due to new consoles

Whether they can make it profitable is whole another discussion but using Q4 numbers of this type of business to predict other quarters is just insanity"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s actually good advice. You holding? Did William Holden come to the party?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🦍 together strong
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re referring to P/E TTM (trailing 12 months). There is no rule against calculating P/E quarterly. The reason I calculated quarterly is because the previous quarters are negative, therefore giving a P/E ratio of null. Do I believe the stock to be worth nothing? Certainly not. Do I believe they will go negative again? Perhaps, but I am 100% convinced that going forward, their P/E TTM will be no lower than what I calculated. In other words, I believe Q4 2020 will be the absolute floor by 2022, which is why I put my money where my mouth is."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,HF's owned me in 2008... this isn't about money for me... im holding!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can calculate whatever you want but its not relevant information and shouldnt be given as answer to somebody asking about p/e ratio.

And if you think the whole business is going to change, why are you using the Q4 earnings estimations at all? For 2022 the earnings per share would be 1.65 and p/e ratio to be 30 as you claim, the Q4 has to be way higher than the 1.65 since other quarters will always be behind Q4.

Maybe this chart will help you understand why the Q4 is so much different than the other 3
https://www.statista.com/chart/16211/monthly-video-game-industry-sales/"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, we’re going to have to disagree. You say Q4 isn’t relevant because of the seasonal nature of the market. I’m saying that I believe Q1 2022 will look as good or better than Q4 2020. Also, since you’re not the arbiter of what is or is not relevant information, just saying “it’s not relevant information” doesn’t invalidate my points. Further, I never said the whole business was going to change. They will still sell much of the same things, but do so more efficiently and in greater volume, as a result of the pivot. This is why I believe estimated earnings are relevant. Side note: online video game sales are $200B/y and growing, which isn’t reflected in the link you shared."

2021-03-22 06:33:20,wallstreetbets,"RKT's growth story shows up in its financials I see many people compare RKT's forward P/E of around 12 to supposed peers like COF (Forward P/E 9.25), ESNT (7.38), PFSI (5.45), WD (12.2), UWMC (6.83), and claim that RKT is fairly valued or even overvalued. But I think that is a shallow comparison, given that [RKT is more than just a pureplay mortgage company](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8olrf/why_rkt_is_not_just_a_mortgage_company_with_an_app/). So what are some other metrics that we can use to compare these companies? One way is to also check their P/S, which is used a lot for growth companies that sometimes have losses and does not have a proper P/E. RKT has a P/S of 2.87, with a $45B market cap on $16B sales; what about these pure-play mortgage company peers?

COF - 2.26

ESNT - 5.24

PFSI - 0.99

WD - 3.14

UWMC - 3.99

So you can see here that RKT is middle of the pack. Why is it that RKT has average P/S valuation but high P/E valuation? The difference here is in spending - the higher expenses of RKT is making the EPS lower. What is RKT spending on and why does the spending make RKT stand out? They are reinvesting in the business - buying marketing, spending for infrastructure (they have a 2500 software team, larger than any of these other companies), acquiring other businesses, etc. You might argue and say maybe RKT is really inefficient and has a bunch of useless employees? Lets quickly check this: RKT has 20,000 employees and $16B sales, UWMC has 7000 employees and $3.62 sales, COF has 52,000 employees and $26B sales... you get the idea, RKT is pretty efficient with their staff.

So in the end, it's clear that based on sales, RKT is not overvalued. Their high P/E ratio is because they are reinvesting in the company, just as a growth company would do. Their investment in infrastructure and automation already clearly shows up in their staff efficiency."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish on RKT 🚀🚀🚀🌕
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is a 3-4x stock in 2021. You read it here first, on WallStreetBets. If the Biden administration passes the $15k tax incentive for first time homebuyers, new mortgage applications will skyrocket. IMO, the chances of this tax incentive being passed soon are very high.

FHA loans require a minimum of 3.5% down payment, which is $10.5k on a $300k loan. Closing costs are typically an additional $10.5k. This means that before a new buyer needed to save $25k (to cover reserves). Now the government will cover $15k of that, at closing, not at a later date, they would only need $10k to close a deal, which is very realistic.

I’ve always been bullish on RKT. If this tax incentive passes, this will be a hyper growth stock"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m balls deep in shares and June 28.89c. And I’m buying more tomorrow if there’s a dip. $60 stock min but I’m thinking we’re gonna get another gamma squeeze once enough buy volume comes whether that will be via divi reinvestment or buyback program and we start reaching the 30 level. This stock isn’t staying this low for much longer. Last weeks price action was absolutely ridiculous. Algos were going crazy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its hard to do, but IMO reinvesting in the company should count as 'earnings'. AMZN was famous for this; their profits always looked like shit cause they put it to work"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They just got bumped up to a 1 rating on Ford Equity Research on Friday. Expect big gains.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I honestly like both UWMC and RKT and even though this makes no sense.... I love Detroit! As far as Mortgage plays are concerned. These are the only 2 I would play and own.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's ready to send some apes into space
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Used to work there can confirm that there is not any employee that doesn’t fulfill a role. They only promote from within and they weed out any who don’t grind in their first position. I have never worked harder in my life and honestly I didn’t hate it! Also when they set goals they beat them. I’m all in on Rkt since IPO and add more every paycheck.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme stimmy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think RKT holders and UWMC holders should have some sort of sparring match

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions? Options strike and exp? Or are you a hedge shill? This stock is heavily manipulated
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,TL;DR PFSI might apparently be the most undervalued company in the industry even after the massive jump.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Super Bearish on RKT.  Its anal is getting deeper.

It is way over valued refer  to mortgage market, none of the FED act up will bring it up sooner.

Don't waste your monies on this SCAM.

Your money will use to offset for their upcoming short payments."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If the Biden administration passes the $15k tax incentive 

As a middle class worker in California, I cant help but feel like Im just getting fucked over & over again"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool.  A tax credit like that means I sell my house for $350k instead of $300k.  Prices will stay high, but that sale will still be tax free growth, and I'll move to a bigger, better, newer house in a slightly nicer area.

And granted I know I'd be buying into essentially the same market, but loans are cheap and money is nothing anymore.  In 25-30 years you'll be paying the bank a cup of coffee and a scone every month.  Those who have access to borrowing at mega low interest rates are making out like bandits."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When is this tax incentive set to pass?

EDIT: 
- did some googling and basically, we know nothing of the bills timing and it’s kinda much pretty vague, doesn’t look like something actually on the visible agenda of Biden’s administration.


Please do correct me if I’m wrong."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"no more gamma squeezes.  AMC and GME have proven they will sell down any amount of stock to close the weekly book outside of the money.  That profits teh shorts they are sellers of these calls.

I have put all my rkt money into shares.  I swear off the options.  That cuts off the income stream to the shorts.  Then they are burned.  Let the stock hang here and close the options book.  They will starve and have to cover.  

Then: booom!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe we will luck out and get dividend reinvestment and buyback this week. That will definitely shake the shorts out.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and no. There are some shit companies who ‘reinvest’ into themselves to avoid paying taxes. It’s always important to know what they’re reinvesting into and if they have an expected ROI.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Detroit has good hot dogs if I remember correctly. I remember the food being good. Haven’t been there in a long time.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got shares in RKT and bought leaps in UWMC to hedge if they win with the brokers. Also a bit of HMPT. Basically I can't lose. Or win. I'm retarded. Buy gme or something idk. Not financial advice.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you check my post history u'll see that im a real dood. I've argued before that RKT is not a distraction from GME - RKT had lots of interest and qualoty DDs last year. In fact RKT is probably shorted by the same HFs, and they could be getting ammo here to fight the apes in GME.

Im long shares and leaps. Sold my june dated calls for 5 baggers near the top of the spike. Im still extremely bullish on this in the short and long term. We just need to get the shorts outta RKT"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"you check the stock on fedility and yahoo and the stock is likely going to trade sideways for a while.

its one year proce target is $25.08 which it hit and is trading below currently. expect it to rise some but they are trading within a realistic value."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"not sure why ur getting downvoted but that is a good observation from the numbers alone. I think PFSI just isn't sexy and appealing, it looks like just a run of the mill mortgage company that pays out dividend - a good retirement stock. But I agree the valuation is actually really low by all metrics. Not really comparable to RKT because RKT has a growth story. But if anything I think PFSI is a better buy than UWMC. I'll probably dig deeper and maybe even take a position."

E.g., 6k/yr for IRA is proportionately less effort for you than someone in St. Louis. If you aren’t leveraging your higher than average earnings into the stock market, or real estate market outside or CA yes you are absolutely losing. Anyone in CA should have a 10-year plan to relo/retire to lower COL area; now that remote work is mainstream it’s a true opportunity."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. Biden doesn't seem to understand his 120k income cutoff on student loans means middle class in cities in CA will still be paying 200k on loans while renting garage ADUs for 2k a month. 15k will not help any of us afford,  well, anything out here. Not while we have student loans."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to my world. I've received all of $128 from all stimulus combined even though I pay a good chunk in taxes. I'm more just frustrated in them calling it a stimulus, it's not a stimulus unless everyone gets it.

Fortunately with remote working I think we're going to see a lot more smoothing out of housing prices and COL going forward.  It'll take time of course.

More worried about hyperinflation than anything else.    The pricing mechanisms in our society are breaking down."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🤗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ok but why?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally has never gone past $43. How did you sell at $45?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither of which are expensive... what are you poor?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Pitter-patter.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought I saw in pre-market that it touched $48 briefly before falling all the way to $36 at open. Was very strange. Would be doing well to have sold at $45 but it was doable. Still long btw, 625 @ 25"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Premarket the day off the crash. If you have a broker that allows trading at 4 am, you could've sold at iirc $50. He's still an idiot though for paper handing the second time. It hasn't even been 3 weeks and he sold the moment it went red."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[it was $42,](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lx4a75/rkt_yolo_update_mar_3_2021_i_still_like_this_stock/gpkwpsb?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3) my bad. 

I swear it got to $48 after I pulled out stayed around that, then bombed as soon as market opened to around $25. 

Either way i aint fkn touching this stock again."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s get at her. Buy more RKT.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If that happens there will be a housing bubble and inflation causing havoc. If the inflation gets in control and the economy bounces back slowly RKT could profit in this tax incentive. That said I dont see it happening due to too much risk.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Two big problems. One, housing market is so hot thag people are paying more than what the house is worth. So when it comes time to sell and get it appraised you are out money. Or get an absolutely high rate of interest on the mortgage because it's more than what it's worth. 

Two, When Housing costs are already rising, and people who cannot afford a mortgage are getting significant relief form said mortgage down payment they can no longer afford said house. This will lead to foreclosures and forbearance."

2021-03-22 05:34:22,wallstreetbets,"You’re buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. Why do you hate money? Technicals 101 for beginners. **Not a trading advise.**

Hey there folks and congratulations if you haven’t blown up your account last week. Thanks to TA, mine **barely** survived. It is messy out there, making it very difficult to trade. Honestly, if you’re down, that’s understandable because these are not normal conditions. We just had a 12 month flash course on market behavior. What we’ve witnessed in this short time happens in the span of 3+ years, not months.

Bright side is, we learned a lot. Through pain and punishment. Turns out those lessons are the most kept. It’s like we are little puppies.

**So, what do we do?**

We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis. It’s gonna be a long Sunday read but I promise, it’ll be an eye-opening one for most of you. Don’t worry. Basics are super simple and I won’t confuse you with pattern terminology.

If you’re not using these methods already, this post is going to improve the way you trade exponentially while minimizing losses if your trade begins going south. You'll be able to apply these methods on short and long term positions.

I received a PM from a fellow Redditor yesterday, saying his puts lost half the value. I’m sure those losses would not have been this big if TA was involved. We will get it back my dude. Read on.

**Resistance and support**. Two simple, magical words we’re going to cover today.

You’re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.

I'd like for you to pay attention to time of entrance (**at support**) and exit (**at resistance**) then match those with order execution times which you will find on top.

https://preview.redd.it/d2nrriswrgo61.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=78703c09cfc24458b1d63ddde0c022038dd1f72f

**Back story**. Folks, I can't make this shit up if I want to. I'm two inches away from my screen, glued. Watching green candles pile up over support, printing...On the way to 390 resistance. I know if it breaks, we're going 391 easy..Last I saw was 389...Goddam power flickered, caused a reset on my modem. Panic sunk in.

About 45 seconds later, connection came back. I remember I kept saying please be above 390...please be above 390....I knew as a fact, when it hits that major resistance at 390, there's a fat chance of rejection, sending my greens to red in matter of fifteen seconds.

I saw 390.12 on screen. Smashed sell. Could've been a good trade gone wrong. My original plan was to sell half at resistance and sell the other half after a possible break out. Slightly above 391, those contracts were going for $1.50 per.

&#x200B;

Let’s step away from day trading, apply support and resistance basics on longer term charts. After all, you need to be mentally unstable in some way to even consider day trading.

We’re gonna take General Electric as example. Starting with it’s 6 month chart, then zoom into weekly.

On **October 10th 2018**, GE closed at what seems to be a random, insignificant price. $13.28.

On **February 12th 2020**, it hit $13.26. Failing to close above $13.30 once again. Think about it. After millions of trading volume and after 16 months, it touched the same number and traded down the following days. Crazy accuracy, couple cents.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3tumqvxssgo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06512087a5ea457dabb354960c24c5d548f495e2

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Stay with me.

**Drawing bearish and bullish channels**

Here's the GE weekly chart. Each candle represents one hour.

https://preview.redd.it/pwxrsx91ugo61.jpg?width=1532&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d0b6361605df5fe66cfdac3d6c6cbe2c15b1a44b

Super simplified. You take the bottom of the **lowest candle** (**A**) and draw a line until it touches the bottom part of another candle that's trending up **(B).**

Now, we repeat that on top portion. This time, starting a line at the top of candle **(C)** and ending at another candle that is trending up **(D).** Bullish channel is complete.

Using same principals, you can also draw a bearish channel. In that case, instead of pointing up, channel will be pointing down.

Next, we’re going to add to our chart what’s proven to be the resistance at $13.2x. Purple horizontal line.

Guess what price GE closed on Friday. 🤯

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ssi2kllbvgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6e6ac7bbb85f40bd35a4232c794b39f8f4d54cfc

**So, buying short expiry puts Monday on GE is free money? It failed to break resistance again and again.**

No. Analyze the chart below. Area I highlighted shows it actually did break the resistance intraday and held all the way to closing bell. There’s a big possibility that resistance is now a potential support. What we’re seeing on the highlighted portion could be the back test of said support, closing at $13.2x and not below it.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/kma6obvoxgo61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6a7be213dc070bc178a35316600bfa84a8f77ea4

&#x200B;

**As a case study, what do we look for Monday eod?**

We look for confirmation. If we see a strong green candle close above $13.50, in my book that’s a long buy (calls). Likely 13.2x resistance becoming support.

If we see a strong red candle finish below 13, breaking down our bullish channel, that signals resistance held once again and it will most likely continue to go down, once again. Puts galore.

**Here’s the part that matters for you the most.**

Do not buy calls near major resistance. Period. Buy the confirmed support. Sell the confirmed resistance.

We see paper handing comments all the time. “If I were to hold two more days, I could’ve doubled my money”.

Why would you sell when you see green candles making higher highs inside a bullish channel? Sell when it’s close to resistance.

**What about red candles inside the channel?** 

It's okay. Take a look back at the **0tde SPY 390c** chart. If I were to see red candles getting close to support, I would’ve sold and worst case scenario lose 10-15%.

**Buy at support, sell at resistance. Buy at support, sell at resistance and don’t look back.**

Apply these principals to your weeks, months out expiry contracts. Pull charts that each candle represents 4 hours minimum, one day candles ideally. TA is much easier and accurate when it's based on longer time frames. **I'm telling ya, damn thing closed at 13.2x two years ago!**

**Minimizing losses when trade goes south.**

This is the hardest part to execute. Denial, hope, what ifs... I lost $24K two weeks ago by not practicing what I'm about to preach.

I added red candles on our GE Chart to simulate a support break. Each candle represents four hours. Take a look. 

https://preview.redd.it/hzjczrif3ho61.jpg?width=1529&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d1495016c42c920d0cf0754011f7d8a142cb5e6

At this point, it's pretty much gg. Even though we see a green candle at the end, due to time decay, calls are destroyed. Basically, it needs 3 perfect green candles just to get back inside and 3 more candles to start trending up in the channel. 4 hour candles, by the time that happens, 30-50% poofed. In this scenario, I bet bears would buy puts at first sight of support break which I wouldn't blame and definitely participate.

**I'd like to point this out again. Some charts I showed you guys as examples are short time-framed. You're better off applying these basics on charts that each candle represents one day, assuming your position is not expiring in 48 hours. Remember this as beginners, longer expiration, more data, better TA. More gains, less losses.**

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.

What I know is this. I’m not touching TSLA. I’m not touching AAPL or SPY or QQQ or any ticker that has been chopping up and down between support and resistance. Bunch of noise. Time decay. Not good for option contracts.

I want to see resistance break and hold for calls.

I want to see support fail for puts.

Don't know about you but I like my money. Not going to close my eyes, open a position and hope for the best. Buying based on gut feeling, selling on gut feeling. That’s gambling not trading.

I get the biggest kick when I see my people after Friday close saying, “Shit...What am I gonna do now for 48 hours?”

Well sir...You pull out crayons, draw some lines, look for opportunities. Add more layers to charts. Moving averages, bullish cross overs, RSI...It’s a treasure hunt.

This is the way.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This looks like nonsense. That’s my gut feeling.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here’s the thing with TA:

You will mitigate losses but you’ll also mitigate gains. It’s a way to get in and out of the market with minimal risk. But the market historically goes up in the long term so spending time out of the market-regardless what the charts say- is foolish if your goal is to make money. 

It’s ironic that traders (the group of people whom often have the highest risk tolerance) choose to use TA (a strategy which fundamentally speaking carries some of the lowest risk tolerance). But it’s for this exact reason that traders on average will underperform the market. Buying at support and selling at resistance leaves almost no room for volatility. And volatility (on average) is what leads to the highest returns."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,$14 GE calls? Gotcha
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every single time I’ve ignored my gut feeling when making a trade I’ve lost money, every time. TA is astrology"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You opened with a misspelling. I love it. You fucking retard ❤️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not a huge TA person but I believe there is something to support and resistance points, I've seen it play out many times and I've based decision from it in many cases. 

I'm no expert, but I believe the right approach is to follow the same group of stocks over time to get a feel for what high or low is. In a way, your ""gut feeling"" becomes more or less than same as the support and resistance points. I've noticed that if I'm looking at any particular stock for the first time, even using TA I still don't feel confident in what a ""normal"" price is, or where the support and resistance points are. Sure I can use TA but I don't trust what I'm seeing.  Even scrolling through different time frames, zooming in and out, I still feel like I'm about to step on a land mine if I haven't followed it before. But if you're watching a stock closely day by day for a couple months, you know where the support and resistance really is, regardless of what any TA on a chart is showing you. You roughly know it rarely goes below $12 or above $15, and you know once it goes to $16, back to $15 and the to $17, it's reached new territory and you recalibrate to it's new normal range. 

Even if TA is complete BS, the fact that so many people use it and believe in it, and knowing that investor beliefs impact price changes, I don't think it's something you can ignore."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really enjoy technical analysis and find a lot of value in it.

The thing about posts like this and of technical analysis in general is people don't mention that technical analysis is used to interpret what is going on in a chart to give you an idea of what you should do in the future to increase the probability of making money.

It's true that lines and patterns don't work every time, because every situation in the market is unique. There are always different traders that get involved that could completely screw over what you think should happen. What goes on in the market cannot be predicted as too many people are involved.

So please for the love of God everyone, please do not use technical analysis to predict what is to happen because that's not what it's for. Technical analysis should only be used to interpret what is happening in the market or the price action of a ticker."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, so drawing lines and levels will force the others to buy and sell at your discretion? Amazing wizardry. This is the reason why only 10% of retail traders make money, because you reveal your strategy to the hedgies and stupidly expect to win. The only good thing about TA is the risk management part."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also use TA, but mine is a bit different. Basically if a ticker symbol makes me laugh I buy long (ex. HEINY, BUNZ), and if I feel a symbol is making fun of mean in some way I sell short (ex. DUM, FAT). I agree with you. Gotta use TA. These apes on here who trade on gut feeling are just idiots."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Technical analysis literally isn't real and anyone who is actually smart and understands the market laughs at TA and mocks it as astrology.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe someone names u/dayswingtrade wrote this and received moderation approval..

what is this?

""You’re gonna love the story behind this trade. Perfect example of how powerful technical analysis can be. Below is a **$7K buy-in, 0tde SPY 390 call** I traded on Friday. One hundred percent based on a known pattern.""

this is such confirmation bias. You are literally bragging about one trade that happened to be right. I am so good! I entered at support and left at resistance! Bro everyone gets right, you are gambling based off lines, how is that better than gut feeling or knowledge about a company. Next time you are betting 100% on a known pattern and that pattern fails you are gonna feel like a dumbass? Like how much of an idiot did you feel like when you lost 23k last week based on a TA pattern?

""We do what seasoned traders have been doing for decades. We understand the basics of charts and practice technical analysis.""

"" I’m anxious to see how next week is going to play out. We’re stuck, yo-yoing between support and resistance on pretty much all indexes and big caps. It’s simply not possible for me as an apprentice trader to speculate.""

but yeah people freaking out on these dips when it gets bought up from the 50 day MA. week before last we had a nice test of the 21 week, snap bought back up from major support at 372. the big guys are going to do these major fake outs to shake out retail and get liquidity for their long positions. this happens a lot at major levels before huge breakouts, and spy breaking 400 is going to be one of these times. things could of course go either way, the bias should be towards the bulls, and markets are coiling up for a \*big\* move"

Clearly, what seemed to be chaotic, random price action is not chaotic and random. It follows rules and order of it's own. Just like everything else around us.

Ah yes. It makes perfect sense. After 16 months of playing hold-em, I made tens over treys on the flop, just as I had on that fateful night when I lost it all. Clearly what seemed to be a random shuffle was in fact a coded message from the NSA agent who passed the marked deck to the CIA agent posing as my dealer. It was time to go all in. My dick got rock hard as I shoved my chips into the center. I was about to make history. And, if things went well... another $380. B-)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how GME is a great beginners stock. ""Is this a dip?"" Stock goes down 15% in 30 seconds, then takes a break for 5 minutes to let my brain adjust. Then it goes down an other 15%. At this point I have had time to recognize the dip, sell some other stock and buy when it begins to rise again.

I've also heard that the squeeze can last for days like VW did. I might be able to catch that one too. =)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found a cheap mining stock with a recent IPO and saw they had experienced successful management from other connected industries and bought it last week. I'm up 8% already and that's just the start.

Technicals my ass. GME closed in the red at the latest psychological milestone of $200 and dipped under it significantly twice in the past week. That told me it was going down because panic sellers won't have confidence in a solid floor at $200 and they're afraid of the next psychological milestone down so they sell. I predicted that and now GME held under the $200 psychological milestone for the past 3 hours.

Fundamentals and psychology. A big spike upwards followed by a long downward trend looks like a downward trend even if it closes positive and that appearance sways hoards of retards more than any contrived technical analysis. Technicals only sway boomers, so save your tech talks for boomer stocks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"cool, but what if I just like the stock?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is really just a way to put some ‘if then’ logic behind volatile short term trades. I have calls and it dipped - how much of a dip is OK or am I bailing out here? Like anything else there’s lots of ways to do it well and poorly, but ultimately you’re just trying to put some guard rails in around what you’re doing (which is gambling).

Whatever you use - lines, crayons, chicken bones - use something, or you WILL blow up your account on options. Not even a question of if, just when."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"reject TA, remain at monke"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"while I’ve been involved in the stock market more these past months I have been noticing a lot of the variables between ppl who make money and those who lose it. I wouldn’t say the stock market is gambling like the lottery system. But ppl tend to let it become that way without realizing it. My first job was working at a gas station so I sold scratchers. I noticed many thought they had a system to winning and would bet on their system to work. But they never do, they always lose and think it just didn’t work this time. But some were smarter than others, they knew most of it was a game of odds. If someone had $100 to spend they would buy nothing more then scratchers worth $5 and their chances of winning back all their money was much higher than someone who blew all that money on just one scratcher worth $100 (these ppl were always the biggest idiots of them all, cus 9/10 times these were the ppl who believed in their systems religiously). This is how I see it with the stock market, the biggest losers are the ones who spend too much on one play thinking it’s gonna be the one that makes them a millionaire. There will always be exceptions but the odds are rarely in your favor. TA can be great but to a certain degree it begins to form the same thought pattern involved with gamblers who believe they have a system. TA can be a very useful tool but never risk so much money based on TA alone. And don’t sell it all as soon as you get in the red. That’s another factor. Emotions play a big factor in winners vs losers. Ppl should learn to separate emotions from rational thinking. It’s a skill worth learning and I believe these are the most successful ppl in general. But if you’re on wsb than you most likely don’t care about rational thinking 😂I mean I am holding on to gme but that’s the only non rational thing I’ll ever participate in again. And you better fucking believe I’ll see it through to the end. In the end everyone is allowed to lose or make money however they please (except scamming scumbags, fuck you)."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is basicly for monkeys to follow other monkeys trend. Why not become an investor and just do your DD and buy and HODL. Only sell if if the company changes so much that you no longer wish to be invested in them. 

HODL you fools! Don't be a chad!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is junk. With every single chart of yours I can point out and ask why didn't you draw your line here or there. Very easy to draw stuff in hindsight. Thinking you have an edge because you learned about some squiggly lines is laughable. Short term prices are random. Look up some interviews of people who develop algos for big funds. All of them laugh at TA. The most cringe shit is when a YouTuber with a $500 account talks about rsi is overbought or oversold and needs to ""cool down"", as if rsi determines the stock price and not the other way around."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh. TA exist for a reason. It helps, a bit, in buying a decent limit point vs buying at market value, which is substantial over many trades.

The confirmation bias is probably the best thing about TA. Think of it this way, if everyone in the world uses TA (enough traders do), the suspected trends is more likely to happen.

I'm not saying plan your long-term calls and puts purely on TA, like what most of these posts are about... But TA can help you buy those already planned out calls and puts at a better price in that day/week."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"if this were true, this would be true. but trading is actually 80% psychology, 20% mechanics. this is why people were successful trading for centuries before we ever had charts. dudes used to stare at ticker tapes and make money.

the best book on trading psychology is arguably ""Trading in the Zone"" by Mark Douglas. Best practice is to read (or listen to the audiobook \*wink\*) until one has it memorized.

trading is easy, you can literally flip a coin and make money, if your risk management is tight. most traders act on the erroneous belief that if they become better analysts, they will make money. many traders are exceptional analysts, but they lose because they never master their emotions. the markets are some of the last few places on earth that allow for unlimited freedom of creative expression. this freedom is what permits people to fail epically, in a society that largely thrives on imposing limitations.

TA works consistently. Your emotions do not. Master the latter, the former works for you.

I can prove ta works. TA is just behavioral analysis. This post will be downvoted because I'm saying TA works. These ignorant fucks go right past the 'trading is 80% psychology', and go right to what triggers them. So I'll say it again:

TA works, TA works really well. And risk management is far, far more important. It's why there's so much glorious loss porn in this sub. People lose all their money because their risk management is shit. If your risk management is shit, learning TA will only make trading more frustrating, because you'll go into profit *more* often, and then give it all back."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ever heard of card counting? Purpose behind it is to improve your odds against the Casino. There’s no expectations of winning consistently. Through basic math and following set guidelines of card counting, you aim to win more than you lose."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA works, it’s the traders psyche that determines if someone’s consistentely profitable. Dumb fuck"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The analogy I've always used with TA was that it's a lot like sitting down at a roulette wheel and 24 of the numbers are black (leaving the other 12 red) and the only bet you're allowed to make is black or red.

&#x200B;

You'll sit there all night putting your chips on that one color, as you should.  TA doesn't guarantee you're going to end up on the right side of a trade, but it gives you a 65-70% conviction if you can spot a chart pattern forming cleanly."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand why it's so hard for you people to understand that TA isn't supposed to predict the future, but rather give you an approach about how to go about your entry/exit points based on mathematics (statistics and probability, to be more specific). There's no logic against hating on TA unless your view on TA is flawed to begin with."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"you haven't been here long. most people that post insane gains, lose it shortly thereafter. you can't spend gains you don't keep. in fact you get fucked by not keeping your gains, because you can only write off $3k in losses annually. so having a volatile trading account balance fucks you **HARD**"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time that you've ignored your guts (and remember it) you've lost money, but I bet there are plenty of times when you ignored your guts and it was ok and you just don't remember it as clearly"

This guy literally tells us how he lost his shit because his internet went out for 2 minutes or something - too clear that it's just a gambler telling himself differently. Anytime there's hourly or shorter interval chart of candlesticks involved, it's gambling.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"i think what people miss is that while TA is a useful tool, it's only 20% of the equation. most people never learn risk management, so it doesn't matter what they do, their going to lose."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wizardry? So, there's no such thing as limit buy orders below the SP. 
 And you also are assuming that no one in the market decides, If stock X dumps to price X , I will buy. 

  That is what support is.  It's a swelling of buying interest around a  SP that usually tends to prevent further price drops as investors buy the dip.  

 And resistance forms around higher SP where people tend to set sell limits, exit points, etc. 

 Technical analysis combined with level 2 order book data can usually confirm buy walls and sell walls around certain price ranges.   

 Calling it astrology because you do not understand it, is certainly not doing your market education any favors."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, never saw that one!  Thanks for the link!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is something that's been bugging me ever since I started looking at stocks.

When I'm counting down a shoe at a blackjack table, I know the approximate Effect of Removal (EoR) of every card and I know what  my approximate EV is at any given moment, based on the cards that are no longer in the shoe. I know how much to bet, proportional to my bankroll, when I have the advantage. If I hit a 100 hour losing streak, I know it's OK because that's just the math working itself out.

As I'm sitting there, keeping track of big and small cards, I glance over at a baccarat table and I see bunch of degenerates with notepads drawing lines and trying to predict the outcomes of the following hands, based on the results of the previous hands. Those suckers don't have a chance, yet they believe they see winning patterns.

So this is what bothers me with stocks. As you're looking at those lines, how do you know you're not trying to draw conclusions off independent events?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The difference with card counting is you're given a set of variables that can be accurately accounted for. Accounting for these variables gets more accurate as more cards are dealt increasing the likelihood of making the correct call. I used to gamble semi professionally at blackjack. Card counting and the market are not a good comparison though I do see your point.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You aim to win more than you lose with any strategy. I doubt TA provides any advantage over “monkeys throwing darts”

If there is any advantage to TA, it is most likely because some predictions are self fulfilling prophecies

I’d much rather trade on clear catalysts or business speculation than the erratic moves of the market."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You really convinced me to Check out more analyzing, even tough my current Positions are 100% gambling."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a really bad metaphor. First of all, casinos are now using multiple decks, so you no longer know how many of each card is still in the deck, making card counting useless.

Second, card counting (with a single deck, or N number of decks where you know N beforehand) works because you know all variables in the game. This is absolutely not true for the stock market."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"there are finite cards in a deck, and counting card works because laws of reality govern that after xx cards have been dealt, there are yy cards left that can be dealt


what governs the mechanics behind these supposed floor and resistances?  what's mathematical about it?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cards counting is a math function, just like trading algos, they use mathematical models to create a prediction with high probability. Cards counting is a genius model that is proven to work, TA is not, there isnt a single model or function on TA there is no proven model.

TA isn't mathematical nor probable. Its confirmation bias. 90% of them are based of price averages, macd, simple average, fisher models, RSI are all derivatives of price average, its high schooler algebra, the highest math used is logarithms.

Don't insult mathematicians by comparing a proven math equation like cards counting with squares on charts. Sincerely a Stastician."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can confirm level 2 does give some very needed information if one is to do their trading in this manner. Obviously it's not going to always give you a home run but it helps. Though I'm still new at being a more active trader I can see why people want access to this information.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time you see a ""support line"" and you ""buy the dip"" I bet it drops below it the same day. there was no support it just happened to hit that number at a local min a few times so you could pick 2 points and draw a line. Its not real. Level 2 data is more useful than ta nonsense a little bit I guess. It still wont tell you much. Definitely not enough to validate any of the bs predictions."

Edit: Put another way, you can be correct on stocks more often than not and still lose money. Just like you can win the most hands in poker but still lose the game."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well most people that trade price action are going to say you have a maximum loss of 1% of account balance. They also would say you take profits at different levels and then move stop losses up. You would calculate all this before entering the trade and if 1% loss makes your stop loss to thin then you reduce the size of your initial position.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not OP, but TA has worked for me for years. People who think it's tea leaves think it claims to predict the future and don't realize that markets are partly driven by investor psychology. A stock is at 100, it goes to 110 and some bulls miss out. It gets back to 100, and those bulls buy in this time to avoid missing the next leg up, which on the chart creates what looks like a bounce at a nice horizontal support line.

TA increases my chances of a trade going well from a 50/50 coin flip to something greater than 50/50, which is plenty enough for me.

I don't use complex indicators like tea cups or whatever. Trendlines and support/resistance. My portfolio is currently running at 256.74% annualized return and a huge part of that is because TA works."

>Accounting for these variables gets more accurate as more are cards are dealt increasing the likelihood of making the correct call.

You mean more cards as in more candles? More candles more data?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,great now i have a monkey throwing darts at me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, this is the meta bro. You pick 20 random stocks that you like, make numbered list of those tickers, go on Amazon and buy three d20 die, a magic 8 ball and a deck of UNO cards, also you'll need a flipping coin and six sided die.

Roll the dice and the 3 numbers that pop up on the die, you cross reference them to the numbered list you made. Those are now the three stocks you will pick between. This is where the Magic 8 Ball comes into play. Shake it and ask for each stock, ""is it a good pick"". Out of the three, assuming it agrees on all of them, use your ape brain and then remove one stock out the three you like the least. Now you have two stocks, flip that coin I told you to have, to decide between the two. If the 8 Ball only picked one stock, then the 8 ball is smarter than you, and you can skip straight to the UNO cards. If the Magic 8 Ball picked none, go back and re-roll the die and start over.

The UNO cards are to be used accordingly once you have your final stock pick. Roll the six sided die to find out how many cards you'll be drawing in total and draw each card individually and apply the effects as you go.

Draw +2 = Double Down your initial investment of $1000 or $500. I dunno how much money you have for this.  
Reverse Card = Reduce your initial investment by 50%.  
Skip Card and 0 Cards = Do nothing.  
Wild Card = Increase/decrease initial investment by 69%.  
Wild Card Draw 4 = Triple Down your initial investment.  
1-9 Cards = Increase current investment by percent on card 1-9%"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jokes aside, big firms 100% *do not* use TA.

They literally don't. Many use algos, but those algos are not based on chart crayons. They are all different, but they mostly use things like news, order flow, unusual activity, etc. You can basically think of them as market ""scalpers,"" buying and selling in matters of seconds based on short-term trends. 

Honestly, it hurts people to hear this, but TA is almost exclusively used by YouTube traders. The big boys know its mostly bogus, as the big boys know you cannot time movements. Every successful investor of all time will have a quote that basically amounts to ""only idiots think they can time the market."" They try to find things that are overbought or oversold, and invest accordingly, but no real big time successful investor would ever say some shit like ""oh that's gonna bounce off the support."" The only people who say shit like that are people trying to sell you an ebook. 

 I've never heard of a big fund using TA to make trades, ever. And many  actual wall street bros have posted on WSB before, and they all unanimously say that TA isn't even a consideration at that level."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""You mean more cards as in more candles? More candles more data?""

I don't know how to do the quote thing like you.

It's a bit different anyway. As more cards are dealt, you know they're not going to come again. If you've seen four jacks, you know you won't see a fifth (I think they use multiple decks now but same thing). If you see 4 green candles going up 2%, you can still expect to see a 5th, 6th, 7th etc one."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I definitely read everythig you wrote. You clearly don't realize why your analogy is bad. You cannot draw a direct connection from the candles to the cards. Once you see one card you won't see it again until the deck is shuffled again. That is not the same as the market.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you card count, you are increasing the expectation of profit. If the game is set up correctly, you can calculate and formally prove the risk of ruin and the expectation of profit so that you know for a fact you will likely win money.  
  
You can’t do that with TA. Markets are much more complicated and you cannot formally prove anything. You only can do so if you make naive assumptions which may or may not hold."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Macd, rsi, simple avg, fisher models, marc models, are all price average derivatives, literally 90% of TA is price average derivatives.

They are all looking at the same function by using different angles, you understand how stupid that is. There is no math or statistics behind it.

As a stastician who graduated from a ivy (flex) i will give you an advice. You have more chances of getting a stock movement correctly by flipping a coin 10x or watching DD on WSB. 

Don't be dumb, if billion dollars algos created by math PHDs dont touch algos why would it work for an average joe."

One thing to note however, is daytrading, I swear every successful daytrader uses TA.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"right. that's not mutual exclusivity. you aren't the person that originally suggest it was, that I replied to, either. that's a little petty to downvote for that, don't you think? taking personally a comment that wasn't even directed at you? nothing personal hun."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"what makes you think you're smarter than the bots? most people don't even look at a chart so in events like last week they sold when spy dipped below 378, right into the waiting buy orders at 372. TA shows you what the bots and algos are doing.

most people don't even have a library card, so the argument of ""if it worked everyone would do it"" is lacking.

like i literally went, myself **me**, from homeless to financially independent in the span of the last 10 years. it's because i followed a formula. wealth is a formula, it's not luck. luck = *preparation + opportunity*

anyone could do what i did. i started a business *part time* selling target store clearance on ebay, and now it's my **full time** income. that's not dumb luck, that's consistent effort over time. most people won't do what i did because they can't manage the risk. therefore they don't get the reward. but this is short sighted. i manage my risk. i didn't quit my day job until a couple years ago. i sacrificed things that would have gotten me a bunch of likes on social media, but done nothing to my bank account. i did things that made me more complete as a person, vs things that stoked my ego.

if it worked, more people would do it. that's a lie. most people won't do what works, because of their limiting beliefs. it's easier to cry, manipulate, and fuck guys into giving you stuff, but that also means you a hoe, and you're always going to be dependent on men co-signing your bullshit.

fuck that. i'll take my freedom and independence every day."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It is manipulated but it does give you a better idea of buy vs sell demand. Like I stated it's not 100% obviously  but it's still more information that does give you an more complete picture. It's definitely still a gamble.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some people do, some people don't. You've heard how some people are successful trading just one or very few stocks that they understand, right? They've figured it out, even though their process for getting results is very different to an algorithm. In my opinion, if it works, it works."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> the point of counting is to identify periods when there are more high cards left in the shoe than low cards. an abundance of high cards in the deck gives a statistical edge to the player, and this is the time when they would typically increase their risk.

deny this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, you read my comment and instead of going back to see how you misread that other guy's post to figure out why you're wrong, you just quote the definition of gamblers fallacy to me? Incredible. He literally posted the opposite. Please tell me your plays this week."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not really want to get involved with this spat, but the fact is, the 24/12 roulette board example is basic statistics and the gamblers fallacy relies on you not knowing the odds, or at best, them being 50/50 and you making decisions based on feels.   

Just.. Pointing that out. This is not communications advice and I am not a communications consultant."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course.

*""Our findings demonstrated the feasibility and value of applying technical analysis in this context. On average, the returns obtained using TA surpassed the value invested.""*

*""There were groups of assets from each country that performed well above the portfolio average, surpassing the returns obtained using a buy and hold strategy.""*

*""In addition, our study suggests that technical analysis and fundamental analysis can complement each other.""*

As I've said before, TA is shown to give *some* statistical advantage and isn't supposed to be a fool proof system that magically predicts the future with 100% certainty. You're attacking a strawman if your retort is to point out that it doesn't **universally** lead to better results than a buy and hold strategy.

So yeah, about them mental gymnastics..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp I didn't downvote you first of all so it's a little petty to complain about that to me dont you think? But the reason you are probably getting downvoted is your inability to under stand a simple concept while trying to define it for other people like you know what you are talking about.

There are two statements being made

1) You use TA to make decisions about the future 

2)You don't use TA to make predictions 

These two statements are mutually exclusive and you claimed they weren't both statements literally can not be true at the same time.

If you take statement 1 as fact and use TA to make decisions about the future then you are using it to make predictions therefore excluding statement 2

If you take statement 2 as fact and and don't use TA to make predictions then there is no way to use it to make decisions using it therefore excluding statement 1.

It is impossible for these two to be true at the same time. It's a textbook example of mutual exclusion.

My point still stands. 50k/year as a single dude is more than enough to do anything. As I said, it depends on your life, your goals and how you manage your money. If 3500 a months, isn’t enough to pay mortgage, travel multiple times a year, own a car, and put money in investments.. you’re doing something wrong."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an example of projection.

 I can use TA to decide I'm not trading, and this has nothing to do with predicting future price action."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now this is why I'm here
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus...  That is eye opening in the way we get third person perspective into ourselves at times.  Everything besides the burger joint , you damn near defined my life and it seems so lame tome, but yea a few decades on I think I do want more than the least possible responsibility, weed, sex and other fun unsurprisingly.

I have in most ways a great career, but I've worked from home over a decade doing the EXACT same shit and I'm really kind of burnt out.  It doesn't offer anywhere to evolve besides being a business owner in the same niche aviation tech industry the company I work for founded.

I used to be in line to take over the company honestly, but I don't think I was meant to because if I think about going out and starting a new company doing the same work it sounds like something I'm not capable of and don't desire...so I imagine I wouldn't have been happy with the only promotion available even if it fell in my lap.

That said, I more than suspect though that my predilection to have the least amount of responsibility, smoke pot, party & get laid may possibly not have helped advance my career and life as shocking as this may strike you!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahahaha, every TSLA investor has my jealousy :)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"However it's not that random. People that bought at $10 aren't randomly turning around and selling at $10.01. People have borrowing costs, employees, reward targets. There are fundamentals like the government buying trillions of dollars in assets. they aren't randomly turning around and dumping that back on the market. with that in mind, the stock market is actually MORE predictable than a randomly shuffled deck of cards, because I can tell you right now, without even looking at the price, it's far more likely to go up than down, because the fed has so much as publicly stated they aren't going to let the market crash.

the people that are randomly trading don't have enough capital to move the market. the ones that do are not buying and selling at random.

TA is the same, in that it identifies areas of value in which the price is statistically more likely to move one direction vs the other, and applying risk accordingly. further more, option trading factors in things like volatility and velocity, and these 'predictions' are made based on the analysis of price action, i.e. technical analysis."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just unwilling to admit you're wrong? Your just being pedantic. Sure you can use TA to make projections but it's nearly impossible to act on theses projections without using any underlying predictions. In fact Id say it's nearly impossible to trade at all without using prediction. If you are deciding not to trade based on a projection it's because of underlying predictions you are making based on those projections.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's great, and funny, i was just referencing ""american beauty"" =)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me try this another way. The op is stating it's like card counting is like someone coming up to while you're eating an apple and asking you what's that like? You say have you ever had an orange and they respond with yes.. You say we'll they are both fruit so there you go. Sure TA and card counting might be using statistics to give yourself an edge but they are very different in the areas that matter. Sure apples and oranges are both fruit but it's not a good comparison. If you cannot understand that I don't know what to tell you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Projection: Projection is the process of displacing one’s feelings onto a different person, animal, or object. The term is most commonly used to describe defensive projection—attributing one’s own unacceptable urges to another. For example, if someone continuously bullies and ridicules a peer about his insecurities, the bully might be projecting his own struggle with self-esteem onto the other person. 

\--

I can look at the chart and say, I don't know, don't care which way the price is going, I am not trading. That's making a decision, without making a prediction. In fact, if there isn't enough data to make a prediction about future price movement, it's better I decide to do nothing. A common mistake beginning traders make, and I'm guilty of this myself, is always being a trade. No position is in fact a position.

I am not wrong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"when you say ""areas that matter"" what do you mean? making money????

are you talking about getting laid, achieving physical fitness, paying taxes, going into debt???

edit: wait, are you saying you do this for fun?????

if trading and gambling aren't about making money, you're doing it wrong, i don't know what to tell you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are wrong plain and simple. And if you think someone telling you your wrong makes you feel bullied then youre in for a rough life. 

This whole time we were talking about using technical analysis to make decisions vs using it to make predictions

You are saying that If  you look at something and there is not enough data to use your chosen method of technical analysis so you decide to not trade that you consider that  ""using technical analysis"" That's deciding to forego a trade precisely because you *can't* use your chosen form of technical analysis. That is not using TA to make a decision that's making a decision based on your inability to use the TA. 

By your logic I could say I am going to use black voodoo magic to make decisions about trading. I only make trades  based on if I can summon spirits out of their stock charts. Then when I try to do it and nothing happens. I used black magic to make my decision of not buying this stock. Obviously black magic did not have to occur in order for that decision to be reached you just based the decision on wether or not you could use it. Just like your TA did not occur if you decided not to trade due to lack of data that you need in order to do the analysis

If you use TA in any capacity you are using it to make  predictions it's baked into what TA is. Arguing that it's not has to be one of the most retarded things I can think of"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucks sake man I gave it to you in a manner a middle school kid would understand. This just inlsnt worth my time anymore so best of luck to you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an example of being condescending.

Nope, TA is not about making predictions, it's about identifying areas of value. I don't have to resort to condescension and name calling because I'm right and I know it. It's straight out of Sun Tzu, strong is weak, weak is strong. I don't think you're retarded. You can have your own ideas, it's fine. It just so happens that I'm right about this. I can look at the chart, mark of areas of value, and decide I'm not trading until the price reaches areas of value. This can be to the upside or downside, it doesn't matter."

2021-03-22 05:24:26,wallstreetbets,"DD Boomer Edition:Canadian Pacific to Merge with Kansas City Railroad. 🚂 I am autistic so I like the trains. https://www.wsj.com/articles/railroads-strike-a-25-billion-merger-11616330332

Canadian Pacific has been trying to make a major purchase of a US railroad for years that would allow them a clean path between Mexico and Canada.  They want badly to be the USMCA railroad and have been put down by regulators multiple times despite raising cash for huge companies like Norfolk Southern.

US regulators have been blocking it because their buyouts would have arguably reduced market options and railroads are the one piece of semi-public assets the US still seems to be on board with protecting.  This small $25 billion dollar deal resolves the problem because instead of picking up a major rail network Canadian Pacific brokered a deal with a short line  🩳➖railroad service.  

In this case the Kansas City Southern is a very limited route with half of it's rail in mexico and it's US rail being simple long isolated stretches rather than the web a company like Norfolk provides.  So the primary regulatory concern is gone and from an international trade standpoint this would actually be a win.

Other Factors: 

Railroads are good recovery stocks.  Supply lines and distribution are a mess with back logs right now.  Ports are backed up, raw materials are missing and Texas getting shutdown by the storm hit a number of industries in that area hard.  Rail lines provide the ability to move large amounts of freight at lower prices than any other method on the globe.  

Railways are also increasingly green technology.  They were already the most efficient transportation method on the market but the technology keeps improving and railways has lots of incentive to adapt as energy costs are one of the major factors in their profits.  This means the industry likely doesn't see any pain coming out of the Biden administration and can likely get a piece of an alleged infrastructure bill.

Boomer Points:

Railways give dividends!  Thats extra money in your pocket.  Great secure industry that isn't going anywhere.  Millennials may be afraid of 🚂 but they need trains to move 🥑🍞 and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.   Rail is secure and GROWING.  

Railways are simple and easy to understand.  People need to move things and 🚂 are 💪 alone.  

This would literally be a new transcontinental railroad just in the other direction!  It is 🚂 history in the making!

Warnings : The last two merger attempts by CP failed.  This is their third shot at an end goal of getting direct access lines tied together between the USMCA counties.  Probably the most likely to succeed but no guarantee.

Rail is slow and that makes it vulnerable to other developments in the transit market (see self driving electric trucks).  The market is strong and showing promise but needs to push it's own technology forward to remain competitive long term.  Not to say they aren't trying but the auto industry has way more Engineers.

Positions;. Currently none.  Merger was announced today.  Calls are pricey but I'm going to try to buy in early Monday.  Rail is actually beating the market anyway."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's refreshing to see DD related to other tickets besides GME AMC for a change
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been pondering this all day. Not really sure what the play here is yet - familiar with RR's and the industry but no positions currently. Not sure if I like calls or whether to buy shares of either CP or KCS.... and this could easily blow up in regulatory, but hopefully third time is the charm for CP.

(KCS ticker is KSU. Always annoys me when the SCAC doesn't match the stock ticker)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another thing to add. With Biden shutting down the pipeline a lot more natural gas is going to be loved via rail. CP is hiring a lot of folks right now (me included). As gas goes up, it'll hopefully help play a role in this."

>Millennials may be afraid of 🚂 but they need trains to move 🥑🍞 and the less millennials talk about an industry the less likely they are to try to cancel it.

Am millennial, fucking love trains. I'd go as far as to say that rail is actually quite popular with my generation because you can electrify the whole network, and even in the case of big, ugly diesel trains, they're still good because there's only a couple of hundred of them, doing the job of hundreds of thousands of trucks. If anything, I'd say millennials WANT rail to expand and improve so that public transport can improve, more freight can be taken off the roads, and the amount of planes in the air can be reduced."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How the fk are they a good recovery stock if they have already recovered

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks OP, made my own post about this, it got taken down because well, I’m a retard. I’m looking at the $230c for 3/26 and 4/1. My hesitation is that KSU hit an ATH Friday, and was up 3.67% for the week. Wondering if we are at the cliche “ sell the news” point."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"KSU is going to gap up at open, doubt we will be anywhere under 250 by the end of the day. (Deal, if it goes, puts KSU at 275 - but that won’t go through for a year or so)
I put in a limit order for some next month calls but I kinda doubt I’m gonna get them filled ahead of all the bots. 
I would not go market on those, nor on long stock. You might well end up overpaying."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I looked up some old posts on railroad forums about this and a decade ago they were just discussing a corporate agreement the merger thing is new.   It is definitely going to shareholder vote at a minimum.  I don't know shareholder attitudes so you may be right but personally as a future share holder who won't have a vote I would vote for it since it seems like a clear competitive advantage.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,CP is good anyways if you just buy shares and hold worst case what you lose no money and collect the dividend. I mean it could go down but I doubt it will.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Best of luck. They have a high turnover for a reason. If you can stick with the schedule the pension and stock options are worth while.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish there was a nation wide fast rail service with a lot of terminals. Id rather take a train than a plane.

From my place to atlanta its a 10.5 hour drive. A plane is fast but when you factor in luggage, screenings, travel to airport etc.. you start to hit 7-8 hours all said and done.

High speed rail could make the trip in about 5 hours plus overhead time, so like a 6.5 trip. Plus rail travel is much more comfortable than plane travel. Stretch those legs. Maybe 7.5 with multiple stops."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Price go up when macro economy heals
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Railroads benefit from economic recovery.  They have recovered with the market (and more so) but economic recoveries love 🚂.  Most economic recoveries mean there is a backlog of demand for products people couldn't access before.   The backlogs are extremely visible this time so it is clear and consistent revenue stream for the foreseeable future.  Picking the right railroad stock now means figuring out who has an advantage that earns more market share.

It potentially helps CP on terms of profit because they would provide a unique single shot service from Canada to Mexico.  Of course they could just keep profit margins relatively similar and seek to aggressively grow revenue if they wanted to be more like the millennial stocks and drop boomer status."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh highway transit is the simplest thing to program and trucking is the industry that benefits most from it.  They will put guidance sensors on the roads of they need too.  10 years sounds reasonable for the start of elimating drivers but regardless of who is right trains are safe for quite a while.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hydrogen seems more likely.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has to pass the surface transit board and that’s extremely tough after all of the mergers in the late 80’s and early 90’s when rail traffic came to a halt. I’m torn on this because I think BNSF and UP push very very hard against this, as this would be fucking up their Mexico business."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a pretty rough gig to be honest. Very union and the schedule is pretty hard if you're gonna do the running trade thing. Maybe maintenance would be better but they are a pretty old school company.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All of the railroads are pretty shitty to work for. If your going into a trade- TE&Y, track, and/or car/locomotive it’s tough because you can be furloughed at any given time. If you work in management, particularly operations/track prepare to have no life at all. I’m glad I got out when I did, my friends who weren’t so lucky are currently working 12 on and 2 off. They even had to forgo a weeks pay earlier this year. The railroads don’t seem to get that yes cutting costs are great, but you have to modernize their yard and facilities (some of these facilities were built in the 1900’s) and take care of your employees."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Recovery stocks are referred to stocks that have yet to recover to pre crash prices. That's why it's called recovery play because they present a better opportunity for big gains.

Alberta Premier (who is a douchebag) is promoting this as a way to transport Alberta oil to gulf refineries in an unobstructed manner."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its the battery and infrastructure. Trucks can't sit 8 hours to charge a 500kWh battery every 500 miles which means exchange pack is the only option. That means industry-wide compulsive standardization of pack size, connectors, capacities and swap methods (which means limited mounting options).  
  
So who is going to be liable for that $50,000 battery pack if it is found defective on exchange? The truck owner? The Service station? The Line company? Insurance? ""Hey, you know that pack you just swapped last week in just outside Oklahoma City? Well I know you're in New York but you have to either come give us a good pack or pay us $50,000 core fee. Thanks""
  
Who is going to cover the $2m+ inventory of swap batteries every highway service station will have to stock?  
  
How are we going to get the thousands of kWh to each station every day needed to recharge those packs? Where is that energy going to come from?  
  
For OTR trucking to go full-electric will require complete cooperation between ALL vehicle companies, complete cooperation between ALL service stations, complete overhaul of the power grid and billions of dollars investment.

2021-03-22 05:19:47,wallstreetbets,"some DD on MRO, its not perfect and I might even suck at it..... But it does come with a few Facts.... Marathon Oil (MRO)   

Marathon Oil (MRO)

In recent trends I have noticed the huge ups and downs with the Big Oil Companies. Only 2 within the energy sector stand out. The main one that I find that still has plenty of value you is MRO and it is flush with cash. Presently MRO has 742 Million cash on hand and pays a reasonable dividend.

If you compare this to COP or CONOCO-PHILLIPS, MRO / Marathon is cheap and actually oversold. It is true the Marathon Oil has a main office in Findlay, Ohio and that is about 45 minutes from me. So, I am all for the local people. It is also true that in 2019 that MRO was over $20.00 a share. 

And I quote as far as cash is concerned 

“The latest balance sheet data shows that Marathon Oil had liabilities of US$1.07b due within a year, and liabilities of US$6.33b falling due after that. Offsetting this, it had US$522.0m in cash and US$620.0m in receivables that were due within 12 months. So, its liabilities total US$6.25b more than the combination of its cash and short-term receivables.” (Simply Wall St 2020). 

This will improve by years end as MRO and the entire sector has seen increase in the price per barrel Brent Sea Crude as high as 70.00 a barrel. It is expected that Oil will be closer to $80.00 a barrel by the end of Summer as people are tired of the hole BS Covid thing and have decided to just get out and go. Presently Brent Sea Crude is trading at about $63.00 a barrel. As I previously said this will ultimately increase profits for MRO (Marathon). But presently MRO last traded at 11.02 a share and I have seen a lot of activity for April 09th Call options with a strike price of $14.00 a share, and at that level the Implied Volatility is around 77%, meaning it can either got to $14 a share of go to $0.

Also, and I hate to say this but Neal Dingmann at Truist Financial has his price target at $15.00 a share. If I were to follow him. It would reinforce my theory that MRO is not only a Value play, but WAY OVER SOLD!!! I know you APE will down vote this as you always do. So, it is expected, but half of you apes will end up going out and buying shares after down voting it. But facts are facts and if I read everything correctly MRO(Marathon) had a 40% upside earnings surprise. Also, as I quote “Based on its pre-COVID enterprise value to PV-10 premium, MRO shares might have more than 30% upside given where WTI stands today.” (Seeking Alpha as of 19 March 2021). It seems the shorts/bears want this want at $10.00 a share and the short interest is only about 6% of the total shares outstanding. Just remember I look for cheap STONKS that are oversold and are flush with Tendies$$$$$. I am not telling you to buy anything, and I do not work for MRO, and this is not advice. I will add that the MAE(Moving Average Envelope) is showing an upward trend in the chart. So do your own DD, like I did, and on what little free time I have and take a look for yourself. I don’t claim to know shyte! I do know cheap, and I do like $$$GAINZ. Also, I will add this, if somehow magically MRO gets to $15.00 a share by the 1st of April, I will eat a wrecking ball pepper and show proof via video. So, I dare you all to watch my pain if that happens…."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought MRO at 4 dollars last March. The easy money in oil is over.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I would argue that Marathon's positions are weak and they are not the best driller of the North American oil companies but I am in agreement that Oil will be around $80 by Q2-Q3. Summer driving season will crush all supplies that we have and currently the deficit is at 2-3MMBOPD undersupplied. This time delta between production of oil and use of oil will cause the price to skyrocket.

They then ate their words. I am not a super guru. I do this for a hobby. But more times than not I do not miss. I might not be able to explain things well sometimes. But I know DFV when I see it and this again is at DFV now more than ever.

I might even keep buying passed that. This is not about a short term gain.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oil to me seems very precarious as of the next two months, it’s hinging on the fact that OPEC doesn’t increase production, even though they (like everyone else) are absolutely bleeding money. They promised to cull production until an unspecified point in April but each day of reduced demand weighs on that timeline hard. It also is banking on the idea that Iran and Russia, who are both in financial trouble, don’t capitalize on the reduction in oil production from OPEC and flood the market. Iran is already doing it by dumping oil into China, which is suspected to see 90% of the future growth in oil demand over the next year. 

Russia said they would abide by a gentlemen’s agreement and reduce production, but now with President Biden going after Putin and most likely sanctions going into place due to the Navalny Affair, anything is fair game, especially if Russia can profit, negate sanctions, and hurt the US while having a valid excuse to do so (and making us the bad guys in the situation). 

Aside from that, a third wave of COVID is rampaging through Europe and more lockdowns are going into place throughout many of the countries there, with a laundry list of countries shutting everything (or some things) down until it subsides, yet again. With those shutdowns demand will be driven lower until the lockdowns can cease, at which point the only problem will be the forced supply reduction, which again, will not last long. Do not think oil is a great play until all of that begins to resolve."

You do need to understand how well the business is doing and whether they will be filing Chapter 11 (reorganization) or Chapter 7 (bankruptcy/liquidation), which Marathon has done in the past.

$GME -25% 3/19 EOW

# Rambling OPINION PIECE, skip if you just want the calculator

It's been two weeks with over 70% correlation between gamma and price. Can we now all agree that not withstanding all the other theories such as RH internalizing orders, citadel writing naked options, DTCC about to audit fake shares, 3/23 earnings blowout, VR+e-sports transformation,  shorts over 100%; Gamma has been the main factor of the week to week price movement these past few weeks. I'm not saying those other theories are untrue, but they don't provide actionable intelligence for 🦍🦍🦍 to trade besides HODL, which at 0.7% shorts borrow rate might take a looong time. Furthermore, when institutions/whales do a short squeeze, they usually follow it up with recalling their loaned up shares, like what /u/MartinShkreli did with $KBIO, though he was able to do this effectively because he had control of >50% float thus able to coordinate the timing.

Some important points

1. Gamma/Delta goes both ways, it can amplify upward momentum but can also accelerate a downward spiral.
2. Delta Hedging is a continuous process. The moment you bought an option, within minutes MM bots will start delta hedging your options.   They don't suddenly start to buy the hedge only when nearing ITM or Friday's close.
3. Buying options at specific strikes and expiries can give you 4-10X amount of share buying amplification compared to buying shares directly due to MMs delta hedging by buying the underlying shares. You may not need to buy options to trigger a gamma squeeze, provided the OI already supports it, a small price increment might be enough to tip it over.
4. Yes the IV is damn high at +300%, highest in the market in fact,  making ATM and near OTM very expensive, but  that doesn't mean it can't go higher. Ideally for a gamma squeeze we should start with low IV and ladder it up, however you play with the cards your dealt with. Ms Alexis Goldstein / u/dontfightthevol testified in congress that option probably contributed to most of the volatility [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what\_was\_the\_footprint\_of\_institutional\_trading/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m7h6uv/what_was_the_footprint_of_institutional_trading/)
5. Short Hedgies are using PUTS to short $GME, PUT/CALL ratio increase almost 10x on long dated expiries. Hedgies love to short because in trading as in life, failures occur much more frequently then successes. Thus it is way easier for hedgies to instigate a business collapse by publishing negative press, influencing creditors, and launching frivolous lawsuits against a business rather than trying to create success.
6. Make no mistake, this is a battle. It doesn't matter at this point if on earnings 3/23 GME announce new VR tech with e-sports or all 5,509 GameStop stores were to somehow spontaneously combust. All that matters is the buying vs selling amount and the max pain each side is willing to tolerate

I believe if 🦍🦍🦍 understand the mechanics of a play, they would be more willing to commit their hard earned   🍌 to it, 🦍🦍🦍 together  💪 , 🦍🦍🦍 + 🧠 = mega  🍌🍌 🍌

# $GME Gamma Squeeze Calculator v8

This update contains a graph generator to visualize the total delta hedging vs underlying price and/or time decay, ***it includes 3,143 $GME options chain OI(Open Interest) up to 1/20/23 based on 3/19 closing data***. It aims to make a free retarded excel version of a Total Delta/Gamma Visualizer, frequently used by institutional traders

The calculator calculates the net buy/sell needed to be performed by MMs given certain price movement and time assumptions. There are 5 sheets with the input parameters color coded in peach orange. Parameters include

* Current Price
* Projected Price
* Time to Projected Price (The time in days you forecast the projected price will occur)
* Net MM%(to estimate how many % of the sold calls are written by MMs excluding covered calls/puts and theta gang spreads)
* Strike and Expiry filter to include/exclude option chains based on strike price and date

The new graph simulator graph has the following controls

https://preview.redd.it/s8fpj8ao8ho61.jpg?width=893&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bfd4cb30cb991751927cff5bfcadb601d2f6586e

That allows you to visualize the total hedge graph vs price in constant time, so you can have an overall view what the total MM delta hedging is on different price levels based on current options OI. Clicking the simulate price button would generate the graph below.

https://preview.redd.it/g7k5b0np8ho61.jpg?width=984&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c33983b49fe86702be4f41f95708aa23978e138a

From the above we can glean information on how price effects total delta hedging, The call options generate positive delta hedge, while 🌈🐻 buying puts adds negative delta hedge. The total delta hedge converge with the puts delta hedge as price goes lower and vice versa converge with the calls delta hedge as price goes higher. It can be observed that If the price drops below $85, MMs will be net short, and further moves downward will be greatly amplified by the puts delta hedging. Thus the $85 is a level that theoretically should be defended by longs.

By clicking the simulate time button, the simulator can also show the total hedge vs time decay in days in constant price

https://preview.redd.it/zj8gtxdr8ho61.jpg?width=910&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d278ba91a635a44a91cd209cb7d93b03bdc2571

From the graph, due to the current structure of $GME options OI, at its natural theta(time component of option greeks) decaying state, there will be a net SELL of stocks by MMs if price remains the same, leading to a downward pressure on the price. This decay is particular to High IV stocks with an option chain OI concentration of strikes above the current share price like $GME. There'll also be a significant drop as it passes the monthly expiry in 4/16, where a lot of options expire.

To find witch strikes and expiries are responsible for the largest delta hedged shares, go to the OI sheet and click sort by hedge

https://preview.redd.it/4bwwm5os8ho61.jpg?width=1317&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c43f3a8aa8568ebace2de5f1fdf4e9cd114072a

To find the biggest shorts delta, sort by hedge from smallest

You can use the index2 field to return the original sort order(strikes & expiries).

To model what would happen if specific strikes and expiries increases in OI(Open Interest), go to the OI sheet and sort by amp factor.

https://preview.redd.it/0dyp87px8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fc5d8d545b179f9c790de3746f74bc3dd3b0a448

change the 445C 3/26 New OI from 67 to 10,067

https://preview.redd.it/5rxsyndz8ho61.jpg?width=1188&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6819b829b398d0244959845fa7914c9aa9fcfde4

You'll see the from the diff column, that 10,000 x 3.38 x(100 per contract) = 3.38 MM USD buy would trigger 106,620 net share buying by delta h\\edging MMs or about 21.3MM USD, giving amplification factor of 5.4X. If price were to rise, this amp factor would climb further due to positive gamma. Changes in the OI sheet will be reflected back in the Total Delta Hedge on the Cover Sheet and the Graphs. For the Graphs you'll need to run the simulation again to get updated results.

On the topic of IV too high, as $GME currently has the highest IV in the market and about MMs ripping you off; Well it's actually a bit more nuanced then that. Here's a graph for Gamma Delta vs IV , assuming $200 underlying and 7 DTE. You can find it in the Delta/Gamma sheet of the excel macro. Use that sheet template to model Delta vs Gamma for different strikes and expiries.

Gamma is not linear, depends on the underlying price and IV

&#x200B;

# Obligatory harebrained scheme

If all 🦍🦍🦍 understand delta hedging/gamma, then a play like the following would be doable.

*Disclaimer : I'm not actually telling 🦍🦍🦍 to do this, it's more of a what if scenario of what would happen if 🦍 did, as many users have pointed out that according to the media this may amount to market manipulation, and market manipulation is illegal if done by retail plebs, mkay... Only hedgies are allowed to do stuff like this and naked short a company to oblivion.*

For this gamma play to work, the large short interest still needs to be true, then If you all can  💎🤲 , I suggest 🦍🦍🦍 wait until IV drops down a bit to <200%. So that the ATM and near OTM options will be a lot more affordable. When IV drops to below 200%, 🦍🦍🦍 can start building the ATM to NEAR OTM ladder, optimizing our strikes/expiries using the calculator. Why not just randomly pick near OTM price you ask ? $GME option chain have been so volatile that there were huge discrepancies in theoretical delta vs actual delta between the strikes.

Summarizing, the steps are

1. 💎🤲  your shares, because it's likely to drop next week
2. Wait for IV <200%
3. Use the calculator to calculate best ITM,ATM, near OTM strikes(depending on your risk tolerance) with largest delta/price ratio
4. Someone ~~post a call to action~~  do a Tarzan yell, if up vote is over the threshold buy amount needed, everybody goes all in, if not then better wait for another opportunity, no sense in wasting 🍌🍌🍌s. It takes ~~teamwork~~   *🦍🦍🦍* together or the play won't work
5. Watch price goes up end of week
6. Defend it by buying shares on Friday 2.45 PM, just ignore all the earlier price movement on that day and instead concentrate on the close, This is when MMs try to fix price to avoid max pain
7. Exercise if you have capital or if not, roll those calls to higher strikes
8. Witness short hedgies cry
9. Rinse and repeat for the following week, until the entire financial system collapse
10. Profit !!!

Edit 1 : To be clear, the calc is saying gamma decrease next week, In the excel macro change projected price to 200 and projected days to 2(Monday from friday), you'll see a net sell of shares by MMS. I didn't want have the default template parameters to show red, cuz u know, morale."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How hard is it to just hold your shares and be patient? Friendly reminder. Hold. Be patient. That is all anyone has to do. Nothing else
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Anyone reading this should note that buying OTM options is a fool's errand. IV crush and manipulation will more than likely cause your options to land out of the money.**

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not about playing options. It’s pointless for beginner investors to play options. A gamma squeeze can cause a short squeeze and a short squeeze can cause a gamma. But no ones has enough money to buy a bunch of calls. Nor would I want to risk the money any more. Lost 3k on a 300c. It hit 295 and crashed to 202. Not worth the risk. Buy shares and hold if you want. Save options for deep pockets

For the price action, what do you think would be the effects of lowering IV?

I'm picturing high IV Gamma being more wide and low IV gamma being more narrow. Considering those far otm puts are negative delta and a lot of calls are itm do you think we might get a little positive price action as IV drops, until we go back to the squeeze?"

We're all individuals here, we all make our own choices, we can't be confident that anyone else is actually going to make this play.  Since that is the case, is it really market manipulation?

What IS market manipulation is flooding the market with a huge amount of shares sold at once, forcing many triggered stop losses to sell far below their intended stop loss sell point to drive the price even lower.  That sounds like market manipulation to me, when one single individual (or entity) holds enough power to break the market and so they do, all for their own gain.  We're individuals making our own choices.  A hedge fund is an entity with one singular goal of taking as much money from others in the market, and the capital behind it to force it to happen.  One side isn't even close to manipulating anything."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but that is just plain wrong.

Let's take today's price for $200 C expiring March 26th.

Currently the price for that option is $27.75.

It already dropped 17.5% today vs 2.02% for shares.

#Literally NO ONE should be buying any options. Your premiums go to MM like shitadel and only help them.

If by the end of the week the stock is still around $200 you have not lost anything. But with options you lose that premium and hence wasted $2775   needlessly.

The stock trades flat/sideways and you lose a significant amount.

As for waiting for the IV to drop...well that's going to happen when everything is said and done.

It's 360% currently for that strike price...it will be under 100% once the ship has sailed.

So basically you miss out if you are waiting for that day to arrive."

With options you could control those same amount of shares for much less $. The 150c has a delta of .82 for a premium of 60.48 so for 6048x3x100= 18,144 you could control .82*100*3=246 shares.

With SMART option buying we can greatly influence the price, ofc if you don't understand options or feel more comfortable with shares then just stick with shares.

It's the way far out of the money options that don't help a single bit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the way, I like the stock. That's why I own it and don't share your shares hold itttttt"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you don't pose it as a question I won't tell you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I know how options work retard.  I've made a ton of money with them.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,NO ONE CARES ABOUT A SINGLE VIOLIN
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And how far will the price fall oh wise one?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, seeing as this is literally just a bunch of random people on the internet in a reddit forum - it's kinda hard to legally make any case of a coordinated effort. where's the ""group""? Who the hell do you charge? OP for making some excel spreadsheets and giving out his opinion for free, or 100,000 people that follow though (likely without saying anything about doing so). In the hypothetical scenario where this worked of course."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since we can't know everybody's individual actions, each actor is effectively gambling that others will do the same. We can check the options chain to verify whether we think people are actually doing this, but both the options chain and this subreddit are public information, just like a news channel spreading GME fud. Is it actually happening? Would people bother following it? You have the data and the decisions to make, if you've got the capital"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not illegal. These questions where already asked in the first run up and the second one.

The SEC isn't going go after 9 million people talking on an internet forum."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lie to her and say you sold and put the $$ into a much safer stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Get her a new bf to keep her busy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boss makes a dollar, you make a dime, and that's why you always... Poop on company time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Completely agree with you! 

Just saying... If I'm prepared to hold onto something like that for a year or two GME for X amount of days/weeks/months shouldn't be an issue.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
💎👊💎👊💎"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"this is wallstreetbets not gme, we've got 9.6m people here, 6m of which joined during the GME spike"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mixing options and GME is a good way to lose money. You know how you can avoid this? Just buy the stock and hold.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">If you don't pose it as a question I won't tell you.



I'll be honest Chief...I have no idea where you are going with that line...

My comment was intended as a statement not a question...so...yeah..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Easy there you badass you!

Let's not get too worked up. Take a deep breath in and slowly let it out.

Now repeat this slowly again and again

>#Buying Options when the IV is so high is dumb. I u/Flfhead am not dumb. I am a smart boy.

Just do that whenever you start to get angry."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My ape chill out, sit on a banana"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"how should he know. he just indicated past trends for what happened, not how much"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Like bilderberg trilateral lunches etc
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly! It's not illegal market manipulation if all you're really doing is speculating that enough people are as retarded as you are. OP is true autist.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"She's wanting this to pan out as well.  The money is important to her.  She hasn't seen her daughter in 4 years and this is supposed to fund the trip home and everything.  She was hoping by April, but will wait until October if she has to.  Her kid's next birthday is in November."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's easily 7m
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,During the first spike. You can't assume they are all either here or invested in gme that's why I used gme numbers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this not wallstreetBETS??
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know edit: person ...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, nobody said to buy when IV is high.

And fuck off, retard.  Only my wife's boyfriend gets to tell me what to do."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not anymore.  The only people making any sense here these days get downvoted to oblivion.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair point. I support options betting for all other securities besides GME. Hedge funds are making a killing through options writing at the expensive of retail traders. It's in their best interest for retail investors to speculate through options. They write them, collect the premium, drive the price OTM, option expires worthless, retail investors lose money, repeat cycle."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps if you were more chill your wife's boyfriend might let you watch.

*PS: He said you are running low on salsa dip.*"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, and fuck you! What was your peak?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Paying more taxes each year just means you made more money! Good job!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats and fuck you.
You just joined the big whale retards club"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got inspired by another guy posting his yearly gains. No withdrawals and 1000+ trades, mostly CSPs, CCs, and long debit spreads. I was down 50% at the lowest trough in March.

Edit: I'm gonna add some more details here- I used a lot of margin which is how I was able to make these kinds of gains. You can sell CSPs on Robinhood without paying interest on collateral (until you are assigned), not sure if this is industry standard. My actual starting principal was around 95k at the beginning of the year and my P/L hit almost -50% at one point in March, this graph is the gain from close to my lowest point to now without any additional deposits/withdrawals."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,February sucked eh?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are your gains mostly on collecting premiums
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I need to send my money to some of y'all and let you invest for me....I need to know how to make these kinda figures....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your cheat code?? Steady gains like that for a year?? Mine looks like that but opposite
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice f u man. I started investing a year ago, similar account to yours. I’ve put in a total of 55k and peaked at 340, down to 290 now tho."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gave me a semi banana chub!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"so if i lost 11k on amazon but then gained 14k on gme stock...

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a gain if you sold right?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice parabolic curve there. 
You must have experienced a little God complex here and there. 
Hehe - I’ve been doing this a long time and I know how years like that feel. 
Anyhow, if I were to post a chart of my gains you would see a slightly more tame 45* angle (up and to the right, of course) with a slight curve (dip in the middle). 
Congratulations on your year...now, do it again."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Under 400k from capitol gains. What's your overall income like? You'll probably end up keeping more than you would have normally when compared to the last 5 years.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question,  on that amount what would be the tax?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uncle Sammy thanks you for your financial prowess. You have now adopted 75 WSB 🦍🦍🦍 with your contributions (through stimmy checks, did the math)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a $25 HR Block coupon you can have. Taxes offset with coupon savings.. You are welcome.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's awesome! Could we get a gist of where you started and how you got there?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How are stock gains taxed in the US? Flat tax or tax bracket depending on total income?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,you have a free stock why not use it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A balanced portfolio? What is this, r/investing??"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait to pay taxes as long as possible, I keep hearing they may move the date again"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder how much Americans pay taxes for $100k of gains? Approx
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not done yet!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,how much taxes do you have to pay in the US?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You were this close,  just 1%"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did u start the year with?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can spam I can spam

This is bigger than we can even fathom even what I have conjured in my retarded brain now. Pretty much any bets group and any sub focused on a specific investment choice ex: gamestop, phys met, crippy, weed all have like 44k+ members and no post is getting over the threshold of reaching the all. Every sub has the potential of making every post go all, but are Bing downvoted as hard core as possible. Only people that barely win the tug of war are people that are popular.

Conclusion: I believe the application is compromised. Wallstreet doesn't want us banding together on anything. Anything at all. And any of the category could be the catalyst with enough influence.

Response: I'm willing to offer transparency with anyone that shares my view. Find me on fb messenger. Kyle Chandler (not the actor or football player). We can start there and figure out where to go.

My views: I'm holding gamestop and converting people along the way. I'm doing other things I can't say here because of censorship (another prime example of us being controlled)

You have the fucking secret to life right here. Please fellow apes if you don't understand this chapter, go back and study the shit you skipped.

Their positions matter somewhat. Yes they can move the price and even flash crash it with what they have. No they cannot get it under the bottom AND the bottom gets higher with OUR short position. That's why they want to know our numbers. Thats why they want us to forget about gme. 

Their shirt positions can be settled behind doors with smoke and mirrors. Maybe they delay the inevitable, but it is inevitable.

Before this passed by mainstream media. Before the sheep decided it was time to bankrupt ws with the apes. Before hedgicide was the thing, they had the ability to keep this thing under the price of a night at McDonald's. 

After our short percentage passed 50 percent they weren't able to get it under 50. 

Now they can't seem to budge 200.

What happens when the people we ramble on to in the real world decide to just get one?"

You can sell CSPs on robinhood with margin and not pay interest on collateral, so you don't need as much capital as you think assuming you're willing to risk using margin. Fun fact I did get margin called in March at one point so I was forced to close a few positions I didn't want to."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">One of the biggest barriers to selling options is that you need a pretty decent amount of capital to start with unless you just do spreads since CSPs are pretty intensive and CC's you have to own the stock.

This is just incorrect, you can start with little capital and still build your portfolio.

You don't have to aim for your Nvidia priced stocks there are plenty of smalls out there to work with. And tasty trade has their own smalls indexs to help people with lower accounts.

Also the main thing you need to think about when entering a position is buying power reduction.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"ngl that article has confused me for a long time and I even emailed RH support several times to try and clarify, but it seems to me you can use it without being charged. I have had instances where my account value was equal to my equity value and then on top of that I had 50k+ in options collateral and it still said I was using 0 margin. Even right now I have like 415k equity value - 335k account value = 80k in margin used, but I also have 20k in options collateral from a CSP.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Market crashed super fucking hard last year. Like 40-50 dollae stocks to 9-10 dollars.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a common misconception. Overtime is 50% more per hour, but there is more to it than that. If your regular rate is $20 an hour, and you work some overtime, you will get paid $30 an hour that you wouldn't otherwise have. If the taxes go from 16% to 28% (I believe those were the numbers you used in another comment), you are still making 72% of $30 an hour (ignoring FICA), which would be $21.6 an hour. $20 an hour minus a 16% tax is $16.8 an hour, so you would still be making 28.6% more than your regular take home pay. If you only worked that overtime for one or two pay periods of the year, you would be getting most of that extra withholding back on your tax refund too, as you pointed out in another comment. If you work enough overtime throughout the year to raise your income by a significant amount, you will also still benefit from working overtime, as the tax rates are progressive. When you move up a bracket, you are only paying increased taxes on the money you earned that falls into that bracket. The lower brackets are still taxed at the same rate. 


There are very few possible situations where working overtime would actually decrease your take home pay for the pay period, but if you can provide an actual example I would love to see it. 


Lastly, using relative numbers like ""taxes increase 60%"" is misleading. To use an extreme example, let's say I go from earning $10k a year to $20k. My taxes go from 1% to 10%, a 900% increase. My salary only had a 100% increase, so does that mean I'm losing money? Of course not. 10% of $20k is $2k, so I am still making much more than I otherwise would. This example is not counting the fact that the first $10k would still be taxed at 1%, making my tax increase only $1k and my take home pay would be $19k. My additional income amounted to a 90% increase in pay, even after a 900% increase in taxes. The tax rates in my example are actually higher than the federal tax rates for the brackets I was discussing as well, considering there is a standard deduction of $12k and the bottom bracket is 10%."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> there is a point where making more money isn't worth the time

i agree with that for sure

>perhaps you live in a low/no income tax state?

this is true. i never even really considered it in terms of state taxes. i always looked at the federal tax brackets and knew that even *if* the overtime bumped us into the next bracket, the taxes on that income aren't enough to cancel it out. anyway our state taxes are very low. 

where do you see that california's state income tax goes up to 60%?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't that be a Credit spread since you're collecting a premium the same way you would with a CC?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aah ok I get it, I just wasn't familiar with the specific term/abbreviation, thanks!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wheel trading, basically instead of buying options, you sell them to collect the premium. So you sell puts until eventually some of them expire ITM and get exercised, at which point you (have to) buy the stock, then you sell calls on that stock until those calls end ITM and you (have to) sell it, then you go back to selling puts etc.

After I managed to lose a good 10k+ gambling on options (admittedly with no idea what I was doing) I started to read up on strategies, figured I'd try this one out and, at least so far, it has shown me more green than buying options ever did.

Of course it's not the patented WSB yolo, so it's not going to make you rich or bankrupt you overnight, but... you know... I kinda like not losing all my money gambling.

It doesn't cancel it out, and the more I think about it, I believe I remember the withholdings more than what I actually paid, but it was certainly enough that I avoided working overtime for years until I learned you can adjust the withholding to whatever you want."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's true that you can lose (almost) as much money selling puts as just outright owning the stock, but the way I see it, if I have the choice right now between buying the stock and assuming that risk or selling a lower put and assuming a slightly lower risk (due to getting the stock at a cheaper price than right now and getting a premium, both of which reduce the sting somewhat), but also with a decent chance to just keep the premium, I'll take the latter, unless I have good reason to assume the stock is going to rocket up.

In either case between those two options, if the stock tanks hard I'm a bag holder either way, but less of one if I just sold the put (plus selling puts allows me to roll down or out if need be to try and salvage the situation).

That's, after all, why you diversify and don't trade money you need to survive, if one or two stocks tank you can just wait it out, that's just not possible as an options buyer."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well over the past year you’d be better off owning stock than selling a put on pretty much any company. You’d also get the benefit of long term capital gains and less trading fees. Much superior gains. Yes it’s less risk but historically it’s been better to hold stock than sell puts even on a risk adjusted basis

Edit: fixed a word"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a fair point, and I am holding a fair amount of stock (although I still sell calls on that, I'm not married to any of those stocks and if I end up losing out on a small amount of gain on an exercised call that's generally more than made up for by the premiums collected up to that point, why just collect dividend if you might as well collect dividend + premiums), I just try to avoid buying into most stocks by way other than sold puts."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for your service.. ""unzips"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nok is a long term investment if you look at their future prospects.I ended up getting it high as well but averaged my price out and 6 months from now it’ll be a different story .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmaooooooo this is not the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof. I wish you the best of luck and that all your other positions are quite green and tendie machines.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There were plenty of decent options and you chose NOK...

You were better off going to a casino and just playing slots."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only thing you held was somebody's bag lmfao.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How long have you held this?  $1.47 for a $6 call is insane unless you've been sitting on it for a while.

Edit:  looking at the option chain, there are **ITM** calls in **2023** that are cheaper than what you paid."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon lunch sounds delicious.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You bought 105 $7 calls on Nokia for $1.47?

**Are you retarded?**"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sorry man this was one of the FUD, cut your losses and buy GME or AMC, all other stocks aren’t the highly shorted meme stock"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I still have Jan 2022 options. Better hold shares on NOK though.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He thinks he's holding the line when he doesn't even own the stock lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂never understood how NOK got pushed in with the short squeeze. You were hustled into buying a boomer stock. There was never any huge short interest even during the pandemic. In other words buddy there was never any line to hold to begin with😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Game over. Please deposit $15k
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, if you have Level 3 options you can sell someone else 105 $6.50 or $7 calls (turns into vertical spread) and recoup a few hundred $ of that more than likely 🤷‍♂️

But yeah. ouch. might just want to cut it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling puts on Nokia will print. Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wait people are still holding NOK?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The loss porn is beautiful 😻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What smooth brained fuck would invest in Nokia but not AMC and GME? You have to diversify your meme stocks dummy.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, I thought I stretched buying some 4.50 calls. Yikes."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, there was no needs to buy NOK, you should have put money into GME. 

NOK was just another try at getting people to not buy more GME and you fell for it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Should I show him my puts that printed?

2021-03-22 04:21:43,wallstreetbets,"$FSR is worth $0 a share This stock will fly again due to hype, but it's a $0 company.  My current thesis is they never actually mass produce a car.

Firstly, their projections are to start production in Q4 2022.  Think about that for a minute.  It'll be late Q1 2023 before they plan to ship a car.  And that's IF everything goes to plan.  By then, GM, VW, Tesla, Ford, Volvo, Honda, Toyota, Lucid, and others will have a two year head start on actually delivering EVs.  By then there's no reason for someone to wait 24 months for a car.  People did it for Tesla's because they were the only game in town, but they won't do it for a Fisker.

Second, the CEO is a huge liability.  He already made decisions that ran the exact same type of company into the ground.  This does not bode well for long term success.  Yes, it could be a one off due to failed battery packs, but who approved their use?   Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean.  And where?  At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory.  You remember the one?  [https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump](https://www.theverge.com/21507966/foxconn-empty-factories-wisconsin-jobs-loophole-trump)  .  This does not show me that he's improved his decision making.

Third, price.  If they can deliver on what they are promising I will be amazed.  A 300 mile range EV with a solar roof, and full vegan interior for $37,000.  I may be wrong, but I just don't see it.  They have no proprietary tech, so will be getting all the internals from other manufacturers, but can somehow undercut their prices?  That's a leap of faith.  Faith that hasn't been earned.

Fourth, volume.  They will need to stand up an entire after sales support network (repair shops, trained repair techs, replacement parts, distribution, etc.) for a brand new car line.  In every country they plan to sell to.  You need huge volume to justify this.  Even Tesla is having problems getting people timely repairs to their cars.  How long will that solar roof last after the first hail storm?  Or the first drive behind a dump truck with unsecured gravel in the back?  Who's going to repair it?  How much will it cost?  How long will it take to get the parts?

Fifth, design.  A small concern, I know but I am thinking that by the time they ship a car their design will be outdated.  I think the car looks great now, but so does everyone else's.  And design tastes will change in the next two years.  Can they afford a design refresh before they even ship a car?

Finally, they have no real differentiator.  There's no reason to buy a Fisker over any other EV that will be out ahead of them.

I see canceled pre-orders, manufacturing troubles, regulatory hurdles, and ultimately a failed endeavor without anything to show for it.  Man, I hope I'm wrong, but the more I thought about it the more it didn't make sense.

WSB DD perfectly balanced...as it's intended"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FSR could be a winner. It could be a loser. It's a pre revenue company trading at a cheap price compared to its competitors. I wouldn't nessisarily bet on them becoming a popular brand , but with their cash position and contracts in place with reputable companies like Magna and Foxconn , I would bet on them atleast bringing a car to market which will shoot the price of the stock up substantially. After that whether the public likes it or not is another story. Magna and Foxconn are great companies that I don't see screwing this up. Either way a rise from here is easy."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. Cancelled preorders are free money. 

2. The mistake Fisker made last time was using only one sole battery manufacturer that went tits up. Now they have agreements with multiple manufacturers. 

3. The Foxconn manufacturing plants could be in Mexico and not Wisconsin. 

4. Project Pear hasn’t been revealed yet. The Ocean is the cash cow due to great leasing program residuals and a home run suv design, but the 🍐could change everything. 

It’s too early to count them out yet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fsr has about 1B in cash and a float of 95.65M that puts it at 10.40 a share. Can’t say it’s worth zero as stated there sparky

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in since it was the old SPAC ticker....I could see them occupying a niche space. I'm not adding nor am I selling.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My only experience with fisker is when james may reviewed the fisker karma on top gear. The most interesting part of that episode was when he ditched the karma to test drive brian johnson’s older car.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing is very clear - most of these startups will not make it and will go bankrupt.  It’s super hard to build a car and make a profit to sustain a business.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you that having zero cashflow really does make them worth exactly $0. Still, the fact that they trade is a sign not of faith but of perhaps hope and you can't beat human hope. What you can do though is sell it; you're on the wrong end, sell them ridiculous naked calls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are correct ,, but will the stock price decline further? I see lots of money losers at all time highs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">Oh, and they just announced a partnership with Foxconn to build their next car after the Ocean. And where? At the (in)famous Wisconsin factory. You remember the one?

It'll be ironic if after all the shit-talking about the Wisconsin facility, Foxconn builds out a huge US car manufacturing facility there so they can be the manufacturer for the Apple iCar in 2025 or whenever it's planned to come out.  

It's a little odd that they're randomly getting into the EV space, so I wouldn't be surprised if that was the reason - and as far as I know Apple plans to manufacture those in the US. Fisker saying this just bolsters that theory, even though I agree Fisker is a flimsy company."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A while back I bought calls in FSR and told my wife, they have a picture of a cute SUV on their website and that is enough for the stock to go up. I sold them for a small profit (they were going to expire that Friday so was time to get out... had I waited till that Friday, that was the Friday they shot up... would have made $90k).

In any case, I agree the company is not worth more then their cash on hand. The issue is the market is not rational when it comes to EV companies. Everyone is looking for the next Tesla. FSR can trade high for longer then your options go."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Short it at your peril. In a fraudulent economy anything can happen
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Those puts are too early even if you said all those things can happen. We won't know how things go until months from now.   They have 2 years to deliver a car.  They aren't going to announce they are gonna have delays two years early.  Maybe when it's 6 months left and it's clear they can't deliver they'll announce it then.  I agree I don't think they can deliver 37k with 300 miles with a solar roof. Sounds like they are going batteries are going to be way cheaper in 2 years.  Long puts sounds good though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Has no one else connected the Fisker-Foxconn-Apple to project pear and apple car?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d like a little more info on this DD - a smoothbrain like me needs help -opinions I can get anywhere.

That said - their partnership with Magna is what seals a small position in my portfolio. That company is able, right now, to build an EV with no help from outside. They are basically the FOXCONN of the automobile world.

This is a Magna car - being sold by a separate sales company, FSR."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not just FSR, there are few EV startups that I would class under fraud category. They saw the EV boom and tried to become rich by making PowerPoint presentation. It's nothing new though. Every bubble leads to some of these kind of entities. That being sad, I would not short any of those companies though"

Could be, but why even the mention of that albatross factory in Wisconsin?  Again, makes me question the decision making at the top.

I hope you're right.  I don't like betting against companies that seem to be trying to put out a good product.

edit: expanding on my initial response."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,1 billion in cash but no income for at least 2 years.  That billion will be long gone before they sell a car
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much cash does it cost to try and stand up a car company?  If you fail, you don't get your money back.  They run their account to zero before they get sales then yes, $0.

edit: Their latest 10Q has the funds held in trust for the SPAC merger at $569M.  That's a long way from $1B"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It just goes with the environmentally friendly aspect of the EV. They make leather out of plants and it feels like the real thing. Its not as crazy as it sounds tbh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't bother me, I usually don't travel very far from civilization so the odds of having to eat my car interiors are slim to none."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doug DeMuro's review described it as weird within the first 10 seconds of the review. Generally not a positive indicator.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qfg4ZG1dZW4

The whole thing seemed to involve weird gimmicky design choices just for the sake of being different."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Audi A8 came with a solar moonroof. All it was good for was ventilating the car in the sun with a little fan. Solar panels on a car roof, at best, only prevent battery self-discharge"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fisker isn't a start up. It is a very troubled automaker that is banking on it's new Chinese ownership to make something.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canoo is doo doo too. All you people YOLO'ing into it, will be up a creek without a canoe."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,On FLAMES of glory no less...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, must be good if I'm already being called a shill!  I was second guessing it, but Thanks!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Every day I look at my EV watchlist and wonder how NKLA still exists.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the loss porn as a cautionary tale. I have never and will never buy options expiring within half a year. Also I may get some hate for saying it but when people say GME to 1 mill per share I die a little inside.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I argued with a guy telling me it was a $500 stock by 2025! Though honestly I do think $58 is possible in the near term. The prices on these EV stocks jump and fall on price target news or small developments. And it does have a $40 price target on it from the most well respected EV researcher (Adam Jones from citi group).
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,when hype dies it'll crash the price. probably might revisit a year or two from now. until then il'l just hold onto my nio and tesla lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding NKLA shares is the exact opposite of being a value investor
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 👍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re not fully refundable
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fiskar should have stuck to making scissors and pruning shears.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yea you hold that bag girl
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude get up to speed man that was when Spartan was pre ipo!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They have $991 cash on hand as of the earnings report they filed earlier this month.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't we already have vinyl upholstery everywhere?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but u know what reduces GHG emissions? Killing cows. Therefore leather is is a carbon sink. Literally infallible logic.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not crazy at all. They don’t eat meat or use animal products because animals are killed or
mistreated. It’s actually pretty hypocritical to say you’re a vegan and own leather products."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I think Mercedes is also doing it, just don't think it would be cheap."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s all it was designed for, though, to run a fan. There’s just not enough square footage there. The main problem comes down to how much range you get in a given day, and that scales with the amount of solar panels that are on it. There’s no point in making a solar powered car and not go all-out on solar panels.

If the Aptera can do 40 miles Fisker should at least be able to do 20. 20 miles was a pretty good average for a one-way commute pre-covid. So maybe you slashed your charging bill in half? That’s still deep value. Post-covid with telework that has all changed, and a solar powered car makes even more sense if you don’t drive it every single day."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for helping to drive the stock price into the ground I want to buy more
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Will buy puts just because you were called a shill 😂😂. I’m so tired of seeing GME DD. How much confirmation bias does everyone need. I have to dig trough so much GME dd to find a good play it’s crazy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Zing
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then why you put some much energy into trashing the stock?? If its a POS stock, then let it be, but you write an essay about it. Obviously you are looking to discourage potential investors."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA is a whale and GM wants in on EV market, and they know the general consumer will either forget, forgive, or aren't even aware what the hell was going down the past five years."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you really think the people who say that shit would bother reading posts about other tickers?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Even when they think it will go to 1k. I think it can still go up especially if RC becomes CEO but 1 million is just craziness.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It already crashed from 31 to 20. It was stuck at 15 for a few months. I think 20 is the new 15 after the positive news. Still a long way from it's price target of 40. Only way it continues to fall is if we have a market crash or this bond rate bs continues to scare off investors of highly speculative stocks like pre revenue EV'S.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well said . I was so close to throwing a lot of cash right before that absolute NKLA dive bomb. Good reminder that Im retarded and have no idea what I'm doing. Lucid was the second reminder when it absolutely dive-bombed, however I got in at 12, so still green. Big paper losses though"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apologies, just saw their 4Q announcement on the website.  Posted the pre-spac numbers because that's all I found on the SEC site.  Looks like you're right, $991M in cash."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right.  I made a mistake on that.  The announcement on their website says $991M, but couldn't find it on the SEC website, so I went with what I had."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so “vegan interior” isn’t as outlandish as it sounds. 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mercedes has been using ‘MB-Tex’ for >40 years
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, and it sucks.

vinyl is for 2 things and 2 things only:

1: records

2: weird sex shit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a tree hugger bro, just explaining what was meant by “vegan interior” 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why I eat meat
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The sounds of  1,000,000 windshield smashed bugs isn't super vegan. I think vegans only care about animal live as long as its cute and can be used to virtue signal."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, if I think something is going to lose people money, I would like to say so before they lose said money.  If you disagree with my points then put up your thoughts.  Calling someone a shill is the laziest thing you could possibly do."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you look at what sub you are on?  The OP is betting  with a put option and sharing the position which is what the sub is about.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could get my spouse to admit mistakes this easily! :-)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe do some actual DD next time there chief.  Good luck with those puts
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Pleather.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not buying one until it runs on almond milk
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It means they hate America!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're against animal abuse no? Ever seen how the livestock industries treat cows/pigs/chickens/etc? Still a hypocrite <3
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t remember the last time I hit a bug on my windshield. I forgot it was even a thing for awhile.I’m sure it’s fine tho.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and this is another perfect venue for them to do it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He said FSR is worth 0 a share. That aint positions. Thats trash talking.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm here for the discussion, not to prove anything  :) 

I do think my other points still stand though.  Tesla burned obscene amounts of VC cash to get where they are."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer actual filings to company website press releases there chief. My main thesis doesn't include their burn rate because no one knows that yet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Many synthetic leathers are terrific. They are just really expensive.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do they milk the almonds?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can brush that aside for chicken nugs that are dinosaur shaped with some honey mussy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJCTIPWPNtw](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJCTIPWPNtw)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can milk anything with nipples. Oh wait, does an almond have nipples?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I mean they’re just going to be slaughtered. Might as well torture them lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha you gotta be kidding me ☠️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have nipples, can you milk me?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tuesday... Soon to be declared Ryan Cohen day
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If shares drop to 20 a share after the split I'll buy way more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What a time to be alive
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If it splits 10-1...  🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m here just for entertainment and that was brilliant mate!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Man i love dfv’s fucking laughs lmaoo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Papa Cohen gonna do the right thing.  The move will create billions worth of goodwill if you want to call it that
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV at the end made me LOL. Ape ready. 🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This will probably be one of the most watched earnings ever. I've been seeing people brand new to investing looking into how these types of things go. For most investors its just another earnings with a little cherry on top.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Papa Cohen better announce he’s CEO tuesday so we can fly to tendie town. If not I will be loading up the gun for the inevitable squeeze you smooth brain retarded apes 🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,“Recall every fucking share” 😂😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy hell this has been going through my head on loop since I saw it.  Every time I close my eyes I dream of what this earnings call will be like. I have a Cuban cigar and a bottle of 16 year Macallan  that I bought after tripling up on pots stocks that I have been saving for GME launch day.  I’m holding my 80 shares with diamond hands and waiting for RC initiate launch sequence.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV has me dead at the end
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what I understand is that if this were to happen, my 2 shares would now be 20 correct?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Please let them do a split and offering to investors.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Grube, former CFO of chewy, being made the CFO of GME is what can really set this in motion along with earnings. GME has to find a new one by 3/26 which seems to make this week look like a strong week for the stock

Ryan Cohen ftw"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to the squeeze if the stocks split?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahahahah his laughter is contagious now and the news is stock split 10/1

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We ain’t leavin
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is the investor call public?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do certain criteria need to be met in order to execute a split? Can the owners do anything we agree on like a 5-1 or 10-1 split without the SEC installing chastity belts on every GME holder?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My prediction soon is I think ryan cohen is possibly going to be named CEO Of gamestop and he is going to turn gamestop completely around. The people love him, he already holds 13% of shares, he has a proven track record with E-commerce platforms on top of that gamestop is in need of a new CEO and has been for awhile that can shift with the changes and demands of a rapid growing economy. It is a no brainer for gamestop to offer Ryan the position. If Gamestop Successfully transitions towards E-Commerce gamestop will be up to date with the changes and challenges of a growing more advanced soceity, and catering more to the convenience of online shopping. If this is the case GameStop is truly under valued and has growth potential to be as big as Amazon!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this the catalyst for it to squeeze!?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good lord I will coom so fucking HUUURRDD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep seeing 10 for 1 split as good news. Anyone have a link to DD on why people think a 10 for 1 would be good? I don’t really see it. One of the reasons we are in this position is because of how few shares there are in the float.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dont overhype this guys, we dont want FUD to set in if things go a bit different than predicted"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I watch and what time?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn’t DFV hold a 100,000 shares? Or is it 50,000? A 10:1 split, and a recall running the price passed $1,000... DFV would be worth $500M-$1B..."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would that be legal? If they decided to do 10 split giving all of us x10 stock and then say he wants to recall all shares.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What movie is that from?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Smooth brain question but what happens when a stock split occurs? If it splits 10-1 what happens to the people with <10 shares?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"None of that is going to happen, FFS... The delusion is almost insufferable..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not the way. I prefer the road we are on now. 10/1 split does not seem to appealing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope and I pray
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What time is it?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What might happen?

Think having a website where you can mine and receive fractional coins for the mining effort you contribute. Think agreement with Nvidia for GPUs. Boom baby!!!

""OMG this is so boring.""

Yep, it's an investor conference call. It's about finances and maybe something about plans if you're really lucky but usually not, with some semi-in-the-weeds financial questions from institutional investors that most people don't understand, nor want to understand."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy RC Day! 🎆🎆🎆🎇🎇🎇🎇
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ikr! Finally can avg down from $200
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would a stock split help or hurt the HFs? I'm assuming *hurt* because they still owe x amount of shares, and there will be a retail buying spree at the lower price...

But if the stock splits 1:5, and the HFs currently owe like 10,000,000 shares, will they now owe 50,000,000 shares?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm off on weekends. Is the split and actual thing or just hearsay?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What split?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What split?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe that’s what Andrew meant when he said GME was worth $20
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So this means that my 15 shares become 150 shares worth 1/10 the price?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone talking about a $200 share going to $20. But a 10:1 split would bring the premium of an ATM call down from $3200 to $320.

Which is a much bigger and more important drop for retail investors who only have $1000s to invest."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing. A 10:1 split just instantly averages down your position from 3 shares at $420 to 30 shares at $42.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where in the world are clubs open these days?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on what is said.  2 major decisions will, other's meh.

1. Recall.  Gives the market 45 days to deliver. Could be insta panic from shorties to cover, or time to fuck things up for Gamestop.

2. Major overall haul of the company's direction with additional investors/partnership.

Other stuff like ""ok"" profits, nothing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it like this:  


Say you own 10 shares totaling $2000   


1 share of GME = $200 currently  
10 for 1 split = 10 shares at $20  


Now you have 100 shares totaling $2000  


So say shares are trading for $20 now.  Stock price after split is cheaper and more appealing so more people start buying in and that $20 price jumps up to $100.  You now have 100 shares totaling $10000.  


In reverse, 100 shares totaling $10000 before the split would have equaled 1 share = $1000.  


That's just one potential benefit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes shares more affordable (from $200 to $20), which will/may encourage more buying which will increase stock value, while still giving apes who diamondhanded the same value of shares they already hold"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shorts will owe ten times as much shares
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes the entry price for call options smaller, allowing for a bigger gamma squeeze as retailers pile in. 10:1 would be insane"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You would still have the same amount ,just more shares at a lower avg price. Hopefully it'll mean more can buy more..and more can just get in..easier to buy x amt at 20$ than 1 at 200..see🤔"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it would be better to buy prior to a split because if there is a split there will be a large amount of people who are suddenly able to buy in/buy cc’s driving the price of the stock up so your average will be lower if you buy prior.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every 1 share would be turned into 10 shares.  If one share is worth 200 then 10 shares would be 20 each.

More people could jump in at 20 each than 200 each, those who already have stock would not lose anything.

But it could also kill they hype, people thinking it devalued from 200 to 20 without understanding it split."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you have 2 shares of a $200 dollar stock right now, you will end up with 20 shares of a $20 dollar stock. No money is lost."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they would get 10x what they have at 1/10 of the price.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The cheap shares will be bought up by the shorties and cover all of their naked shorts.  No moon if that happens.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t get the split talk. I especially don’t get the special dividend talk. 

Best case scenario i see is RC getting more control and less bad financials than expected. Updated plans for business transformation would help justify a valuation adjustment and path toward growth, which would be huge validation."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it already automatically lower your average to $20 tho
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Retail usually buy more shares after a split because it's cheaper to get into that company.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yep
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">But if the stock splits 1:5, and the HFs currently owe like 10,000,000 shares, will they now owe 50,000,000 shares?

Yes. If you borrow 10 share you owe those 10 shares back to the person you borrowed it from. Essentially whatever they would have had you never borrowed the share is what you still owe them.  
&nbsp;  
If it split 5:1 you'd owe them 50 shares. If it reverse split 1:5 you'd owe them 2  shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not so much hearsay as stock owners asking for it to happen. There is no announcement that I am aware of though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Clearly nothing has been announced by anyone in the last 2 months so what u think?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Each share would be worth 1/10 but the 15 pre split, would be worth the same as the 150 after split"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"And not only that, but retail can also sell more options too"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which cancels every hope for people waiting for it to squeeze tho.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya I got fucked over a yr ago or so when one of my did a split like that. Still holding still in fucking red
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. If a stock you have a call on does a 10-1 split, your call undergoes a similar transformation.  
&nbsp;  
If you have call now covering 100 shares a $10 strike price it would become a call covering 1000 shares at a $1 strike price.   
&nbsp;  
Not sure if it's actually 1 contract for 1000 shares or becomes 10 individual contracts for 100 (guessing 1 for 1000 because I'm not sure how they'd handle reverse splits otherwise) but the gist of it is your options contracts won't be fucked up from it."

They told her to keep it or give it away to someone who would use it, and refunded her for the shit anyway. The next day she received a bouquet of flowers from Chewy with a note of consolation for her loss. That is how you create a lifelong customer."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Chewy stock probably isn't doing great because Cohen isn't there anymore.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So at 300 avg the split remains the same value wise? Just own more shares for cheaper?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there's a stock split they make it so that each share turns into 10 shares or whatever number they split it by. Each individual share now has 1/10th of the ownership power as before, and the price of each share is 1/10th of what it was. Splits make the shares more affordable though, and so usually after a split the price goes up. It's also easier to buy options."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that takes me back

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happens to short positions? If someone shorted 10 shares, do they have to return 100 shares after split?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it push the squeeze back more?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If a split happened (first I'm hearing about this? ) lower shares cost would give the shorts a lot easier chance at covering wouldn't it?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How does one do this? Any info on that?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If they were to go after my wife's boyfriend that would mean....I have a wife.... but I don't. :( sad face.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Twas a joke my dude
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,With new direction in the company..I'm kinda thinking profits aren't anything to stress's about at this time..the shorts are loosing $ hand over fist! It's just a matter of time. Do a recall now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The ability to buy fractional shares dilutes this effect.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  Those cheap shares will be bought up by the shorties to cover.  That is the LAST thing anyone holding wants.  That would ensure NO moon.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ bro that is the most rose colored approach to a split that I’ve ever seen lmao. To be fair tho I’d love to see it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it’s very different from issuing new shares which is what I originally thought could happen. Issuing new shares just screws everyone over which is why AMC is fucked if they do issue new shares"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If I only have 10 bucks but the stock I want is at 20 bucks. And the stock splits in half then I can buy one share. Where as before I couldn't.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know. I think it might have some psychological side effects that work against us.

I see what you are saying, but I think it has the potential to derail us a little."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ten times the shares at a tenth of the price.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That will be getting recalled. Shorters will have to be accountable for covering all their naked lies..oops I mean shorts.  Naked shorts and false shorts...imagine that!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very well aware of what a split is.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No way! Should I buy today?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I just rewatched it yesterday and the exact thought I had was this movie is flawless apart from this one stupid scene. I also watched infinity war the day before and didn’t realise they also had a similar scene in that movie when they’re fighting Thanos in wakanda.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't they all die in the Infinity War? I haven't watch Endgame yet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know it’s avengers but what one is it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh, not everyone has seen the movie.

The most popular thing you can think of in your country? Most people don't give a shit. That applies to everything."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh I forgot about that part. I thought it ended with thanos destroying the world.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for this. My ape brain initially thought it meant 10 shares turns into 1 for some reason.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, then I’d have more stock I won’t sell."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds good but it’s gonna fuck you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They aren't issuing shares, the shares already owned split, so you have more and shorts actually owe more shares"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on how much they wanna split. The OG comment says if price hits $20 ‘after’ the stock split. So it can be $50, $100, depending on how much they wanna split it by/ price at time of stock split"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hear-thing?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you believe this will help the squeeze effort? Making the cost of entry so much lower?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, overnight the price of entry to sell covered calls is back to $2000, instead of $20,000."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t see how?

There are at least three simultaneous squeezes occuring in GME at the moment.

Short squeeze - Relatively unchanged 

Gamma squeeze - squeezes harder - more option interest

FTD squeeze - dunno, unchanged?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, since you're at -43 right now, you could post those loss positions on here to get some orange up arrow things. I'd love to see your red, makes my red feel better."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shares would immediately drop to 1/10th of their price, but your overall value remains the same because you now have 10 times as many shares.   
&nbsp;  
Instead of having 1 share worth $200 you'd have 10 shares worth $20 each.   
&nbsp;  
From a technical standpoint nothing really changes, but theoretically the price could begin to rise because psychologically people are more comfortable buying a $20 stock than a $200 stock."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. If they shorted 100 shares now, then, assuming a 10:1 split, that would be equivalent to them shorting 1000 shares after the split.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah too bad. Was about to hop on my private jet after GME goes brrrr
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,would you prefer 10 or 100 shares for $2000? oo guess what. now ape can start selling covered banana.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fractional shares imply your shares can be lent. Get out of fractional accounts. It is Robinhood and others trying to screw small guys.

And yes split math above is correct. But the FOMO majority has obsession with cheap stocks.

Anyone could have bought a share of TSLA at 2000 but because price was so high people go buy a different stock cause instead of 1 share they could get 10 and that feels like more. Their wrong but it does feel that way.

TSLA at 1600 announces split. Hits 2000 pre split. Now it’s 400 and it only took a few months to shoot up to 800-900 now the market widely expects the price around 700. Which would mean TSLA went from 1600 a share to $3500 with nothing more really then a share split"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of brokers don't allow fractional shares.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we even outright own those fractional shares..I don't think they do. I may be wrong but I think this is how robinhood and cashapp and others are able to do fractional-kind of a pool senario ???
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But the shorts would still be on the hook for the pre split price. So instead now they have to buy 10 shares instead of 1
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Splitting is a good thing.  It keeps an uptrend in motion and makes it easier for new buyers to enter the market.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It also causes hedgies to pay way more interest .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry it's not going to happen lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,10-1 split gonna cause ur shit to tank. One of my shit did that a year ago still in red can’t wait to fucking get rid of it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming every ape watching this doesn't jump on the boat of buying 100x the shares they have because because its a buy one get fucking TEN sale and send the price right back up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe it will fuck them over on their naked shorts and their false shares they move around..recall ever fuckin share..let's level this ball field..TOUCHDOWN APES🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is all based on a theoretical split, but yes, in my opinion, you’d want to buy before the split. 

If there’s a split way more apes will be able to buy up shares and covered calls which I think would drive the price up pretty quickly. 

Buying prior to a split in this situation would almost guarantee you a lower average cost per share."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great response.

Can you elaborate on the fractional shares being available to lend = the screwing the small guy.

I think we are both correct.
Mathematically, TSLA should not have been valued  higher after the split. But that's not how people react to the lower price, people are not rational.

I work in corporate for a top 5 property and casualty insurer.
We were recently told that splitting our stock was unlikely because of the corporate resources required verse the benefit. Fractional shares was mentioned as a reason to not split, since price is less of a barrier to entry."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"During a reverse split, if you don't own enough to get a whole number of shares, the company gives you the cash equivalent of your extra shares. So if a stock reverse splits 1-for-10, and you own 34 shares, you would get 3 shares of the new stock and the cash equivalent of your 4 shares.  If you owned 9 shares, you'd get cash and zero shares."

2021-03-22 03:38:02,wallstreetbets,"Correlation between GME and other Melvin Capital Holdings **TLDR:** 

1. **The price of a number of other stocks that Melvin Capital held short positions in closely correlate with GME's. It's not just AMC/GME. (BBBY, IRBT, FIZZ and GSX)**
2. **Melvin Capital held put positions in these tickers but closed them during Q4 of 2020, before all of them went through a period of volatility along with GME.** 
3. **MC hold a put position in $AG, a silver mining company that was shilled on WSB during the 'silver squeeze' bullshit, which also followed a similiar pattern to GME in January with a rapid run-up around the 27th January.** 

Link to Melvin Capital 13F filings i.e. MC's holdings, use the 'quarter to view' drop-down to select which quarter to view. 

[https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)

From that you can view or download an excel file of MC's holdings - up to Q4 of 2020. 

Back at the end of January I was looking at the day's biggest movers on yahoo, and noticed that a few silver mining companies had gone up by around 20-25%.  This was at the time that all that bullshit about a 'silver squeeze' was going round, so I thought it was interesting. One stood out in particular: $AG, because I had seen it mentioned in a lot of the shill posts about buying silver. Knowing that the whole 'silver squeeze' thing was total bullshit manufactured by someone with money and a motive i.e. probably Melvin Capital, the ones who had an incentive to divert WSB attention (and money) away from GME, I started to look at the day's other biggest movers. Strap your tinfoil hats on boys and girls.

Like I say, what I did was go through that day's (28th Jan) biggest movers, and then I looked in the 13F filing available for Melvin Capital to see if MC had positions in any of them. At the time that I was looking at this, I was using the 2020 Q3 13F holdings, but since then the Q4 13F's have been made available. I'll get on to that in a minute though. First though, I want to show you the chart for GME/SPY. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4dyzatf3bgo61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=27fd1c05149cb9247ee2a442114e5bdd0bc5ef2b

As you can see, during the Jan/Feb squeeze (Gamma/short, whatever your opinion is on that) GME practically inverses SPY. Correlation doesn't demonstrate causation however: the point I'm making is that this is the trend that SPY was following at the time, so any correlation between GME and another stock can't really be put down to just general market trends. 

Now, these are the stocks I identified as having a significant price movement at the end of January which MC had put positions in as of the end of Q3.

**$BBBY**

[GME in orange, BBBY in Green. ](https://preview.redd.it/g11nca6cago61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=d23715bfefb01a62cc75f05da1ee870985b41f8b)

MC position as of Q3 13F:

PUT. Market value: $48,385,000. Also their 69th biggest holding. Nice. 

Another interesting thing about $BBBY is this:

[**https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693**](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1353689266660978693)

Cramer made a couple tweets about BBBY and linked them to WSB. Pretty sure there's one where he actually tried to driect WSB's attention to BBBY but I can't find it. 

&#x200B;

**$IRBT**

[$IRBT in blue GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/3zt6lrlwago61.png?width=1445&format=png&auto=webp&s=6e5e0c62df6aefb1156dcb9f25c374542926c6c3)

MC held a $37,950,000 market value PUT according to 13F filings for Q3. 

**$GSX**

[GSX in purple GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/t6jgqm8obgo61.png?width=1455&format=png&auto=webp&s=345c6d445d3dcb6f135f9b2b4345ae280bf6357c)

 MC held a $148,682,000 market value put position. 

**$FIZZ**

[FIZZ in yellow GME in orange](https://preview.redd.it/3usgiedqbgo61.png?width=1452&format=png&auto=webp&s=3942d0fe1c72d4e186cbf942b0a994540499f6c1)

MC held a  $54,408,000 put position. 

**Finally, $AG**

https://preview.redd.it/5jxfgox6mgo61.png?width=1462&format=png&auto=webp&s=9a06d6c5dda93a145a35672dd32550a5472c8be0

Now, I can't find any AG position for MC in Q3, however for Q4, they added an entirely new position. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/i0hyt7fsmgo61.png?width=1766&format=png&auto=webp&s=0d20308204d103dfd2c3e93cf94698d16eca5a11

That's a brand new put position in the 4th quarter of 2020 worth $74m USD. If anyone has got the ticker mention data I think it would be really interesting to see the ticker mentions of things like $SLV and $AG around this period. 

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So now to cover the Q3 vs Q4 filings, below are the Q4 statements for the previous tickers  that I stated MC held put positions in for Q3:

&#x200B;

[BBBY](https://preview.redd.it/ye0b1yt4pgo61.png?width=1767&format=png&auto=webp&s=bd8bd937433f7fb72167ee77f06ea80317e82e72)

&#x200B;

[FIZZ](https://preview.redd.it/tfix9lvcpgo61.png?width=1770&format=png&auto=webp&s=c0275f1e13fc50a76970bc1e598ea1b3453562c2)

So there was a correlation between GME and a number of other stocks that MC held short positions in as of Q3 of 2020, but they abruptly closed these positions out in Q4, before the volatility early in Q1 of 2021. 

**So to summarise:** 

1. There is a correlation between GME and a number of other tickers that Melvin Capital held PUT positions in (according to their **Q3** 13F filings) for the period from around the 27th Jan to early Febuary 2021. 
2. According to Melvin Capital's  Q4 13F filings however, MC closed these put positions before the end of Q4. They closed their PUT positions *before* the run-up that occured in late-January 2021 across these stocks. 
3. MC opened a put position in $AG in Q4, a ticker that had a sudden, massive increase in the number of mentions on WSB around the same time GME reached it's peak. The consensus at the time was that the 'silver squeeze' was a ploy to divert the attention of WSB onto something else away from GME. 

There are probably other tickers that could fit here that I've missed too. 

**So what the fuck are we supposed to make of this?**

Could MC have known that something was about to happen with these tickers? Why is there a correlation between a video game retailer and a soda producer? A consumer robot manufacturer (IRBT) and fucking bed-bath-and-beyond? Did MC run-up these tickers in order to reposition their short positions from new highs? 

Once the Q1 2020 13F's are released it will likely shed some light on what has gone on here but until then, unfortunately, it's up to the collective 14 brain cells of the WSB community to try and figure out if there's something going on here and whether that can give us information relating to GME (and possibly other tickers) going forward. After all, if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters eventually they'll write some Shakespeare."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: MC somehow ahead of these squozes...despite reports they lost a lot of money. we have to wait and see how and why after the 1st quarter. 2 minute warning. First and goal. WSB.

If you look, not one other stock fall so fast, so low after the mini squeez  as GME. As GME was the most shorted stock why it fall more that others and faster? I think maybe they cover some short position initially, but at the top shorted it even harder that before.
Data that we have is shit, MM report this data and nobody audit it. DTCC didnt change the rules for naked shorting after 2008, why we still have fail to deliver and no regulated dark pools ?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi thanks for the info that’s a really great explanation. The reason I stated that MC closed these positions is because of the screenshots I shared from the Q4 13F filings: for gsx they reduced their position by 54% but apparently sold all of their positions in BBBY, FIZZ and IRBR."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So my theory is right then?  If these HFs fail in GME they will take down ""good"" stocks when they close their longs to cover the shorts.  Also because GME makes them insolvent they will have to cover all their short positions causing all the ""bad"" stocks to squeeze.  

So this is kinda a great wealth transfer from the wealthy smart investors to the wild speculator trader buying beat down stocks in hopes of large gains."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> they lost $6B because every trade went against them and that is not something you would expect in your risk models

So... the 6.4billion dollar question is:  did these suddenly become correlated when all historical measures showed them to be inversely correlated?

The next obvious question is:  should WSBs start looking at other SEC filings of large heavily leveraged hedge funds to find that one potentially memable stock that could push other multiple positions out of inverse correlation?

I think maybe /r/WSBs just happened to stumble across that one magic stock, but that doesn't mean there aren't others."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes I see that now, they still had GSX. So what’s funny about it is other HFS at the time were operating off of their 3Q 13Fs as it was the most recent filing available. I’d guess they still had shorts in most of those but I don’t know. Corrected my statement"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"THe HFs shorted a lot of very good stocks mercilessly all the way until March 19th (3am to 6am activity, almost daily) to make money to offset their huge losses on GME, FIZZ, BBBY, EXPR, NAKD, KOSS ...................... Sick. We will see what entails in the weeks from March 23rd."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most shorts have been covered in GME. Sorry. All available evidence points that way. So no, hedge funds are not going to be bankrupted if the stock squeezes to $500."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not being a dick but that already happened. In January. Since then people keep trying to find the next short squeeze but hedge funds have deleveraged and shorts are less crowded.

I find the whole thing fascinating and brilliant.  Such a product of the moment.  We had to be at the height of this populist era, when retards think they're real smart and *the commoners are going to rise up*!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree. Verb's reasoning is too sound...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"But it only works if a bunch of stocks are squeezed at the same time. GME would not have played out like it did in January in a vacuum. It would have squeezed but to nowhere near that level. A fund can lose a LOT of money on one short and not need to cover if the rest of their book is behaving. But when their longs are down, their NAV is declining and a bunch of their shorts are going up, they have to cover."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I've always considered myself an optimist 

Right, I remember the comment you're referring to now, and I remember that the rest of it, which you deliberately excluded from your quote, said that you memestock retards had sucked all that optimism out of me.

So which is it?

Lying under oath to Congress? Or lying to financial institutions and swallowing a fine?

I've said this to you before and you didn't have a reply last time.

So, do you have one this time?

Also, do I need to remind you that S3 originally posted a tweet back in February stating a significantly higher SI% of float, but **deleted the tweet and replaced it with a much lower one 30 minutes, or so, later**.

They do **not** calculate these in real time, they had both values derived from the same data."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting how anything that supports the narrative gets upvoted with no proof but then the same person is mass downvoted for going against it and is demanded to show proof

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your response had nothing to do with the comment about hiding shorts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That math doesn't do the trick. If you go short lets say 20m shares short at 40$ and that price goes to 480 like it did in Jan you are on margin for 20.000.000x 440$ = 8.800.000.000 / 8.8bn(!) + Short Interest and SI had been a bitch during those days. Melvin Capital doesn't have 10bn cash, no HF would do that as opportunity costs for non invested capital would be fucking high (absolut). Also you are talking about a comparable small HF, the real whales are other ones."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Uh. No. The fuckery that has happened since then is hedge funds pushing the stock around using options and making a fortune. Most shorts have covered.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plotkin said covered their position. People don’t want to believe it, I can’t make people stop deluding themselves. 
(PS there’s um, other hedge funds. You think melvin was short the entire float? You could theoretically believe Melvin covered AND short interest remains high but nobody in this sub has a fucking clue how anything works they only know “Melvin” and “shitadel”)

S3 changed their calculation of short interest to include synthetic longs which was stupid but also I’m sure they didn’t anticipate a rabid angry cult. It’s been consistently calculated the same way now since then. It’s definitely not 100% accurate it can’t be it’s based on algos trying to determine short covering. But the bimonthly reports show a steady decline in short interest. 

Most importantly the borrow cost being 1% or lower is the biggest tell. The market doesn’t lie."

Hedge funds lie about their shorts all the time, its literally a strategy at this point, hedge funds and brokers will always put fee price in their profit/loss calculation. Anyone who worked in IB knows and seen this, I had partner literally tell me they would just just deal with SEC and their fees, so proceed. If they are willing to lie to their officers without hesitation, what you think they do to public data?

Its not secret the amount of power hedge funds have, they control the economy, we all seen what happened when brothers went down how it impacted the economy. SEC isnt there to stop them, they are there to make sure nobody finds out. Trust me or don't all IB who worked with big cap knows this."

Um yes when you run a regression   between a stock that has moved 20% to 100% in a day vs S&P which moved .1% to 2% a day you’ll get a very high beta number and a few days with extreme movements can easily make the beta a huge negative number.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, most **are** stupid.

But the fact that this person is dedicating some 80% of their day repeating the same statistics, but not even having any meaningful dialogue about the rebuttals to those statistics itself is stupid.

""Lmao, just trust them.""

???

If there is even just a single reason to doubt a source for SI% of float, that's enough. But there are several reasons to doubt it and there have been perfectly reasonable and justified rebuttals against those analytics.

So why don't you adequately explain why maths is suddenly wrong? Why the stock market stopped working the way it should? And we should just absolutely trust *algorithmically derived* SI%'s ... when S3 in the past tweeted contradictory values and deleted the higher one within some 30-minutes?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"stop calling the conspiracy a conspiracy, said the person rejecting facts in favor of fantasy.

The REALLY funny thing that you're doing is arguing without a point.  melvin covered.  other shorts moved in.  so what?  nobody is saying this isn't a shorted stock.  there is high short interest, and it remains the highest shorted stock that there is.  i fucking think GME will keep going up!  i'm not even bearish on the stock or the company.

but you have to cling to this idea that melvin capital is the bad guy despite A LOT of evidence that they moved on, including what was pointed out in this post, which is that they had to liquidate a shitload of positions to cover their losses.you insist melvin is the only remaining bad guy because you dont know the name of the CEO at maplelane.  you do this because your story needs a villain.  why do you need a villain?  because your stock position relies on fantasy to retain rhetorical appeal for idiots who dont know what they're doing.  you need other people to feel like they're fighting against evil."

They have to cover, their position is getting bigger as the stock rises, which is why managing shorts is so much harder than managing longs (if longs go against you the positions shrinks itself. If shorts go against you the position gets bigger. You have to keep buying and buying *just to keep the position the same size*)"

2021-03-22 03:17:02,wallstreetbets,"TSLA - Cathie Wood's PT broken down in six months segment. So Ark Invest (Cathie Wood) released their new PT for TSLA.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

I calculated (based on $4,000 PT) that it comes down to an average of $2.42 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. Ideally, if the price moved linearly then this is how it would look like (six months intervals).

|Date|Projected Price.|
|:-|:-|
|July 1, 2021|$906.24|
|January 1, 2022|$1,350.97|
|July 1, 2022|$1,788.44|
|January 1, 2023|$2,233.17|
|July 1, 2023|$2,670.65|
|January 1, 2024|$3,115.38|
|July 1, 2024|$3,555.27|
|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

Currently, I only have one TSLA $687.5c 3/26e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

Edit #1: Sold my TSLA call for 120% profit.

Edit #2: /u/tortoisepump pointed out that it makes more sense to use fixed percentage value (instead of fixed dollar value) for projections. Here is the updated projection after today's price action.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seeing the recent 8.2 videos, it’s pretty obvious that fsd is far away for Tesla, at least."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> keep the downvotes coming and I’ll double down on my position (which is profitable and big time green) on Monday.

Did you double down? Lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Post proof and cost basis
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Comin back to this in a month to see if your puts paid off. Tough betting against Burry. You’re right. But also wouldn’t want to bet against Cathie either.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"solar city doesn't exist - hasn't for years now.
they dismantled the company and it became Tesla Solar.

to which, now that Panasonic has pulled out of GigaNewYork, Tesla is the only US based and register PV cell producer. 

definitely something Cathie is missing - they dont even price the energy side of the business. i personally think think it hold more water and will generate more money than robobtaxis in her time frame"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,queefer
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh she's long past heaven with her 150% gain last year she's on Mars
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not? She proves doubters wrong every single time. I believe her💎❤
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i agree with her PT but not because of robotaxis
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,please be sure to inform me in time before neglect takes over.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If 1 guy is holding bags, thats his problem. If the entire country is holding bags, thats your problem"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck!!!!  🤣🤣🤣🤣 Lol!!!!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it don't work here
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Tesla insurance is also spectacularly overvalued. ARK majorly overpriced what margin they could make. If they were able to price their insurance at the level they say (~45% profit margin), regulators would stop them, and a hundred other companies would undercut them."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling cars at 40-50 times an iPhone doesn't mean they have 40-50x the profit. Apple sells well more than 40-50x as many units than tesla will,  a much larger global presence,  and subscription services will generate continuous revenue. That's why right now with the complete monopoly in their market they generate 35b a year or 1/4 of what Apple did in Q4. I'm not an apple fan,  but I'm using them only for comparison reasons.  By your logic those 40x priced cars should've generated more. ..TSLA is trading at a ridiculous 1000x earnings which means they have to really come through on all the hype and future business endeavors just to stay at the price they are already trading at."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  Musk will sell China the tech at 20 billion a year for 20 years. And they will honor the contract.  Even after the technology is old news.  It's been done before.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wholeheartedly agree.  Just passed on some info.  That's why people need to pay attention to the fundamentals as well as the technicals.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think you are missing a few points here. All cars have been full self driving equipped since 2016. You pay for the service not the hardware. 

Also Tesla has no interest in selling cars for a small profit when they can build them cheaper as fleet vehicles for Robotaxi. Why make $10k when you can make $30k a year for 8 years. 

There are more Uber drivers and taxis in NYC than there are Tesla Sales at 140,000 units."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,His put position is down 40% today he better lol. What a 🤡
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cost basis was $3.4 for my TSLA puts. ARKK was $1.2

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouuuh. Woow. Thanks for the clarification insights
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sutherland
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, well, you stick to your faith in a hedge fund manager, (loves, bae!), while I stick to my gut instinct. 

Let's see who's right

!remindme 5 years"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t mean your effort doesn’t matter. I respect people who try to the right thing even if it doesn’t matter in the long run
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, insurance pays like 2 - 5% on risk. Some years you lose money.

Like seriously Tesla could push out a bug that causes like 100 fatal crashes in a day and bankrupt themselves if there isn't a bank providing insurance against such an incident.

It's clear to me that Ms. Wood is just really ignorant on all this. I would like to know her history on risk analysis."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty sure that profit margin was ""including tesla insurance"" not the insurance by it self"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it has to do with Tesla being able to have the most detailed driving date out of any insurance. Paying how you drive exactly
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla Insurance backed by FSD. A MASSIVE amount of driving habits data. BIG DATA. Solar roofs. Robotaxi fleet vehicles will earn 30-50x revenue. Uber/lift will dissolve. Robotaxi service will take over because the driver is the most expensive cost so it’ll be 1/3 of the price for riders. Unlimited mile 8 year warranty. If you put your Tesla into fleet mode they’ll pay for charging, cleaning, maintenance. (Prorated by usage). Gas will plummet. Accidents will go down. Johnny cab is here. 

Let’s not even talk about solar roofs that will take over the market. The people buying will be home builders. They are marketing them as profit machines selling power at peak times and charging at low times."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"haaaa chima doesn't honor shit. 

they gave companies a monoploy in one town or province and then have  the guy that is partnered with the company quit and build a factory in the town or provimce over.

china takes anything they can get their hands on. 

check out what they did to GM."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah.  I think the biggest misconception is that newer and better technology will always translate to monstrous valuations and execution. At the end of the day, it really just comes down to profit.  I don't get hyped about what the product is as an investor.  Hell, if a company can sell more $$ and profit each year in paperclips than a company who could invent and sell flying cars bringing in less revenue and cash flow,  I'd take the paperclip company.  I think most would take the flying car because it's the ""future"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This again; robo taxis isn’t coming my friend.  It didn’t come in 2020 as musk promised and it isn’t going to be here by 2025.  People severely under estimate the cost and implementation of the last 20% of Full self driving.  

Also; the regulatory hurdles.  Do you think cities and countries are going to magically let Tesla self driving cars to be enabled by a click of a switch?  DMV has certified Tesla’s FSD a level 2, lol.  I’ll start believing it when they get certified to level 4."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah what a big mouth bitch, better post that loss porn only then will he redeem himself."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just post the tesla position

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have done my research on ARK investment and their research methods. I trust in her research and work. There is nothing wrong with it imo. That is me sticking to my guts. ARK investment even share their research tool on their website, its free and you can download in Github. I ran multiple different scenario on their model and it looked promising for me. Idk any other ETF managing company that has same level of transparency as ARK investment has. Yeah, we will see after 5 years man. I hope you become rich as well. 💎❤"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah,  no one cares about valuations.  They don't realize they are paying for all those future plans being executed perfectly in today's price.  They have a rude awakening coming"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy clearly tests his code in prod only lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Google Reinsurance
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and if that’s the case they can offer the insurance for very cheap, making it not especially profitable."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So let's say, uber + lyft  150b combined cap replaced to tsla, let's say FedEx 69b replaced by tsla. He'll let's even give them the benefit of the doubt and call our 200b.  There's 350b in cap (not revenue) tsla is already 600b which is 1000x earnings.  So those ideas may keep them at the existing cap.  So you're saying taxis are a 3 trillion dollar business? They aren't.  Just because it's a new idea,  doesn't mean it is economically worth hundreds of billions of dollars.  You're also assuming tsla is going to execute perfectly,  and have zero competition and just dominate every facet of every idea or business they pursue.  Just because they're the first on one idea,  doesn't mean they'll be the first for every other business endeavor. Let's also add that they will not trade at 1000x earnings forever.  Let's give them the benefit and say eventuality they trade 100x earnings.  That means they will need to increase revenue 10x just to stay at today's valuation. Which they definitely one day will bring in 10x The revenue,  but after how much of all the future growth is now being sold"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd take the paper clips as long as the CEO calls a guy a pedo...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck yea Chad
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/16 TSLA $420 put. That’s the position.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, vro.

I love aunt Cathie, but I'm trusting her for tendies only slightly more than I trust Andrew Left. 

Each has a thesis and an agenda. 

Aunt Cathie at least has skin in the game, though.

Death to hedgies; may God bless you with tendie rain."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"P/E = 1,000,000,000,000,000? Oh this looks perfect"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone is salty they don’t own Tesla.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually don’t own Tesla, but I do own arkk and arkq and am up about 70% on my investment so can’t really complain. Ark is basically a Tesla investment at this point. At any rate, I would never bet against Elon. Sorry his Twitter feed offends you so much"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here we go brother, I just sold my TSLA call for 120% profit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You too man. Hope you get that tendie rain too🙏❤
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But they look at fwd p/e.... and think they're getting a deal.  They like to use today's known stock price to compare to the unknown future earnings.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well that's what I started with in January and I only made $5k. It should have been more than 10x higher if I played things less conservatively but it was my first time trading and when you have $10k on the line it's hard to separate that feeling of ""this is a lot of money to me"" to let it sit and grow."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you sure you wouldn't rather use that money for a down payment on a house? My wedding was $6k. I just can't compute spending that much money on one day. But maybe you make a lot of money and that's pocket change.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats on the wedding.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">  $30k for my wedding next year

I know we're all retarded here but this is next level"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Weddings are shit. Spend all your life savings on a single night to entertain family members you havent seen or talk to since the last wedding/funeral. The bride and the groom are stressed out the entire night,while everyone else simply dont give a fuck and want to be home watching netflix. I just had a few close friends and family to attend at city hall, then some small drinks and fucked off home"

We joke that our lack of a wedding is worth $2500/month.

Meanwhile my cousin spent $30k and my other cousin $60k, and neither owns a house. They each make double my salary and will probably work into their 70s. 

I'm functionally retired, live off investments and property. My wife and I are adamant about this being impossible without skipping the dumb traps of weddings and new cars and shiny toys. 

Skip the wedding."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,His future wife's boyfriend disagrees
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah mate, in my country getting married means you pay less tax. It's a good investment"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like you've been to some boring weddings. Ours and all of our family/friends' weddings have been nights to remember.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 1 year
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If you feel like you're missing something by eloping, or getting married at City Hall,  you can always have a big dinner at a nice restaurant a week later, with all the people you consider real friends and only the family you actually like, cover the bill yourself, and it will have all the good things a wedding provides, with none of the bullshit and headaches, and a bill of only a couple of thousand dollars.

Getting married in a catering hall is some basic-bitch shit and the biggest scam currently active. No one likes to be there, everything feels forced and pretentious, and everyone can't wait to leave.  Doing something smaller that they all want to opt into because they like you is way better on all fronts."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This shit right here is why I love WSB. Apes lookin out for apes with the real life advice.

Tbf the 30k I pulled will cover the wedding and taxes on my tendies with a decent amount left over. We have a house already, but the remainder and any gifts we get from family and friends will go toward buying a plot of land to build on, then we'll turn the current house into a rental property. One day I hope to grow up like you and live off investments and real estate.

While we considered putting it all toward the nest egg, she's big on family so we decided on still having a wedding then saving the rest. I do appreciate the advice though."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Until you divorce. Then boom half your tendies gone
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The bride and groom remember they spent multiple down payments on a ""night to remember,"" I'm sure of it.

American weddings are a trap. 20x overpriced compared to any other event, and they suck the money out of new couples just before they need it most."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Weddings are a waste of money. I can't believe people still fall for that. Unless you are super wealthy anyways in which case you can just waste money like that and don't flinch.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why divorce rates are so high, some people try to show the world how much they love themselvs by spending a shit ton of money on a party. Love is not measured by how memorable 1 night is, its by cherishing every night together.

 But if yours have been memorable, carry on, im just being salt"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't use RH.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You have no fucking idea what you're talking about. Stfu
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know somebody that almost died from this. Bullet landed in the living room while he was sleeping on New Year's. Came from a few blocks away according to the police but how can they tell?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess you're going to have $1 million sitting in RH
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like korean jesus

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chip, I gonna come at you like a spider monkey."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buddy Christ is my preferred Jesus
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s your end game?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Myth Busters did a video on it.  According to them you can not die from a bullet shot directly in the air.  Because, the forward momentum will push the bullet upward and when it descends down to the ground it will fall at 9.8 m/s\^2.  I forgot the exact math.  But, if you take the distance the bullet would travel upward and times it by 9.8 ms\^2 it does not reach a lethal velocity.

Of course that is if the bullet is fired directly upward.  If you shoot the bullet at a 45 degree angle or less or I guess even if it were at anything below 90 degrees from the earth the forward momentum times the force of gravity would yield a lethal shot.

Of course this is all without comprehensive math."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Angle of entry and estimated velocity based in weight maybe? Honestly would he surprised if they tried to figure all that out when no one actually died though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop fucking with Korean Jesus. He got Korean shit to do
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm all jacked up on MT Dew.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,As if losing unrealized gains doesn't hurt just as bad.  Lmao ok.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"LONGTERM value investor. I’m thinking 4-10 years.

I don’t sell. I only buy more and usually on dips. My investments are “savings” accounts to me and I look to put little bits often for the last 4 years and will continue to do so.
I’m looking to build a portfolio over 20 years.

This is a marathon IMO, not a sprint.

LONGTERM value investor and I started with nothing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I mean I guess both situations could take balls? But you’re right, OP is a pussy cuz they have an average price of $4 and they are still holding."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't that whole episode about how you probably most likely almost certainly won't hit *yourself* but you could definitely hit and kill someone far away?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"X velocity is independent of Y velocity so if you fire a bullet directly up, it will decrease its speed to zero then fall at terminal velocity. I don’t think terminal velocity is enough to kill. Although when shot at an angle the X velocity would be the total velocity times the cosine of the angle. Therefore if the bullet had a sufficient initial angle, the combined velocity of terminal velocity and the X velocity might be able to kill."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s innocent people dying every year from marriage celebrations in Arab countries, not even a joke."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Im.gonna scissor kick you in the back of the head

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When AK's and bullets are cheaper than fireworks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but most of the time it's people losing control of an automatic and sweeping the crowd AT the wedding, and more rarely from bullets being launched ballistically."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did not watch that episode will have to now, but even at a lethal velocity the chances it hits someone in the small town I'm from are so low. If you account for as many factors as you can like people moving around and not standing still that whole duration. All in all still dangerous and illegal I believe."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,radar cannot count bullets but cool story bro
2021-03-22 02:14:35,wallstreetbets,Sweet Jumps

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing will compare to watching this movie for the first time in high school. Completely caught me off guard with this style of humor. I had never seen anything like it.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,omg hot rod is the best
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That included snacks for the crew
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hot Rod is so stupidly, painfully hilarious.  One of the free movies that made me laugh til tears and aches in my face and sides.

We also hear from DoD and IC customers how much they are beginning to hate Palantir because of how they lock up their tech up to third-party vendors and charge exorbitant year two contracts, duping the gov. Saying all of this because after all these years they’re still not
profitable and were one of the few SaaS defense companies in the space, and are now on the gov’s bad side because of their contracting practices. I don’t love the outlook for them."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why were the other people chasing him?  
To disturb the police or catching him?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idiot = actually trying to run from cops while handcuffs. A pity crime just became a major crime.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Here’s (https://gorillafund.org/statement-from-the-dian-fossey-gorilla-fund/) an lengthy official statement on what they’re planning to do with the donations.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is beautiful! My wife works for a non profit dog rescue so I know how hard it is for these places to operate. Especially when they come in needing medical treatment. We have a mama dog right now with two broken legs mange multiple BB gun shots large cuts on her legs and she’s emaciated. After paying for all that medical the rescue only gets paid the adoption fee and that’s only $200.  Love seeing my fellow apes work together 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just got my tshirt! 

Side comment: This was the first time I’ve been able to purchase off a website using Apple Pay where I literally only had to select the color/size then double-click the side button on my phone and boom, done. Didn’t need to enter billing/shipping address or anything.  

Which is all to say they’ve made it incredibly easy to get one for yourself! (at least if you use iPhone/Apple Pay)"

The people were fighting have never spent a *dime* on anybody but themselves. They’re actually incapable of thinking about anybody but themselves... and that makes them ruthless and formidable. I don’t think there’s any way to beat an opponent that powerful and evil. Not under the circumstances anyways. Itd be different if the laws and regulations applied evenly but they don’t. We’re basically fighting a God. It’s like, peasants with pitchforks trying to fight Zeus’ team of Greek gods."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape protect ape and gorilla
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean it is only right that we protect our masters
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,50years? ...didn't know WSB has been around that long
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes support Apes  🦍❤️🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought my shirt but not for wearing. I am just going to put it in a frame.

Anytime I make a life decision I will glance up, see it, nod, whisper ""together"", then buy more GME."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck all those kids in third world countries dying from starvation and diseases. Dicks out for harambe!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this is so corny. can we be done with this
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does anyone else think this sub has gone to shit and the GME bs has permanently ruined wsb? Is everyone from the old sub as shocked as me? No more DD to see, no more overlooked tickers, no more gain and loss porn, just these low effort bullshit posts about “holding the line” and diamond and ape emojis. Truly sad"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Free karma baby
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got two one for me and one for my pup. All will know he’s also a 🦍with💎paws!!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin Incredible Apes Beat your Chest!🦍🙌🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I entered this thread with extreme caution
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do you claim your GME shares for the money yall have put into this?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just in case you didn’t know how cool gorillas are, check out Shabani: https://youtu.be/wc1F6N-MzhU"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a little new to this whole gorilla fund thing, is there a specific market we're putting money into or are people just buying merch en masse?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I can say is...

**HOW DARE YOU GUYS SUPPORT ELLEN DEGENERES**"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope everyone has a blessed week 🙏
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We should buy the staff some GameStop shares
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet it’s going to be next to impossible to find a rental gorilla costume this Halloween.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally got my act together, got to the website, and sent something to the actual gorillas at the Fossey gorilla fund.  World Wildlife Fund still has the best toys (shoutout to them for their prime-level stuffed animals).  

I sent my tendies (stuffed octopus from WWF) plus a blue-footed booby and a red-footed booby off with my brother and sister-in-law.  So they’re going to grandkids or the charity box probably, and I have room for more stuffed animals.  🙂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP Dian Fossey
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We have to support our family.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I ordered a t shirt! 🙌

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Order one to use as cumrag tired of licking my wife’s boyfriend dry every time 💦
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How about we purchase from GameStop instead of donating to good causes before the fight is over
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here’s a link to the shirt

[APES TOGETHER STRONG](https://store.gorillafund.org/products/apes-together-strong-t-shirt)"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course. It’ll be one of the most expensive shirts I wear. $30 Ts and lambos, what a life"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm hoping mine comes in time for my zoo trip this week
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My husband got one for me and my boyfriend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got one and left a fat tip 🐸
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"U con-minced-me, I just bought my shirt, but my wife's boyfriend is bawling like a little baby because I did not buy him one."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You are not an Ape...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wanted to order one, but the shipping to Europe was more expensive than the shirt itself. As an Europoor with just 3 shares I couldn't afford one :("
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got a Grey Apes together strong shirt 🦍💎🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FYI if you apes aren't sure who Dian Fossey is, there's an 80s movie based on her and her work called ""Gorillas in the Mist"" starring Sigourney Weaver, 84% on Rotten Tomatoes"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just ordered one for myself.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Picked two up for me and my fellow ape brother
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I ordered a grey one and a black one.  My roommate and I are going to figure out who gets which when they arrive.  We are very excited!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely! Can't wait for it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course I grabbed one. Added a little dono on top cuz it felt right
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup! I got the one day shipping, but I don't know when they go out"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed.  There are currently a bunch of retarded Ape pilots running around SoCal with WallStreetBets shirts on.  Soon they will add Apes to the ensemble.  lol 

We are all out of fucking control.   A buddy sent our entire group of investors a 64 piece box of crayons last week.  Came with a note which said ""For snack time"". 

We are all nuts!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I did. I can’t wait!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mines on it's way!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Waiting on mine, bought it thursday"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ordered, hope my wife's boyfriend will let me wear it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,FOMO’d a black one ASAP.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought one, didn't even realize it had the diamond hands on the back until after I bought it"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I order
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t even know about those! The look sweet! Just ordered mine!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I Bought a shirt. I have no spare cash anymore, but didn’t look at price, just ordered.  My wife was not pleased. Already have everything invested GME. Can’t get any tendies out of a shirt, but can’t afford a gorilla so a shirt will have to do."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 9, honestly, I don’t know why..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got one! I like it so much I probably won't leave it in a pile on my floor like all the other pieces of shit contributing to my crippling depression!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup I snagged one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,shirt?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasnt missing that chance! I hope to see my ape brothers in the wild with their shirts as well!!

What a time to be alive!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried to order one but shipping and taxes to NZ was $80 USD lol. I need the squeeze 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got a shirt and a hoodie. Now the GF wants a hoodie too, but the shipping cost is killing me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The back of it with the ape diamond hands is what sold me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,72$ :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like reddit has been busy... the 4XL in black is sold out 🙈
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Waiting for my pay to come in this week to purchase 🚀💎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I just bought one :D
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Snagged it faster than HF's next short.
However i fucked up, should have gotten 2. One to wear at one for framing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wanted one but the shipping cost was way too high to Australia, even before exchange rate conversion."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, wonder if it'll beat the squeeze to me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No matter what happens, at least I’ll know I had a blast, helped a good cause, and came out with a  sick shirt."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Found out a friend works for them here in Atlanta, donated, got that shirt, can’t wait to yell at another ape in public when we see each other  🦍🍌"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone want to split shipping costs to Netherlands? It's $50 shipping.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ordered mine, then I felt like a hypocrite because I was still childless. Went on to adopting a gorilla and an orangutan. I’m a happy mommy over here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for mentioning it. Just ordered one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I did. Donated a few bucks on top too. We must honor our ancestors.  🦍💎🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ordered 1 now and a Call Option at $100 for one because I have no idea what that means. But I like the shirt, and am not a cat."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is accelerating the Planet of the Apes.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so retarded I went to adopt a gorilla and ended up adopting 2 sloths.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here I am all these years later, thinking I'd never hear this statement back. God bless fellow apes and apelettes, rally on your comrades and message me if you doubt yourself.  I love you, yes you! 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Also fellow Canadian and the shipping is bananas
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow ape have PayPal?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Respect
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s probably why they’re the rich ones and the poor ones are the poor ones lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good read!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the share! Made me a little allergic at the end. I’M NOT CRYING I GOT SOMETHING IN BOTH EYES AT THE SAME TIME
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy chills
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am ape who runs cat & dog non profit, thank you for all you and your wife do. 

To the rest of you, you all are fucking amazing people. Even if you lose all your tendies and your wife leaves for her boyfriend you will still have your Ape/dog/koala/whale living strong from your efforts. Keep it up!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a reason. The reason is fuck you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really can't imagine much that's more evil than being Jeff Bezos, looking at the world and knowing how much good you can do with your money and do nothing."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We are buying apes strong together T shirts from the Gorilla People
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jane Goodall was actually a pretty close friend if Dian Fossey. I believe Dian even spent some time living with Jane’s mom when she was ill.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I understand your point of view but that dosen't mean the fight isn't worth it. If people don't stand up to the 1% nothing will ever change.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s 30$
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,People can care about more than one thing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The starving kids are Biden's Problem and Bill Gates's Job.  WSB got the apes back.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Has nothing to do with this topic
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your wife’s boyfriend walks around shirtless too huh?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He's just going to take yours anyway.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What an Ape 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He'll just take yours like he did your wife.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He'll just borrow yours
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ordered mine. And as much as I love it I’ll sell it before I sell my shares of GME.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kick him out, tell your wife to find a new bf"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn't deserve her.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like your wife's boyfriend pays you protection money. All the better to sink into GME.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"can someone explain all the ""my wife's boyfriend""          comments?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s never dressed, so that checks out"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought your wife one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doing the lord’s work. My brain is far too smooth, fucking posted without the sauce 🤦🏻‍♂️"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks got my shirt. + some extra for the gorillas. I specifically request the extra money be handed to a gorilla and he can do as he pleases with it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They are probably sold out and don’t even know it. Can’t wait for the message update that it will take 3 months to print millions of shirts!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,is black actually dark grey? because i’d prefer the dark grey that’s pictured as “black”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well shit. Was gonna wait for realizes gainz. But now I’m Ordering for me and one for all the fam. I think we will have our Christmas photo cards done in them.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is incredible
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh nice, grabbing one"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,holy fuck this is fantastic
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already ordered. I emailed them asking for a t-shirt after that first day, was stoked they came out with one"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, international shipping is higher costs than the shirt. Too bad, really would've liked a shirt, but 33$ for standard shipping is absurd."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for posting this! I can’t wait to get my order!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks fellow diamond hand. Ordered my shirt and donated some extra gains to my fellow apes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just ordered! And I bought my shares at $349!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t believe how quickly I just dropped $30 on a shirt.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought one and donated too!! So excited! 🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn it'd cost me $80 USD to get one to Australia
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Big D Energy
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just get an XL and grow into it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I ordered XL so it'll shrink in the dryer down to an L
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah shit, I thought M was for monke"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too so I got the L and imma get fat on my tendies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually more to ship than for the shirt. $30 shipping for a $25 shirt.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I just couldn't bring myself to do that. $66usd for a t-shirt and only 25 of that is actually going to the foundation.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh. You see short of stock, you think buy. If there’s only xs size left, then it’s one of those short squeezes I’ve heard so much about."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they willing to put shirts on your gorillas? Because I’d pay to see that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m with you there!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not an ape 🦧- not wearing a shirt
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean wear it with Troop! - Pride is lions!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hoodies good. I used Siri to write them an email, fingies too fat to type... asked for a hoodie version. Apes together strong - and cozy in a hoodie."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I would wear a hoodie to death.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ditto. Hope my ape head fits through the neck hole.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure he’s just gonna take yours
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fly here with your tendies next month and pick one up in person
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this me?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That was the year that Ellen gave millions though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh god, here we go. 15 year old's are having an opinion on salaries for a non profit which doesn't actually make any money so why does the ceo even get paid aren't they supposed to do it for free because they're rich right"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a charity and the CEO is paid over $200,000?!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,....but where the hell are we putting all of em'??
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We can finally send the whales home.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's send an adopted gorilla into space!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re sending monkeys BACK into space.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sloths deserve love too. I’m broke af, but if GME hits 500 I’m helping out elephants and Rhinos as well."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one put their dicks away, they have been out this entire time, so we need to get something else out now."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Canada isn't a small country... its bigger than America we aren't all neighbour's.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely. What a great cause!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME no make ape.     
  
You ape anyway."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gourd futures gets me every.  Single.  Time.

You’re doing the lorts work, btw 🍺"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This post could literally be the definitive case study on “context matters.” This sub calls people autistic and retarded all day but this was offensive??
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No need to apologize... If anyone took offense to a guess at a username they are weak paper handed bitches.

Edit: if you monkeys are going to say your are autists and retards please never apologize for not being pc. That is not why I subbed. I will reiterate - don't be a paper handed bitch."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate you made the edit
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate that fellow ape made the edit ❤️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done with edit.  One of those words that are a lot more offensive in different English-speaking countries because of historical usage.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mis-spelt rea$on
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No se que leches dices pero mejor es no caer en la vulgaridad.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the charity, I'll see my bananas go in to the intended recipients."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No the issue is little bitches like you brigading this options gambling sub with bullshit.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ok obvious shill
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I don’t think so either. I stopped paying attn to this particular drama, however I think that Twitter handle is controlled by the guy who started this sub years ago; but who is a douche/not welcome here

Edit: what I mean is that there was so much mod shuffling I lost track of if that particular guy is in or out at this point. And I don’t care. And yes I know we all like the current mods. 🙌🙌"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure they were both pretty big inspirations to each other at the time I knew they were friends I didn’t know about the latter though that’s very interesting
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed; but it’s also $42.98 for shipping - that’s the bit that makes it “de facto” $72.98
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean you asked your wife’s boyfriend for an advance on your allowance?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I figured they’d sell out in 30 mins so I copped one ASAP on the toilet
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahah
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did he allow it ???
Askin for a tahded fwends"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I maxed out my credit card to buy one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What did he say ?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I wanted a couple soon as I saw it so I got one of each color and then I bought a bunch of kids sizes to give out to the children in the neighborhood
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought mine and didn't tell my brother or brother in law. Gonna be funny to see their reactions.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so since that's how it looks online... at least that's the one I ordered. Hasn't shown up yet though.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I ordered a 3XL because I am a fat chick but now I am wondering if maybe I ordered too big because these t-shirts are probably not European/Asian sizes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"3X here. I'm a big guy, and taller. XLT is my size, but nobody ever carries T, so I've gotta get 3X to be able to raise my arms without revealing the belly.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,that’s such a melvin thing to do smh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International had a 5 star rating on Charity Navigator.  With a score of 98.07 out of 100 for how it manages it's finances.   Only 5.6% of it's donations go to administrative expenses.    It is a a good charity to donate, reliability and lack of scamming wise."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not that high of a salary for a CEO, you can make that as a mid level skilled employee at other jobs"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is most definitely on the.low end for an executive salary. A staff scientist in some industries can make 120-160 k, mid-upper management in the high 100s-low 200s. Executives can go sky high."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s 165k a piece.... that’s not very much money in the grand scheme of pay.... like maybe in a small town but there’s probably ALOT of regular jobs that make that much and loads more in specialized industries.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There a 4star charity which is one of the highest ranking you can get you can see their full breakdown on Charity Navigator.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Combined? Honestly that's not much even for a nonprofit CEO.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No this is not normal they usually get paid a lot more. Here 2 people together are getting 330k. See the following 2 links about charity CEO pay. There is plenty of info since all that has to be disclosed since it’s a charity. 

https://www.causeiq.com/insights/highest-paid-nonprofit-ceos/

https://work.chron.com/comparison-charities-ceo-salaries-3358.html"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d bet that’s really low.  I work for a nonprofit (although not a charity) with similar revenue, and our CEO’s salary alone is more than $350k"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your comment also brings to light another common misconception people have about nonprofits. Paying your staff low wages is NOT how you want to run a nonprofit. But because people, the media, and donors view ""high overhead"" as a negative for these nonprofits, most typically underpay everyone, including the CEO. CEOs in the nonprofit space last, on average, 8 years with their nonprofit before moving on. Not part of the statistic, but I assume they move into a for-profit space where their salary and benefits would likely skyrocket (2-10x greater pay). It begs the question, how can the mission of these nonprofits be pursued if leadership experiences significant turnover so frequently? Where would the Harlem Children's Zone be without Geoffrey Canada and his staff receiving the resources they need to flourish, as an example.

We need to stop the narrative that nonprofits should pay their employees so little and have so little overhead that they can't actually accomplish anything on a large scale."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"at least you aped up and learned.  you were wrong, acknowleged, edited, referenced and explained.    id pick and eat a bug out of your hair ape.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,how much would it take for you to live in Africa with the chance of getting killed /abducted by humans and apes 24/7...sounds a little low if you ask me!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s cheap for two executives. What were you expecting them to make? $50k a year?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">he article mentions that the CEO and CAO of the organization have a combined salary of $330k?

What you have to understand is that the caliber of individual it takes to successfully run stuff like this would be making vastly more in any other sector they were to go in.

Alot of charities have tried the, ""we're going to save on admin and exec costs."" They always die."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That seems on the low side for managing such a large organization. You want to hire smart, experienced people to run a charitable organization, not someone who is cheap an inexperienced. Especially in this case when they are trying to build programs in areas where little infrastructure exists."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, low when you look at comparably sized organizations."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is not an extravagant salary for the CEO of a major charity.

It is definitely a salary that makes it so the CEO doesn't need to worry about their finances, however it's not much more than that (depending on location). And you don't want a CEO stressing about their finances. You want them comfortable. Putting financial strain on those in power just adds another avenue to corruption."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Justified and normal

They can go ALOT higher if they wanted"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Very normal. In fact the better the charity the better the salary usually. What is usually more telling is what % it is of the charities income.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mamma Mia
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not much for a CEO. Nonprofits have to compete for talent with for-profit organizations. Salaries trend lower than for-profit but you still have to be competitive.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck finding anyone qualified for a C-level position at that salary. They could work countless other places as a middle manager for more. $330k would be a massive discount for either of those positions alone.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Regardless of that’s considered a “low” salary it’s still bullshit. Maybe $200-$250k would be more than reasonable. Those charities bleed out admin fees
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earth, it’s where I keep all my stuff."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another thing to consider, lots of executive compensation is in stock options. So charities need to pay straight cash."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They make less than for-profits for sure, but being a CEO they're still extremely well compensated"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a fan of citing the 5.6% part, because it's important to pay the best people a good salary to do the work that supports a valuable mission. Only in extreme cases should overhead be cited. Otherwise, it's too simple of a statistic to make any good inferences off of it. Charity Navigator is a good resource, however. Thanks for sharing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm. I’ve worked in nonprofit. We lost many MANY wonderful talented employees to the private sector because nonprofit work is doing the job of 10 people for the salary of one person, entry level, in the position you signed up for. 

In reality you’re doing the jobs of a dozen or more people, working 60-80 hours a week to fill in the gaps of everyone else your company can’t afford to pay, and literally ALWAYS ASKING PEOPLE FOR MORE MONEY. 

Every year talented and hard working people left because the job chewed them up and spit them out. Nonprofit work is hard as fuck. These salaries seem appropriate to me.

Edit: Thanks for the award kind ape friend! 
I will also add— I wouldn’t mind if Ms. Diane made a weed/beer fund with my donation for the employees. The gorillas would be fucked without them. They deserve a little extra."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for sharing that, a fascinating video."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then they should go to the private sector if they have profit motive.  It's a charity. Nobody is forcing them to be one.  

You would hope everyone in it is in it for the mission not to get rich.

There's no rule saying charities need to grow and become huge like corporations.

In this case, these aren't outrageous salaries, but there a ton that try to act like corporations and empire build."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats basically what OP said you just re worded it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's literally average.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are actually regulations in place that (to my understanding) only allow non-profits to utilize up to 30% donations for administrative costs. Which you have to understand is necessary for the people to put food on their table and outweigh the desire to move into private sectors. 

&#x200B;

However there are times where greedy CEO's of non profits have dipped their hand in the pot too much. There was a veteran non profit that got into huge trouble for taking up to 60%. It was all over the news."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"With a good charity, paying a skilled CEO a good salary is a huge advantage -- the investment in the CEOs pay should yield huge advantages in doantions. That person is often the face of the organization for the public and they can bring in huge donors. Often times CEOs of charities have donation targets and failure to meet those targets would result in dismissal.   

If you don't pay for a good CEO for your charity that can lead to poor fundraising.  

Of course, you want to have some limitations in place, the CEO shouldn't be robbing the charity blind, but I'd say this salary is on the lower end / is totally reasonable."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This would not be possible, just like for profit CEOs they have contracts that stipulate compensation which is almost always going to be base pay plus bonus usually based on revenue."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I also believe non profits don’t do much in the bonus side. Kind of puts profit on the agenda. So then the salary has to be pretty up there or else you get junk CEOs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what stuff like the charity rating is for. DFGF is like 97 or something, they're really good."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately incentives and bonuses for charities are normally tied directly into increases in donors/funds. So what was done here will go into any kind of bonus.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disagree. 

You have it reversed.  That line of thinking is fine for large established charities, but a very relevant stat for the majority of those with just a few million in seed money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You try doing the work of 12 people working 80 hour weeks because your charity didn’t want to spend the money to hire enough competent people.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are both still pretty low. Sure there’s many an engineer that hit 209
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He makes 400k in salary but everything he does is payed for so it really a much higher compensation package. I mean the guy will literally never drive on a public road again (even after leaving office)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It brings me too tears every-time I see it. I’ve been trying to promote Virunga on WSB when we started adopting but I didn’t wanna come off sketchy. I think if we as community focused on helping the park rangers directly we would have a lot bigger impact than just supporting random charities. Plus we could actually see how our support is having a impact because the director Emmanuel is transparent and gives weekly updates on projects around the park. He shows where the money is coming from and where it’s going.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Being a non-profit organization is a misnomer in that while it's not your primary goal, any extra revenue you bring in helps to further your organization's primary objective, so you still want to grow as much as possible.  Sure you can keep the status quo, but a couple of years of that will leave you vulnerable to shifting economic and social changes.  

Just look at /r/prorevenge to see how bad management can completely upend very solid appearing businesses.  As much as the ""trickle down effect"" is maligned, I think good upper level management really does have an effect on the performance of an organization as a whole."

The first time I heard how much the President of the US got paid (early 00s), I was in utter disbelief, most other countries in the world, the president gets paid like 33% more, even the Prime Ministers, even in places like Ireland, get paid more.  Which was quite nuts to learn."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Epic! Thanks for the heads up. I have MDD and have been in line for a Yale U psilocybin trial for almost a year. After multiple life-reaffirming/-changing experiences on mushrooms I’m really hoping they achieve federal legalization someday. (Also doesn’t hurt that I threw a quarter of my Roth into CMPS back in February).

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t a lot of people microdose
Mushrooms daily?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"But I think what you're missing is that depression is just the tip of the iceberg for psychedelics. You don't need recurring patients if you just have a lot of patients. 

One example: group sessions for people with social anxiety (which is basically everyone to some extent). Just taking it in a group to develop a deeper connection with your fellow man. I could see otherwise healthy people wanting to do this yearly.

Also group sessions help keep costs down.

Keep in mind that once a drug is FDA approved, it can be prescribed ""off label"" for different conditions at the discretion of the doctor."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You can absolutely micro dose psilocybin and use it every day. All of these medical trials aren't based on getting people completely high and seeing shit lol.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the real reason I have held off for now - funnily enough I was microdosing shrooms while trading the legendary Jan squizzle and that shit is amazing - like adderall from nature.. So it could be something like that where they make psilocybin infused products that lift mood etc.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It really depends on the regulations regarding the clinics. If you need 1 highly trained therapist per patient, then yeah it's expensive. 

But this therapy is probably even more effective when done in a group with many patients. And that also helps keep costs down. Ancient psychedelic rituals have always been done in groups."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are several conflicting studies on micro dosing true - there are also studies showing SSRIs are a placebo as well. 

Good to be skeptical but please note CMPS does a macro dose combined with therapy and that does have studies to back it up. Several from John Hopkins,  imperial college of London, etc. A macro dose of psilocybin for depression seems to be the most studied of the indications thus far. 

A microdose of DMT , LSD, mushrooms etc is a bit murkier but I personal believe it works and more studies are being conducted (formally with the FDA and informally)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, patenting is pretty much the only way of covering your ass in the pharma business. If CMPS doesn’t do it, someone like J&J will. It’s a fucked up game but can you blame CMPS for trying to carve themselves a niche? For investors, this is good news. If you disagree with the ethical side that’s another ordeal, but one that can only be fixed by changes in the IPR/legal system."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Microdosers tend to do every four days but there are few rules hard rules.  

There are companies testing mid range doses daily though. At that level the theory is you won’t be tripping but it would elevate your mood. This company in particular is looking at it for social anxiety to compete with SSRIs. 

Doses and frequency are still very much up in the air."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What are the other stocks in the psychedelic market that you follow? I was looking to throw some money at this as soon as I can offload my AMC bags.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thoughts on Numi? I have most of my portfolio in NUMI and like their team,financial situation and direction so far even if it's a little scattered. 

I wonder if telemedicine would really be profitable given the nature of psycadelics and how potent they could be? As someone who trips sits fairly regularly I have hard time imagining some of my friends having a good trip if I wasn't presently with them. 

I will have to do more research on the application of telemedicine clearly thanks!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I could never figure this out.  Psilocybin is 4-5 hrs.   It's a lot of hrs for a professional to attend to.  I can't currently picture insurance paying out a lot for group therapy.

The appeal of this ""natural"" medicine is that a big pharma *doesn't* own it.  If  psilocybin therapy is legitimized, there's not a reason to go to a specific pharma to obtain it for therapy.  The therapist's skills are key, but how does that translate to a stock value??"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a hard time believing the current corporate U.S system will support that but I agree. There is nothing wrong with this being done in a group setting
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks I'm in this ETF and realize it's in their holdings but I'd also like to be able to invest individually in my favorites but since I can only get mmed, cybin, seelos and numi, well I guess I'll just let the ETF do the work for me."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Without the regulations? FDA approval for psilocybin and MDMA is right around the corner. It's been in the making for some time.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically any mental/neurological disorder involving being stuck in dysfunctional patterns: just about any addiction, insecurities, .. everything

So many issues in the body come from dysfunctional muscle activation patterns. Psychedelics can help make you more aware of the aches and pains in your body and can help you get to the bottom of them. 

The scientists studying it now are really only scratching the surface. 

Honestly it's just generally good for improving health if used correctly. There are risks of course."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What company is this? Numinous Wellness? (Trades with a different ticker in US if so, just want to be sure)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd assume the telemedicine he's talking about is more for the pre/post session integration work. I could be wrong
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out Field Trip Health. They're focusing on training therapists and opening clinics (starting with ketamine for depression, which is already legal). 

Once a company gets a drug FDA approved, I believe they have 5 years of exclusive rights to administer the drug in the US. It's not much, but there's potential there to leverage that period of exclusive rights, as long as there's other companies like Field Trip Health ready to scale it to many patients in many states. 

And MindMed is branching out into different patentable pursuits like AI technology. I think that's super interesting and promising."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is my take TRD and MDD are very much related.

""It is diagnosed when an individual has a persistently low or depressed mood, anhedonia or decreased interest in pleasurable activities, feelings of guilt or worthlessness, lack of energy, poor concentration, appetite changes, psychomotor retardation or agitation, sleep disturbances, or suicidal thoughts."" You have to have at least 5 of those.

TRD 
""Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) typically refers to inadequate response to at least one antidepressant trial of adequate doses and duration. TRD is a relatively common occurrence in clinical practice, with up to 50% to 60% of the patients not achieving adequate response following antidepressant treatment.""
So basically someone with MDD who doesn't respond well to treatment.

Source: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12706951/

As long as the meds have been approved for the treatment of depression, there is no separate need to redo the trials for TRD or MDD. 

I'm still not sure this is a hovering since there is esketamine already available which is providing decent results. 

Bottom line.... I'm putting it on my watch list since I don't know shit about shit, except biochemistry."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t mean wide spread use making it a profitable ‘business’ though does it?  I just don’t believe the psychedelic biz is a profit driven business is all
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you involved in this work? I have a keen interest in psychedelics and body function, particularly the neuromuscular system."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive been holding both I hope this news is good for it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It is yes!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's most likely and totally the way to to!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I just don’t believe the psychedelic biz is a profit driven business is all

Anything in particular lead you to that conclusion?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The drug developers get 5 years of exclusive rights to administer the drug once FDA approved. But I think the long-term profit is in the companies setting up clinics (like Field Trip Health) and doing other patentable things like things with AI and telemedicine.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm quite involved. I get high and do yoga/balance/basic movement training quite regularly. Very helpful for improving the alignment of your body. 

I actually think cannabis is probably better for helping you learn to use your body in new ways. The only downside to cannabis is that it doesn't have the same neuroplasticity effects, so you're more likely to revert back to old patterns afterwards. I wonder if microdosing a classical psychedelic like psilocybin for the neuroplasticity along with cannabis for the incredible body awareness would be a good combo for treating these sorts of issues. 

I'm not sure it's feasible to use psilocybin by itself for this purpose. I've never used psilocybin, only LSD, but my experience is that yoga on cannabis is much more insightful for neuromuscular issues than on LSD.

If cannabis is used by itself, you really need to document what you learn so you can come up with a training plan to solidify those new patterns afterwards."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Patent protection will differ (including length of time). A new indication for an existing drug will be a few years while creating a new molecule will be much longer (I think around a decade). CMPS created a new compound with comp360.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is really cool and I'm very interested as well. I first heard of the medicinal benefits of psychedelics about 10 years ago from a co-worker. He suffered from cluster headaches every spring and he'd have to take about 2-3 months off of work every year. He had tried everything and the only thing he found that actually worked for him was LSD. But it was difficult to obtain obviously.

Then more recently, I've been researching scientific solutions for alcohol use disorder and addiction in general and have read quite a bit on the brain and neuroplasticity. I have addiction issues as well as a close loved one and I'm not interested in traditional 12 step, faith based programs. I belong to several alcohol free groups and the psychedelic research has come up a few times - more and more frequently recently. 

I know there's quite a bit of research being done in academic settings which is amazing. Cannabis is legal here and I know a lot of people with addiction issues and mental health issues have used it with great success. I have tried though and CBD does nothing for me. THC - well I truly hate the way it makes me feel. I've tried playing around with strains and doses because I know that's the issue but it makes me crazy paranoid. Plus as you mentioned it does not have the neuroplasticity affects which I think is very key when discussing all types of addiction. I think psychedelics could be huge in the area of addiction. Right now there aren't a lot of medical, scientific methods for dealing with AUD. Naltrexone is probably the best but it does have a lot of side effects for a lot of people and doesn't always work."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you get a chance to try MDMA or psilocybin in a therapeutic setting. I think it could help
2021-03-22 00:55:21,wallstreetbets,"Target Q1 Earnings will crush it Q4 for Target wasn’t too hot I’ll admit. Got crushed playing earnings on the stock for the first time holding through the results. But I believe that Q1 will be vastly different. Q4 had loads of holidays sales, meaning profit margins were down. They also gave more hours to employees to keep up with the demand... but here’s the kicker. Demand isn’t slowing at all but hours are down. Plus no holiday sales. The Karens and various other creatures that prowl Target are now locked n loaded with stimulus checks. Just go to your local target bruh. It’s packed as shit and they’ve got maybe like 2-3 people on the registers. Cutting costs, no big sales cutting margins, and a steady flow of people stampeding to go into target will cause a massive earnings beat in May when they report again. So you might be wondering... “okay so we’re probably 2 months away from the next earnings report isn’t this priced in or will be priced in?” 

Probably not. I predict Target will eclipse 200 and trade sideways until they report earnings in May. Even if they are above 200 when they report.. I think loading up post earnings calls 5-10% OTM will print nicely for anyone brave enough to take them. 

I don’t know how much attention this post will get because WallStreetBets has changed a lot lol. All I see is gamestonk this amc that. That’s what happens when a bunch of normies invade a Sub-Reddit that used to actually have lots of good investment/yolo ideas that were backed by decent fundamentals. 

TLDR:

TGT is loved by Karens and people spend all their money there idk why. Buy 5-10% OTM calls post earnings in May

EDIT: I currently own 4 195/200 July 16 bull spreads and plan on grabbing May/July calls as it gets closer to Q1 earnings"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work there and like all employees I have access to our store sales, and my store is crushing sales. But that has also required us to start throwing hours at people. I think you're right but Target is a buy and hold. Long term, could hit $1k but that's years after all the remodels are complete. Brian Cornell, is the CEO and came over from Amazon of all places and has done an excellent job pushing important changes and updates to the company. This is not a company I'd buy options on, I own a couple of shares in my Fidelity account, and then some through my 401k. Aside from some sort of hack, or another ""bathroom issue"" like we had it's not a bad buy, but I don't expect it to print.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit I just did some googling & Dian Fossey was chopped up with a machete by poachers in Africa back in the 80s . Theres also been netflix documentaries made about her. 

I thought this was just a random gorilla org one of you found to donate to.. didnt realize there was such a deep story behind this organization."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I know she means well but calling us financial analysts is a bit much lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am in tears. I am so proud that we are saving these gentle giants-that need protecting. Also this organization is amazing-the money is going to where it should go. Nevermind that DFGF gets us... we embraced them and they embraced us back. I pledge that no matter what happens with GME I will continue to support DFGF. My personal goal is to adopt every gentle giant-the whole family. I do not know who started this, but I for one will not let it end."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg that’s so amazing. Uuuuugh, I want to participate in WSB so much! I want to donate to Kakapo conservation...

Actually, I think I will anyway. Though I sure would like a GME share..."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they can relate to us more than we give them credit for. Can you imagine the red tape, bureaucracy and corruption that they have to deal with to save these animals? They are literally risking their lives while holding the line for apes.

May GME skyrocket and Dian Fossey gets unlimited tendies."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love all you apes. This shit makes me cry diamonds.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dian Fossey woman: ""Fuck that gorilla shit. Gonna buy a lambo with that money."""

The posts about taxes, the posts warn people about scams, The posts encouraging people, and god damn it the post saying to message people if you are feeling down legit had me crying. THis is just one more man. I’ve been a part of some awesome teams but there is something special here. A group of degenerates standing together strong and who claim the name apes and take the step to put their money where their mouths are … Thank you for welcoming me, thanks for motivating me, thanks for teaching me.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going to order some t-shirts. What an amazing bunch of apes in this sub. 

Here is a video I saw a few years ago of an encounter with wild gorillas in Uganda. It really stuck with me how amazing they are. It's about 4:34 and worth a watch. I thought it was a great distraction from watching tickers and inspirational. Without these foundations and support from us hairless apes, this kind of encounter wouldn't be possible.

But honestly, a regard like me knowing about numbers and stuff? 🤣🤣🤣"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is beautiful. The story about the one gorilla protecting the little baby gorillas really got me. I hope that we all continue donating to them because this is legitimately beautiful.

It's like she truly gets us, and knows what we're into. Viva this lady and her work!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boy if gme finally goes to the moon and beyond. They will get blown away. There are probably thousands of apes here, who had not so much money to spare. If there are many bananas sharing is easier. :D"

Melvin and such never donates per capita of their winnings like we did...imagine.if for every 25Mil they won they donated 420k to the apes and such...how much capital for good could Melvin Capital raise if their face wasn't buried in their money trough...have they ever donated or been custodians of anything that doesnt benefit themselves..? unlikely besides for tax write off purposes 

dont forget to write off your donations fellow mongrels"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sooo nice
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I plan to donate *after* I cash out my GME tendies, whenever that is.

But guys... Can you imagine the effect this might have on the long term survival of gorillas on this planet? 100 years from now, this event could be the reason they were able to repopulate the Earth in great numbers.

This is awesome & I look forward to donating... **after** the squeeze, of course. :)"

She was in many NatGeo mags when I was a kid and the work she did was very unusual for the time. 

Let's keep donating guys."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Chills
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol ape like ape
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone buy this lady a share of GME!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"She thinks we talk about stock values and economic forecasts, nobody tell her."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely so happy to support this amazing cause.....awesome work
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"🙂 I got my act together and donated to the Fossey charity this morning (through the website).  So now I’m officially an ape.  My brothers have advised me strongly against investing in AMC or GME at my (ahem) 🙁age, but a show of solidarity is in my budget."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,For hurmbel 🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ma'am, we are not finacial analysts... this is a casino."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks to this foundation i'm finally a milf
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is so great and also so hilarious
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. But what does this organization do to fight armed poachers?

2. Dian Fossey had left an unsigned ""will"" leaving her $4.9M estate to the Digit Fund later called the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund International. Why did Dian Fossey's mother Hazel Fossey Price take over the $4.9M estate instead leaving the Digit Fund NOTHING ($0). Hazel Fossey Price (aka Turbo Bitch) gave a statement in 1988 she ""was working on a project to preserve the work her daughter had done for the mountain gorillas in Rwanda"" but nothing was ever announced...If Dian Fossey's own mother didn't believe in this organization why should anyone else?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,APES TOGETHER STRONG
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes. together. strong.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I might have cried
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope people watch this all the way through. They did a great job on it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I was getting choked up watching this.  I keep saying this, wall street is telling us we don't know what we are doing and that the money we are making it better in their hands...

Watching something like this drives home how much better that money is in our hands. The tsunami of positivity is touching so many lives around this planet, while with them it sits in bank accounts and to buy a 15th home.  I don't think anyone went into GME to upset the power balance, but I sure as shit am staying to send this message. Never forget they made the decision to turn us into this movement.

Apes. Together. Strong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not crying your crying
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats actually awesome marketing right there
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gave me goosebumps.

This was amazing. I may have even teared up. wtf

edit: had to get the [t-shirt.](https://store.gorillafund.org/products/apes-together-strong-t-shirt)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the cutscene animation. So realistic.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fully expected her to say it in the end, but I still died when she said it. Apes. Together. Strong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mods this guy needs a flair.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Aww I cried a little - hope they know when we go to the moon they're coming with us :D
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It feels so good when you call us apes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Genuinely brought a tear to my eye. Well done all you excellent donators
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for being the liaison here, this whole thing has been even more fun because of the communication. Seeing a personalized update is the kind of weekend post that reminds me that big bets aren't the only thing that makes WSB a wild group to be in. Just when I think I've seen it all, y'all always surprise me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How much do we have to donate to get a building named WallStreetBets (perhaps a center for mildly retarded apes?)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I really love the fact that Tara and the Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund continues to express their gratitude and thanks to the impact WSB has made with their donations and support. So wholesome. Thank you for putting this together u/kampingcarl
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Loved the lambo drive 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! Please more of this, we need to keep this going ❤️🦍"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the 80s, pre 87 crash. This stock will go on forever!

Gorilla is good!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sloinki, Polish descent ?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Big thanks  to you Carl and a special thanks to the wonderful, beautiful, Tara."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the Update. Just beautiful 😊
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just an FYI for people, in case they want more background on the founder. There's a movie about Dian Fossey called ""Gorillas in the Mist"". It came out in 1988 and Dian is played by Sigourney Weaver. Haven't watched it in a very long time but it was a good movie."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a great video, thank you for the updates!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Expect more generosity after the moon, as a bunch of us retards have every last one of our bananas in gme, lol."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Carl!

This wholesome put gave me and a bunch of folks here a warm fuzzy feeling!

Apes. together. strong!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if they took all that donated money, and bought more gme"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So well done. Tara is an amazing champion for the fund. her presence, articulation of the issues and general warmth have me in tears."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've already told my wife that when GME moons and we make fat stacks, we'll be making a sizeable donation to a local alley cat rescue and the local food bank.  And I'll probably be sobbing happy tears when we hand deliver those checks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly nothing is more delicious than the fact that, you know, like, actually helping out other people seems to be the ultimate way to say “fuck you” to hedge funds.

Like how do you even find a way to consider yourself not a piece of shit as a human being if other people are literally helping people and animals just to spite you, because it’s everything you are against in life."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a dream last night that GME mooned. It was all the DD I needed to prepare to buy more shares at market open today.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Once Gme moons I'll be shocked if they don't receive millions
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm used to 12 second gifs. I usually don't watch longer reddit videos. I'm so glad I stuck around for that. I laughed heartily. That was awesome.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It wan’t even Lambo, looked more like McLaren or Ferrari. Hope we could finally afford Lambo once we are done with GME and not some TKMaxx version of sports car."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The animation had me dying. 🤣🤣🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought my Tee as well and can’t wait for GME to moon so I can adopt my 🦍.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I really love how they are handling the situation and posting updates
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Putting this on my resume right now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets, Maybe she's an analyst therapist. She's very encouraging.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Already updated my CV!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe she's trolling us
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Ma'am, this is a casino.""

But I was legit tearing up by the end."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,me too. the silverback protecting the babies agh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that there was a spiel on ""why save gorillas?"" actually made me question some shit.

""Why is that even necessary? Who needs that? There should be no question about why. It's just what we do. Why is that not what we do? Fuck.""

I get that there's some people who'd say ""fucking gorillas, whatever, who cares?"", but still... we care so fucking little about some important shit.

Anyway, rant done. Sorry."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's Meme Magic
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Memes are the new wave of advertising
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it, subtle, like I could wear it without having to explain things to people who'd see me in it having just heard about wall street bets in places where... well, anywhere. There's just no explaining some things."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say no more.
1 for me, 1 for the husband... if they had kids sizes the mini apes would get them too"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Limited edition too, need to check if I'm getting 1 or 2, but definitely getting it, thanks for the heads up."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t wait to get one and donate once this goes past the moon 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I get to the ape diamond hands one!? I can't click it!?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The shipping is ridiculous. It's 33$ for me. I would rather add that 33$ as a donation than give it UPS :/
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Next we crowdfund to investigate her death post mooning so we can put a hit and buy puts on the mother fucker that murdered her.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got my hoodie also!👍🦍❤️
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh dang they had hoodies? I missed out :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed when she said financial analysis and economic forecasts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,She never claimed we were good at it!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m so glad you’re a country where the news is still reported as news. Here in America, unfortunately, the “news” is bought and sold with spin on it. Starting in the late 20th century, uber wealthy people gradually bought up the newspaper companies, & then they bought out the TV news stations. I’m happy for you guys, & glad to find out the movement is being reported. Btw, a big shout out to The World Apes for their support. I hear they’re even buying stocks!! I’ve heard reports out of Germany, the UK, Europe, HK., Canada ( thank you neighbor)!—We owe you all a great thanks & we send you some 🦍❤️
& wish us all ☮️.  Now, where did I put that blue crayon...hmm... I wonder, behind the couch?..."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt they're being paid.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget Jim Cramer's Tears. He's adorable.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe her mother was a greedy bitch who wanted the money for herself, and they showed in the video that they literally send men to guard the gorillas individually from like 30 feet away. And by working with the locals (would-be poachers, destroyers of habitat) they are making long term gains. The number of mountain gorillas has over quadrupled under their watch."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was so happy when she said that.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tara saying Apes Together Strong at the end definitely had me laugh-crying. This update was heart warming!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Might have... Did.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,New org slogan IMO.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Naturally, it should be “Apes Together Strong”"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't hold many GME shares. But one of them is dedicated for my fellow apes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m glad it wasn’t just me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, I held out well until she said ""Apes together strong"" - that bit tipped me over the edge."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a couple of GME shares once it moons
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the animation cut, that's so funny"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are loads of Polish surnames in the US, most cities have a road called Pulaski pike/road etc."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got emotional reading this and thinking about getting to donate fat checks to my local Feeding America and Veteran’s center.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wonderful and it makes me so happy to see many peoples goals in this sub is to help others; one of the reasons Im really hoping the price will go to the moon is that I have lists of people Id want to donate to and commission art pieces from then dropping some heavy tips
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing would piss them off more than us distributing the wealth even further. They don’t understand that we’re not like them. We’re real people and most of us are painfully familiar with what it’s like to live in poverty. Oh, and we have souls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the feeling that after GME really takes off they will get literal millions in donations.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep shed a tear in that story.. plus when she said “apes together strong”
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just got 2, trying to double my position"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Boyfriend just misses out?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, it's one t-shirt, you're trying to click on the photo of the back of it...

Are you sure you don't want to just move in there? I'm thinking it might be *your place*.

Jesus Christ, and to think that hedge funds and the media see us as a systemic threat... It's only going to be through sheer fucking stupidity."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's the backside of the t-shirt 🦍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't miss the animation in be middle
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely. I'm so fucking proud of you apes.

I also wanted to take a second and give a shout out to whomever started this trend. You picked a fantastic fucking organization for us to bandwagon. 

They responded to our bandwagon by not only immediately providing us context for how the monies would be used, but also gave us fucking meme t-shirts to buy, and put a lambo hucking bags of money in this video.

I adopted the father/child pair and bought four shirts, and I'm really proud of what we all did; even if some of us just did it so we could shitpost about it."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought one as soon as I saw their tweet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If I buy the GME option from E*TRADE they should throw in the T-shirt for the apes...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think in this situation it would be the husbands girlfriend missing out?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,😄 thats a true story. I'd like a 5 second screen appearance in the movie when we're at this part in the timeline of me trying to buy a shirt
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooooh. Holy shit, am I retarted?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you guys just become best friends?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha no way. I'm not sure how I'd feel about meeting him irl. His business practices are shady and I'm definitely going to be taking his money, but he is a human being and raised a large business by himself so there's still respect there. I'd probably say hello, wish him the best of luck at Wendies and then proceed to draw dicks on his office windows."
2021-03-22 00:05:21,wallstreetbets,"TSLA fundamentals analysis - why it's not overvalued ARK’s latest price target for Tesla has been the subject of a lot of discussion lately. They believe it will reach $3000 per share in the next 5 years, which based on its current market price of $654 implies about a 50% annual rate of return. If you haven’t already, you can take a look at the [article](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/) they published explaining how they arrived at this price target and the assumptions they made.

I recently got [downvoted](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m8pntp/weekend_discussion_thread_for_the_weekend_of/grq28wo/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) for suggesting that this price target wasn’t illogical and that Cathie wasn’t crazy. So I wanted to explain my reasoning a bit more so that more people can downvote me and tell me why I’m wrong.

Now just to be clear, I’m not here to argue about whether EVs are the future, whether existing car companies are unprepared to switch to EV, or whether Tesla is an insurance play. I’m assuming that you’re already interested in investing in Tesla and the only thing stopping you is its valuation.

**P/E. It’s over 1000! But is it a useful metric?**

P/E seems to be the most common argument for why Tesla is overvalued. Why buy Tesla at 1023 P/E when you could buy GM at 14 P/E or even Workhorse at 23 P/E?

Let’s step back a bit. Companies can be categorized into one of three stages: growth, maturity, and decline. P/E is useful for valuing mature companies against their mature competitors, since all other things being equal we’d expect their P/Es to eventually equalize as well. For example, I recently bought Target partly because of its P/E of 22 vs Walmart’s 28 and Costco’s 34 (although one could argue that some/all of these companies are still in their growth stage).

On the other hand, P/E is less useful when looking at companies in the growth and decline phases. You could find companies with P/E below 1, but they may be value traps rather than automatic buys. If they go out of business next year, their stock will be worthless.

P/E is similarly flawed when looking at growth stocks. P/E doesn’t account for whether a company is spending a lot aggressively re-investing in itself, or if a company has small earnings now but a good chance of quickly growing into a much larger market. If you had the chance to buy a loss-making company now at $1B market cap now, knowing that its addressable market will quickly expand to $100B, you’d still make a profit over the long term, even buying at massively “inflated” P/E.

That said, P/E is still useful for measuring risk in a growth stock or upside in a declining stock. If Tesla were to transition from growth to maturity or decline, there’s no doubt its P/E and share price would decline significantly. But risk is part of growth investing; this risk exists with other growth stocks too.

**Forward P/E**

While Tesla’s trailing P/E is 1023, its forward P/E is a high but less eye-popping 119. Trailing P/E is calculated by dividing the stock’s market value by its share price, while forward P/E is calculated by dividing the company’s estimated earnings in the following year by its share price. Forward P/E is a more error-prone and risky metric since nobody knows what a company will earn in the future. But it can still be useful when considering the price of a stock, since the market tends to price in expected future performance.

Comparing to some other popular growth stocks, Tesla’s forward P/E is still high but not unreasonable. PINS has 58, SHOP has 227, NFLX has 40. And at least it’s positive. Many growth stocks such as NIO, NKLA, lucid, PLTR, and LMND don’t expect to be profitable within the next year.

And while Tesla’s P/E is high it’s difficult to make a direct comparison with these mentioned companies since they’re not profitable companies in the EV space. There really isn’t another profitable EV company to compare forward P/E with, and that uniqueness/first mover advantage could be partly why Tesla trades at a high forward P/E.

That said, Tesla is still overpriced if (unfairly) comparing against mature auto-makers; GM is at 10 forward P/E, F is at 8. But if you believe those companies have a chance to become EV growth companies and won’t be weighed down by their mature/declining combustion businesses, I’d argue that’s more of a reason to buy them than to sell Tesla.

**Price-to-sales**

If a company is re-investing in itself aggressively, it may be incurring costs that aren’t part of its core business. Once growth slows, it may be able to cut these expenses and dramatically improve its P/E. To account for this, we can look at price to sales.

TSLA’s price-to-sales is 20. For comparison, SHOP is at 47, PLTR is at 40, FVRR is at 42, NIO is at 27, NKLA is chilling at 63619, lucid is at infinity since it doesn’t have sales yet. It’s quite an oversimplification to make these comparisons without considering what portion of a company’s expenses is related to operating costs. SHOP has better margins than TSLA for example, since it’s in a totally different business. But nevertheless, one could argue TSLA is currently undervalued by this metric, even compared to other EV companies.

**A historical example**

Another common argument is that the whole market is overvalued right now, and this is especially the case for growth stocks. I don’t pretend to know what the market will do in the short term, and I’m certainly not discounting the possibility of a further rotation out of growth in the near future. But I know that eventually the market will rotate back into growth stocks. You may have looked like a fool buying Amazon or Microsoft at the height of the dot com bubble, but if you held until now, you’d get the last laugh.

So let’s look at an example from a time when there was less talk about stocks being overvalued. Facebook IPO’d in 2012 at a P/E of 91.2 and price to sales of 24 ([source](https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndobosz/2012/05/17/facebook-is-flat-out-expensive-compared-to-google-at-ipo/?sh=5c83b70c6d03)). Both FB at the time and TSLA now have an annual growth rate of about 45%.

If we take Tesla’s forward P/E, this comparison actually makes Tesla’s price look reasonable, even though Tesla currently trades in a market with record high average P/E.

**Market cap**

One last note - market cap. Yes, Tesla’s market cap is quite high as it’s already one of the most valuable companies in the world. At $654B, if Tesla actually reached $3000 per share it would be the most valuable company in the world (unless other top companies continue to grow as well, which is likely).
The global market for EVs is expected to grow to $800B by 2027, from $162B in 2019. If this is accurate, and you believe Tesla retains its market share and current valuation, without expanding into other areas like ride hailing and insurance, then  the EV market ~5Xing could justify Tesla’s share price ~4.5Xing.

**Tl;dr**

While Tesla is certainly overvalued by trailing P/E, this is a somewhat flawed metric, and by looking at other metrics like forward P/E, price-to-sales, and growth rate, an argument can be made that Tesla is more-or-less fairly valued, and potentially even undervalued. This argument holds even if looking at historical examples from less frothy markets, such as FB after its IPO in 2012.

Like any growth stock, Tesla is a high-risk investment, since its future share price depends on future growth of both the company and the EV space. But the potential for reward is also higher.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't get all these negative Nancys.  I'm long on TSLA.

Tesla is the Apple of cars, except that they are like Apple that owns Foxconn.

They sell every single vehicle that they make.  One bigger factory is ramping up this year (Shanghai), one bigger factory is going to start production (Berlin) and one more factory will start production next year (Austin) - and these are likely a bit pessimistic timelines.

Tesla is making big innovations in the car manufacturing space - forming the body in two big pieces (front and back casting) instead of dozens of pieces that need to be welded or glued together like every other company (including Tesla prior to the Gigapress coming online).

There are only a few currently shipping credible competitors - Mustang EV (teething problems and battery supply constrained), Kia/Hyundai EVs (battery supply constrained), Porsche/Audi Taycan chassis (a generation or two behind in efficiency - range - and battery constrained), Toyota RAV4 PHEV (not a full EV, but a great choice, but battery constrained).  Battery constrained means the company cannot make enough vehicles to sell because they do not have batteries; I'm not talking about battery range here.

All of VW's new products on the MEB platform are fine if you're talking 2 generations ago competing with a Nissan Leaf.  They are too slow to be credible.  VW also did shady sales tactics to goose the year end sales numbers last year to make the ID.3/4 launch look good.  In Europe most of those sales are into sales channels (i.e. car dealers) and not customers.  Customers have not taken a bunch of deliveries of the ID models because it is an inferior product.

Renault Zoe (EU only) is a good product but is in the EU city car class.  It's more like a Fiat 500e sized vehicle (also a good product but battery supply constrained).  GM's Wuling (China only) is also a good product but it is kei-car sized and a lot of customers buy it to replace a moped.

Good luck to the new competitors trying to get off the ground (Rivian and Lucid have the best chance of actually delivering product).

The biggest issue for all these EV makers, from Ford to GM to Porsche (VW) is battery supply.  The second biggest issue is battery cost.

One cannot overestimate the advantage of having your own battery production factories.  None of the competitors have that.  I'm not sure if anyone is even planning to develop it (maybe only VW).  Most of them cannot develop battery production because of the capex involved - here is where you can leverage a high stock price into a competitive advantage.

Like Apple with things like screens or small hard drives (iPod), Tesla was an early mover on also buying batteries from 3rd party suppliers (Panasonic, CATL, etc.).  Apple gobbled up all the parts years in advance because they knew they could sell all the iPods/iPhones that it would go into.  Other companies could not bank on such sales projections and therefore could not buy tons of components.  Ergo they could design a great product but they could not get access to parts to build it and sell it.   All these other EV makers will fight amongst themselves for the limited battery supply left over after the Tesla purchases.  And lets not forget that Tesla will soon make its own batteries and lower its kwh costs versus the competition.

Apple does not dominate the phone market share - it just makes the most money from it.  Part of this is their walled garden subscription model.  I'm actually bearish on FSD as it relates to robotaxi but FSD as a monthly subscription model would work nicely.  

The other part of the company that gets overlooked is energy.  And not 5 years into the future energy stuff (big battery farms, making money from energy price arbitrage).  I'm talking about basic stuff like good old solar panels, not even the fancy solar tile stuff.  Tesla currently is the lowest cost company for putting solar panels on your house, for most (if not all) of the US.  ROI is about 7 years for most areas of the country.  Lots of densely populated areas are thinking of requiring all new builds to have solar.

In short I'm long on Tesla because

\- insane consumer demand (sells all it builds), plus insane future demand (cybertruck and semi)

\- more production capacity coming online than anyone else (perhaps even the entire car industry combined)

\- gigapress is a major innovation and cost reducer in the industry

\- makes its own batteries while competitors are supply constrained

\- currently dominates solar sales to end users

Just the above is enough for a PT of 1k by EOY imo.  Not financial advice because I love dandelion crayola crayons."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is the only game in town for EV's. Ford and GM have to deal with:

\- Massive capex to retool factories just so they can cannibalize their own market share and decrease profitability until scale is achieved. This is a decade long process.

\- A dealer network that they can't really unwind. If they make all their new electric models online only, the dealers will go out of business partway through the transition from ICE to electric and harm their sales. If they choose to make all vehicles available both online and in store, the same problem occurs. They could scale back the dealer network but it will cut into their market share over all and take a lot of time (a decade or more). The presence of dealerships actually does increase sales of your cars when you are competing with other companies that have dealerships. If they don't offer an online option, they won't sell as many cars. Catch 22. Declining market share, even if its temporary and in a legacy segment (ICE vehicles), looks bad to shareholders and GM and Ford are run by boomers, what do you think they will do?

\- A lack of charging network infrastructure that makes it seriously difficult to use their vehicles. Tesla has its own charging network, Ford has nothing.

\- Inferior tech and branding to Tesla in the eyes of the types of consumers most likely to early adopt EV's, giving them a slow start until they begin outright replacing ICE models and fully build out their charging network

I don't see Ford, GM, or VW being serious competitors in this space for a while. Tesla will remain the dominant EV company globally, if anyone buys a non-Tesla EV it will be because it's cheaper or because Tesla literally doesn't have enough to sell them one.

I didn't even mention self driving because who knows when that will be ready. But if you watch videos of the new beta version, it's getting a lot better. It's only really tricky, specialized areas with bizarre lanes and signage that trip it up. Probably 99% of the driving I've done in the last year could be done safely by this version of the beta or a slightly improved version that is more confident/aggressive when in intersections. They're really close, this is NOT vaporware. There's tens of billions in pure profit if Tesla can replace truckers with FSD software. I think this is inevitable, it's just a regulatory problem. And they will have it done for probably years before the competition catches up. Easily a three trillion dollar company if they accomplish this."

>if this is accurate, and you believe **Tesla retains its market share and current valuation**

You could've reduced your entire post to this point here. The rest of your post is, no offence, rather meaningless fluff based on forward earnings estimates that the market has already attempted to price in (hence the high valuation). 

Now, can Tesla keep it's current market share? Almost certainly not. While it is growing in terms of sales, it is losing % of the market share. Right now it's due to the fact that they're limited in production, but then, that's the case with practically every EV on the market right now. 

I'd say it's too early to call whether Tesla justifies it's valuation or not. Once production limits come off and more EVs are being sold than the market wants, that's when we'll know who the winners and losers are."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry a bit late to the party.  


Imo I find it hard to justify Arks price range for the stock specially for the bull case but also the 3000 range.  


Lets take the bull case. Where they estimate Tesla will sell 10 million cars. A google search estimate the numbers of cars sold in 2025 is about 100 million cars. Goldman Sachs have about the same estimates for 2025 - they estimate about 120 milliion cars sold.  


Lets say 100 million cars sold - that would mean 10% of all cars sold in 2025 will be a Tesla. That seems like a crazy high number, that they should burst in and claim 10% of the entire car market in just 4,5 years.  


Goldman Sachs estimates, that 5% of all cars sold in 2025 will be EV/Hybrid cars. So that is roughly 5 million that will be EV cars. Yet Tesla in the bull case will sell more than double of that. You could argue that Goldman is on the low point as more car makers and governments is spreeding up the transition. So we give Ark the benefit of the doubt, and say that 25% of all cars sold will be EV cars in 2025. That will still leave Tesla with nearly 50% market share. That in my ears sound a bit crazy.   


Then there is the idea of robotaxi - Goldman sachs also have estimation on willingsness of different generations to share cars. In the US it range between 4 and 18%. So I can't see how Ark can estimate those kind of revenues. [https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/technology-driving-innovation/cars-2025/](https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/technology-driving-innovation/cars-2025/)  


If we say, that Tesla can make that kind of revenue from sharing a ride, I would expect the car sales to drop also, meaning it will be even harder to reach the projected sale numbers of new cars.  


And with more compition in the market as more car makers switch over, I would think that margins pr. sold car will also get lower and lower.  


TL:DR: I think Ark pulled their estimates from an 8ball"

The only thing that will make TSLA stand out is if they come out with a true autopilot as this is the one area they are ahead leaps and bounds than the major auto companies."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think some of the flaw is that he's using 2019 numbers but comparing to current stock price. Assuming globally (huge flaw) that there was a similar uptick in EV market share as comparable to the US, that means that the EV market share grew by 28% (1.4% to 1.8%) or comparably 162B to \~200B. Forecasting 800B for 2027 would mean about a 22% increase (consistent with current trends) which if we hold TSLA EV share constant should mean equivalent increase in the stock price based on that (not including other factors which may have an outsized impact). Basing on Jan 1 stock price of \~$720 we should see a baseline of $880 for EOY (probably an underestimate based on the hype) and then a trend up to \~$2000 for 2025 EOY (not terribly off from ARK's 1500-3000 range). 

Now I believe there are some synergies and other areas where TSLA may actually increase it's growth rate beyond the markets 22% (Semi's, AI, Robotaxi, Batteries) and I feel that their data collection is far beyond what any other automaker currently has and is what will propel them faster in their AI development vs others who may have better engineers. I'm bumping my estimates up to 40% early on with the assumption that their leap ahead in batteries is what will have some distance over the next decade and may solidify them as the dominant player. So see $1000 by EOY with $2225 by 2025 EOY."

If you believe a stock is worth X in 5 years, then you should value it at X/(1+r)^5 today, where r is whatever annual rate you deem appropriate to the risk.

In point of fact TSLA has very clearly surpassed all of Ark's prior bear-case 2024 targets. In other words, using the prior model, just reset all of Ark's bear case probabilities to zero.  Then their 2024 median case of $7000 (pre-split, $1400 post-split) becomes the new bear case. Allow a little growth on top of that for 2024-->2025 and you get their new bear case for 2025 of $1500.

With the exception of highly trained stunt drivers (similar to the blue angels or whatever those stunt fighter jet pilots are called) no one would be able to pull that off. But autonomous cars would be able to do that consistently."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla wasn't even #1 to the mid range affordable EV market in the US, but they still dominate it today. People seem to forget this. The Bolt beat the Model 3 to the market, had a better range, and had a better cost.

The US has a unique set of circumstances that will let Tesla retain a 60-80% long term share there. (Namely, dealership resistance to EVs, and the charging situation for road trips, and Americans refusing to buy cars that can't road trip). The US charger situation is insanely well favored for Tesla dominance, and if you don't understand why this is then you should step far away from any EV investing. (No, EA cannot compete with superchargers).

They will climb back in Europe somewhat. Right now they have a VAT that competitors don't have, no Model Y, and no 25k EV. Two of these will change within the next 12 months.

Southeast asia they will remain a minority, but that's ok given that they can still take a decent slice. I think they will do better than all other western autos in China, but ultimately home grown companies will remain dominant there."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla's self-driving AI sucks, they are just posers, not serious competitors in the field. Waymo already has a working, commercial autonomous taxi service, and Tesla has little more than lane assist."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What apps are you going to sell on a car? Do you want instagram? Venmo? How many different functions can you add to a static object that only acts as an immovable display? 

What media will they sell? Movies? Games? Movie platforms are already well established and most people don't even use them, preferring subscription services. Also why would I want to buy a movie in my car? Am I gonna go sit in my garage for 2 hours and watch a movie on a display that is just a bit too small and just far enough to the right to make it uncomfortable after 30 minutes? 

Also why would I want to play a big high budget AAA game in my car on a small 60 hz screen when I can do it at home? 

Services? Tesla music streaming? Tesla cloud storage? Tesla news? Tesla fitness? What services could they possibly provide?

Every bit of software Tesla sells will always be limited by the fact it can only be used in a small, cramped space on a small screen with poor controls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Google has basically all data from search and nobody cares. Even China didn’t ban them for data collection reasons.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,... can you do maths? She's given it a 500% price target
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"(When I say she, I mean Ark, but also I do mean Cathie I guess)

She gave a $800 ($4000 pre-split) price target for the longest time whilst the stock was trading at roughly $60-$70 ($200 pre-split). So a roughly 1100% increase from there.

https://www.cnbc.com/2018/02/07/ark-chief-catherine-wood-sees-tesla-stock-going-to-4000.html

Almost everyone thought she was crazy at the time, mainly because most people don't understand exponential growth. She then increased it to $1400 ($7000 pre-split) in early 2020, and now she has a $3000 base case ($15000 pre-split).

We're gonna see the same cycle again, ""she's crazy"", ""oh wait, it happened"", ""she's super smart""... Repeat

Bear in mind, her price targets are more long term (4-5 years)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s retarded, one ships product, the other shits fantasies. It’s ridiculous to compare the 2, Milton should be jailed and nikola delisted."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nikola Tesla is a person though
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When nikola first came to the scene and some of their shenanigans started to unfold my biggest fear was that nikola was a Trojan horse to hurt Tesla. From the stupidest of people who would confuse the two based on the guy “Nikola Tesla” all the way to coward investors who would think that the EV space is doomed because of Nikolas failings
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Publicly they are leaps ahead. But the auto makers have plenty of R&D projects they aren't live testing in the world for liability reasons unlike Tesla. I wouldn't be surprised if the german automakers announced full real world self driving in a year or two on their higher price tiers.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is much more reasonable.  Tesla is more about the portfolio, not just the EV.  

The power of a strong leader is the key element here to leverage the entire portfolio towards a single vision, as we saw in the past with apple.  Apple tech/engineering wasn't superior (basically repackaged existing tech in shiny plastic), but they were all working in the same direction so people got a consistent experience.  

Modern car conglomerates have to play politics, as does google (who is leading in AI).  This means customers risking their product support being dropped in a few years (ex: various vehicle lines and google message apps).  

Tesla is definitely overvalued in theory, but the lack of credible competition ensures stellar growth."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All memes must die
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I appreciate the insight from someone more knowledgeable than me when it comes to valuations. You are right to imply that it’s ridiculous to expect Tesla to meet Ark’s conditions three years earlier. 

Still, I am uneasy about buying now at its current valuation. It seems as though a lot of the positive things that Tesla will do in the future has already been priced in and that the current price seems unsustainable and subject to an extreme degree of volatility (which is obviously expected given that we’re talking about TSLA here). 

What do you think and what are you personally doing?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I find the Random capitalization of Some Words to significantly Increase the reliability of your Analysis.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volkswagen and GM will not be a leading company for at least a decade. Yes, they can take the market share but superiority of tech is pretty obvious at this point. It would take at least 10 years for them to catch up with Tesla. That 10 years is assuming that they will focus their capital in investing into technological development to develop the tech for automation and EV."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean like when GM kept up with Toyota and then went bankrupt because they lost all competitive edge and had to be bailed out (along with the collective American automakers) in 2008? Just like that?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because you can't even take that Taycan or mach e on a road trip in the US.

You bought a car with training wheels.

The Bolt beat the Model 3 to the market at a lower cost and higher range, but it still failed because it has training wheels.

And it not only failed, it never sold more than 10% of the Model 3 despite having better stats and a lower cost.

Tesla is such an easy buy because there are so many idiots who try to invest without having any knowledge of why Tesla is such a big leader. It's like being the only person in the world who knows why the iPhone is preferable to BlackBerry, but nobody is investing in Apple."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think he's dumb. Mentality unstable, perhaps, given his random twitter rants, but he's clearly a very smart dude. I say that as someone who doesn't really like him."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had to chose between those two.. yes.

But I think neither is the best option."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">  who are more Ford fanboys than people who want the best EV on the market.

This is untrue, Ford has stated only 1/5th of buyers of the Mach-E were previous Ford owners"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,VW updates over the air as well though..
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you actually want OTA updates for your car, you deserve OTA updates IMO."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So? They're doing it, who cares why?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Okay. Try shorting Tesla and see what happens in 5 years
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What's autobidder and dojo?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty normal for Tesla. I've seen my investment go up and down 70% so many times over my past 5-6 years of holding it.

Still beat index returns by many, many times though. I expect the same will happen by 2026."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla sucks at self-driving. They still crash into walls and parked vehicles, get confused by paper bags carried by the wind. Waymo is light years ahead - they operate commercial Level 4 autonomous taxi service already they don't even need safety drivers anymore, while Tesla struggles with proper Level 2 driver's assistance system. They are not even in the same line of business as Waymo. If other car manufacturers like Volkswagen wanted to leapfrog Tesla at self-driving capabilities all they have to do is to buy license from Waymo."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This same argument has been made for 10 years, even after the release of Tesla killers like the Bolt."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Then it's truly riperino for TSLA.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think the current FSD Beta videos are evidence of failure, you are utterly clueless about how AI works, how it is developed, and what matters in terms or hardware and software."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We will see! I wish you a successful moon landing and accompanying tendies, but my own view is that Tesla is very overvalued at this price. My price target for the company is below $300."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 100 shares and a couple deep straddle leaps but I feel like it's and the EV market as a whole will crash and may never recover if the boomer cars convert thier factories to EV.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">... can you do maths?

I'm sorry, is that an honest question? Pretty sure we both already know the answer to that given the state of this sub."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What would you rather hold? $TURD or $NKLA?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not brutal enough imo, too many newbies from January still around"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,.....this is them being incredibly lenient lmao.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty sure that guy is out to hurt everyone, not just tsla.

I mean, he's probably trying to actually make something. It's just, it's all so shitty. everything about it. He stole things from TSLA designs, then patented it, his name is a cheap knock-off of TSLA, he himself is obviously a fucking slime ball. I've watched interviews with the CEO, and he's just... slimy. 

I liked NKLA for a momentum swing, but that was about it. Now it needs to die."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gravity powered truck sounds way more badass than the scam they pulled.  The fact that they even did it is enough to show their integrity.  If they ever do put out a vehicle, can we trust them to build a quality product, or will customers get absolute garbage quality that's advertised as premium new tech?

I'll sure as fuck never trust them.  Gravity powered truck can go where gravity takes them.  Straight down the shitter."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"VW announced their ""Model 3 Rival Car"" will come in 2025 with Level 4"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"personally im with Ron Baron and Cathie on this one...

tesla saw 50% yoy growth for YEARS and the stock stagnated. 

finally it began to catch up. ""longer the base, higher the run up"" as they say"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"what do we say to the lord of death?

memes - not today"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on TSLA. If I had free cash flow, I'd buy more.

I don't really care what the market does in 1 week or even 6 months... anything can happen in that time, because investors are sheep and sheep will sheeple and chase each other off a cliff.

If TSLA is going to be worth $3000 in 5 years, then today it is a steal at $650. It is a steal at $1000. It is a steal at $1500.  It is an extremely good damn deal at $2000.  At $1500 or $2000 there might be better deals or steals, but only if you know what they are. For my part I'm actually looking ahead 10 years, not 5 years.

Maybe it will dip down to $400 or $200 and be an even better steal for a brief moment... but maybe it won't. I'm not going to miss out on the ride up because I waited for a lower stop to get on."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,it looks like they are a native german speaker
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well Audi declared already that they won't Work on their combustion Tech and Invest Fully Into EV. I think VW or any Other established Car Producer will do the Same. It shouldn't Take a decade to Catch Up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok? Who gives a fuck? Taking road trips is incredibly god damn boomer. This is further reflected in the fact that mid-size sedans are literally sized for road trips and surprise, nobody is buying those boomer turds.

Your average person 99% of the time only needs to drive < 40 miles to and from work every day and thats it.

Hell, at the $100k price range, why the fuck are you road tripping with a car. You get yourself some plane tickets using some of those dollars you shit. Otherwise you are only having some fun around town, and commuting to work as well.

&#x200B;

If you can't see why the Bolt doesn't sell you are dumb. The Bolt is fucking 164"" long, it's competing with a fucking Honda Fit and Mazda 2 and Toyota Yaris for small.

The three cars being so unpopular in the US because it's tiny for ourfatasses, that they all  got discontinued in the last few years in the US."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This exactly. Uber in no way was about self driving cars. They sold that lie hard 
And what do you know, in the last year they cut back on the R&D"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Robotaxi require huge technological advancement. Only company that is close to do it is Tesla. Uber will not be able to do it before Tesla can do it. Uber can buy the taxi from Tesla tho.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Proof that you have zero clue about the EV market: you think insurance companies try to compete over EVs.

There's a 500% difference between the worst and best insurance quote I got for my Tesla. Most don't even try to insure EVs competitively because they're ""scary"".

This was true of my previous econo EVs too by the way. 

Insuring EVs is a market that's ripe for the taking, and so far only Tesla and maybe one national insurance company seems to be capitalizing on this."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford fanboys are more likely to not want the Mach-E because they're still stuck on the ""not a real Mustang"" schtick"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla sells every single vehicle that they can produce. If not Ford fanboy then they’re someone else who has a poor reason for not just buying the Tesla. For every Apple lover there is an Apple hater who buys a Nokia or blackberry instead of an iPhone ;)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Autobidder is like pltr applied to electrical grids. 

And Tesla's utility side flipped from money drain to profitable last quarter for the first time.

Dojo might be licensed out, but need more time to see if this will happen or not.

Investors will eventually pick up on this. People seem to forget that Tesla is like four businesses wrapped up into one, and right now only one of the four is adding to profits."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m long as fuck on TSLA and that eCock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I did and I made 35% with puts. I will be rolling the profits over into longer term puts.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yet they're still far better than any other system you can buy in a car today.

What does that say about competitors?

Waymo is still much further away than Tesla. Their system is geofenced to a small part of a city with no bad weather. 

You can't even tell the difference between a waymo video from 2014 and a waymo video today. They are stuck because they're relying on lidar.

On the other hand, any owner of a Tesla can report significant progress between 2018 and today. And they have a rapidly iterating beta build out in the public that is slowly but surely able to tackle more and more corner cases.

Tesla is very likely to win the race."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if they maintain a loyal customer/fan base (which I think they will)then I think they will do just fine and sell a lot of cars. They just won’t be dominating the market like some people expect/hope they will, that’s just a ludicrous concept."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok... Anything else to go with your side of ketchup?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying it’s a failure, I’m saying Tesla is nowhere near as far along as many think they are. Tesla is still years away from fully autonomous vehicles they will not be first to market"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"VW can't even make a [working infotainment center](https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/11/21288572/volkswagen-id3-ev-delay-software-vw-herbert-diess), you guys think they will solve autonomous driving within a few years, which Google hasn't even done in 12 years?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d be on the same boat as you if it wasn’t for Michael Burry
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the literal definition of fomoing 🤔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it correct of me to assume that you were in TSLA before March of 2020 and have an average cost basis of <$200?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, I couldn't find the option to turn it into an english Keyboard. 
And it wasn't really any analysis, more like my 2 cents on the matter since everyone thinks Tesla is gonna dominate the EV market for years, which I doubt."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubt that other companies can do the same. There will be huge pressure from shareholders since they will have experience in huge financial deficit and share price will drop. 10 years time window is optimistic outlook for other companies based on assumption that they dedicate their technological development. Tesla will continuously develop their tech just like they are doing now. Tesla isn't slowing down when they clearly know that other companies are trying to catch up to them. I'm sure Audi can do quiet well in EV if they really invest all into EV but I doubt the automation department.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"VW CEO Herbert Diess said himself that Tesla's technology is years ahead of VW car companies' technology. At least he is being honest and I see good potential from VW. Tesla was just smart. They knew they had to sacrifice and bleed for a while to develop the techs and put themselves apart from others. Now, its time for the other companies to bleed and pay the price because there is no free shit in this world."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> ""Let's give our customers a thing for less money than it costs us to make"". 

I mean, without carbon credits isn't that basically what Tesla are doing?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not disagree. But lets picture a world full of robotaxis, do you still buy a tesla if you can hail one at any moment? Or if you own a tesla that drives itself,would you still use a robotaxi? What about the tens of millions of uber driver,lyft drivers,taxi drivers? What will they do to earn some money if everything is robotized? Do you think goverments around the world will let so many people to stay on unemployment costing goverments billions every month just so TSLA can reach $3k?

 Edit: it takes only one pedestrian to be run over and killed to shut it down for another 10 years"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is Tesla capitalising? They're just a broker, not an underwriter. They are just the salesman of the insurance.

And I don't think insurance companies will try to compete over EVs.. I know they will. No insurance company is going tot leave money on the table when it actually is a big deal. 

And I don't give a fuck about your experience with your personal quotes. That's just anecdotal evidence. And it's probably because insurance companies didn't want to take the risk yet to insure teslas for a rate they're not sure about yet. Tesla hasn't even sold 1 million cars in the USA. Total number of cars on the road in the USA? 280 million. Do you really think they care about less than 0.3% of the market at this point? Please."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">Tesla sells every single vehicle that they can produce.

Almost every EV is sold out right now. It's just an indication that the EV market is growing faster than it can be supplied. We won't see the real picture until supply outstrips demand - unlikely to be the case in the short term with semiconductor shortages."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Having worked for a guy who spends all day promising the moon with the pressure on you to deliver the moon. It gets exhausting fast.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the part i dont get about ARK's cases... they value robobtaxis way more than i would and dont even included these insane gamechangers of Tesla Energy and Tesla Solar
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The last two are off... space X isnt part of TSLA and solar paneling has existed well before Tesla and while Tesla is selling and improving it Tesla doesnt have private sector dominance of solar panels....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you even talking about then? Stop wasting time being stupid.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You made money because of short term volatility and the macro environment, not because Tesla is failing as a business. You can make money off Tesla going down, it’s just not a good long term strategy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It always is fun to read messages from Tesla fanboys :)

Waymo is geofenced because geofencing is the way to make it work. Right now it is one city, but this year they are launching it in San Francisco and bunch of others - they just bought 62,000 new vehicles for that. 

The reason why you can't tell the difference between videos from 2014 and now is because it was already working well in 2014 :) Latest statistics submitted to California authorities show that Waymo cars can drive 30k miles without a single engagement from safety driver. That's more than a typical human drives in a year.

For Tesla ""progress"" means ""we are not mistaking paper bags for humans anymore"".  The latest video I've seen for Tesla self driving test shows the car happily making left turn, ready to be t-boned by the car coming from the opposite direction, stopped by safety driver. 

Waymo stopped doing stupid mistakes like that years ago. In fact I've seen their report where they claim they can avoid crashes better than humans: https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/8/22315361/waymo-autonomous-vehicle-simulation-car-crash-deaths

So no, Tesla does not play in the same league as Waymo, they are not even in the same business: Waymo is working on self-driving, Tesla has poor driver assist system."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I paraphrased you as saying ""failure"" for brevity. If you think the FSD Beta vids are evidence that Tesla is doing poorly/worse than competition/making slow progress, then you do not understand what you are seeing.

Keep in mind that Tesla did not in any way need to do this public beta and allow the testers to post those vids. They could have gotten many times more confidential in-house testers to do the same stuff for a tiny, tiny cost compared to their overall investment. You mistake transparency on current limitations as evidence of lack of (or insufficient) progress, and you fail to recognize the monumental progress the current state of FSD beta actually represents.

Even given Elon's habitual over-optimism on timelines, the latest projection of ""level 5 by end of year"" is, in fact, not unrealistic.

They are no where close to using the full capacity of the on-board hardware. The bottleneck right now is training the neural network, and all evidence points to them being exactly on the right track... and it is learning *fast*."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. It is long term thinking. FOMO is short term.

I am not afraid of missing a peak. Nor am I afraid of missing a dip. 

I have very high confidence that in the long term (5-10years) it will go up *alot*, and I have zero ability to predict a short term dip, therefore it makes the most sense to buy now. Period.

FOMO is for gamblers and can apply just as much to missing a dip as to missing a peak. FOMO is fear of missing something that is going to happen *soon*. I do not buy ""today"" because I think it will have a run up tomorrow. That would be FOMO. I buy ""today"" with full expectation that tomorrow it could go up *or* down, but I don't care, because I am confident of where it will be in 10 years."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehh, he's mixing a little FOMO in with his investing style. He should have incorporated current standings and where it is in comparison to the growth forecast (i.e. buying at $2k now is not a good investment if you only think it's going to $3k by 2025). He is closer to right that if he believes Cathy, that under 1k in 2021 is a buy, under 1300 is a buy in 2022, under 1700 is a buy in 2023, and under 2255 is a buy in 2023. Anything over those and you're potentially over paying which would have a degree of FOMO."

For me at least, a hold and a buy are effectively the same, so for all practical purposes, I am in today at a cost basis of ~650. I was all-in 3 months ago at a cost basis of ~900. I was all-in some time ago at a much lower cost basis. ;)"

1. Automated cars are far less dangerous than human driving a car.
2. If the world is full of robo-taxis, then I would still by my own Tesla. Just like the world is full of taxis, yet people buy their own car.
3. Transition is inevitable. Governments who refuse automated car will stay behind the global economic and technological development process. Soon or late, they will eventually make transition to automated car."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course Tesla isn't failing as a business. Tesla is growing and will continue to grow. Teslas are the most desirable car around and nobody else even comes close. Hell even I dream of buying one with the money I hopefully make off my puts. The problem is Tesla the company and Tesla the stock are basically 2 different things at this point. Tesla will grow, but even if they have amazing growth the stock will drop like a rock to meet with their actual performance."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You asked for reasons why Tesla hadn’t been crushed yet and I gave you several. They know they have 9 years and will all have full EV ranges long before then and have the potential to scale up massively no problem when they NEED is what I should have said. All I’ve heard about Tesla in the UK is poor build quality and reliability issues which is never good when trying to carve out a market especially for American car companies which let’s be honest don’t have great reputations in Europe.

I can’t see that Tesla bring anything unique to the table in the long run and these guys know it hence why they are happy to let Elon plough on before they come in when it suits them and blow him out of the water. The production figures for Tesla says it all, they have had a clean run at this but have made barely a ripple in the ocean but yeah we will see as maybe Elon has a trick up his sleeve as he will certainly need it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,350 miles doesn't get you across some states on the US.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You have all your assets in one stock and think its going to be 3x ita current price in a few years. That's close enough to fomo.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> , a hold and a buy are effectively the same

This is exactly how I see it and I think the correct way to see it. 

A decision not to sell is the same thing as a decision to buy. If someone holds something but it's at a price they wouldn't be willing to buy more, they should sell. Because that means they don't believe it is worth whatever price it is. I sell options and that's exactly how I decide when to buy to close. Would I sell to open at this price if I didn't already hold the position? If the answer is no that means I need to buy to close. Because I no longer believe the risk/reward is worth it. 

Similarly your cost basis on your tesla shares is meaningless. With 1 click you could sell and have the money in your account. If the value of your shares is $100,000 by not selling you are saying you would rather have X shares than $100,000 cash. So if you had $100,000 you would buy X shares with it. The fact that you decide to hold today means you believe the price today is a good price to buy. Or at least it *should* mean that. Many people get in the trap of thinking their stock is probably overvalued but they got in so low it doesn't matter. No it always matters. Just because you only risked 10k and now it's worth 100k doesn't mean you are only risking 10k. You are risking 100k."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I appreciate the feedback dude. I’ll probably just DCA since going all in is way too stressful for me rn. Good luck to you
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They still buy cars and use taxis because their cars are not fsd. So you cant have a drink and let the car take you home, you need to get a taxi. They are less dangerous of course, but who would be responsible if a person gets ran over? Will musk be? Will the guy who built the software? Will the guy who bought the robotaxi? You understand now? Its not about being more or less dangerous, its about who will take responsibility in case somebody gets run over"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> do they make their own batteries? ... yes.

No.. they don't. You're falling for the meme that Tesla is doing everything themself. They do not currently make their own batteries. They have Panasonic make them for them.

> Like most car companies, Tesla sources its batteries from major producers so it can focus on its core mission: building electric cars. The company’s 2170 cells, which are currently used in Model 3 and Model Y vehicles, are produced by Panasonic at Tesla’s Gigafactory in Nevada.

https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/22/21449238/tesla-electric-car-battery-tabless-cells-day-elon-musk#:~:text=Like%20most%20car%20companies%2C%20Tesla,at%20Tesla's%20Gigafactory%20in%20Nevada.


And maybe they have the largest network in the USA, but there's more outside the USA. Most chargers I see here are not Tesla brand chargers."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you shittalk someone who holds the same position as you? That’s like being on an NFL team and talking trash about your teammates right in front of them lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think your analysis is wrong. Telsa the stock that has gone up 10x and Tesla the company fundamentals are very closely tied together. Just because the stock had a hot streak doesn't mean it's overvalued. They have very clear path to achieving multi trillion dollar valuation even with no robitaxi. Primary reason is FSD high margin reoccurring revenue which will only grow as they ramp up production of their fleet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""All-in"" and ""FOMO"" are unrelated concepts.

All-in is the opposite of diversification. Diversification is for idiots who can't tell a good investment from a bad one. So (following ""expert"" advise) they invest in everything and get average returns.

With Tesla, I am confident in the ROI. Why would I dilute my returns by investing part of my assets in things that I expect to have lower returns and/or which I do not have knowledge or insight to evaluate the expected returns?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a long term projection. FOMO is buying when it hits 2500 even tho everybody been saying 3000 for 3 years.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Its really poor risk management more than FOMO.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whether hold = buy depends on fees and taxes.

If you could sell without significant fees or taxes, then a hold is the same as a buy, since you could convert your shares to cash virtually at will and buy something else at any time. Thus, holding $X in shares is effectively the same has having $X in cash and buying those shares at any given moment.

If you have significant taxes and fees to consider, then a hold is not equivalent to a buy. 

In an IRA or other tax shelter, with minimal broker fees, then hold = buy."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I disagree w cost basis being meaningless. Those who were lucky enough to know about TSLA before others and reap the benefits of that insane bull market last year have less to lose than those who got in later. Risk is significantly higher for those who got in late.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the **vehicle** was being operated properly and as designed but somehow fails, then the manufacturer may be the appropriate party to hold **responsible** for any injuries that the faulty machine caused.

If someone jumped in front of a car, gets ran over, then it will be that person's fault."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shiiiiit. You must not understand the 4680 ramp up going on. 

Rumor is they are already shipping 4680s for giga Berlin. 

Even still PENA is in a joint partnership to produce 2170s at Giganevada. If you think it’s all Panasonic doing the work you clearly haven’t done any research. 

I suggest listening to the Stanford energy summit where Celina Mikolajczak explains the new 2170s that were jointly produced as well. The partnership is more than just “getting from a supplier”

Edit: still the largest charging network in the world"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Memes over teams. You are gay.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Diversification is for people who dont want to blow all there money on a single move. You want to know why so many people blow their entire accounts on here. Because they dont make any attempt to diversify. Im not saying invest in 100 different companies. But holding 8 to 12 good companies is definently key as far as investing goes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Kind of the same thing to me. If one has FOMO they often times ignore risk management and make moves this crazy.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A pedestrian respects the law and crosses legally the street. Robotaxi did not detect it due to a glitch or maybe even a hack. Person dies, so who goes to jail? The designer? The buyer? The owner of the company? Who is to blame for ending a life? 

Because if i drive a car, and i dont see the pedestrian, im fucking going to jail for killing someone. Not Ford, not the maker of the tyres, or the maker of the brakes. Its me who is fucking responsible, not the city for puting a crosswalk exactly there"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, well from what I have seen I just don't agree. Also, being a battery manufacturer is hardly worth that much. Other battery manufacturers are not nearly trading at the multiples Tesla is trading at."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you describe is called ""managing your bankroll"", which is something gamblers do, and not quite  the same thing as diversification.

Managing your bankroll means if you can make many smaller bets all at the same odds, do that rather than a single large bet at those odds. This is good advise, as your expected returns do not change and you have much less chance of losing everything.

Diversification tends to be preached as something good in its own right. But it is really a hedge against your own ignorance. If you cannot tell a difference between your 8 to 12 ""good stocks"", that represents ignorance that you have about the actual quality and prospects of those companies.

But do you really see no difference? What return do you expect from the best out of your 12 stocks and how confident are you? What return do you expect from the worst and how confident are you? Was the last $100 you put into your worst/least choice better placed than if you had put it into your best choice?

For each dollar you invest there is only one question: where is the best place I can put this dollar right now? Diversification is for those who cannot answer that question."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see FOMO as getting in because something is going up, w/o doing necessary research or having patience.

Bad risk management is having too much in any one play. Yeah, you can have both. But it is its own thing. A great stock could be a bad play if you go too heavy (good odds, but you bust)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the Technical glitch scenario is pretty clear. The company that was responsible for manufacturing the car will be held responsible in that scenario. If it was software problem, then company that desgined the software will be responsible for its own fault. In Tesla case, it will be just Tesla. Hacker will held responsible for its own crime in case of hacker penetrated into the system and causing the glitch in software. I'm not a lawyer and you should probably ask lawyer about these situations."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like you are getting deep into this political and philosophical questions that are already been discussed like 5 yrs ago. Reality is that other car companies don't have the technology to make robotaxi. Tesla has it. Tesla will make it happen. If Ford had same tech, then they will do it too. Its not like they are not doing it. They can't do it. Even Tesla need to develop their techs more. Tesla is closer than any other companies tho. In my opinion, when it became reality , majority of population will enjoy it. The change is inevitable imo."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a dumb comparison - And totally missing the point. 

By having battery production even buy a different supplier under their own roof jointly produced. As well as seven to be two battery factories near their manufacturing plants. It reduces costs and increases gross profit margin’s on vehicles sold as well as their megapacks. 

Battery production is a volume game and to reduce costs along the entire supply chain. Specifically time traveled and transportation cost. Is game changing for the company that implement these new ways of going about it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"As someone working in the industry (lidar perception systems for autonomous vehicles), waymo is far ahead at the moment, and they claim lidar to currently be the most important sensor. Tesla on the other hand refuses to acknowledge that lidar is even useful."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I don't look as deeply into singular companies as I do the overall Macroeconomic trends. I then chose companies to invest in based on that and a few profitability and debt ratios. I still stick to the 8 to 12 companies but it tends to be towards that overall arching trend. I tend to make only moves I can win for the most part. You are correct that I don't expect 100% to 50% returns every year. But I do this based on an overall strategy where I swing trade currency pairs and take that profit and transfer it into my mother account where I reinvest the funds. Forex itself is likely a lot closer to gambling but I only use a small portion of my total net worth overall."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mate, your wife gets runned over by a glitchy robotaxi, tesla or different brand, doesnt matter. Who will fucking go to jail for killing the love of your life? It is not political nor is it philosophical. Someone has to pay and i dont mean with money. I dont see elon going to jail because a nobody got hit by a tesla robotaxi. Thats why goverments will not allow them to roam free,not in the next 10 years at least."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"We'll see how it goes. I still believe the tesla stock will take a massive haircut sooner or later. More sooner rather than later.

All these predictions are more hope rather than actual analysis. It's a nice story you can tell investors but in the end, it's not going to be that much ahead of the competition. Especially because it's the fucking car industry and nobody buys a car based on a stat sheet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"And I definitely don’t by telsa shares based on automotive statistics. Lol. 

energy and solar is much bigger a reason for me. 

They have such an amazing advantage right now primed and ready to go.

 Last week was the first time since 'Nam I saw someone post a decent play in the daily thread that wasn't one of the 9 different stocks talked about here lately. Shoutout to whoever it was that said BAC 40c, I turned $400 into $1,400 and **sold for a cool $1,000 profit.** I swear people used to take profits around here.. maybe not. But they say nobody ever went broke taking profits. $1,000 isn't a lot of money, but it's $1,000 that I didn't have before and all it took was a one liner comment that *wasn't* GME AMC RKT PLTR  etc. 

What was awesome about wsb that I feel like is lacking lately was all the different tickers that people would talk about and different plays they were making.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok hear me out you degenerate gamblers:

A call debit spread straddling the current price with a 100% max profit can be done with SPY weeklies that only need a 0.3% move up to be in the max profit range. 

Flipping a coin and getting heads 4 times in a row has a 1/16 chance of happening. 


5k play on options hitting 100% 4 times in a row (re rolling each win) = 80k 

5k * 16 chances = 80k 


So attempting to hit 4 weeks of at least  +0.25% growth in SPY week over week should, especially in a raging bull market, hit before you lose what amounts you would win. Even 15 straight weeks of losses, if the 16th week hit then you still are up 100%. And that assumes you never cut your losses on down weeks. 

Why am I retarded for wanting to do this?"

Owning GME does not make you an ape.  While GME ownership is a common trait among apes, it is not the defining characteristic.

And ape is defined by its constant shilling of a single stock and by its tendency to administer peer pressure and bullying upon other apes to persuade them not to follow best practices, which it does in order to protect its own financial interests.  Apes are also well known for rejecting facts,  discouraging open discourse, and championing false information.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Random thought time...regarding Tesla 

Revisit 2007 when Apple debuted their iPhone. Many analysts were skeptical in a new category. A touch phone? How can people function without buttons? Blackberry is not going anywhere. 

Steve Balmer, of Microsoft, famously said (at the time):  ""There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share. No chance. It’s a $500 subsidized item."" The rest is history.

Robotaxis reminds me of a similar situation. Today, early 2021, you can't imagine Robotaxi being part of your future life but I believe it'll be a real utility, just like the smartphone. We'll fetch a Robotaxis similar to how we fetch an Uber. The difference: you probably won't need to wear a mask."

1. Go into your favourite stocks app
* Type random letters
* Decide on 10 you like the name of
* Look at chart
*  Find those that have reached close to bottom
* Buy and **HOLD**
* Sell when you start getting 20-400% gains
* Repeat for 📈📈📈📈📈

Studies show that picking stocks at random, you will beat, on average any technical trader. Never has the market been this retarded before.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that the orange man having regulatory control over fitting whatever narrative he wants into whatever situation he wants is extremely dangerous. 
Is this hugely different from what other forms of media do? Absolutely not. I just think that after recent events and the polarization in America giving him a direct platform where he can ban anyone calling him out on bullshit will actually split this country in two (as the majority of his supporters will ONLY maintain information from this source as fact, and disregard “fake news” that condemns what happens on it). I’m fucking scared."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's going to get shut down probably days after launch because his crazies will be saying heinous and illegal shit on there, particularly regarding actions they would take against minorities.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Half of WSB gained psychic abilities after investing in radioactive waste futures, it gave them the ability to see into the future.

They are letting you know they are seeing the future and it appears red, typically this means the stonks will go up"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Futures” is not just a clever name. They are literally contracts for the future price of the market. The “market” being a basket of stocks. SPX RUT DJX NDX and other things like gold silver oil gas corn wheat everything. The price of your gasoline is derived from /RB gasoline futures. The price of heating your home with natty gas is derived from /NG and so on. This is the real deal. It’s not a game, this IS the price of real world stuff and how it is set is trading contracts that settle in the future for the underlying stuff."

**Volume - catalysts**

I put volume here first becuase it is BY FAR the most important indicator for a stock and ESEPCIALLY GME. Let me be clear, volume is king. Volume is god. Volume is your wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's boyfriend's wife's pimp's boyfriend's boss' 3rd wife's byofriend (that might be an understatement tbh). If you look at GME's chart, every single giant price increase was preceded by a large influx of volume. This is not unique to GME, as any stock requires a massive amount of volume for a massive increase in price:

https://preview.redd.it/x4y89amnrfo61.png?width=1071&format=png&auto=webp&s=f162175a836a710ce3896fa61f45706ded9fdc2e

&#x200B;

Understand that volume is the only thing that will make this stock spike, as with any stock. The stock is not going to magically go to the moon without a ton of people on the buy side. Again, this is not exclusive to GME. When a stock has a great earnings report, acquisition news, FDA approval, etc, you will see a massive volume spike that leads to a massive increase (or decrease) in price. Now you're probably thinking to yourself, ""ok Uncle Hank, but my tiny ape brain can't comprehend what makes volume increase."" Well, volume is simply the number of people buying or selling the stock, so that begs the question, what makes more people buy or sell a stock? Catalysts. We have seen that GME is especially sensitive to catalysts. I believe that this is because WSB/retail investors own a LARGE portion of GME's float, so that guarantees that there are a stable number of holds, so when there is news, demand spikes while supply is still low. I am now going to go over the past catalysts that made GME spike so you can get an idea of this. First, here is a pic of GME's volume since January. I call it an angsty teenage boy's hair because it is SPIKEY:

https://preview.redd.it/mhtvivaprfo61.png?width=675&format=png&auto=webp&s=e31b6d1d9b3521a4c18be7636526e13d8c334dd7

&#x200B;

The very first spike in GME's volume was in November when our lord and daddy Ryan Cohen announced his stake in GME. This isn't pictured here because it isn't significant compared to volume from the past few months. I think at that point most people thought cohen was on DMT when he hit the buy button for GME. The first big spike on here is in early January (11-13th ish), which is when Ryan Cohen was announced as being a member of the board. This is when people were like ""ok maybe Cohen wasn't on DMT, but he def took some wicked shrooms when he pushed that buy button""). In the next few days we see volume decline but still elevate compared to previous levels because of increased media attention. The next jump, which was very red was when our special needs friend Andrew Left announced his short position, which subsequently led to WSB ass ramming him on the internet (dude literally got his cheeks clapped by a bunch of apes and had a tantrum). This is where things really started to kick off. After this, there is a giant orgy of volume for a few days because of Elon tweets, Chamath support, Mark Cuban talking to us, media coverage, and the revelation that GME was shorted over 100%. This was the frenzy of late January. After that, everything died down regarding volume, price, and media attention. HOWEVER, the volume picked back up (and price corresponded) when GME ousted their CFO. Most people thought that Cohen had something to do with this. Full disclosure, I thought that GME was done when it tanked the first time, and this showed me its true power. We then see one more volume spike when it was announced that Cohen was being appointed as the head of the board that would change GME to a digital company. Since then, volume has gone down. The following charts show GME's volume and price in each of the past few months so you can get an idea of how crucial volume is:

https://preview.redd.it/pc3a5kxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=e21bb57d541c82bd0973f991f608243999a05189

https://preview.redd.it/5p55jvxqrfo61.png?width=182&format=png&auto=webp&s=17d87c7618a76a429820adce815d235cbecc0601

&#x200B;

So, now you understand that volume is king and is the only thing that will move GME. When people talk about (X will move GME), they are saying that the event will create positive volume, which will allow GME to rise. So, what are the potential catalysts we have in the future for this volume rise? Earnings is obviously the closest one. The actual numbers don't really matter here. If GME beats significantly, it might cause a rise, but the real thing that we're looking for is the conference call. On the conference call, if we hear news about the digital transformation, acquisitions, a new CFO, or anything relating to Cohen, there will be massive volume and a price increase. If those things are not discussed on the earnings call, then they will be catalysts in the next few months. If GME appoints a new CFO, I believe that catalysts will significantly drive it up as we saw the price 4x in a few days when they merely announced that they ousted the old one. If Cohen gets appointed CEO... oh.... get fucking ready. So, now you understand that Volume is king and all this talk of ""the squeeze might happen here"" or ""the chart makes it look like the squeeze is coming"" are irrelevant if they don't coincide with an event that will significantly drive up volume.

**OBV**

""But Uncle Hank, what can you tell us about volume when there haven't been giant spikes."" Glad you asked, that's where OBV comes into play. OBV (on balance volume). is a volume indicator that was founded on the idea that volume precedes price (keep that idea in the back of your head). For those of you who didn't finish 3rd grade, precedes means it comes before. OBV is a running total of positive or negative volume that depends on price for that calculation. In this calculation, the volume of a candle is either added or subtracted to the OBV total, which is denoted by a line, depending on if it's negative or positive (this is an oversimplification but just know that it's a running total). If a candle is neutral, the volume of that candle will not be added. Thankfully, GME rarely has neutral candles cuz it's so volatile. If it's positive, the volume is added to the total, if it's negative, the volume is subtracted from the total. For example (these are random numbers, don't start eating your crayons yet), let's say a given stock's OBV is 1,000. Then, there is a negative candle with a volume of 2. The OBV would now be 998. Then, there is a positive candle with a volume of 100. The OBV would now be 1098. This is why OBV is shown as a line rather than candles like volume. OBV is a trend indicator (remember volume proceeds price), so the actual value of OBV is largely insignificant, rather the trend of OBV is what matters. Because volume proceeds price, OBV allows you to predict where a stock will go because if OBV is increasing, it means that there is a lot of volume in green candles and less volume in red candles. IMO, OBV is best used to predict where a stock is going when it's consolidating, and oh would you look at that, GME is consolidating. If a stock is consolidating and OBV is increasing, that is an indication that when it breaks the trend, it will be high. The opposite would be true if OBV was decreasing. Generally, if a stock is increasing in price and OBV is increasing, you can expect it to continue that trend. If the price is increasing but OBV is decreasing, you can expect it to go negative in the future. This all goes back to the idea that volume precedes price. The below pic shows GME's OBV (the yellow line) on different time scales.

https://preview.redd.it/rmbx8r3trfo61.png?width=713&format=png&auto=webp&s=b34b39b2ffdc2872f94b062827d8ae30dff7c6ba

&#x200B;

So what does this mean? Gonna just take this from my other post because I think I explained it well: The commonality between all of these graphs is that OBV continues to increase. If you look at the 1-year and 90-day charts, you can see that OBV took a very small hit when GME collapsed after the January squeeze. However, OBV has continually increased in value since then and is currently higher than it was in January. This means that the green candles (the uptrends) have higher volume than the red candles (the downtrends). This is extremely bullish. We can also see that although volume may be decreasing in the 30-day and 10-day charts, OBV is still increasing, which means that there is much more volume on the buy-side than the sell-side. Even with all of these monster short attacks (like the one we saw last week), there is still a net positive uptrend in OBV, which further adds to the bullish sentiment. Personally, I think that this is partially because of continued retail interest, but, more importantly, I think that this adds credence to the theory that we have an institutional ally or allies that continually buy GME and are trying to initiate the squeeze. This takes away credence from the idea that HFs are just manipulating the price up and down for their own benefit. Furthermore, many people also believe that GME and AMC are correlated. Though this may be true to an extent (they move similarly but not identically), OBV is much more bullish for GME. AMC's OBV is increasing similar to GME's but is not higher than it was in January like GME currently is. AMC's OBV dropped significantly after January and has not returned to those January levels yet. As stated above, GME is and has been above its January OBV levels for a while now. This is not to bash AMC, I am very bullish and AMC and have a position in it. All that this is showing is that GME seems to have greater bullish momentum than AMC and that the stocks are not perfectly correlated like many people think. The massive OBV of GME also suggests that it will be relatively easy for it to have a rapid, parabolic upward move.

So, now you understand that volume is king, we need volume for GME to increase, volume is not increasing, but OBV is still increasing. This is good.

**SPY and VIX**

Many of you have probably seen the news that GME has a disgustingly negative beta (I've seen -2, -8, and even -13). Beta essentially is the factor of how the stock follow the market. A beta of 1 would mean that the stock follows the market (if the market is up, it is up proportionately). A negative beta, however, means the opposite. It means that the stock essentially doesn't follow the market and actually goes in the opposite direction. If you've seen some of the other DDs, you can find comments from people with economics and finance degrees/knowledge saying how rare a beta THAT negative is. There are tons of other DDs with info from Bloomberg terminals and other stuff that demonstrate this negative beta. Just know that it means GME doesn't like to follow the market. Below are charts that compare GME to SPY and the VIX. SPY and VIX are the purple lines (first one is VIX, second is SPY):

Though the correlation is not perfect, you can see that GME seems to be inversely related to SPY and positively related to the VIX. This makes sense because VIX spikes usually happen during market turbulence, high volume, and volatility, which are exactly what GME needs. Lucky for us, SPY is pretty fucking overbought right now. The effects of stimmys have already been priced in on SPY, and I believe that funds are going to continue to short the 10-year bond, which will push the stock market down. Essentially, the market is overbought, needs to pull back, is overinflated, and will soon have to factor in the looming threat of inflation. Again, volume is more important than this, but this is just something good to keep in line.

**Support and resistance**

https://preview.redd.it/slo3fv3wrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=7e3f924e3df995fb61353f38129c591ccf86a835

&#x200B;

In this section, I'm going to just give a brief overview of the support and resistance lines that we have developed. Again, sorry for all of the lines, I am a technical trader who was raised in a crayon factory, so I cannot help myself. The first thing to take a look at is the fat orange line. This line was resistance for GME when it had its second pop at the end of February. We have however since broken that resistance. As many of you know, previous resistance usually acts as future support in uptrends and this is VIOLENTLY true for GME. That fat orange line has withstood several short attacks and has literally bounced right back up since. Is this because of psychological levels? Is it a whale doing that on purpose? Is it the hedgies playing games? It's impossible to know, just know that the support is stronger than my wife's boyfriend's hatred of me. The fat yellow line on the bottom is essentially our doomsday level of support... let's not talk about that and hope we never get there. The fat green, yellow, and red lines on the top are our god levels of resistance. We had a bulltrap on the top green line just before that massive short attack. Getting above these levels is extremely crucial as they will be strong support. If we can get above the red line and stay there... MOON. Just know that we currently have some very strong support at 180ish and that is a great thing to have, especially because of how tested it has been.

**Current patterns**

Looking at the chart, I can see many patterns forming and almost all of them are bullish. First, you've probably seen the billions of posts of cups and handles. I can 100% see that pattern forming, and believe in its merit. Since there are so many posts on it, I won't waste your time with a picture. The first pattern that I see is a giant triangle pattern from the 513 high with support slightly below 100. This is signified by the fat yellow line on the bottom and the skinny diagonal yellow line:

https://preview.redd.it/u3crqynxrfo61.png?width=946&format=png&auto=webp&s=6a1df9c8da258c7a6b8c4ee448dd71fa8c71a6da

&#x200B;

As you can see, we broke that pattern in a bullish way and used the resistance from that (180ish) as our current iron-clad support. From there, I saw a bullish pennant pattern (the two orange lines), however, as many of you know, this pattern didn't play out as we kept testing that 180 support. Instead of forming a pennant, I believe that we have formed another bullish triangle pattern:

https://preview.redd.it/o3eub5fzrfo61.png?width=1722&format=png&auto=webp&s=103c416b860eb08f28d61d28ad95e05510d26b26

&#x200B;

That current triangle is using our 180 support level and it seems that it is trying to break the pattern in a bullish way. Now, why are these patterns bullish? When a stock makes a move upward or downward, then consolidates, it typically continues that pattern. Here is an explanation of that:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/yjjz7nk0sfo61.png?width=1824&format=png&auto=webp&s=9b7dbdf8552c45fe147371cafdfb4002e5f63c42

As you can see, the graph on the left applies to us as we are currently consolidating from an uptrend. This is consistent with Elliot Wave Theory, which I am a huge supporter of. Just wanted to give a shout-out to everyone who posted EWT DD because I thoroughly enjoyed it. If you don't know what EWT is, it's basically the idea that stocks move in a repeating fractal pattern that is categorized by periods of trending movements, consolidating movements, and corrective movements. GME is currently in a consolidating movement proceeding a trending movement, which is bullish. I don't want to explain EWT because it's very complicated, so I encourage you to look at other posts about it and just know that Uncle Hank supports it. With all of this in mind, it appears that GME keeps forming triangle patterns and keeps breaking them. It is moving in a stair-step pattern where it shoots up, consolidates, then uses the previous resistance as support. This is extremely bullish:

**TTM Squeeze, MACD, Ichimoku:**

Some of my other favorite indicators are TTM Squeeze, MACD, and Ichimoku. These indicators are purely based off of price and are trend/momentum indicators. TTM squeeze has to deal with the relationship between Bollinger bands and Keltner channels. It moves similarly to MACD, which also predicts momentum. Ichimoku makes clouds based off of previous price action and helps to indicate trends. All of those explanations were EXTREMELY general, so do some research on your own to better understand them. Importantly, all of these indicator show bullish momentum for GME. Below, I have combined the TTM Squeeze and MACD indicators (because that's how I use them). On the one week chart, the TTM and MACD indicators are extremely bullish:

https://preview.redd.it/wc7ah2h2sfo61.png?width=706&format=png&auto=webp&s=de6566627a85061b76dc9ea3e5e6321c60e4dd4e

The MACD is opening wider and is continuing its bullish trend (MACD is the two lines indicators. When the blue line is over the yellow one, it's bullish. The wider the distance, the more bullish). TTM also indicates the start of a very big move. When TTM is light blue, we are in the stage of the greatest momentum (you can see the light blue from late January). When we are in a dark blue phase, there is still bullish momentum but its dying). When we go into a red phase, we are in a bearish phase (you can see that throughout February). Yellow indicates that the bearish momentum is dying. From here, we can see that bearish momentum is dying and that we are ready to go into bullish territory (light blue candles). This is assisted by the fact that MACD is super bullish right now. I did this on the week chart to give a good overview of the price of GME because it's so volatile day to day that it's hard to understand it sometimes. Finally, Ichimoku. This indicator is a trailing momentum indicator. All that you need to know is that when it crosses through the red cloud, this is an indication of bullish momentum. Well, would you look at that, GME is getting ready to enter a red cloud right before earnings:

These three indicators are great on their own, but when used together they are even more powerful. MACD indicates that we are bullish RIGHT NOW. Ichimoku and TTM indicate that we are about to go into a period of extremely bullishness. THese charts all show that the bullish momentum for GME is just beginning.

**A note about the ""short attacks""**

As many of you have seen, over the past few days, GME has been through a series of sharp downturns intraday. Are these ""short attacks"" or are they one of our institutional allies purposely putting us on SSR? It's impossible to know. This will be an examination of those crashes and some potential theories.

Like I said above, It's impossible to know if these short attacks were from friends or foes. What we can be sure about, however, is that it either triggered stop losses and/or pushed out paper hands. How can I be sure of this? Below are screenshots of both of the flash crashes from March. As you can see, the crash volume candle is about equal to that of the recovery candle but the price does not recover to its previous highs. What this makes me think is the short attack triggers stop losses and paper hands, then whoever did the short attack (again friend or foe) bought the shares back up. The reason why the price doesn't fully recover is because of paper hands being pushed out. I believe that the whale probably sells off all of his shares then rebuys at the lower price (hence the equivilant volume but price not fully recovering). Again, it is impossible to know if this was an actual short attack or if it was an ally trying to put it on SSR, but what you should know is that it was in no way a regular sell-off. No stock drops by over 50% two times in one month with NO NEWS CATALYSTS. If a stock drops this much, it's usually because of an investigation, missed earnings, etc. On both of these crashes, there was no news on GME at all, so do not think for a second that these instances were just regular selloffs or profit-taking - they were 100% coordinated attacks.

**More on why paperhanding is stupid:**

The reason that I made this post is to highlight why paperhanding GME is not a good idea through a technical analysis. Obviously, it's not a good idea for the cause, but I'm here to show that it's night a good idea for the individual ape as well. If there's one thing to know about GME it's that it's a VOLATILE stock. This thing can and will move over 100 points (points, not percentage) in a single day. We have seen the price go from $100 to over $300 in a single day and from $350 to less than $200 in less than half an hour. It is understandable that many new traders might (for example) get in on GME at $100, watch it rise up to $350, then panic sell when it goes below $200, but I am here to give you proof that it is not beneficial to do that. Below, I have posted screen shots of several charts at various time frames since the beginning of January to now. The red circle signifies where you might have been tempted to paper hand and the green circle signifies why you would've been better off holding. It's important to note that the only way you could have lost money on GME is if you bought in above $400, but believe me, apes, we are going to go FAR above $400 in the near future. The reason that I have posted this is because, though I am feverishly against paperhanding, everyone, including myself, gets down and sometimes even paniced when GME crashes because it makes up so much of my portfolio. I suggest looking at these images everytime GME falls as a reminder that this is a long term game and that volatility is expected, but that paperhanding is not the answer... enjoy:

**A Note about squeezes**

Before I go any further, please understand that last time was not a short squeeze. Last time was some shorts covering and a series of gamma squeezes. A short squeeze is characterized by a RAPID increase in both price and volume in a short period of time. A short squeeze is far more violent and faster than a gamma squeeze. Short squeezes can cause a series of gamma squeezes and gamma squeezes can cause a short squeeze. The reason that a short squeeze is so rapid is because TONS of people are buying, which decreases the total number of tradable shares in the float. The buying pressure creates immense price increases, which cause shorts to get margin called and have to start buying to cover (which only increases the buying pressure and price increases). This short squeeze may force market makers to delta hedge by buying more shares (gamma squeeze). Just know that the squeeze truly didn't happen last time. If it did happen, you would have seen a VIOLENT uptick in volume and price on a single day or two that was FAR higher than the 500$ highs we saw last time. It should look similar to the VW short squeeze. So, anytime you see FUD about the squeeze being over, look at the chart, see that there has not been a parabolic rise in volume and price on a single day similar to VW, finish jacking off, and thank Uncle Hank. To add more to this, if the squeeze truly did happen, then FINRA would be reporting FAR lower numbers than 50% short interest.

**Why short interest might not matter**

If your eyes are glued to the WSB DD page and your hand is glued to your 2inch punisher like me, then you've probably seen the plethora of posts about how the short interest in GME isn't 50% like FINRA says. I've seen posts that say it's 65%, 120%, 200%, and even 900%. Let me tell you, those apes put in some DAMN good research to get those numbers and you should definitely listen to what they are saying. I personally believe that the SI is over what FINRA is saying because of all of the crazy/illegal stuff that hedgies are doing with ETFs and naked shorts. The point that I want to make is that it's impossible to actually know what these numbers are because of what the hedgies are doing. Again, I want to give all props to my fellow autists who make that spankin DD, and again, I agree with it, but just know that it's impossible to really know what it is. Now, I am going to make the case for why that doesn't actually matter. This is just a hypothesis, feel free to disagree with me below. I believe that GME is a stock that reacts so strongly to catalysts (see above) because of WSB and retail traders essentially owning the float. I believe that GME's flat is mostly owned by retail traders who refuse to sell. This decreases the tradable shares and essentially creates a sell wall. It also provides that there is a group of millions of shares that are simply held and not moved around and sold. Because of this, when there is good news on GME, all of the nonretail traders flood the market to buy the stock, which is mostly held by retail traders, which creates massive buy pressure. Essentially, because of WSB users diamond hands, every time there is positive news on GME, it creates a gamma squeeze. Again, this is just a hypothesis. Do I believe that the short interest is still through the roof and that the squeeze will eventually happen? Yes. However, I think that the diamond hands effect from WSB has essentially limited the supply of GME, which is why it's so sensitive to catalysts and is so volatile. In essence, diamond hands is fucking working.

**FTD Squeeze**

I would just like to reiterate the amazing work that one of my fellow apes did on GME. I don't remember his name but you've probably seen the manifesto about the Failure to deliver squeeze and how the FTDs are going to have to be repaid soon, which will lead to the actual squeeze. I don't have the link to it but I just wanted to acknowledge that guy and say thank you because it's really excellent DD. That DD is what people are talking about when they say that WSB users are doing better research than Wallstreet analysts. If someone could link it in a comment below, I could greatly appreciate it so other apes can see it. Also, just as another note, if you look at iBorrowDesk, GME has had less than 10k shares available to trade for the past few days. Borrow rate is still super low, but this is just an interesting thing to look at.

**Closing Thots**

In short, I like the stock. If there is anything that you take away from this, remember, volume is king, the short squeeze has not happened yet, short interest might not matter, and it's only a matter of time before this thing launches to the moon. Again, this is not financial advice and I am not a financial advisor. Finally, I just wanted to thank all of you who upvote my DD and follow my account. I have always loved investing and trading, but making these DDs and hearing your reactions has become one of my favorite things to do and brings me a lot of joy. Thanks a ton apes, stay strong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, sir u/HomeDepotHank69. May I have some of your adderall pls? 

Really though, this is some of the good stuff I've been looking for since January. There's been a lot of horrid DD discrediting the situation ever since the second spike. I too thought we were fucked after the first dive and just decided to hold my babies till death do us part, but some of the most recent DD has been similar to the brilliant late January DD that got me so jacked to the tits I wasn't fucking leaving for anything. 

I'm working on becoming a stonk analyst but I hardly know dick right now and the main thing giving me massive positive sentiment is the lack of price drop after volume settles down from a huge spike then marginal tank."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The lack of volume is my biggest fear. I’ll continue to hold because fuck it. I want to bail out the bag holders and I love the stock. 900 shares and still holding

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"1 thing i disagree with and its just my opinion from the extensive DD I've seen where another ape broke down the different brokers and the percentage of apes holding the stock at each broker and how much percent of the float we would own if each ape held just 5 shares, 10shares, 20 shares and so on but stopped at 100 which we know there's tons of us who hold hundreds, thousands, and tens of thousands of shares. But let's just take what he said from 5 shares each which would put us owning 193% of the float. At 100 shares a piece that would put us at 3,000%+ of the float. Thats all I'm saying. If I can find it again I will repost it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mention VOLUME as #1 but I also want to add, that FOMO at unreal prices are also important. Remember people BOUGHT IN AT 350 and 400 per share. I don't think people will do that anymore since what happened the last time. I am betting we lost a good bit of FOMO people at the higher levels needed to catapult to the moon."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a complete idiot, but I feel like predictions based upon technical analysis don't work on GME. It could just as easily drop 50% in a day is it could gain 50% in a day, without warning."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You claim OBV is now higher than it was in the January spike. This depends on size of the candles you are using. With 1 day candles, you are right. With 30 minute candles, you are not. IMO the smaller time frame candles are superior here, because of how much GME fluctuates intraday.

OBV being flat during a period of consolidation is not, in fact, necessarily a bullish signal. In fact it is often a sign that institutional investors are dropping bags for retail to pick up. OBV has been pretty flat the last two weeks. It approaches the levels we saw in the January spike,  but without the same price action. Could it be that institutions are selling shares which you apes are buying?

If this is true, this will not end well."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't you see a lot of these same indicators if this was just a massive and constantly increasing number of clueless retards buying a joke stock because they heard about it on the internet?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder though. Do big institutions that own a lot of GME shares benefit from a short squeeze? Surely, they can't simply sell at the top as they have to file a form (13D or 13G). And Ryan himself for that matter?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love how in every job there is an over engineered process to yield results or projections. Most of this gibberish is explaining things that are basic, and have a lamen way to explain or think of, but maybe its fun when you're a professional to say the big words. Sometimes when you do that tho, you take away the actual basic of what something is.

Example how a meteorologist would explain a weather event when to a lamen ""dark cloud + wind = storm""

In my line of work, law enforcement, a retail theft equals ""[Signal, Selection, Concealment, continued concealment, pass last point of sale] + proof of intent"" when in lamens ""suspect stole X item"". 

Volume is people buying and selling .. high volume is lots of people buying and selling.. stock moves when this happens. HODLers do in fact influence price by making the asset retain value when big buys are not happening. HODLers will make price go up slowly by themselves or faster with a catalyst creating demand. 

Tl;dr I appreciate DD but this post is mind numbingly complicated and over engineered for what it's trying to convey."

second is MACD - its misrepresented as being still a wide spread with MACD (blue) far above the signal (yellow) lines; at the writing of my response (2021-03-21) the MACD line is actually fallen and is intersecting the signal line, indicating a downward or selling (bearish) trend.  for duplication I am viewing 3 month chart, 1day interval not weekly which still shows MACD wide open and above signal line."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"According to my forecasting models, SPY should hit 398ish on Monday/Tuesday and then should start coming down. I wouldn't be so bearish on SPY going into the week. I'm buying my puts by Tuesday though."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude i can't read. Do i eat more green crayons or green play-doh? My therapist keeps telling me to stop eating crayons but he doesn't have diamond hands.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, good read (did not understand most)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You said the squeeze will be rapid increase in time over a day or two.

So say for example I don’t have a limit set at $10,000 and I’m just patiently watching and it starts shooting up 

When it slows down am I safe to assume that’s the top? Or would it happen over a few days? 

Like say it shoots to $3,000 and looks like the squeeze, am I safe to sell and not feel ima miss $30,000??"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can actually understand this
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally had tons of orgasms reading your biggg analysis. It made me cum 💦 (wife’s boyfriend saw me) we like the stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"THIS is the reason I joined the ape community. This DD is far superior to anything I was doing up to now.  A major league ""THANKS"" to Uncle Hank for explaining in such clear language what I only could guesstimate at ( I don't know if I was lucky or just had a lucid moment or two). I'm just a knuckle-dragger - but even I understood this!! Well done!!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What in the fuck did I just read. I’m all in.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is excellent. *DOTHS CAP*
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best DD I’ve seen during this entire GME Saga.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys, I have a weird question. I have shares through Chase (I know, I know). 

When I try to look at options, I can choose any strike price for 4/16 EXCEPT $205. Everytime I choose that number, it says ""Sorry, this part of our site isn't working right now. Please try again later."" Anyone else have YouInvest w/Chase and have this problem?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Came for the DD stayed for the thots
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw the funny comment about Andrew Left so I scrolled all the way down to upvote and now I'm gonna go back to finish reading this. I'll let you know what I think when I'm done in a few days. Thanks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone have a recommendation for which DD on the SI is the most credible?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,These are the times I wish I could read
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For fucks sake Homer.  

Seriously, thanks though.  I went through a case of crayons scrolling to the TLDR section.  💎👐"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Scrolled through to see when the comments (real DD) start. Will read tomorrow with caffeine. Too drunk for so much text
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're a fucking chad orangutan among apes, thank you"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Excited for GME tomorrow.. got my paycheck today..

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So where DIP going to be at? Ape buy many bananas. Get Diamond Hands and swing through trees to promise land.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome DD. Easy to read and understand.  Good job!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good to know that Gme has less then 10k shares left. Gonna buy some of that tmrw.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a lot of big words. I’m going to have to ask my wife’s boyfriend to read this to me before bed.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer upper decks his own toilets
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that was wordy...but I understood most of it which says a lot just hanging out here has raised my IQ significantly thank u for taking the time to do the DD and for sharing
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Great stuff here.  TLDR: paperhanding this stock is stupid.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,time to sort by controversial to see what the shills have to counter this
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an awesome bunch of DD.  However, I am retard and after reading it all twice, I came away with ""Shapes, triangles and squiggly colored lines are gooder"" and ""Turn up the volume"" and finally ""Buy more GME and HODL"" said GME until I read in the WSJ ""Citadel and Melvin offices are being liquidated to cover their losses on GME shorts"".  The article should hopefully contain a link to whichever auctioneer outfit is handling the ""rehoming"" of their yachts, Lambos and 2nd, 3rd and 4th vacation homes. 

What did I miss?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go here, hit ctrl F, search GME and you'll find out how many FTD's there were last month and you could probably 50× that for this month so far since the price of the stonk is way higher. Just something to think about for that smooth ass brain
https://www.sec.gov/data/foiadocsfailsdatahtm"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do you think the The Fed declining to extend capital relief for banks will do to interest rates? I think they did that so that banks need to buy more bonds, so we put a break on higher interest rates for just a little while. So I disagree with your assessment that funds will continue to short bonds, I think overall the market goes up even higher for the time being and all the markets start to rally again. My question- how does that affect gme?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked at the pictures only, then read the comments.

Great DD!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in other words, buy more GME and get a good harness to strap in for launch... Got it!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I see the mass exodus out of RH and Webull and others not mentioned with retail also removing margin from their position as being a possible catalyst.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,oo pretty colors
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Basically buy and hold you fuckin retards

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing work, uncle Hank. Grateful for your contribution."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Uncle Hank. Wonderful DD and contribution to the community!


Unlike the other Uncle... that steals DD and never contributes back to the community where he steals the DD from and capitalize on by asking for donations (yeah the audacity)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Love post like this keep them coming
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,👏 bravo. I’m buying more.... thanks

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is gorgeous you ugly duckling.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing thay im worried about.. right now people can still buy the stock around 200 usd. IF you're right and it pops to 10k... Almost nobody will be able to buy it anymore since we are not that rich. And the only thing we could do is HODL. But to get the stock up we need volume right? Care to inform me?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Cn ad tldr at bottom¿ Many words too long head start pain
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! Absolutely bonkers DD! I actually developed the patience to read through all of that and I'm illiterate!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just need one graph with a giant up arrow. That is all.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD thanks

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been here long enough I now scroll to the comments to check for debunking or counter arguments before reading long posts. Looks like the coast is clear, imma go read the DD now.

EDIT: das dat good shit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes must remember to upvote because bots will never forget to downvote. This is a battle of information.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Um, 2% of retards downvoted this biblical piece? What in the ever-loving fuck are you looking for that is more impressive than this???"

Thanks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could read.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that’s what I call a DD!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tuesday GME will announce they are changing their name back to Funcoland and distributing the newspaper like prices again. The whole world will rejoice and they will become a $1T company.

In all seriousness though, I'm a huge retro gamer and that market has been seeing a HUGE increase in prices (my collection via my app is claiming my stuff is worth $90k). If GameStop decided to be the arbiter of online retro game sales, meaning the ebay of buying/selling retro games (they take like a 8% cut of sales), their value would go through the roof and be completely justified... and I would love it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn...it took me days to read all this and when I got to the end my smooth brain forgot what I read at the beginning. Nice charts thought!🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Incredible read
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So what you're saying is that we should all market sell 10 then market buy 11 every day?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it just me or did I only see penis shaped chart handles? Asking for an autist
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I usually skim around 10%-30% or skip right to the TLDR as soon as I read poorly written DDs  


But this DD my fellow ape, this is something else. I thoroughly enjoyed every single word. Thank you so much for writing and sharing this. This is truly top tier DD"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t read a single word in this but I think I saw “cat-girl” at some point so upvotes around.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,so i read that several banks will not be releasing a large portion of stimmy payments till the 24th... after earnings... i'm a dumb ape but... is this sus?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What a fabulous post
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing work, my deepest thanks explode from the tip of my diamond dick 🚀🚀🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,damn i like $CUM
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My eyes are bleeding GME but thank you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"One other reason the price didn't go fully back up after the flash crashes on 3/10 and 3/15 are sell walls. Hedgies routinely put up several thousand shares sell walls on every smaller dip (hence the ladder impression, as price is dipped and then prevented from going back up and repeat) and also on these big ones."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good shit my man! I've learned so much in the last 3 months about the stock market cause of apes like you!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quick question for OP or the more wrinklier brained apes here: So, MACD and intervals - look at weekly candles like OP, you get a super strong bullish MACD. Switch to daily candles and MACD is about to cross over signal, which is a rather bearish indicator, right? 

How do you guys determine which time intervals to use? More long term movement always more important than shorter term, at least if you're not daytrading?

disclaimer - I'm long GME, just curious on how to apply MACD best."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Uncle Bank!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"WOW. This has to be the best DD I have read anywhere on Reddit. And I'm very thankful that it wasn't bias but straight forward n factual/technical. My confidence in GME is through the roof now, and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed reading this. Thank you!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ve reinforced my diamond hands. I LIKE THE STOCK.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all, excellent DD, some of the best I've read.  

I am getting more convinced that something is going to happen very soon.  

Either way, I'm a 💎👋🦍 for lyf."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is amazing, thank you. I truly believe the ""paperhanding section should be first, as many people fall into this category of perpetual loss, due to misunderstanding the rise and fall of a stock. We hold, brothers. 

Not financial advice."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I tried, I really did. When I thought it was done there were more charts and words. I need a nap. Great job on what you did. It was amazing."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difference with this is Achilles died, GME, AMC and the rest of the meme stocks have not died but only gotten more powerful."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like the stock, I also like this post."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Obviously smooth brain here and might have way to many crayons up my nose but my question is why can't they just keep shutting down the stock when it takes off like they did the other day? I had epic gain porn then epic loss porn in a matter of minutes....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck, I want to believe so haaaarrrrrddddd. 

I have positions, but I don't know if to go balls deep...

BULLISH on financial literacy 

Calls on FinLit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have also learned more about the stock market the last 2 months than I didn't in 8 years of bagging fries at McDonald's. I fucking love this place
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That'll happen with a gender studies degree

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've started watching Billions, and I actually understand the stakes of that show. Had I not been involved with GME, I would have never understood just how bad Axe capital (or any other hedge funds for that matter) is. 

But yeah, I've managed to accrue enough knowledge on the stock market to use it for my own benefit (outside GME and whatnot). That $90k student loan debt ain't gonna pay itself."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"SAME. I’m a geologist, but I started 2021 knowing nothing about the stock market. I’m having a blast learning with all of you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I recommend new traders to join chat forums

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"While the DD on here can definitely have some quality to it, it's important not to rely on it to actually learn about the market. Even the best DD on here is usually fundamentally flawed in some respect. Often times (especially lately with GME), it'll be 95% actual legit analysis built on 5% complete misunderstanding of the entire underlying premise."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of technical analisys is based on the past. I’m affraid GME is a different beast that most of what others has faced in the past. I won’t rely too much in technical
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I read the words 'Bollinger Bands' the other evening and was nodding along - thought after I had NO IDEA about any of this a few months ago. Learning by doing is the best education.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to sound too cynical, but the education system did its job perfectly.

Don't educate people on things that matter but on things that make them easily moldable.

Not knowledge about mortgages so you blindly accept 25+ years of debt so you can be a model citizen.

No knowledge of stocks other than buy/sell so they can make money from you

No knowledge of how to accumulate wealth so they can steel it from you and give 0.01% returns while they get 45%"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just saying that to my wife. A person like me is not supposed to know what I now know.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"but we all should be investing for a 3% return to keep it safe and to stick to fundamentals, amirite? lol MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOON"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a school for techinical trading? Why didnt I learn this at my MBA? Lately it's been investopedia for me. 😔

But I have proven to may self that my life is fine without the $$$ I put in and I’d be fine if I never saw it again, and I’ll be stoked as all fuck if and when it doubles, triples, quadruples, ect ;) hold easy"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For me its a significant part of my savings, like  40%. And I'm down 30% as I bought at $286. But honestly, I'm a student and my networth isn't as high to begin with, won't cripple me in the future if I lose that money.
But it still feels like shit because I think about all the things I COULD buy with that money, could be a good downpayment for eye laser surgery or an amazing vacation."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that the borrow rates are so low on  iborrow desk is completely unsensical.  Friday the number of shares available was in the hundreds yet the borrow rate was minuscule. I have no finance degree and perhaps an IQ that can be counted using my fingers and toes but might I suggest that brokers are lending out these shares at discounted rates because they are trying to keep hedge funds in the game. If (sorry when) the hedge funds go broke eventually the brokers will be on the hook to some degree and they certainly don’t want that. I can’t see anyway for the fuckers to wiggle out of it but it seems that they are trying to kick the can further down the road hoping we will chase the next shinny object ( like perhaps Ag).

I know I am a moron and have no business posting about shit I know nothing about, but it makes sense in my smooth brain."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it could be a good sign?

Possibly the institutions want all the shares they have, to be borrowed at any rate.  They’re catching on that the more that’s borrowed the more the stock is worth in the end, when the stock is squeezed and shares returned.

Maybe the share lending institutions have really caught on to how deep the shorts are.
There’s already millions of shares lent out at higher interest rates that will create the margin call necessary. This low rate is a “please no don’t borrow more” but have your fingers crossed while you say it and smile
The end is near?

I have no financial literacy and no idea in the slightest how all of this works but hey thanks for letting me put my two cents in!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Possible because there’s no new shorts. They could just be borrowing and returning intraday. Low rates might not mean shares are easily found to loan, it could mean shares haven’t been borrowed enough. If we look at it from a supply and demand perspective, supply could be low, but if demand is lower than supply the rate would decrease with it. Smarter hf probably wouldn’t want to ever short gme again"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"January's borrow fees were 80% annualized at their peak. Note that these rates are for retail, who most of the time will get the short end of the stick. They were extremely insane.

What I'm trying to say I guess, that, along with fintel, IBKR, along with the exchange reported data (""FINRA"" doesn't report SI to the public directly, Morningstar does, and they have been using an incorrect value for the float) showing 26% of float, that there are simply the shares available to short.

You'll see that 26% number on a Bloomberg Terminal and these are what the big boys use.

A large number of shorts were forced to cover during that initial short squeeze.

The price action right now isn't due to a short squeeze, but rather a lack of liquidity in GME's stock driving the price further and further up, combined with options activity.

Right now there is not too much risk in taking out a short position, especially if you hedge that position in another way (a long call is a common way to hedge upside risk). Dealers know this and that is why the borrow rate is so low."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?

I assume all the free press has helped sales over the past two months, would be great to hear about it on the call. Although the official numbers reporting only goes up to January, they can mention the past two months earnings in the context of future guidance, right?"

It's possible, even probable, that the original shorts that prompted the squeeze have been covered. They posed a massive weakness in the hedges' strategy, one they are sure to have repaired at the nearest availability. They are greedy, not stupid."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume also flagged directly before the big spikes, though, didn't it? I'm not saying the situation is identical or even similar, because retail has changed the face of this and the establishment is likely altering its strategy as a result, but it is worth consideration at least."

I learned very little of any of it in high school or college. Which is sad, because for most people going into college, they have to get student loans, and most have no understanding of what exactly they're signing up for. Hell, I knew kids getting an extra 5k a semester in loans for money to just throw around and party with when it was for ""living expenses"".

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see what you mean about the bull side argument. If IBKR has shares to lend, then they stand to gain by lending, provided their shares will be returned (e.g., borrower doesn’t default [is that possible?]), and of course borrow fees are paid.

If the situation of borrowed, counterfeit, doubly-shorted shares is as bad as has been estimated, though, isn’t there a risk of non-payment to IBKR? I mean, how many retail buyers could foot a short-squeeze-sized bill?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stupid question: Could synthetic shares or ETFs explain the cheap borrow fee?

My theory would be something about how if GameStop is flooded with synthetic shares, would that make an infinite amount of shares to short? New shorts do not actually need shares to borrow, they can make them up. With unlimited supply the price of borrowing would be dirt cheap, as we see now.

The other theory I would have involves ETF shorts as opposed to directly shorting GME.  But I have not seen crazy price action on the borrow fee there, and ETFs certainly do have unlimited shares to short."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although unfortunate that borrow rates are so low (because that contributes to the short side of the equation and suggests brokers are comfortable lending a supposedly over-shorted equity), I am less concerned with brokerages’ ability to set rates. 

In fact, it is good news that they do, as it lets me infer how they are perceiving risk to lending out shares. And herein lies my concern: at least explicitly, it appears they perceive their risk as minimal.

My open question, then, is why is the rate so low? In other words, why are they confident in their exposure to short positions? Surely, brokerages have superior data to rely on when it comes to determining the true numbers of shorted shares and FTDs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bingo. I think that is the only strategy that will take us to the moon at this point. **The catalyst.** I am counting dearly on the earnings call and announcements coming from it.

At this point, we do not know who are they borrowing from? how much? at what rate? etc. We also do not know if the IB is colluding with shorters and charging less on the borrow or even getting a cut in the future for the discount they are offering today.

Remember, these are all buddies who do not mind anything unethical as long as they can pretend it to be legal on the balancesheet.

I hope we get that earnings surprise or announcement of GME buying some online gaming platform or something else smashing so send the stock soaring. Even after that the rate of ""soaring"" should be higher than the fire power Melvin must have saved up for the earnings day. Fingers crosses. Great discussion guys.

See you on the moon, hopefully. :D"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the thing. Unless I am misinterpreting your comment and the above DD, what’s implied is that enough of the initial shorts (when the shorts were 140% of the float) were covered, decreasing significantly the odds of a second short-squeeze driven by outstanding short volume (and any FTDs, counterfeits, etc,).

What we’re left with, then, like what Uncle Hank and you are saying, are price fluctuations based on few available shares. A catalyst could propel the price upwards and whatever extant short positions (less than 140% and greater than 26%) could get squeezed. This would send the ship into orbit, discounting any further illegal outmaneuvering from the shorts (however unlikely). 

What we don’t and can’t know is the true percent of shorted shares. The best available data point to 26% of the float being lendable for shorting (based on Bloomberg Terminal data).

Coupled with low borrow rates, this suggests outstanding shorts are not in the outlandish range, as purported elsewhere."

I think it's hard to sustain a claim like this without keeping into account the increased amount of shorts on ETF's containing GME. Last week there was DD posts here whicu goes more into detail, basically the message being put out that short positions supposedly have covered their shorts on GME might be complete FUD and at least in no way confirmable as ETF's containing GME have seen spike in shorts in same time period

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/m5zoos/gme_how_the_dip_today_was_due_to_etf_shares_being/

>this is all synthetically created to kick down the eventual outcome down the road through lending ETF shares and recent data proves that. Over 3.5 million shares were lent out through etf's yesterday and their failure to deliver's are accumulating each and every day. It's like maxing your credit card to pay off the debt on your other credit card. Does it solve the issue? No. It only delays it and makes it worse. Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip and just goes on to show you how this is all synthetically created to spread FUD"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely intentional.  Ask someone who didn't go to college (or a low paying job after graduating) about how much a pain it is to get a credit card.  Massive PITA starting with a cash secured card where you have to build up your credit limit over months if not years.  

Compared to the CC drives on campus when you're still in school with starting limits in the thousands.  

Years of ""general education"" algebra/calculus that never used APR, mortgage payments, IRAs, or present/future value of money as examples.  

Financial institutions rely on gatekeeping to increase perceived value of their services and to build a population of wage slave slaves paying interest in perpetuity for reliable revenue streams.  Ex. Tax filing software companies that prevent the IRS from simplifying the tax filing process."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great point. I wonder though if the lenders are under the deception involving synthetic shares (or additional bets on “real” shares) as anybody else.

If demand to borrow shares for shorting is at a low, IBKR could be like okay, lower the rates then. But if I borrow those shares and synthetically short those initially borrowed shares with connected bets like a CDO, then the massive shorting is cloaked behind the curtain and  short interest looks the same to the lender,  as it does anyone else. 

Naturally I must disclaim am tarded, don’t know much but this is fun conversation."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My question is, why don't we have access to this superior shorted shares data as retail investors?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My sentiments exactly. See you on the moon 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers would have shorted these ETFs earlier than last week. Unless there is a post or few that shows that they were, it's likely just a coincidence that coincides with the broader market getting spooked due to bond yields, SLR not be extended, and the FOMC in general. For example a lot of ETFs had available to borrow shares decrease suddenly on 3/19, yet come back up later that day.

Even SPY had its available-to-short shares decrease recently and that tracks the S&P 500, which GameStop isn't in.

OP presumably can't say what ETF tickers they're talking about so it's hard to do a comparison between those ETFs and others, but especially with rebalancing coming up, an arbitrage opportunity does present itself, and people will take advantage of that.

>> Secondly, there is no volume to back up the current dip

The lack of volume is exactly *what* backs up the dip, as well as the dramatic rise. I know you didn't write this, but this is my general point. The huge swings in price are due to a lack of liquidity."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I follow you. It is entirely possible that some lenders are being hustled, too. Even IBKR. What makes me think twice though, at least in IBKR’s case, was how aware their CEO was of the magnitude of his predicament (as seen in his arguments on the news in January).

My reasoning is that if he knew the shares were headed to the thousands, possibly infinity (however absurd that sounds), then he may have grasped that even 140% (of the float shorted) was an underestimate. In that case, he has - or certainly had - the resources to be acutely aware of the accurate data of shares shorted and counterfeited.

Of course, time has passed, and many shares and dollars have changed hands. Come to think of it, you’re likely correct: the big guys are hustling each other. I hope they are also having a hard time keeping track of accurate data. It seems only fair."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you. Ideally, the free market would be transparent and fair.

It did require quit a bit of grinding at times, which was tedious, but I didn't mind it. Overall, it was ok for me. I enjoyed the story of FFIV much more. I've watched playthroughs of 1 and 2, and own 5-8. I've beaten 7 & 8 (love them both), but haven't played 5 or 6 yet.

It seems weird to act before the rule comes into force though, and also negates the supply vs demand factor, which until now, I assumed would be the major part of this calculation.

2021-03-21 23:39:48,wallstreetbets,"PLTR Analyst Ratings - FUD, Bad Faith and abusing their analyst positions So I was doing my DD on PLTR today and whilst going over the ownership structure and Shareholder History I did see some amusing things - I say ""amusing"" when I'm really fuming. No need to be creative and interpret anything on this one - it doesn't get any clearer than this.

1.) Some of you might've seen the **Credit Suisse and William Blair Analyst Ratings for PLTR** \- Underperform with a Price Target of 20 as of February 16th 2021 (Reviewed and unchanged as of March 15th). Note that both those ratings were issued after the FY 2020 report dropped - so after seeing the 47% increase in revenues.

[The 2 Underperform Ratings](https://preview.redd.it/172gxd93lfo61.png?width=1404&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b4448e07eef9f839a156716e982e53f14db92849)

2.) Now guess who loaded up massively on PLTR shares for the last reporting date. I'm talking the **BIGGEST** relative position increase for the last reporting date - they didn't just double or tripple down, they quintupled down. Unfortunately I can't get the exact number of shares - but my best guess is that it's an Overweight position at this point (Edit: It makes up for 21% of CS Asset Management LLC‘s portfolio - Check Edit 2 - wowzaaaa)

[Credit Suisse with the BIGGEST relative position increase in the last reporting period - PLTR is CS Asset Management LLC‘s biggest position accounting for 21&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;#37; of their Portfolio \(Check Edit 2 for more on that\)](https://preview.redd.it/3ci8uk87lfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=26d896e80c2f8fde57ad285d6f064a1c7e149181)

Now - in which subsidiary of Credit Suisse does said analyst Chew, Yaoxian work?

[He's a VP at Credit Suisse Asset Management, LLC \(US\) - yep](https://preview.redd.it/zlfu1bxdlfo61.png?width=1819&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3ddbd45cd5ab4121ad880669fb51f4570bd19d30)

Little sidenote: If you had invested based on mister Chew's analysis, you would've made a whopping -8% return for the past 3 years! *Blacklisted the guy.*

Mister Bhavan's ratings don't look a lot better.

If you're reading this Chew - shame on you and if you wanna boost your accuracy and recommendation performance - maybe do your job and post an actual analysis, not just one that serves to spread negative sentiment in the hopes of lowering your cost basis. I bet you don't give two shits about actually doing your job though.

3.) Now let's have a look at William Blair's trades.

[No comment](https://preview.redd.it/3nbo9hmemfo61.png?width=1118&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=8cdc305208a842b497abb06c9a253501621be67f)

[Bhavan Suri's Ratings not looking too rosy either.](https://preview.redd.it/74w7rwxamfo61.png?width=1796&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=0d31456fba6a1716e9ab971fdccc01bb0fdfa536)

Let's have a look at William Blair's disclosure:

Officers and employees of William Blair or its affiliates (other than research analysts) mayhave a financial interest in the securities of Palantir Technologies Inc.. 

**(NO SHIT)**

This whole thing is just bullshit and I seriously question why these guys are even allowed to issue forecasts.

**TLDR:** 
CS and William Blair analysts are issuing sell/underperform ratings while massively loading up on PLTR stonks.

The only analysts I trust on this one are the GS analysts - the rest are full of BS, giving Sell recommendations while loading up on the respective stonks themselves. If you issue a sell recommendation, well then at least put your money where your mouth is. Not like mister Chew was just some low tier analyst who couldn't affect the decision of his firm to buy or sell PLTR shares - he's a VP at CS USA LLC - Chinese wall, my ass. **Their DDs and PTs are literally worthless.** Do your own DD, don't even look at the analyst ratings or if you do, look at their track record and question if they're pursuing some alterior motive. 
I've literally seen DDs on WSB that have been more accurate than these *professional* forecasts. This just goes to show that these guys are just trying to load up on more stonks at a lower cost basis by spreading negative sentiment. It's infuriating - I am legitimately pissed and hope that more people see this blatant bullshittery.

[At least Goldman gives honest ratings and their actions are in line with the recommendations they issue. - Issue a buy rating - load up on stonks. Issue a sell rating - sell the stonks. How fucking hard can it be.](https://preview.redd.it/zi72enzenfo61.png?width=1413&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=3201e3eeb872eedba58f33ce9e1a797e240051b5)

**Edit: Valuation Concerns**

I see some people saying they're currently grossly over-valued. If compared to some of their peers I'd disagree, there might be some inflation but that's due to future expectations. 47% Sale's Growth last year, IBM partnering up with PLTR is bigger than it may sound at first glance - IBM has been in the game for decades and surely have the resources to create some beautiful things but they've given up competing against PLTR.

[If you look at the recently listed peers \(Snowflake, Datadog, Dynatrace\) - they're not as grossly overvalued as one might think given the hype they've gotten recently. They just have to \\""grow\\"" into that market cap and beyond, which I have no doubt they will. Also have a look at the EPS - the recently listed ones \(except for Dynatrace\) all have negative EPS \(PLTR in fact did have positive earnings at one point, but they're just re-investing everything and growing aggressively\).](https://preview.redd.it/vgmc4kiq2go61.png?width=1181&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=6c0e3bf371c8d6fbc921d51905d710463af3fa82)

Also: if you deduct the stock based compensation from FY2020‘s net loss (which is sound as it‘s not a recurring cost), they‘ve actually netted a profit. I might do a more extensive DD on the Financials and have a deeper look into the shareholder‘s portfolios to show the conviction of the individual shareholders.

If they end up getting IL-6 from the DoD - they would be the first company to ever get that level of clearance. That would attract other governments like the UK, France, Germany etc. (I bet some of those are already in discussions with PLTR). Government Contracts made up for around 50% of revenues last year. So even more revenue growth and more partnerships (which means higher revenue stability). They're also expanding into the private sector. I see a lot of upside but given the current market environment (high treasury yields - uncertainty about future inflation developments...) it might take a while.

u/Ada_Diamonds did a [great DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lkngg9/former_pltr_engineer_dd_part_2_usability/?utm_source=share&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;utm_name=iossmf) on the future potential of PLTR - so just check that one out. It's not very financy, more from a practical PoV which imo makes more sense in valuating these companies - no way you'd value TSLA, PLTR, SNOW etc. with your traditional DCF/Multiples methods.

**Edit 2 - CS Securities USA and William Blair - Broker-Dealer/MM role:**

u/McKoijion brought up a fair point in saying that the aforementioned Credit Suisse subsidiary has a broker dealer role and hence does not hold those stonks to profit from them, they hold them to facilitate trade - which is partly true. The shares were acquired via Credit Suisse Securities and are currently held by CS Asset Management LLC who have a Low turnover rate (meaning they usually hold securities for a long period of time). Credit Suisse Asset Management LLC is the top 20th Institutional Shareholder. Their biggest position is PLTR (21% - the next largest position is ~10%, now that’s some insitutional YOLO like I’ve never seen it before. Obviously they’ll trade some shares to the other CS subsidiaries, I don’t expect them to have 20% of their portfolio in PLTR when the next filings get released). That imo has nothing to do with them being PLTR's IPO partners alongside GS and MS - neither GS nor MS have that weighting on PLTR stock.

[Credit Suisse Asset Management - top 20 institutional holder](https://preview.redd.it/lg08skyt4go61.png?width=381&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;format=png&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;auto=webp&amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;amp;s=b397365437263c8d1ddb7917a702ea0aa60d2ace)

As to William Blair - They're an actual Asset Manager, no MM or Broker-Dealer role there - pretty straightforward, they're just holding.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR will definitely not underperform and Credit Suisse ratings seems to coming out of the glory holes there dom master made for them. Brent Hill from Jefferies has covered PLTR before and set a price target at $40. PLTR is not your “get rich quick to make wife’s boyfriend happy” stock like some others had been. PLTR has good fundamentals, tech which has been very funded by the DOD, and applications which can change any industry once fully integrated into them. Watch the demo day if you have any doubts. 

For those who care and can pronounce the word Fun-da-men-tals here, Jefferies and Goldman both have reported on this. I mentioned it before, you should read the full research reports on Street Guru website and understand what PLTR is about.

PLTR had a 47% growth in 2020, total revenue of $322M vs. $301M estimated. They are also targeting $4B in 2025 revenues or 30%+ 5 year CAGR! I won’t repeat the full report here and let you apes do your own reading in the link below:

25@$28.32. Will be adding more to average down cause I actually like the stock and technology they have!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR has been a punching bag for a while. I think They're the next big thing. I believe they're destined to be valued in the low hundreds. We've just scratched the surface of what they can do. The IBM deal is just the beginning.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Chew Yaoxian is just salty because Daddy Karp said multiple time that Palantir will never do business with China and addresses them as the adversary for America.

seriously, more times than not u have to just completely disregard what these ppl are telling you - theyre not doing what they do bc they have your best interests in mind lol they literally get paid to make their company money, not to help you make money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has not only been losing money for years, but the rate at which they are losing money is also actually increasing year to year. Not only are they losing more money than ever before, their margins are actually getting worse. It is not a conspiracy that ppl are giving them a sell rating."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in the position. I hope sentiment changes in the future.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,what are you using for the data?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol isn’t that how they operate?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Semi serious question, should palantir software by great at solving crime?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"About any sell side analysis you see, keep in mind that buy-side (I.e. Hedge funds) never ever take them seriously. They never even look at what they say, they only use them to grab data, models etc.

And it the buy side doesn't give two shits about the sell side analysis and ratings, then who does? Well, only suckers,thats who."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we supposed to be researching these companies? I just invest in which stonks have the best memes.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They load up, get friends to buy puts, dump shares all at once to drive price down and trigger stop limit sells.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Corruption pays for these companies.  Fines are a paltry cost of doing business.  No one is afraid of going to jail because they know it doesn’t happen (2008 anyone?).  But the authorities will hammer regular citizens for petty theft.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So new investor here why invest in PLTR?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"new strat if any analysis telling you to sell, check who they work for and see if they increased their positions."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that...is that good?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some cash secured puts if you have a target in mind like that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you’re indicating my 4/1 29 calls were straight up retarded huh? Well jokes on you, I’m a fucking idiot."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We're in the downtrend. I'm personally using any dip under $25 as a signal to buy a few more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha i did too.  long pltr so dont matter
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‘re getting sell ratings however they‘ve grown their revenues by 47% from 2019-2020, they disclosed that they‘ll be growing their revenues by 30% in 2021 - that requires some investment. I see some smart money invested in PLTR with pretty big positions, shows they‘re convicted. i.e. Soros Asset Management Fund - PLTR 2nd largest position accounting for ~8% of their 5B AUM and countless other lesser known names. 

Also if you deduct their stock based compensation from last year‘s net loss (as stock based compensation isn‘t a recurring cost) they‘ve actually netted a profit. I‘ll maybe do a more extensive DD on their financials and also on the shareholder‘s portfolios to show their conviction."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Iv in the next few months is shit I have to go so close to itm to get a dollar 30 days out
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you determine a price for weeklies?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you typically strike at for weekly's? 20%OTM on IV spikes or 5% underlying pop?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I get it. Do you get any money from the call? I mean, how much net gain could it possibly be if youre losing 100 shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means he sells a contract that he will purchase 100 shares at $20 on the option market up to a certain date.
He gets a premium of money based on that put strike price and date.
If the option gets excersised, the $2000 (the cash set aside for the 100 shares at $20) gets removed from his account and he gets 100 shares.
If he doesn't get excersied, he gets his $2000 back. He still keeps the premium either way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah if its under 20 on the expiration date
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He also get that option premium to help him lower the entry cost as well.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You first. How bout we both go get some help, we'll get an evaluation. Let's see who walks away. Deal? Hell, lets make a side wager on it too! What do you have to lose?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it really isn't."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries, it depends on your subscription plan but you can get a sub for anywhere between ~3‘000$ - ~20‘000$ annually"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what I’m thinking.  It could revolutionize police work.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, will do when I get home. The 200k isn‘t mine, I‘m at 1030 @ 25.9, hoping to get some more the coming weeks"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir is 3% of my overall ROTH portfolio. Is that a bad call?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And I have literally one percent of your shares 🙂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's as a naked call as it gets
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh hell yeah! I figured it was something I wouldn't be able to figure out!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait for a run up, or earnings!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait for a run up, sell $2-3 above strike."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know much about options but.. He doesn't loose his shares, he's selling them if his call gets assigned. Let's say he sells call 35. He then gets 35 dollar for each of 100 shares. If it's not assigned, he gets a premium and keeps his shares. Win win unless pltr rockets up really high"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He got a premium up front, and then he’d get $65 x 100 x 50 if the stock was over 65 in January of 22. The premium varies depending on how long ago he sold them, but to give an idea 1 is worth ~$230 right now (x50 in his case)"

It’s probably #6 or so in the all time list of meme stocks. Definitely top 10.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a good start. 👍🏻
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya that’s smart if that’s how you want to structure your shares. I have 5500 shares so I might try something similar.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you set your strike at the current price, when wait for it to jump up a couple dollars and sell the contract?

So now say it's 24.50. Do you buy calls at 27 or 24.50, and sell the contract when it goes to 27?"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agree, looking at the surprise on past estimates I still do think that PLTR is overperforming and will continue to have some unanticipated growth. It surely isn‘t a value stock but has huge growth potential. Zack‘s gave them an F for value and an A for growth."

You appear to exhibit paranoia, which is going to make that much more challenging as you weave your delusions into an intricate, evolving story.

I wish I could say it gets better. This is a lifelong struggle you've been handed, and its shitty and unfair, but its the only life you have and I hope you can adapt and make the best of it.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless it was $5B, it doesn’t matter to my analysis.

Also, does that increases compensation benefit you as a shareholder in some way? Is your concern with the company’s board or with your shares?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"RKT is a good play with low float, high SI, and a decent gamma ramp.  Its primed for another run but needs volume to get running and for shorts to squeeze.   It has been massively manipulated into a narrow channel of 22-24 (enough to make options OTM).  Guess who's one of the biggest shorters - Shitadel.  Last 2 second ball squeeze was only gamma (no shorts closed).

Check u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT's yolo.  UWMC (major competitor and bad blood between RKT and UWMC CEOs) was supposed to be put into Russell index and now they are not, so it couldve been a P&D.   UWMC money may be coming back to RKT for a run.  Max pain in options chain is mid $23 which is where we are now.   I dont know since when WSB became all AMC/GME and everything else can get fucked.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think this is accurate, but at this point no one can tell people with legitimate negative feedback from shills and bots.  For weeks there were literally thousands of comments from 3 month old accounts who had only posted about how they ""are gonna sell muh GME"" or had a handful of random comments in niche subreddits.  Pretty clearly paid shills. You still see some of these, but I think many people have started to feel that they are getting more sophisticated.  You'll see people who posted for a week saying 💎✋ and then, on no significant change they will do a 180.  Personally, I find the idea of someone who announces they are going to sell before they sell hilarious."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely not the case whatsoever.

AMC has zero justification behind this movement and has historically had maybe a *tenth* the engagement of GME.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not though. They are not even comparable. GME is history in the making.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,“They stock is undervalued” famous last words from every bag holder ever

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes this is obvious because if you were going to sell you would probably just do it and leave the sub.

The sub continues to grow so there is that too. 

Must be a correlation I am sure."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,But i like the stock
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Admiral you obviously do not like the movies but save your negativity for when you’re wanking your ass and leave us retards alone.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We like the stock! All green here!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Justify it dude.

Literally, sell the prospect of owning AMC stock to people... without using canned rhetoric."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong comment, bud.

But thanks for proving that you are coming to my account to reply, instead of going through the thread."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I gotcha, but if someone was butthurt and sold instead of hodl they'd probably wouldn't comeback to the sub. The carrots are cooked at that point.

I don't think it is a conspiracy to say that a narrative is trying to be controlled by big money that has no clue how the internet actually functions."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"People don't actually YOLO or invest any amount of money without doing some DD.

What's their financials looking like?

How have they treated stock hodlers in the past?

Are there any changes to their business model that can generate a stronger bull thesis?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think gme will drop to 175 before the rocket ... how do I make money on that? Sell or buy a put?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree!! Do not buy options, the hedge funds can see your contract and just keep the price low to let it expire and make you lose money 😊

When this song first came out - and this was before the age of Googling lyrics and widespread use of closed captioning, mind you - I thought it was 'Go Go Jason Waterfalls'.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is important to understand how selling covered calls work. but essentially you're taking your 100 shares and selling a contract that says they have the right to buy your shares at the strike price you choose. witch normally when you set the strike price if you do it too far out you won't make any money off the premium. With GME everyone is under the assumption that it's going to go past $800 so a lot of people are snagging up those calls (witch I've seen have a $600-$800 premium) so essentially you'd be selling someone the right to buy your shares but since it's such a unrealistic price(sorry guys it is) it will most likely expire worthless. Now on the flipside. if it does moon and goes past $800 you lose all your gains you would of made past $800 so if you sell a contract for $800 and the price hits $2000 you lose $1200 in gains for each share.


edit: please let me know if I missed anything important. I just barely got into covered calls so I'm genuinely curious if I'm screwing anything up here."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean *writing* a call or a put.  Selling a call or a put just transfers the right to buy or sell at a given price to someone else.

So it’s only if that price goes up in the allotted time frame right? 

So say I set a call option for GME tomorrow at 200, until next Monday. I pay the premium to the broker regardless, but not the actual stock price yet. 

If GME goes to 300 by EOW, I’m up 300k minus the premium I paid and that’s my gain, right? 

It’s like placing a reservation but instead, you’re placing a gamble so to speak, and you’re paying for the RIGHT to place the gamble (the premium)."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling a call can have much more risk than buying a put. 


Technically buying calls and puts is a level 2 action. Lots of risk, but your risk limited to whatever you put into the premium. 


Level 3 is writing a put or writing a call. If the market reverses and does something crazy, your losses can be thousands times what you initially put up front."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're certifiably not a 🌈🐻 calls are all you need to know
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Writing Calls or Puts is when you create an option with the shares you own, with the ""intent"" to sell them at the strike price. (really you just hope stock moves nowhere and you get to make the premium without selling)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea thank you for pointing that out I wouldn’t have noticed that. I changed it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I could help friend!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You got it right. For most people, actually exercising that right would not be feasible though, as one option is often for 100 shares. So your example would mean that while yes, you could buy 100 shares for $200 each, that is $20k you need to spend in order to get the shares. What is more likely is that you don't have $20k and you will just sell those options to someone else before they expire so that you get the profit that way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is the ELI5: 

You make money if it is more likely for people to want it than when you bought it. So if it is closer to breakeven, then people will want it more...therefore you can sell it for more.

Thats it"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,a call shows up on your trading platform like a stock but it has the strike and expiry date underneith the ticker....  you trade them like a regular stock...... you never exercise them because they can always be sold what they are worth ie intrinsic  value plus a premium for what if it keeps going up until expiry date ie extrensic
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not quite as easy because the volume of certain contracts based on expiry and strike price will vary. You have to actually find someone to buy it. The process for doing so is exactly the same though. You click sell and set the price for which you are willing to sell it. As soon as someone is willing to buy it, it will be gone. Or, if no one is willing to buy it, you will have to change the price because you're not going to get your asking price. Either way, as long as there is still a bit of time to go to expiry, you should be able to find a buyer (not always at a profit)."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a two sided market. If you don't want to buy that call, then sell it instead. One side has to be right. Just pick the ""one"" ""the"" hedgies are on."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Traditionally they are used as a hedge for any investor who is “long” a particular stock.  Say you are bullish on Apple long term.  You are invested in let’s say 100 shares @ the current price of $120.  You would buy a deep out of the money put option (say $50) that expires in the next week in the event that the stock dramatically decreases in value.  You would pay a slight premium for this hedge (something like $20).  If Apple drops to $50 in the next week, you would be able to “exercise” that option and be able to now buy 100 shares at $50.  You would have to actually pay for those 100 shares ($50 x 100 = $5,000) plus the premium you bought the put option for ($20).  So in that case, it cost you $5,020 to get 100 shares of Apple.  But since you’re bullish long term, that’s probably a good deal for you.  And you still have your original 100 shares on top of that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. It's part of the ""Last Days of Left-Eye"" documentary. It's why she was in Honduras in the first place; to film it. Wish she would've held off on it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Say I'm the market maker. The farther out the calls are, the less I have to hedge as the MM. MM's dont try to make money on the stock, they try to stay neutral which is a balancing act.

Say I wrote an 800C strike as MM and sold it to you because you were looking to buy lottery jackpot calls. If I think there's less than a 10% chance GME hits $800 by next friday, I only have to buy 10 shares per contract to hedge right now. 


But if you wanted to buy a $250 strike call? Shit, I might have to buy 70 shares per contract on the spot after I collect the premium from you. And a 200 strike call would obviously require me to turn around and buy basically all the shares to hedge.


tl;dr calls close to the current price help the squeeze. The farther out the calls, the less they help the squeeze. You make more if they hit, though, so it's a bit of a prisoner's dilemma. 

Anyway this is why I buy shares and write covered calls.  I don't touch long calls on GME with the premiums where they are."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. But if it rockets you will be obligated to sell those shares or buy back the contract at a higher premium.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If I see money in it I will. Won't be yoloing though. Not dumb enough to bet the farm on gamestop. Made a good penny on stock and options though.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn't change the expected value at all. You're buying $15 for $1.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Whoa... so you could sell something you don’t have?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock price can also remain stagnant (move sideways) that's the killer. Because smart retards straddle and strangle options but you can still get burned by a sidewinder share price. Always buy options on stocks that have high volatility that's how you make the most money!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't we all just get along?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh. Unfortunately I'm not my hypothetical friend and only own 14 shares. And that's not a high enough account balance for questrade to let me sell options if I'm reading it correctly. If someone else uses questrade please verify
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So close!  The first sentence was great.  Sarcastic, witty, and you ALMOST came off as a verbalist!  

Then that “asshole” bit. The brad I know doesn’t need to use swear words to leverage his point. 

To be the Bradest Brad, you must first achieve the enlightenment of all Brads. I am sorry to say, you are not yet there grasshopper."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So where do I insert the quarter to play?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its honestly super duper stupid simple.  

Put: on this date, i expect stock to be this price(down).  If right, yay, money! If wrong, lose it all! 


Call: on this date i expect stock to be this price(up). If right, yay, money! If wrong, lose it all!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah! I have a billion coins in a video game
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you still have the contract for the option, you sell the option before the option expires."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Watt?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically there are lots of factors that determine the price of an option other than the price if the underlying, so the option can be worth more than you paid for it, even if the stock doesn't hit the strike price, so you can sell the option for a profit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,he is selling the call contract itself to someone who has the money to exercise it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately no. But if it does reach 800 you'll probably make money than on selling calls anyway.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys it's ok. I think he's just salty about the Oilers spanking the Jets and sending them to bed without a snack. Canadian stuff. Nothing to worry about, we do this all the time. I will end this Canadian stand-off by issuing a hockey stick fight to the death challenge. You know the custom. Accept it, or say, ""I'm a paper handed bitch boy,"" and be permitted to walk away"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember it as 

Put down

Call up"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If right, yay, money!

But then you have to time when to sell your options because they can peak in value weeks or days before they expire."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but you don’t lose it all you just lose the premium you paid if you don’t exercise your option
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I need good explanation
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always learned it as   


Call up.  
Put down.  


Buy means you dont have the shares in your possession.  
Sell means you have them in your possession."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was stupid simple and educational. I want to give you an upvote, but you're at 69. Let's just keep it that way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about selling tho? Explain those. I sell calls bc I like the stonk and don't expect it to reach my rediculos 800 price. Depending on the date, that is like 4k to 8k in my pocket do I can buy dips"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Y'all?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ohhh so your profit would be the premium?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so. Thanks for all the info anyway. Best of luck
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stereotypes are abounding!  Yeah, i’m not really into hockey, but nicely done doubling down on the confirmation bias you’re grappling with."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now we're getting into very detailed discussions but: you would get the difference between the value of the option vs the share price. If you have a 200c option for a share worth 300, you can buy 100 shares for $20k, but they're worth 300 per share right? So you could exercise the option, buy 100 shares for $20k, then immediately sell them on the market for 300 a share, or $30k total, giving you a profit of $10k.

But you don't have $20k to buy the shares. So you need to sell the option to someone who can actually exercise it. That option is worth $10k because that's the difference between the cost of exercising vs what you get if you instantly sell them after you got the shares.

This means that you can sell that contract for up to $10k at which point it costs more for the contract premium plus exercising it rather than just buy them on the open market. All this is called intrinsic value of an option, the difference between the share price and the strike price of the option.

But what if you sell the option before it expires? The share price is 300 now but it could go higher. This unknown, or potential increase, is the extrinsic value, or time value. If people think that the price is going higher, your option will be worth more than $10k. The longer it is til expiry and the higher the probability of the stock going up, the more the option will be worth. The extrinsic value is the guess, the assumption that a share will increase enough for it to be worth even more than it is now. It's essentially a gamble. So, the closer you get to expiry, the less likely your share is to move drastically, and so the less extrinsic value it has (because the probability of the price moving wildly decreases). This, by the way, is called theta decay or time decay and is what you sometimes see here people talk about."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.. back to Microsoft weeklies that expire worthless!

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking hate movies that kill innocent kids just having fun.  FUCK DO I HATE THEM.  You kill kids in TV shows or Movies I'm out.  Sorry..  just irks me.  I type all this as I'm watching my 2 year old son on a monitor going to sleep mumbling..    thats the last of my rant.  good luck this week everyone.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the point the next film is going to drive home is how indestructible they are. Like even rip through tanks like a knife through butter.

If you assume the attack was rather sudden and everywhere (essentially before the government decides to believe the threat is credible), what I don't get tho is how the government people down in the bunkers didn't solve things.

At the very least just have a drone hover over a cliff blasting people noises."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're pretty bulletproof but I've yet to see anything that was 50cal bfg proof. 

Those things kill buildings."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wait... yes there is... we just haven't awakened them yet.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, what I saw of the next movies preview made it pretty clear these things are like hornets in a bees hive. Just constant slaughter unabated.

Imagine right now there's suddenly 2-3 of these things near everyone everywhere across the globe. How does the army react accordingly when their very own bases have a couple tearing through. Your vehicles will get destroyed by any lurking between towns when you try to deploy. They move so fast your tank turret probably can't even rotate fast enough to keep up, their abilities are essentially magic, their skin is indestructible and they can crush anything like its nothing, regardless of the weight of that object. (I just assume they are alien technologically enhanced biological weapons sent to clear out a planet ahead of an invasion.)

Logistically it makes sense when you assume they were everywhere instantly (either popped out ground or came from space or whatever).

Thing is, it wouldn't take long for the underground mind part of the military to formulate even a basic plan that they would roll out. The hunt by sound and blindness would almost immediately be information they could deduce and use against them. They have speakers everywhere at army bases for gods sakes."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's actually a pretty good movie. One of the better horror ones as of late. I'd give it a watch.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good movie but that little girl is just the worst at making good decisions.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets, We also have a large array of sonar and other sound based weapons. Realistically any submarine sonar device would turn their brains into mush seeing as how feedback from a hearing aid nearly disables them.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, it would only be a matter of time till they figured it out and started creating safe places and spread out from there then start flying overhead and dropping pamphlets to survivors telling them the situation."
2021-03-21 22:35:07,wallstreetbets,"My DD A(NLY)sis on Annaly Capital Alright you dirty fuckin apes, I hate writing long walls of text but the mods won't let me educate you with a DD post that just says “BUY” so here goes.

&#x200B;

[Obligatory \(I know, I need to fuck off Robinhood but I can't transfer contracts\)](https://preview.redd.it/bohppcxldfo61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=93ed60afd09ec40a9fa5e2200bd964df2683ea05)

THIS IS NOT A GME REPLACEMENT, I don't want people to take out GME cash for this play (unless it's being used to fuel the rocket directly)

I've been using Annaly Capital (NLY)as a  hedge against the slight tech fall on Thursday, but here's the weird thing- Annaly goes up when SPY goes down (BUT) when SPY was going up its been shooting up a fuckton, this stock has an insanely low volume which leads to even the smallest of buys being able to shift the price up or down a significant amount. 

(be careful reading this next part since I'm retarted and don't know the technicals) (the retartedness actually applies to most of this not just the next part)

I don’t know the long-term ramifications of NLY, but what I do know is that it hasn't hit its peak and has the potential to at least be moved to twice what it's at right now by seeing its current trajectory and its former high. I also did a little research on the company

It’s a mortgage that pays out dividends to its stock owners (much like the RKT play) except as shown here, it had an insanely good 4th quarter-

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/maeke02odfo61.png?width=1021&format=png&auto=webp&s=4b6b00b91ba46ef88906a3dbf804ded819834fbc

A reminder that this isn't my long-play, that would be GME...but I do like this stock too  👀

But every day since the quarter results have been announced it's been increasing in price exponentially, so I have an inkling that by at least EOW (especially with WSB attention) it could be at 9.50,10$.

“But Jester, it’s at $8.95 right now, that's not that much movement???”

THAT'S ACTUALLY WHERE IT GETS FUCKIN JUICY BROS.

LOOK AT THESE CALL PRICES.

&#x200B;

[Once again, I hate robinhood and will be exiting once I sell these calls.](https://preview.redd.it/vce0r11rdfo61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e0aa49c433755f576657422d1e7a3db00b6c1f44)

&#x200B;

0.05 for 9$ call when it's only fucking 8.95 right now, that's where this post has been going, this is a fucking 10bagger if the price shoots up this week with added volatility. For whatever reason, the premiums have not been catching up with the actual price and they've stayed very low for even ITM calls. 

But I get it. You want to play it safe, which is exactly why I think just purchasing the stock itself is a nice modest gain you can get for this week, yeah the stock isn’t going to shoot up to fuckin- 20, 30$ i don’t think. But going up 4-5$ is also insanely good and is better than getting cucked by stocks you think are going to go up 20-30$ only just to get slapped down a couple of bucks. (I’m looking at you UWMC) I wish no ill will to UWMC folk btw, but hot damn do I keep getting bested by that bad boy. Anyways, no one knows what's going to happen tomorrow, and I’m not a financial advisor, but I wanted to try my hand at researching my own stock to Yolo into, and here it is. Anyways positions: about 500 shares and 700\~ contracts. I’ll keep y'all up to date on how much I win/lose.

Here's a TL;DR

MiniMoon Opportunity, NLY- with proper visibility this could be a big Moon,

I waited until Sunday night to post this because I didn’t want too much attention from people with ill will who can slap it down with their bare hedgie hands, this is a sleeper hit I feel and if it blows up you don't want to be left wishing you could hop in.  Stay safe and stay hydrated brothers <3"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So buying some 4/9cs at open was a mistake lol should have waited til lunchtime
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this stock is a major piece of my longterm portfolio and wasn't <$10 since the early 2000s. I've been taking other gains and dumping back into this to increase my position as the dividend is ridiculous ($0.22/share this quarter). To see it on WSB is actually funny because the stock is boring AF.

I say that in order to preface that this is typically considered an extremely conservative \*investment\* (yes scary boomer word) as there typically isn't a lot of movement or volatility. 1.4b shares and avg daily volume (10 day) <15m, just shy of 50% ownership by institutions,  met or beat earnings expectations since forever, etc.

Please keep that in mind when thinking about options plays as that low volume can make it tough to exit when you want to.

TL;DR - Very solid company that is pure profit, loved by most investors, EXTREMELY undervalued right now. May/June/July $9 strikes damn near guaranteed to print.

Positions: 1000+ Shares and 1/23 leaps at multiple price points."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been running NLY dividends for the last 6 years- always a great safety player for hose too you g to do bonds but wanting to still keep 10-20% of your stocks less risky with a minimum 10% guaranteed gain annually
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Been holding nly for almost a decade. Just let it drip. Sometimes when I feel good about it I buy calls. I bought calls a week ago $9 strike.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,2023 $7 calls are going for $1.91. That means break even price is $8.91 which is at or below it’s current price. Why is this so mispriced?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Also wanna add here that it pays 10% dividends and the ex-dividend date is coming up on 3/30
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Motley Fool is now calling it a buy. Sorry, but smells fishy to me. They don't recommend buying anything until it's near peak right before their buddies unload and you hold the bag.

No thanks, man."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,if their ticker was $ANAL I'd be all in... On this case I will pass and only put 95% of portfolio into weeklies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm kind of hoping that after hitting a 52 week high there would be a sell off and profit taking.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. NLY makes its money from the interest rate spread on MBSs. Buying calls is speculating that the interest rates will spike up.
2. The dividend yield of roughly 10% can cut into your call profitability"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Im rich now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price spread on call options is quite large right now, and have already gone up. Anyone playing this still?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought some calls and hedged with some puts this morning.  Dividend ex date this Friday 3/30, earnings call 4/28, cheap options...all while already in an upswing.  I think you found a good one man!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus there's no volume.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Got 3 3/26 $9C & 1 4/16 $9C queued for market open; hope they go through! Seems worthy of a $25 bet.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next dividend ex date is 3/30

So buy that dip?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying because it says Anal
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long NLY (and CIM which is also worth a look) in my tax-advantaged account. Nice long-term compound dividend-reinvestment play. Yield is \~10% currently. Get in for a small amount of money, reinvest the divi's over years and this position grows pretty nicely. One concerns with the shares is they are non-qualified, so dividends in taxable accounts add to your income. Something to be aware of if holding for a long time (which is why these are good for tax-advantaged accounts).

Positions: NLY: 13,294 at avg \~$9/share since 2012"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so I have actually done my DD on this one and was a previous owner of this stock before. When that dividend comes out, the stock price falls by the dividend amount and will cycle back down. In three month when the next dividend date is close, the stock will cycle back higher, so even if you miss the peak this time around there will be another. It's the natural rise and fall of REITs. I sold break even price for GME back in January ND am looking forward to getting back into my previous position."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes!! I stubbled upon this a few weeks ago browsing sectors on robinhood. My first thought: someone is gonna post I love ANALly on wsb

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone interested should look into 4/16 $9c. Usually my issue with options like this are a wide bid-ask. But April calls seem to be the move. I wouldn’t buy FD’s personally because you’ll probably see some major decay with the low volume and trading sideways
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't transfer if I have call or put options?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought 70 contracts on the dip
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, still a toddler at this so I only got 1 4/30 $8.50c, 1 5/21 $9c and 2 5/21 $10c"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"$8c 03/26 is .93/share, which brings the total to the actual current stock price???"

get gud"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,dm me
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was a over reaction in my opinion, choose a REIT with a strong balance sheet.

I picked up 300 shares of my favorite REIT last march at a deep fucking discount, 20% yield + 150% capital appreciation now. 

 So yeah, buy the fucking dip."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty attractive options. That being said, was looking at Thier financials and I was concerned with the decreased cash on hand over the last 4 consecutive Q. I was curious if they could pay out Thier dividends based on this. So I did some googling and I found an article with a pretty solid bear thesis on the company.

https://investmentu.com/annaly-capital-managements-nly-dividend-safety/

I may still yolo a bit into some calls, just because the price is so attractive, but this seems concerning. What's your input on this?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a bitch to get out of your contracts
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck it I’m in. 200 5/21 $10c
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but I make minimum wage at Wendy's so the actual tax rate is still like 0%.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"since 2019, just buy and hold. nice safe little stock to keep the divs coming. Offsets some of the riskier thing i do, such as sell cash covered puts"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My dad was telling me about this the other day. He buys a little while before the dividends, and sells it a bit after. Said he makes like $600 in dividends, and maybe a few bucks on selling his shares. Not massive gains, but $600 is $600. He is too much of a boomer to go with GME or options though. So he is probably smarter than most of us."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dividend Ex-div is 03/30/21.  Should make up your mind fairly quickly if want dividend.  


""...  this stock has an insanely low volume which leads to even the smallest of buys being able to shift the price up or down a significant amount. ""  NLY does not suffer from a low volume with an average volume of 15,000,000 shares daily.  


I owned NLY because of the dividend.  Sold it because it was a slow pony and never appreciated.."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The volume on these options is way low too
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which stock was it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I was just taking the piss. That's why I started with plot twist instead of straight up accusatory dialogue from the jump. Appreciate the DD dude.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣 Busted & deleted.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy whenever, hold forever, collect everlasting tendies.  This is not financial advise."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just getting started here for the long haul. End of summer if I need the cash but what a value!
Russell don't mean shit right now with these metrics for this gem."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Means you will have a hard time buying and selling options compared to other plays. Havnt checked, so I cant confirm the volume yet.

Edit: actually there is a good bit of volume on the April 9cs at least and the bid/ask isnt too wide at all. Looks like a decent setup"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For sure, buying the dip then was the play. I'm just saying that REITs aren't exactly ""safe""."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What's your favorite reit?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, I've been pretty bullish on the company, but at $.22, they'll have to maintain $8.80 for a 10% div yield. That being said, I also believe they came out of 2020 very strongly, and I'd like to see them aim for an increase in dividend.

They have a pretty decent portfolio, and it seems to me like a higher interest rate can only increase their cash flow, so it doesn't seem impossible to me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought $9c 4/30. Looked good.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a real bitch getting out of them
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"SNY and INFY was similar, but not as close."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,As long as you’re planning on long term and not short term you’re fine
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're looking at the wrong chart. Prior to 2019 it traded consistently above $10 since 2000?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a fair point, I'm not here to explain the nuance of LTVs and such.


But you'll see most REITs are leveraged up, personally I've seen them in the 40% - 67% but beyond that I'm not sure.  You'll want to make sure they've got enough cash generating to make interest payments.



Not financial advice, just a crayon eating ape."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"STWD.


Not investment advice."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure it is the correct one.

Annaly Capital (NLY) on NYSE . Here is a Webull screencap of the price action since 2002 until now with monthly candlesticks: [https://www.reddit.com/user/GreenNeonOne/comments/majbc4/nly/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/user/GreenNeonOne/comments/majbc4/nly/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

&#x200B;

Edit: Did some more digging. The price chart for NLY on Yahoo Finances is different from the price chart on Webull. Not sure which one is correct. According to Yahoo, the stock indeed traded above 10 most of the time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Weird - I don't know what to tell you but I know the Yahoo chart is correct as I've been buying this since 2012 and my purchases have been mostly over $10.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Weird indeed. I suspect Webull is on the wrong side. So this stock is actually quite attractive. And good DD. Here catch a silver award.
2021-03-21 22:05:41,wallstreetbets,SPY 0DTE Treatin me well 
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,are you trading options that expire the same day? or are you buying ones that have a farther expiration date?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What‘s your next play?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Planning to yolo $1000 to on SPY, but I need to watch pre-market to buy Calls or Puts."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats this app called?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice my weeklies are red asf.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I never traded spy so only just realized the options are mwf.  So thanks and possibly fuck you.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy 0dte options on the day of expy... i wouldn’t recommend it honestly unless you are totally desensitized to insane account fluctuations. Rn im yoloing with a dream and so far its working, but one bad trade and im fucked"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Most likely spy at some point today
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically they have calls and puts with different prices... i whatever i can afford or whatever makes the most sense for my strat that day. Spy doesnt always fluctuate or isnt always volitile, but the options have enough volume to reasonably daytrade"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re flipping a coin over and over with your whole balance? You definitely belong here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,i always trade 0dte on monday wednesday and friday bro but idk how you doubled your portfolio thats pretty impressive keep it up
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Much obliged sir
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea boi... ive been a lurker for a damn long time and typically am not active but i make trades like a true autist i think
2021-03-21 21:59:55,wallstreetbets,Now is a perfect time to look like a true aurtist by showing year long gains (as we eclipse the pany crash anniversary) 
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I started with about 25k and probably have a cost basis total of 35k till now. I'm sitting at 45k while this fuck has 165k
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. You did it like one of those actual investors haha. Congrats!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost 800 dollars for the year.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You beat Warren Buffett. Impossible!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the most linear line I've ever seen
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that anyone still uses RH flat out amazes me. We really are retarded.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's actually insane... How do you just steadily make like 6% every week? No big uppies, no big downies, just slow and steady cash money."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Now THAT is a sexy chart BRB gotta check your positions
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright alright, we get it, you’re not retarded"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wow. That is really impressive. Good Job. I hope my current plays work out so I can switch to selling calls. Would you suggest cash covered calls or stock covered calls?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the the smoothest gain I’ve ever seen for a year run. It’s like an escalator to the moon!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why doesn’t it look like an ekg?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude how?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Most recent tech IPOs would kill to make that kind of YoY improvement
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I only sell calls that are covered by shares I own. RH doesn’t give permissions to do otherwise as far as I am aware. I would not want to sell calls on anything I didn’t own since there is theoretically a potential to wipe out (especially if liquidity is low for whatever you are trading).
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I look at it after I have decided if I like a company. I use it to help set the range for my strikes and to aid in determining the premium I should expect.

2021-03-21 21:26:27,wallstreetbets,"DD 4 SQ On 4 March, 2021, narrow-moat Square announced that it will buy a majority stake in music platform Tidal for $297 million
in cash and stock. As part of the deal, Tidal board member and shareholder Jay-Z is expected to join
Square’s board. Much of Cash App’s recent success has come from Square’s efforts to build
out ancillary services on the platform, and this could provide another tie-in. However, in this case, the
strategic connection seems fairly weak, and Tidal is expected to continue to operate independently.
Square's comments on the deal suggest that the acquisition will provide a further entry point to serve
the music industry, so there could be some opportunities on the acquiring side as well. Still, the deal is
much too small to have a material impact on the $78 fair value estimate by experts.

🚀

Square’s business model, characterized by efficient client onboarding, innovative point-of-sale
devices, flat fees, and an internally developed and integrated set of software solutions, allows the
company to reach and retain micro merchants that are unviable for other acquirers. Square's success has largely come from expanding the acquiring market, as opposed to stealing
material share from existing players.
To develop sufficient scale, Square must move past its micro merchant base, and recent results suggest
it is doing just that. At this point, a bit more than half of its payment volume comes from merchants
generating over $125,000 in annual gross payment volume.

🚀

Additionally, the company is making significant progress in cross-selling ancillary services, such as
Instant Deposit and Square Capital, into its merchant client base. Tthe move upstream and
cross-selling will allow Square to materially improve margins in the years ahead and show the viability
of its business model. Square is a narrow-moat niche operator, not a disrupter, with market
share limited by its relatively high pricing and long-term margins constrained by its relative lack of scale.
The company's effort to build out a consumer business surrounding its Cash App creates some option
value. However, Square is competing in a space with winner-take-all dynamics, and its competitors
have large consumer customer bases. That said, Cash App's relative performance has been strong,
suggesting it is positioning itself to be a survivor.

🚀

Tldr;;

The ongoing shift toward electronic payments has created, and will continue to create, room for
acquirers to see strong growth without stealing share from each other. Ancillary services are becoming a more critical engine for growth and will help Square fully monetize its
merchant client base and improve margins. Electronic payment growth is shifting overseas, and Square’s business model looks portable into
international markets, as the company does not rely on a large local salesforce to attract merchants.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mind if I ask how big the city you’re in is and in what region. Curious about penetration. Also income in the region if you can. As much as you’re comfortable with
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, I’m in Hinesville, Ga. Right outside the gate of Ft. Stewart. Income is higher because of the post, all the soldiers and civilians who work on post bring it up. I think everything else is available online."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Square is an ecosystem for your store management which includes paying music in your store. You have to pay license fees to the musicians. Square takes care of they for you. With tidal, square now has a larger catalog it can give you. Pretty smart to buy them actually."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. But, if you buy CNN, your also buying an asset that has the ability to draw subscription revenue. Relying solely on advertising is going to eventually become a weaker business model. It gives you the rights and content to actually make people want to check out Twitters answer to Clubhouse, Spaces. Hey Anderson Cooper just interviewed Elon Musk exclusive to.. Spaces. CNN is also still good at catching live breaking news and they have assets ( journalists) all over the planet. Cable news is dying yes, but CNN is a solid chicken carcass that you can make a solid chicken stock from."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry no. What they spent for Tidal is literally fuck around money for Square. He did that literally to hang with Jay-Z at board meetings.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,300m? :s
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, Square is worth 102 bill. Square didn’t even feel that 300 mill."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What does fuck around money mean
2021-03-21 21:18:19,wallstreetbets,"AMC why it's all good from friday's Quadruple witching hour.  

Why we should be happy with Friday's AMC closing at 13.93. Wasn't AMC stuck at the $8 level just 2 weeks prior? If you were to ask me during the first week of March would I be happy to see AMC reach 12 and beyond by quadruple witching March 19, I'd be ecstatic if $14 can be established as the new base.

Here's why this $14 is a new base. Biggest white elephant in the AMC room was when Wanda Group converted all the [B shares to A](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). With about [44 million A common shares](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-wanda-group-trimming-holdings-142528503.html) that you know Wanda is itching to cash out, Wanda Group was always a threat how they would be disposing of their shares. Well this Friday March 19, what many people did not notice was a flash block trade at 2 seconds after closing.

&#x200B;

[spot the elephant leaving the room?](https://preview.redd.it/qpq8gw220fo61.png?width=607&format=png&auto=webp&s=23166f1766cabe53fee69c8975190469cffa8e76)

That's 45 million shares at 13.93 totaling $630 million. Ladies and gentlemen, Wanda has left the building. So we should be thankful that Wanda did not recklessly dump their shares in the market. Instead they found a banker or bankers to take up the entire 45M share quota. I'm guessing it's Goldman Sachs and B. Riley Securities since those two were of critical help during their [cash crisis in Nov last year](https://www.spglobal.com/marketintelligence/en/news-insights/latest-news-headlines/amc-entertainment-to-issue-20-million-shares-of-common-stock-61282394).

This share deal doesn't happen instantly, but takes days or weeks to negotiate. It's an educated but realistic guess that Wanda has been wanting to sell it shares and would be happy at a $15 range. Just follow Silverlake who also immediately on January 27 converted their [$600 million](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000119312521022799/d30907dsc13da.htm) debt into common share at 13.51 and immediately sold into the market starting at what price? 13.55 - 14.5 range then all the way up to $24. Don't know how they sold 200k shares at $24 but that's what is filed.

So Wanda wanted to follow Silverlake's lead but were just too late when they filed the papers to [convert on Feb1](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/0001411579/000110465921012939/tm215134d1_8k.htm). Luckily they waited instead of just dumping, until AMC revived to above 10. By then they reached an agreement with bankers probably at $14. This is all guessing here and not established fact (except for that 45M block trade).

But if that's what happened, that's good for us because it means a big bank (Goldman? Riley?) is willing to take up a wholesale $630 million equity share position on AMC at 13.93 /share cost and will be retail selling these shares at 16 dollars and above? 18 dollars and above? 20 dollars and above? Once again based on Silverlake's move, they can see AMC going to 24 dollars.

If a deal was struck with Wanda at about $14, then it was imperative for them to make sure AMC stocks had to land at $14 dollars by end of Friday March 19. That's what we observed happening all day Friday trading.

If this is what happened, we should count ourselves fortunate because it's now a big banker who will be establishing $14 as the new base.

Go AMC, go Apes.

All this was NOT financial advice. Just thinking out loud what I think happened with AMC these past weeks."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao this aged well...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLY FUCK.  the amount of people with less than 100 karma telling everyone to buy is amazing.  Buying puts at open.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"how many billions are you imbeciles losing today ?

&#x200B;

i stopped counting

&#x200B;

have a banana , ape"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My major concern for AMC ... cases are rising in my city. Wife won't allow our Teens to go to movies. As fast as they open, they may have to close. Other concern, Weekly charts say all indices are in trouble, RSI divergence bearish. So, could be forced selling on the way even if we just go sideways."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,APES TOGETHER STRONG 💪🏽! Let’s be patient fellow Apes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No but they dumped billions in the market to hold it where they did, presumably took a hair cut of tens of millions whilst doing so (napkin maths) and have provided irrefutable proof of masses of illegal trades if the SEC ever wants to stop sitting on its hands (won't hold my breath). Last week I never expected us to finish above $13 on Friday (I said $12) - significantly more options ITM than I thought would happen, vast numbers of puts OTM. We good here as far as I'm concerned.

We're being manipulated to hell which means they're scared and there's a lot on the line because they're not even hiding it any more (with GME they're not scared enough so are still trying to pretend) - the bad news is *maybe* we don't have enough liquidity on our side to make them actually pay for it. I don't know if that's actually true and how long they can actually keep burning cash like this but if there's one risk it is that.

WSB shilled hard all weekend means things are probably pretty rosey, we'll see. HODL and whatnot."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes yes.  Now tell me.  What are the AMC executives actually doing to your stock?  Diluting?  Executive bonuses?  Lmao.  Ijs
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the work. Thumbs up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Uggg
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So AMC is dead or still having future? I’m am Ape I don’t understand.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm.. What about coming in large on the buy??  Who do you think will be happy as a lark to buy, say... 50-100K shares about 3 minutes from closing on a Friday??  Any Friday.  At say... $15-17 per share."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,We still won we got these buck buy high buy low it will all come back to us
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait I thought this past Friday was the Quad

Shit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just keep holding!!!  Buy more shares!!!  That’s the best thing we can do.  Millions of people buying shares and holding, along with some big players on our side such as Blackrock, Fidelity, and Vanguard, we’ll  bleed these corrupt hedge funds out very very soon!!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well Friday was strange, like a whale was selling at $14 and a wide range of folks were gobbling it up at that price. I estimate a volume through this of about 150k/min or about 45M shares changed hands. Wonder what was going on."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC CEO said like a week ago Wanda didn't sell.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is Wanda selling their shares considered a good thing?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A 45mm share MOC order would have moved the market.  That didn't.Most likely it was a combination of:

  
1) pre-arranged ""algo"" price, crossed at the end of the day.  i.e. if Fund 1 wants to buy vwap over the day and Fund 2 wants to sell vwap otd, then they both find a broker to intermediate and verify the vwap price, and the broker crosses on exchange at the end of day for cash settlement.

2) option settlement hedges accrued and settled b/w banks at the end of the day.  market makers are fully hedged by expiration for opex, and to the extent there are in the money options against which different banks hold opposing positions, they can settle the option and stock at the end of the day for what is essentially a net 0, netting transaction."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"for evidence of this block trade go to [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl\_07Cbt0o&t=41s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl_07Cbt0o&t=41s)

Galactic Finance.  This young blond kid is the only one that catches this. So kudo's to him.

He only pinpoints the transaction and doesn't speculate as to who or what it's all about.

My post is pure speculating as to who or what that transaction is about. But I provide links throughout the post with SEC filings and some news articles to support my thesis."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have used your 12 usd to buy one of those cheap finance for dummies course
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most youtubers commenting on GME and AMC overlook this big block trade on Friday.  You even see the big volume stick on their tech charts but don't even talk about it. The only guy that caught it and spent a good amount of time is Galactic Finance see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl\_07Cbt0o&t=491s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl_07Cbt0o&t=491s)

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,most of the ops here are idiots  or crooks
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus christ. I read OPs entire post and want to believe. I WANT CONFIRMATION!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't think so.  Closing orders must be executed before the close.  Can't trade after the close.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, I was looking for a big swing in price, but didn't seem 45mil worth."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You did well if you bought puts.

Edit: I love the downvotes. Seriously though, he would have made coin buying puts at open."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell your wife's boyfriend to tell her to stop being silly.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah this Management sorta reminds me of Bluestar from the movie Wall Street.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Info""

The dude totally made everything up.

Do what you want to of course, but I wouldn't exactly use this guy's ""info"" to make any decisions."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than losing puts on gme with your HF buddies 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,are we watching the same interview on CNBC?  I think he said Wanda sold most of their shares. However he was vague as to sold out of B shares?  or out of all shares?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That Wanda converted B shares to A shares on Feb 1 was a dark cloud hanging over AMC because you know  they want to cash out like Silverlake did. The short hedgies are happy playing stock poker when one of the players is itching to cash out and looking to dump all his cards/shares on the table for the shark hedgies to devour. But instead of dumping his cards he all of a sudden (Friday mar19) he switches players and in comes a Goldman as the new player holding all those cards the short hedgies thought they were going to devour. The poker table and game has changed. Now you got someone with staying power. So in short, it was BAD that wanda wanted to sell, but turned out GOOD because they handed over their shares to a more stable player instead."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I can buy your argument if its something like 1 million shares. But 45 Million? You should have enough experience to tell you that's not vwap swapping nor options settlement.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Wanda indeed did dump their entire 45M shares on Friday March 19, they will have to file a form 4 with the SEC within 2 business days of the transaction. So we'll have to wait likely till this wednesday for any confirmation."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. Wanda has much more restrictions. They have to file a form 4.  HF's have way less restrictions and reporting requirements.  Shorts have even less restrictions, that's why there is more talk about the need to increase more disclosures from the shorts."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotta love this place. You write a whole short story on a print and don’t know how the market works. Every single day at 16:00:02 these prints go up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most followers of AMC have overlooked this. It's even quite funny on youtube you see them discussing the charts this past weekend and you see this massive volume stick going so high it nearly sticks into the green trading candle and it's just being ignored. Truly like a white elephant in the room nobody is talking about. 

I have to give credit to this young kid on his Galactic Finance. He's the only one that pinpointed this.  see [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl\_07Cbt0o&t=41s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iTl_07Cbt0o&t=41s)"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"After almost one year house arrest, people now value the cinema experience totally different than before. THIS is what has changed and THIS is invaluable."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A little late, but the key to identifying good DD vs bad DD is whether is reproducible. If the DD has sources backing up every assertion made and so you could come to the same conclusions that the author did? That's DD. If there are leaps of logic or speculation (or in this case, as the OP even admitted in the post, literally just wild guesses) then that's a non-starter. You can't reproduce the conclusions of DD if it's based off of guesses and assumptions (unless you have the same biases I suppose, in which case ur fuked).

Also look for actual numbers. If there are no numbers in it and it's all abstract, non-specific reasoning: then it's *probably* not going to be too reproducible since it's so imprecise.

But basically yeah, most subs with DD are fine as long as you make sure it isn't total bullshit or unsupported conspiracy theories and that it's reproducible."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON! Screw WSB's negative nancies and HF shills. AMC will moon. Hell I bet GME will moon and then we'll have these same retards jump onto our rocket ship to double dip. All I know is I buy and hodl every paycheck :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not if you bought 2 weeks ago, you would have lost all that money buying put options."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I already got out and shorted it. This isn't gamestop where the CEO is actually being competent and working for it's new shareholders. 

It just got sucked up in the GME wave and the CEO is trying to suck everything he can out of the wave"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's the opposite of what you say.  Adam Aron said something like Wanda Group has sold all but about 10% voting or 5% shares left. Something like that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shill

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to just take your post down at this point, and admit you're wrong. I've downloaded this video and will reupload in case you're a shill. https://youtu.be/VdkCzj-2DMg?t=433

At this time stamp, 7:13, CEO Adam Aron says that Wanda has only sold 2 million shares in the past 2 years. So, they sold less than 5% of their position at around 44-45 million shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I can tell you apes is that I'm more than ready to start battling for parking, overpaying for popcorn and soda (and juju fruits, can't forget those) and seeing blockbuster films on the big screen. I'm ready. Simple as that. Fuck the balance sheet and the analysis. Fuck it.  Jeez...  Now pass the jujus."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuckin lol I’ve been on wsb since 2018
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally diluting the stock and paying himself a bonus.  Ok bot.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I listened to your video. Adam Aron says after saying Wanda never sold any shares in the past 2 years. BUT NOW has converted B to A and has about 44 million shares or down to 5% of the company.

plus this was March 5th. So we know that as of March 5th Wanda has 44 million shares.  All these facts are consistent with my hypothesis that fridays block trade could have been them."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your charts make a valid point. And concerns of where this huge increase in issued shares come from. It seems a lot of the increase is due to debt conversion. But if you keep using those metrics to bind AMC down, while the market may choose otherwise and bust them out of the $15 range, who's to judge what AMC is worth? In the end it's people's judgement what AMC is worth of which a lot depends on big fishes like Wanda, SilverLake, Mudrick, Goldman, B. Riley, BlackRock.  What we'd really like is to get some insights what these parties think AMC is worth. Mudrick has stopped selling their debt converted to common shares, so they seem to be holding out for a higher price now."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Care to enlighten us in the dark apes?  But before you do, you already accuse us of ""lack of understanding.....is disturbing"" when you hardly know us."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I've heard of market cap.  We can discuss market cap in another post. This post is just pinpointing a very interesting trade block that occurred on March 19 Friday 2 seconds after close and what of it's significance."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are different factors which determine the price, whereas in a market place, the most dominant factor is still the momentarily supply and demand. I can't wait to see the huge numbers of shorts start to give up and cover how the demands would look like and how the price would go up with such a huge masses swear to hold it to the moon..... Avalanche."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No... some was debt conversion. Others were due to an inability to raise debt. Their bonds were rated as selective default. This means no one will buy your bonds so dilution is the only option. Owning half of something is better than owning all of a bankrupt something.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I shouldn’t have to explain further, u/Preachy, u/Verb0182, and u/thesmiter1 already did a great job pointing out the flaws in your assumptions about share price.

When more shares are added to the public pool, the existing shares are worth *less* then they were originally. Look up market cap. Try to form a couple of wrinkles before posting stuff like this that misleads the dumber ones in here."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mentioned share price. You can't compare share price in one period to another without also considering market cap and shares in circulation/dilution of shares. Jackass.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Demand isn't yet at pre Covid levels. But the share price is far higher, especially considering dilution. See a problem here?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All publicly listed companies have a continuous stream of shares added to the public pool.  This is from employee shares, executive compensation, pipes, convertible debts, payment in kind."

I was banned for drawing on myself, but now I can't get the pen ink off. Hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Must have paid a fellow retard in GME to tattoo this with his diamond hands. Only explanation for this quality of work.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If it hit 1000 this year I will get one
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He got it on the cheap. He spent all the trendiest on GME. He friend who just got out did it for him.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what one of those $20 Tuesdays look like at a tattoo shop
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,God damn I love this sub.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought it was an ass shot at first. So much $CUM wasted when I don't even have a foot fetish 😭
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Pffft. That shits gonna scab off.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you ask for it to be as shitty as possible?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My life is so fucked up now because of losing people during the pandemic, you apes are all that I have. Y'all made me feel emotions again after feeling so numb.

This legit cracked me up, also, more power to you, show that shit off, love it 🦍👐💎"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets," Idk.. maaaaaybe video your tattoo artist doing the tattoo to clear cut prove it? Instead of just taking the aftermath and let everyone doubt you, this is just as sus as you could be"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The picture is designed by another GameStop share holder. I believe
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Foot ready to take off.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s pretty cute. I sort of want one.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don't seem proud at all, having to hide the tattoo in your shoe. You're not a true retard."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you do this yourself? 

Lmao watched the video after I said this. You don’t sound too happy man 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice turtle. Well, a retarded one."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It actually looks kinda cute.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good things its small and with the tendies u will make off GME u can get a real tattoo artist to cover it up with an improved version
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine ruining your body for an internet message board? Yikes....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which prison did you get this done at?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What is the point of this?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This shits drawn with pen lmao
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol respect dude, and unlike most people here, I think the shitiness is what makes it legit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you do it yourself?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of us. Even with the tag on him. 

Should have put a number on it. Ape #420453"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I think y’all need to cut some slack. It is conceivable the artist is amazing but the sketch they were given was done by a retarded ape.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That guy that started that post must feel really stupid now if he still alive. What a fucking idiot 😂😂😂😂😂😂😂😂🤣😂🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Painful in that spot?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice Tat! 🚀
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"He keep his word, sacked up and honoured the bet.  For that he gets a solid 10. For artistry not so much."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda really gotten a dope gme rocket tattoo tbh. I might do it just because I’m already tatted and like the stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad bets smh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That is awesome. Such a cool tattoo. One helluva story for the grandkids!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This smooth brained mfer really knows how to shower.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's not even a GameStop tattoo, it's a rocket."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a sissy tat hidden on your foot.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay your moms boyfriend for the tat?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems legit. Llllleeeetttssss GGGOOOOI
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets, Not sure that rocket is moonbound
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is just what fresh tattoos look like - know from experience, black work starts off very shiny."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have one of these on my hand, actually. We call it my “prison tat” and it’s a constant reminder of how you always get exactly what you pay for."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking DEAD
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did that ape have to shave his ducking heel before getting a tattoo? It looks like there’s a shave line
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,he definitely used inkbox
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol JFC
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fur reels
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He got cheap ink so he could buy more gme
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I consider it a micro aggression that the rocket isn’t pointing up.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"When your balls deep in GME at 430,  its all you can afford"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Tattoos on the foot don't last very long.  You shed so much skin from your feet they usually last less than a couple years before they're not even visible.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,""" This is going to be fun to explain to your wifes boyfriends kids"" - There, fixed it for you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well... yeah.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only actual explanation. That or these people are actually so retarded they don't know how easy it is to make a new account
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Are any of them still around ? Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apply soap, rinse off and then scrub randomly. Isn't that the right way?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like a good T-Shirt idea.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude what? Gel pen ink will wipe up faster than ball point ink. Shit you wouldn't even need soap and water for that. Did you learn nothing in high school from the kids writing their homework assignments on their hands only for it to be worn off by 3rd period?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,More impressive if he convinced someone else to get a shitty tattoo for a bet he lost
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Scruffy owns 90% of the company
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, the line work is garbage, this isn’t about them being thick"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is.  As a teacher I had a young teenager show up in class one day.  He said, “check out my tattoo teach” and rolled up his sleeve to show his tattoo on his shoulder. It was a happy face that looked so jagged that it looked like it was drawn by an ape with Parkinson’s on speed. I asked him where he got it and he said that his buddy had just ordered it in the internet and wanted to see how it worked.  Decision making wasn’t his strong suit."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your response was legendary enough that the mods used it to flair him - you should be proud. jesus that's one shitty tattoo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"One dude decided to hit his with a fucking wire brush to prove it was real.

Smoothbrain is real."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,He definitely delivered a shitty drawing of a rocket with GME on it ...as requested.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Did he do the approval drawing with the crayon you were snacking on?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I've had gel pen ink on my hands for days at a time
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it doesn't look like the leg is attached to anything.  It's probably from a cadaver."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Futurama is best
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Mmmhmmm
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if you use reflectors on one candle.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Wha?!?!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, feels good to be useful for something."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a new tattoo, he’d fuck it up if he scrubbed too hard"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tasty, delicious prison trash."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Stupid fuck
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Shower more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate the tattoo!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My tattoo didn’t get inflamed at all really. Think it just depends
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I tried washing it with dish soap and everything and it didn't come off.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,100%... spend more than $25 next time!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you want a penis on your bicep at the time?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’re that confident then bet on it. Get a shitty tattoo if he is proven right in a few months
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next time try Gojo, it's got pumice in it.  should do wonders."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck if I know.  I was drinking a lot of Siberian Ice vodka and snorting a lot of crank in those days, so most of the decisions I made were a mystery to me, even at the time."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yes but tax free profits
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you being serious? You can go online and view real data that states short interest on a given stock. I’m not even being a conspiracy theorist. I’m being very conservative in what I say. 

The short interest was past 100% after March, thus most of the positions were not closed out. Thats just facts. Thats not a conspiracy theory. 

Did you not read the part where I said I’m against all the theories? IM ONLY STATING THE COLD HARD FACTS PROVIDED BY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

Please go back and read what I said because I think there is something wrong with you.

Btw, they swore they closed their positions in January 2021 after the squeeze, yet you’re calling me a lunatic for saying they didn’t close in MARCH 2020. Theres either something wrong with you, or your just messing with me.

Lastly, to reiterate, I don’t think you realize that you and I are on the same side. We both dislike the conspiracy theories. I think you didn’t even read what I had to say otherwise you’d realize how absolutely deranged you sound. I ONLY STATED FACTS."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that but I'll never understand the level of conviction they had when their downside was infinite. Should have been a red flag when someone like Burry takes a long position. Dude is so smart and stubborn they made a movie about him, and he has a nose for sniffing out systemic risk to take advantage of.

There were just so many things pointing to that short position unraveling in the worst way possible, the fact they stuck with it and continued opening new shorts in the single digits is astonishing. They need to make a movie/documentary about this and they need to include the details that led up to the shitshow. It's probably one of the dumbest positions that has ever been built in market history."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I ONLY STATED FACTS.

And the conclusions you draw from those FACTS are retarded."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude are you actually on drugs? I didn’t draw any outlandish conclusions. I don’t really feel the need to prove myself to a loser like you, but did you actually READ anything I wrote?

This is the strangest conversation I’ve ever had on Reddit. You’re either mentally unstable or on drugs.

I think you need to calm down, read what I said, and then realize that I’m actually on your “side”.  (Not that I feel the need to prove myself to you)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't the first time I've seen that fact. http://www.counterfeitingstock.com/CounterfeitingStock.html also says it. I can't find a real citation though.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I am pretty stoned, but that has nothing to do with my position here.

The fact that short interest exists on GME is not some kind of indication that hedge funds are holding out for some kind of imminent bankruptcy.  There are all kinds of reasons to hedge with short bets on a struggling business that don't involve hoping that business dies entirely.  

Whether you understand it or not, you're playing into this imaginary melodrama that leads to all this ""battle"" rhetoric about ""fighting"" hedge funds...by continuing to buy and hold a joke stock.  It's all absurd."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow...that is an insane screed.

Where do you retards even find stuff like that?  Do you use Bing?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now I know you don’t know what you’re talking about. 

The hedge funds were actually holding out their short positions until bankruptcy. This is very well known as the thesis was laid out. This is not a conspiracy theory, they very much laid out their own thesis that they thought GameStop was going to $0. To clarify, the hedge funds thought GameStop was going to $0, I did not invent that idea. THEY SAID IT THEMSELVES.

I’m sorry that this became such a long and unproductive conversation. But you are wrong. This is not my opinion, this is fact.

The hedge funds did believe GameStop was going to $0, and so they didn’t close their positions because there are certain tax implications, among other benefits when a shorted company goes to $0.

I must respectfully tell you that you are wrong and are definitely speaking without doing any research.

I’m not blowing smoke and making things up. You can go and see for yourself. They admitted to being short on GameStop because of their very own bankruptcy thesis.

I’m only reiterating so you don’t find a reason to call me a lunatic. You are wrong because you claim that the bankruptcy thesis was a conspiracy theory, when in truth- the hedge funds laid out that thesis themselves.

Have a good night and don’t bother responding unless its to admit that you’ve been wrong.

Furthermore, I already told you I sold GameStop a long time ago and never looked back. Im not trying to fight hedgefunds and Im not an “ape”. I dont even like the stock. So stop roping me into that trope 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's been linked here before, as has https://wherearetheshares.com/"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shorting in 2020 when the stock was stuck trading at ~$4/share for most of the year was certainly waiting for the business to fail, but that's obviously not what's going on now, after all the bullshit in January.  You're conflating two entirely different situations to make your bizarre claim...you seriously don't think you're a conspiracy theory retard?  I'm sorry to break it to you, but you're wrong.

>there are certain tax implications

Explain those tax implications to me, Mr. Expert.  What's their basis on a bankruptcy?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m NOT TALKING ABOUT WHATS GOING ON NOW! I don’t care about whats going on now. Why can’t you get that through your head 😂

I’m done speaking with you because you’re not even listening to what Im saying. I’m literally talking about what happened in March 2020 and you’re telling me Im not.

I’m telling you I dont care about GameStop and you’re calling me a lunatic.

I hope you sober up tomorrow and revisit this conversation to see how you’ve been ignoring everything I’ve said and instead making things up 😂

Biggest waste of time I’ve ever had on this app. I’ve been speaking to a brick wall.  

PLEASE do not respond to me! 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you're calling March 2020 ""the crash""...I get it now, but that's still retarded, because it didn't ""crash"" last year, it slowly reached it's lowest point after steadily falling for almost 5 straight years.  That's not a ""crash,"" that's just how businesses die.

I guess I should have noticed your $3 reference with respect to March, but calling *that* a crash, instead of the real crash, from January to March of *this* year is just dumb.

In any event, they did presumably all close out their positions from last year, so you still have no point.  Did they do it at the perfect time?  Of course not, but they did do it when it became obvious that, regardless of what happened to Gamestop the company, GME the stock was going to be crazy for a while."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I think you and I are basically on the same page. Its obviously difficult to get a point across over a text post. I don’t follow GameStop and I despise the conspiracy theorists. 😂

Take care bro"
2021-03-21 20:08:41,wallstreetbets,"On a scale of 1-10, how fucked am I ? "
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re all right. Hold tight the cavalry is on the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would sell some of your calls on your way back up at a loss of close to 50 percent then some at 25 percent loss. If you believe in the trade, I would hold around 3 into month of expiration. Theta really isn't killing your options yet, it's the delta movement. Theta ramps up extremely close to expiration (1 month to expiration). Being a few months out, you aren't losing much to theta yet, but I'd sell some of your calls to reduce risk, having 10 calls on something is extremely stressful (I've been there) and it is no fun."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it as a % you lost with leaps and mid-expiry; not the cash.

You’re down 77% on something with five months. 

Little reason to sell, and the sentiment “no way to $90...” well, predicting the future is tough.

But the value of that call will spike like crazy in steep run-ups.

And dafuq would you wanna sell a call that trades with tech/tech valuations when we haven’t yet figured out how we’re dealing with inflation/how bad that is?

I’d wait till the fed pegs rates at 2%. Might give tech/the Qs a little bump when bond yields can’t entice buyers—and might take NIO and “tech-y” stocks that follow megacap with it.

Idk man. Sucks, but I trade leaps heavily. I get out at a 50% loss—as entry is everything.

Yours is too late—you’ve lost 77.5%. Sit on that bullshit and see what happens. Theta isn’t too damning until 60DTE and under.

And what would you sell it for to invest in now? If more tech... meh. Industrials/commodities sure... but no one trades those.

You already lost... and possibly aren’t as bad-off as you think.

I’d look back on it in several weeks and reevaluate.

And I’m sure many will disagree"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucked?? It's just dollars ape... It's a learning experience
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,With that much money you arent fucking at all
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think you are fucked at all. You have plenty of time and as long as the yields stabilize you'll be fine
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, its not until August.  Look at where GME/AMC was after months ago.  I have done my dd on this stonk,  ut who knows.  Least its not an 800c GME"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just delete the app and download a new one. Problem solved.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You bought the ticket and are taking the ride.  Kurt would be proud.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"...You spent ~$242.00(2.42 • 100), to get something that'll cost you ~$8000 (80 • 100) each option you exercize....

Aaaand you brought 10 of those. So, actually:

1) $2420.00 (2.42 • 100 • 10) (basically a donation)

2) $80,000.00 (80 • 100 • 10)

3) $82,420.00 (total) (that'll likely never be fully realized, or made up for if you tried to get it)

And the price of each share is $43.06.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Getting tired of all this gain porn smh
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean if he has shares he could also sell calls against that right try to recoup even more money right?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but you get the discounted price. He is likely to just break even if things trend that way. You'd be making real tendies. Although if everyone in the comments does buy some price goes up a lil, small victory for him."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes thats why i dont plan on getting rid of it as i have more upside than downsides. its normal for meme stocks like this to move 5-6 percent a day, 3/4 days back to back. and a move like that will ofc send its value through the roof. i am autistic but not autistic enough to try and salvage 2k and miss out on the potential these contracts have."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes exactly. I got 4.5 months and theres a ton of catalysts coming out between now and then. also i subscribe to that whole 'hope and pray' trading strategy where i buy shit contracts without any DD and start hoping and praying that things work out.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where do you think you are?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't either, but if I'm bullish enough to buy calls I generally have shares as well. Not always sometimes I buy LEAPS to get a better price on shares in the future but that's rare."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Put on your raincoat because I'm looking at how much steel is being traded at and it's about to get real fun.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"yup. made that mistake when first starting to trade as well. It's common to trade them as it's simple and total risk is very clear (what you paid), but after a couple times losing on them it's just silly not to spend some time looking into how more protected positions are done and how to do them safely (IE not doing high-risk spreads or selling options without knowing how to deal with assignment).   


Hell, 9/10 times you can make way more off of vertical spreads than you ever could buying calls - purely because you can buy 10x more of them for the same $$."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"well, not quite 100k, but turning 3k of GME OTM calls the first run up into 40k was not bad. Have had gains and losses on them.

The proof of this is that when you look at the shelves, the best selling products are in stock but the beverages that don't sell as well just weren't available. They focused their canning lines to produce their best sellers to maximize profits during the shortage."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not entirely true. It is and was a part of the shortage but a bigger problem was the manpower needed to run the lines and distribution. When you have a large portion of these bottling operations in rural areas where the media wage is less than the increased unemployment benefit, it is simple math for the workers to simply NOT go to work and get a raise instead. This was and now remains a much bigger problem to getting the oddball SKU's back in stock more so than an aluminum shortage."

everyone is thinking too big to quick! its not TSLA that party is over for a long time. 

you can't just fucking throw a shit ton of cars in the economy and expect the revenue an profits to skyrocket make gajillons. Fuck no. Our infrastructure isn't able to support even a 25% increase in EV (swapped for fossil fueled) 25% in 25% out ....etc.

SMALLER..

its already blown up pretty fast...scooters were the test model...

it created jobs and moved people for cheap. fast. and there were plenty of them around in the start.

the only issue with that--scooters were just amock with no real ""parking spot', theft, vandalism etc...why ? because there was zero accountability and kids didn't respect them and just trashed he whole project. people were getting hurt because of the small wheels  and large cracks. so people played blame and filed lawsuits.

ok well... hmm solution.

how do we introduce EV and rid of these problems? 

how about motorcycle sized EV..

not seeing those on the street yet...but will soon.. why? powerbanks are small enough that they can be charged at a residence with no installed equipment needed. Perfect...now we can slowly introduce these on the electrical grid watch the electrical load >slowly change some infrastructure to support  this heavier load..  now it becomes balanced. solar panel power stations will be introduced or maybe even a universal battery swap station/exchange

 These bikes owned by individuals so insurance will be required and when people actually own something--they are more likely to respect the item and take care of it..

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am bullish TSLA specifically because of their competition.

A year or two ago there might have been some fear that GM, VW, Ford, and such might be clapping Tesla's cheeks when we finally got the real car companies making EVs! Woo!

And what did we get? Porsche produced a completely uninpressive EV that costs twice the Model S with just a bit over half the range. Nice.

VW other offerings are lackluster. The eTron by Audi is sad, but the ID.4 is a total joke at the price range they are selling.

GM's Bolt just does not cut it outside of being an inner city runabout. It needs 100mi more range before I would consider it over a Model3. But at least they put the right price on it unlike Vollswagen.

Furthermore, Tesla makes their own motors and batteries. None of the traditional OEMs do. So they are going to have to fight over the limited supply of both by the T1 suppliers. If anything, if you are pro EV, those would be the companies to invest in, and not their consumers, the automotive OEMs."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any self-driving car that uses lidar is years behind Tesla. They could have their system down 1000x better than Tesla and it wouldn't matter because they have to wait for the price to come down before they can sell a production car with lidar that anybody can afford. By focusing all their energy on not using lidar Tesla has a huge advantage. First of all, they can always implement lidar when the price start to come down, it will be an asymmetrical challenge for their algorithm to add lidar if necessary (but their competitors will be SOL if lidar doesn't become more feasible). And Tesla can always sell beta projects that aren't fully automated, while their top competitors can't put anything on the market until lidar is cheaper. And considering that most people don't care that much about self driving yet, that reduces Teslas competition to existing car companies- which it's done well against so far.

Having vertically integrated battery production is a massive advantage over all the other players. Panasonic and Samsung have to mark up their batteries to make a profit- Tesla has an instant savings right there. Then consider that Tesla's battery development is directly focused on Tesla's needs- large batteries for industry, homes and cars, not 100x other battery technologies and markets. There are many small advantages to that.

I haven't priced their retrofit solar, so I'll take your word for that. However the solar roof is the biggest product that people underestimate. Yes, the solar cells are only warranted for 25 years, but that really doesn't matter. Tesla's solar roof is by far the cheapest roof that has ever been made. I can't remember the exact numbers of the top of my head (unfortunately Tesla does not install where I live and I'm crossing my fingers that my roof will last until they do), but Tesla's solar roof estimate was almost exactly the same price as slate for my roof.

I know that doesn't sound as exciting as it is, slate and Terra cotta roofs are quite common. The significance is that Tesla's roof is greatly superior to both and that over a 30 year time span it would not only be a free roof, but it should have generated several years of electricity more than it cost to install. 

So the question then is, ""yeah, but wouldn't it be even cheaper to do a normal roof or slate and better, cheaper, uglier solar panels that can be easily replaced?"".  And the answer is, no, that would be more expensive and uglier. The reason is this: a tempered glass roof would almost never need to be replaced. An asphalt roof under solar panels, depending on roof pitch and climate, may not even last as long as your solar panels. Regardless, it'll probably be cheapest to upgrade both at the same time, which means you can be guaranteed that either your roof or panels will be removed from service +/- 5 years prematurely. 

Essentially the problem is that Americans in particular already waste a ton of money on asphalt shingle roofs. Asphalt is cheaper upfront, but much more expensive than slate in the long run (a modern slate roof installed with copper nails can easily last 200 years). The game changer of Tesla's tiles is that they provide a means of financing the cheaper, better, more attractive choice. 

Yes, you could replace the PV cells in the southern facing Tesla roof tiles after 30 years if you wanted to, but the important distinction is that you don't have to. Unlike an asphalt roof that has to be replaced every 25 years, Tesla tiles can be replaced whenever it is cheaper to (and Tesla can subsidize this by selling the old PV tiles to be reused as non-PV tiles that go in sections of roof that don't get sun.)

Teslas roof tiles will flip the finance of roofs on its head. Every high end house will have them, and eventually every house that gets sun will be able to afford them. I don't know what Toyota's longterm plan is, but at the end of the day I predict a decline in individual car ownership, an increase in autonomous ride sharing, and roofs could be more valuable than anything Tesla will do with cars. Having said that, I own zero interest in Tesla right now, simply because I have other investments, Tesla is still a long way from accomplishing this, and also probably because I'm dropping the ball lol."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't see anyone talking about TM.  I honestly think they are the one for TSLA to worry about.  They said they will have a working solid state battery demo car by years end.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be careful with the range talk. Porsche generously reduced their marketed range, while Tesla has had multiple independent tests that shows the range is ""fraudulent"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"All those are relatively small dollar forays into EVs. We are just starting to see the bigger investment models come out. As they ramp up investment they'll start to reach parity. I think what kills Tesla (if they die) will be ownership experience/warranty/repairs. People don't want to be paying absurd repair costs and have a small list of certified repair shops with insane wait times for a lot of things.

I could be wrong. But it's their weak point right now. That and no instrument cluster. Such an idiotic thing to cost save on... Oversimplification to the point of worse user experience is a thing."

If you switched to a large scale investment in lower maintenance/cost electric vehicles and completely removed the need to pay a human driver, anything under $5/ride is gonna be cheaper than owning a car, so add mass adoption and you have lower idle times... In ten years I bet you see a 25+% decline in automobile ownership. Autonomous cars don't have traffic jams. Traffic jams are 99% caused by humans."

> it wouldn't matter because they have to wait for the price to come down before they can sell a production car with lidar that anybody can afford.

There is lidar sensors down to $500. Also Google does a ton of computational vision as well and so do many competitors.

> Having vertically integrated battery production is a massive advantage over all the other players. Panasonic and Samsung have to mark up their batteries to make a profit

Tesla has to mark up their batteries to make profit as well. They have an advantage being vertically integrated but Panasonic and Samsung have an advantage of economies of scale especially when purchasing raw materials.

> Tesla's solar roof is by far the cheapest roof that has ever been made

Uh no, it's not. 

> The significance is that Tesla's roof is greatly superior to both and that over a 30 year time span it would not only be a free roof, but it should have generated several years of electricity more than it cost to install. 

This is assuming most customers are willing to pay triple the price to recoup their investment in 30 years. I don't think most customers shop this way. Personally I would pay 40% of the cost now because I don't know if I'd be living in the same spot in 30 years and also considering technology could drastically improve over those 30 years. 

You are talking about the longevity benefits but completely ignoring its way cheaper to just get normal panels and an asphalt roof. My normal panels were 20k and my roof was 10k, it will last 25 to 35 years. Teslas roof was 56k quoted. The solar will degrade the same as my panels after 25 years, the roof may last longer but I'm not paying an extra 20k because of that wien I might not even be in the house at that point."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a good chance that full autonomy cannot be accomplished without lidar. Hell there's a chance we can't do it even WITH lidar. That's the real issue. Also if the cost save is as insane as you all keep claiming then getting a lidar robotaxi working now should be gold even if the company tacks on $20k onto the price of the vehicle.

Lastly everyone does computer vision. Lidar is a supplemental input you can use to... You know.... Not run into firetrucks..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they figure it out first, sure, the thing is - and I work in machine learning - what makes you think Tesla is going to solve some of the hardest AI problems out there before companies like Google and Apple?  These companies not only have larger teams working on autonomy, they also have more top talent in ML/AI.  There are also several companies like Cruise, Waymo, AutoX, Yandex, Baidu, etc. that have demonstrated more progress than Tesla in autonomy.  Multiple of these companies have been driving completely empty cars around on public roads already.  Tesla's clearly a long way from doing so based on recent videos."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you! I’ve been driving a fully electric VW Golf for 2 years. Europe is far ahead of the US when it comes to EV.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think this is true at all. At the beginning, they mostly produced electric cars which were just their normal cars with an electric motor and some batteries glued to it. To some extent they still are (see the BMW ix3 and the Merc EQA). These cars are bound to have compromises, most often in their range.

If you look to Norway, where there is sold more new EVs than ICE cars, this was the top 6 registered EV cars in 2020:

- Audi E-tron: 9227
- Tesla Model 3: 7770
- VW ID.3: 7754
- Nissan Leaf: 5221
- Hyundai Kona: 5029
- Benz EQC: 3614

And you're telling me there is no competition? Established manufacturers will start taking this seriously when it is time to do so, and I think that time is about now."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The Tesla roof is the cheapest roof that has ever been made. It's free and it will outlast any other roof in history. The question is would you pay $20k more for a house that has a much better looking roof that would never need replaced? Many people would, and the loan is transferable, so you can bet your house is worth more with a Tesla roof. And you're ignoring the most important part. Tesla can finance these at an extremely low risk. 

I haven't crunched the numbers on Tesla or Toyota, but there's no way I'd say that they couldn't be worth 4x as much as Toyota. That's not how stocks work. For all I know Toyota is way undervalued in the long run. I have no idea what Toyota has up their sleeve, and the question I'd ask there is what will they be worth in ten years? Cause a lot is going to change in the next ten years."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah, but that's where Tesla already has them in check. You could solve it 100% tomorrow using lidar and it wouldn't matter. Until lidar can be implemented at a competitive price point Tesla can sell minor beta improvements and they'll have a product while everyone else has a prototype. Focusing on the problem without lidar was a great strategic move, because lidar really isn't an option right now. Worst case scenario they have to add lidar when it starts getting cheap enough to worry about. Best case scenario, they solve it without lidar and their competition has to do the same or they can't compete on price."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has alot more data for the machine learning/ai gathered from the fleets of Tesla  cars that have already been on the roads for years, driving in a wide variety of conditions and environments. Googles Waymo ML/AI is built on mostly simulated road miles, and actual road mile data has been limited to specific regions.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a 0% chance that most industrialized countries ban internal combustion vehicles by 2030.  If there was an option for less than 0% I'd vote for that.  The average vehicle using existing tech is in development for YEARS before the prototype stage.  It takes another 2-4 years to hit production stage from there.  No way EV is even close to 50% of the market by 2030. All of that is just on the manufacturer side without taking into consideration the deep pockets and influence of the oil industry.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dealership model works fine lol. Try repairing a Tesla that's been in an accident without Lord Elon's permission.

Every company has its problems. Tesla is far from perfect. They do for now however hold the cost leadership position and I suspect they will continue to for at least the next 5 years. Tesla is big but it's a tiny fry compared to the rest of the industry which has very much started spending huge money on EVs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Volkswagon is the real bet on EV.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real problem though is getting enough computational power into a vehicle without using a lot of power. The problem is the last few % of autonomous driving functionality may require 100 billion times the processing power. No one really knows. Neural nets are basically impossible to debug backwards to understand what is causing things to go wrong. Even if you could you may just find the neural net is orders of magnitude too simple. 

MAYBE quantum computing can bridge the divide. But no guarantees there either."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"FSD data collection through beta is extremely underestimated by aNaLysts. I don’t think Tesla is gambling on FSD as a mass consumer success, rather a bridge to robotaxis. If you think about it it’s the only practical path given what they have at their disposal."

Edit: Its also not necessarily true. I know engineers in big auto companies have been pushing for EVs for longer than the companies have been really throwing any weight behind them.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol dimwit,
Tesla roof is not free, it was quoted at 56k for my house vs 30k for normal solar and a roof. You are trying to sell some bullshit that it's free because you recoup the cost in solar, but guess what I recoup that 30k in solar as well, and I recoup it faster because I have less to recoup.

And what does financing matter you can finance traditional solar from tons of companies as well. You only argument is that it is supoosably lasts longer(which hasnt been proven because they are a newer product and hasn't been around as long, there could be flaws which make it fail early) and it looks better. I think many homeowners will opt for the cheaper option and recoup their investment faster. Especially as traditional panels get cheaper."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"> nasa did the reusable rocket thing back in the 80s and with the space shuttle. 

They did a test program not an actual running program that launched anything, and to anyone with a clue the space shuttle was only barely recoverable given the amount of refurbishment work that had to go into it after each flight, and even then it threw away everything except the shuttle itself at huge expense. At $1b per launch on average it wasn't exactly cost effective, nor particularly safe.

Compare that to 2 x falcon 9 to get the same payload to low earth orbit at approximately $62 million each and you can reuse both the first stage and fairings for extra savings. That's a real reusable system that's actually launching payloads, and starship will only get better."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. It seemed like nasa was on record saying that the soviets full flow engines were a hoax, because America didn’t have access to the quality of titanium required to make it possible. And that wasn’t even reuse designed!

It’s about the cost of the car and how you can monetize it. 
Robotaxis will make money because the vast majority will be a subscription based model. 

I live in NYC. I pay 500 a month just to park my car. Add the cost of the car, insurance, maintenance, and I’d be getting a steal paying even 750 a month. No longer have to go to the lot, wait 30 minutes for my car, drive it myself, find parking at work. I’ll click a button on my phone and my car will be there. Honestly I’d pay more than my costs just for that. 
Even if you’re not in a city, the idea of not having to sink a bunch of money into a car that depreciates in value and not having to actually drive yourself is a huge selling point. How often are you actually usuing your car? It’s sitting there parked 95% of the time. Subscription model bring in a ton of money and allows for tons of people to basically share cars.

Cleaners also don't need a commercial driver's license like many jurisdictions require for taxis so they're going to be cheaper.

The guys checking cameras don't need to be watching 24/7, they can look at them when there's an issue reported so that's still extensive savings in that.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so napkin math here: let’s assume 1/3 of my miles driven earn money. At a conservative $8 to fill up for 80 useful miles, we’re at 10¢ per mile in energy. I paid $50k for the car, and let’s depreciate it over 250k miles. That’s 20¢ per mile in depreciation. I will assume there will be an additional 10¢ per mile in misc expenses and we’re at 40¢ per mile in out of pocket expenses for me. I expect each Of these numbers to be pretty conservative. Maybe tesla takes 10¢ per mile and I would accept a minimum of 20¢ per mile over that so we’re at 70¢ per mile for the end user. That puts us at about half the cost of Uber/Lyft. 

Of course there are variables:
 If tesla charges too much for insurance/takes too big of a cut, that would make me less likely to use it. 
If there is inadequate resources to compensate me when someone trashes my car, that’s an absolute non-starter. 
Lastly, it has to work in a way that doesn’t heinously inconvenience me. I need to to be ready for me with a battery level and time that I specify, because it has to still be my car."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Norway has not been drinking oil since the 60s. Norway, at least in the last decade or so, has had incredibly expensive gas prices. Even when the oil price crashed, gas kept its price. A gallon costs about 8 dollars at the moment.

Norway also has insane benefits for buying electric. Cheaper parking (which is expensive), halved toll prices, halved ferry prices, cars have way less charges on them (you pay per horsepower on ICE cars). There are also government grants for appartement complexes to add the possibility for charging cars. This is funded by oil, and it is not cheap.

Norway is also a small country, where the consumer can afford to buy more expensive cars. So yes, Norway is proof that it can work, but it does not prove how it can work at scale in poorer countries."

To be fair the Tesla repair times also seem high but i have heard horror stories about the service centers so maybe that's it. It has less space and likely isn't pursuit rated (those Ford's have extra bracing etc to keep the frame unbent). This report is also just bad....

And the trends we see in the rest of Western Europe is that more and more countries have a massive political will pushing the EV agenda, and there is a broad selection of EVs available for the consumer, with a fast-paced development in terms of e.g. battery capacity and range, charging and related infrastructure.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lyft and Uber are paying 75% of revenue to drivers. It’s not even close to the same business as driverless cars.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s possible, but there is a ton of wiggle room in there since it’s at less than half of the $1.50 that Uber/Lyft charge. I was just trying to be conservative. 

Also, I don’t know much about the wants of the market since I hate not taking my own car so I pretty much never take Uber/Lyft. That being said, I personally would pay a premium over $1.50 just to have my own private car to ride in. Especially if that car had a nice flatscreen to watch Netflix/YouTube on."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sell 10 cars in 2019, 20 is 100% growth. Apple does fine with 20% market share.

But I agree that the valuation doesn’t make sense as a manufacturing company. If they can’t do services they aren’t a trillion dollar company. I just think that they will be able to lease you a driver and insurance for $10,000 a year."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that batteries are as important as car engines, there are a lot of companies out there being successful without building own engines. A lot of car manufacturers actually do this. 

It is very short-sighted to think VW or other traditional automakers with EV production will not succeed with that strategy. They are maybe losing out a portion at the batteries, but their premium build quality will make up for that.

Also: Supplier relations are not a one way street. They will make a profit, yes, but they also know that you can only produce demand when their price is not too high. The car industry is heavily reliant on supply companies. Everything, from the seat, the front end, the lights to the rims, to the steering wheel, everything comes from supply companies. And every automaker turns a profit with this in place.

Additionally, I have a bunch of friends and know a lot of car owners who will never want to buy/own a TSLA. They think this thing is build like a Fiat of the 90s with a price tag of a Mercedes. That is where all the other European automakers will score - a car with decent quality and with a lower price tag than TSLA. 

There is no denying the numbers in Musk burning money and all the fanboys giving him money blindly. Of course he needs to spend this money. Question being: How do you exchange all the cars in a city to EV? Answer: In Europe it is going to be difficult. The parking spaces are tight, wild parking everywhere, not enough room. Like 50 chargers for a city of 200k inhabitants. So, where does everyone charge their vehicle? At the Shell or BP station? Simply put: There is no good infrastructure for EVs in Europe yet. Yeah, you can 100% live with an EV but you got to plan ahead. Plan your stops, plan your charges. I doubt we will see a 50% EV share in 2025 in Europe. Although I'd wish it was higher. But demand is not there. 

TSLA has yet to show they are making profitable cars - their excess stems from sale of co2 certificates. If the traditional car makers go 100% electric or 100% h2, they will have a hard time selling the certificates."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I know that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok Boomer! 

Enjoy your tiny DD"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That argument doesn't work for Norway, the politics are not as fucked as in the US. We rely almost exclusively on hydropower for our energy needs, and even though we are producing oil, it's not that embedded into our politics as we are not reliant on it. There was never any resistance when these grants were being created. Politicians love the attention they get from it, and the government has a lot of control over the oil industry.

And I brought up poorer countries because there are virtually no poor people in Norway. An average Norwegian is more likely to be able to buy a new electric car than an average American, or German.

Again, I'm not doubting that the future is electric, but I think it's kinda wrong to use Norway as an example in the way you did."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I had that answer, my company would be in OP’s list."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What percentage do you think Tesla is going to have pay it’s partners to rent out their Teslas? Also uber/lyft only pay drivers around 60-65% of the fare.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Over next 10 years they have a ~$47 billion in disrupting peaker plants and roofing/solar which is another ~$42 billion industry. 

There is money to made in many sectors. And Tesla is attacking from many angles. 

I also have high hopes for the 3D printer RNA microfactories they are building -  but that I don’t have clue the $ potential there since it’s just a pet project"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could you tell me what advantage GOEV will have over other EV companies and traditional auto makers moving into the EV sector? Like, enough of an advantage to convince me to invest before they have any sales and terrible scaling capabilities?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you assume Tesla is going to have any partners in the venture?
Edit: I don’t necessarily believe Tesla will be the major player here. Could be google with a partner, could be amazon with a partner, could be a of other players. 
But I strongly believe that the future of cars is this model, definitely in most urban and suburban areas, probably not in more rural areas. The vast majority of people will subscribe for a monthly fee. Driverless cars will just be driving around picking up people and dropping them off.  Save on the need for parking spaces, cars that aren’t used vast majority of the day and just more conveinant in terms of maintenance and also not having to drive yourself.

Right now Uber cannot do this at an affordable price. Paying drivers 60% means they can’t possibly offer a 500 dollar a month subscription and make money. But once a car is driverless the price point becomes significantly less"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"% market share and revenue multiplier. Those numbers aren’t as big as you think they are. 

Tesla’s market cap today is huge."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you show me more of that tiny flaccid DD I'll go gay.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Well Tesla said they are going to basically let Tesla owners lend out their cars for ridesharing when they aren’t using them. So those people would be their partners.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla has majority in megapack battery storage with immense growth and also the only US based manufacturer of PV cells now. 

They are primed to take over the energy sector by storm. Add in Autobidder. You’ve got billions upon billions coming in with very cheap costs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice reasoning. Projecting with that tiny DD stuff, huh?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo this is super helpful no idea why it’s not getting traction
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Unfortunately a lot of heavy money is making money off of your options plays.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. I feel like a lot of the stuff being posted/written seems to ignore the fact MM's can also use options to hedge positions. Its not always a short call/buy stock scenario. Pretty sure a trader on an MM desk will get booted if he just sells naked calls and waits for them to expire worthless to collect a premium. 100% he/she will be required to hedge, but this hedge can come in more ways than just buying the stock.

&#x200B;

Wtf did I just write....who knows."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,:(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly this.  I'm still new here but until the last week or two the standard response to someone asking to explain options was fuck off, this is a casino.  Now, at the same time theories are popping up that the shorts are covering their losses by selling way OTM calls we're flooded with instructional options posts for newbies?  Seems a little suspicious and you don't have to be a conspiracy theorist to at least question why."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t say for sure that that’s what they’re doing because I don’t want to be accused of being paranoid, but I do think that would be a good way for them to make a profit and deplete the cash balance of retail at the same time without them ever purchasing regular shares

Kinda like the weed and silver pump and dumps that ended up costing some people so much money.

Edit: [Hmmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ma9aqn/comment/grrwsq0) 👀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry next time I’ll definitely tell you to fuck off. Have absolutely no problem doing that. Fucking wackjob,"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be the appropriate response if I asked you for something, which, if we're being honest is never gonna happen."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not even about anyone telling anyone else to buy options or not. This is not an instructional sub. It’s for bets. Says so right in the name. This shit belongs on noobs or elsewhere. 

And if the reasoning is it’ll get more exposure here, tough shit. My dick pics would get plenty of exposure on r/AskReddit, doesn’t mean they belong there."

Also literally 2 days ago YOU suggested I write up a DD on GME. So here it is: GFY"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You really talking about the ""purpose of this sub"" like you didn't just discover WSB 2 months ago because of GME"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure the only DD requests I’ve put out were for naysayers. I think it would be quite beneficial for a long form DD to post explaining why MOASS isn’t happening, which I must have assumed from whatever comment you made along those lines. 

This clearly isn’t that, so I wouldn’t say my requesting you post DD applies to advanced options education. I’ve still not seen “GME is over DD” and I think it’d be quite popular, if not controversial."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Where’d you get that impression?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your first comment here was in January and you've posted ~143 since then. If you're that active here, you would have posts in here from before January if you knew about this place.

That, and that you think people talking about options in here is suspicious: since your clearly unaware that WSB is options-based, not shares."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I say I was that active here? I know the purpose of r/worldpolitics but don’t have much to say about anime titties so you won’t find much engagement from me over there. You realize one can join a sub without comment, right? That plenty of us who haven’t participated till recently have enjoyed the humor of this sub without having skin in the game?

Are you alleging this is an educational sub then? I must’ve missed all that intro to content in the past."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been a Peloton bike owner for a couple years and bought stock after their IPO.  I thought mid-40s was a bit high, so I waited and got in at 18.25 (fuck, yeah).  I thought 160+ was insane, but I didn't sell, and I think the 100-120 is much more reasonable, now\*.

COVID: Obviously, it's been a factor.  I know people in my social circle, not just online, who are still waiting and excited for their bikes.  These are people who won't be going to a gym for at least another year.  I don't expect a dip in bike sales, even with the warmer weather.

My thoughts on the bike platform:  The bike is not a gym replacement and never will be.  What it does replace are (very pricey) spin classes.  Those classes are full-on addictive and all COVID has done is introduce new people to it.  The only complaints I see from users are delivery and repair issues, which have been severely exacerbated in the last year, and that the library of classes isn't big enough.  For the record, you're talking about hundreds of classes, even when filtered down by time and specific instructor, so these are people who ride the ever-loving shit out of their bikes (at my height, I was probably doing 15-20 a week).

I can't speak to their treadmill.  I have had a ""dumb"" one for years, but I used to be a competitive runner, so now I hate running and don't use it much.  I can see the appeal of the Tread from a virtual class perspective, but I think they're fighting a user base of people who just don't want to run.

\*What I see as the big, incoming bump:  The rower.  The bike and treadmill incorporate weights into some of their classes to work your upper body, but there are **a lot** of people in the community who are waiting for this to drop, myself included.  A new product has been alluded to in the Apple GymKit code.  When that drops, orders for it will go through the roof.  That's when I'll sell my stock.  I just don't see it happening before they get their bike backorders and delivery issues ironed out.

Edit: Also, for the record, I *didn't* want to buy the bike.  My wife bought it and I rolled my eyes.  I was wrong and I'm not ashamed to admit it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I definitely think peloton is a sleeper. A lot of large gym chains were crippled during the pandemic like 24 hour chuze and crunch. Planet fitness is fine but that's whatever. Imo peloton and strong staying power if they Transition to in person circuit gyms and spin classes like orange theory. With there membership is 13 they could easily up that to 20 or 25 if they offer in person classes. Idk how large the gym market is but I'm sure if they play their cards right they can corner it. It's p/e is really high so idk If I would buy yet, but my eye is definitely on it."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What exactly is proprietary about PTON that makes it so a Sam's Club (like they are doing) can't come massively undercut on price and way outperform on logistics and cash on hand?

What's the moat here?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No shame in enjoying the bike. I'm the in same boat; I thought a trainer would be good enough, and my wife really wanted the peloton. Now I'm on the thing every day and my concept2 is starting to collect dust. 

My wife was one of those crazies who ordered 5 bikes just to make sure she could snag the earliest delivery window and not get screwed by a delivery delay/cancel, so I know all about the logistics headache. It was rough, but I think the backlog of regular bikes has been cleared as of this month.  Sounds like there's still a backlog on the plus and tread, so I totally agree that there ""should"" be a delay in a new product.

If a rower drops, that would be cool, but I wonder ""how cool"". Also, the Hydrow hit the market during covid, so that will be their biggest competition and that might be seriously hard. Anyone looking for peloton style workouts on a rower is going to care alot more about feel than content if you're sitting on it for 30-60 minutes."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The digital library and name recognition which comes from being first.  Sam's Club could sell a ""smart"" bike with a set of videos, but they aren't going to run the studios and constantly produce expanded content.  That's where Peloton has the rest of the market beat."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I do. So much more convenient."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">Also, the Hydrow hit the market during covid, so that will be their biggest competition and that might be seriously hard.

I think that's precisely the reason there were hints at a rower dropped by Peloton.  I believe the users, if they think might be able to get one within the same ecosystem, they're going to wait for it.  I like the leaderboard (sometimes) and badges, purely for my own motivation, but there are some diehards that will do anything to get extra points and badges in their profile."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I spend a lot of time in health circles, and the peloton craze is a serious thing. I used to spend a lot of money going to a yoga studio and once I set up a room at home and streaming I just never could be bothered to go to the studio again. Hard to say which way this one will go though with gyms opening back up. People might just want to go back to the gym for nostalgic reasons alone..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you own a peleton?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I don't. But mainly because it's not the kind of exercise I enjoy. I like yoga and do subscribe to a streaming service that I use at home which ended up being much cheaper than when I went to a yoga studio."

For GME to be worth *anything* the market has to consider a secured interest in the business to be a good place to sink some wealth.  

Retards here have a million theories about how Gamestop (or AMC, for that matter) will pivot into an entirely new business and suddenly become an absolute powerhouse by abandoning its only expertise and somehow beating the big, established players who already dominate the new arena.

Those theories are complete rationalizations that are not convincing to random investors who don't have an emotional connection to Gamestop and video games in general (or AMC and comic book movies).

When the dust finally settles on all this retarded memestonking, these securities are going to be worth exactly what an average investor thinks those business are worth and that's going to be a very low number, because those are dying businesses in dying industries.  They were particularly selected for this memestonk nonsense because they have particular appeal to Reddit retards, but that doesn't translate **at all** to a similar widespread valuation."

Daycare for a 1yr old is 26,000 CZK ($1,200 USD) per month where I live, and 55,000 CZK ($2,500 USD) in a place like San Francisco.

There's a tollway half a mile from my house that is about $3.50 for the first 5 miles before exiting to the freeway. Then if you keep going straight on that freeway for a few minutes and don't exit, that one turns into a toll road also that's about $4 for the next 10 miles.

We have transponders stuck to our windshield that links to an account that these tolls keep raping us in as we pass underneath. $0.75, $1.25, $1.80, $1.50, $0.90... just nickel and dime us to death until we get an email saying our account was replenished (charged credit card $40 to refill).

This reminds me of a story I heard (I haven't verified or googled this at all before commenting so if I get this totally wrong I'm sorry in advance). The story was that during WW2 every German tank was being engineered to last 10+ years and weren't allowed to leave the factory until this was the case.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean yeah but there's other things for people to spend on and considering lingering covid fears that airlines are at the center of people might not want to buy flights. Also there are quite a few airlines and in order for them to stay competitive with each other they won't up prices for a while meaning their margins and profit will stay diminished for a while.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get the Warren Buffett remark on airline stocks, but he's been playing that game for 30-40 years and has seen a shitload of shenaniganry when it comes to airlines and business, including the great consolidation of the 80s-90s up to the megamergers of the 2000/10s.  All of these acquisitions and the airlines are still at the mercy of Tourism, then Oil prices, then Business changes, etc.  All of those things have fluctuated over the last 40 years, but the flux has gotten HARDER in the last 12 years.  Oil topped $100/barrel, meaning JP Kerosene went through the roof.  Tourism between places changes flavors and quick through the age of social media, which got significantly culled back due to the pandemic.  Business changes have been ongoing since the 70s when Caterpillar first started hiring local sales teams worldwide, instead of sending people on airplanes.  The internet hastened the demise of travelling salespeople, and now the idea is that businesses won't have conferences in person but rather teleconferences.  That may be true for some, but I can tell you from my own experience that as soon as people get jabbed, those annual conferences in Vegas or wherever will be back.  After all, Tax-deductible business travel on the corporate dime with entertainment covered?  You bet your ass that perk will come back."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"😳 you know more then me most likely. But even still all the airlines can't survive off of round trip vegas flights for different industries annual conferences. Teleconferences are astoundingly cheaper then real conferences and I think that is the biggest incentive for companies to leave vegas behind. Think about it if you're Me. CEO would you spend 50,000 to send your goons to Vegas or have them sit at home at their already installed work stations and pocket that cash for yourself?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a helluva lot more than vegas.  Any major city where there are things to do and places to see.  There's also more than just ""savings"" or ""pocketing the cash"" because you can't tax-deduct a bonus.  

A trip for the region's managers and salespeople to *insert regional city of importance* which can be added to ""business expenses"" on the annual tax dodge, resulting in higher morale and better team communication or:

$300,000 that ends up as ""profit"" and gets taxed, and none of that is going to bump your bonus either direction."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone is dunking on [C3.AI](https://C3.AI) because it's pretty basic, with really only the platform and the codeless AI being ""special."" There are other companies with offerings like this (Snowflake, Dataiku) that are similar offerings. Probably because these people are in industries related to ML and AI and think it is ""behind."" But plenty of wheelmakers still exist and the wheel has been around for a while. Let's all remember that the underlying product doesn't need to be superior in functionality for it to sell well (ahem, Apple.)

C3.AI are heavily reliant on partnership with Baker Hughes for their revenue, and this is the biggest issue right now - sales are not going up enough to justify their post-IPO frenzy high. But this does not mean their revenue is shaky, just not growing as fast as everyone thought.

There are enough old-school businesses, of which oilfield and service companies are one, which don't have any AI capabilities and are not sexy enough or with deep enough pockets (or leeway in their corporate pay bands) to hire many bright AI minds.

This is where the money is made for companies like C3. Mining, construction, and capital heavy businesses that have fleets of equipment to function need this expertise but can't burn cash like a tech company because they have such huge balance sheets and need FCF so they can pay dividends.

Just as Oracle gave companies a platform to run business analytics on a database that was not particularly earthshattering, C3 and other companies give giant organizations a way into the ML space without as many hurdles.

With COVID, all these companies are hoarding cash to protect dividend but as soon as industry picks back up, they will be looking to keep optimizing. I feel this is a good entry point for a 2-3 year play with C3. Their platform is sound, R&D continues into optimizing their codeless ML offering, and Baker Hughes is a whale that could bring in other equipment and service companies looking to optimize capital-intensive asset fleets.

There's no guarantee C3 will succeed ahead of Snowflake or Dataiku, but Oracle made solid, uninspired enterprise software that has provided business intelligence for decades. Tom Siebel has enough connections in business via his time at Oracle and certainly enough hot air in his lungs that he just might be able to sell some old stodgy companies with large balance sheets on the benefits of ML and AI. Once they realize they can save on capex and opex, they will start to bite, if he can spin his pitch just right.

I wonder how much damage was done to my kidneys because of waiting that extra week.  Also, even after being in the hospital confirmed having stones, which is widely regarded as one of the most intense pains in the body...one of the nurses acted like I was drug-seeking.

************************************************
I think I know how it works but...I could be wrong, I'm wrong all the time just ask my wife. Let me check....$18/$72.10 =.24999 ~ 25%  So my government (Medicare) is paying my doctor 75% less than your doctor makes.   The average doctor in private practice sees 20-25 patients a day I don't know of any that can pay their bills and themselves on $350/day.

******************************************************
In Canada you need legal status to be covered by the governmental insurer.
******************************************************
That's not how it works in the US.  

My bad.  I apologize.  The politically correct term to use now is unauthorized non citizen. It just sounds so much nicer than illegal doesn't it?  In the US, states will issue driver's licenses, allow their children to be educated in the school system, their children can pay ""in state"" college tuition while charging US citizens coming from another state 4 times as much for out of state tuition (how that for a kick in the head eh?), and yes if they go to a public taxpayer supported hospital they will see a doctor without a penny to their name.  Mothers will take their kid to the ER just for the flu. They don't have government insurance per se (at least not yet but the liberals are working on that) but they're judgement proof which is just as good.  In theory they could get a bill.  Good luck collecting from someone who doesn't have anything and is unauthorized to begin with.   The bottom line is they don't pay for it. You only need insurance if you have something to take."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GME bond bull? My broker found 3/15/23 bonds callable 3/15/22 with a 10% coupon for a $2 premium.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once a bond has been auctioned, the yield on that bond (coupon rate) never changes.

A 10 year bond is auctioned off by GE and the market determines that in order to invest $1000 in this bond, we need to be paid a 10% interest rate based on how risky it is.  That means that every year, no matter what, the holder of that bond will be paid $100 dollars (10%), and at the end of the 10th year will also get his $1000 back.

This coupon rate NEVER changes, and shouldnt be confused with interest rates.

Fast forward 5 years.

Your original 10 year bond is now effectively a 5 year bond on the secondary market.  GE now auctions off a 5 year bond of comparable risk to your original 10 year bond and the market determines that they want 5% interest in order to invest.  They invest $1000 and get a $50 coupon per year.  But wait.  You are holding a 5 year bond that pays a higher coupon than what someone could get a new one for (yours pays $100).  You have no incentive to sell that bond for par value ($1000).  On the secondary market your bond is worth $1348.44."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You sure it wasn’t Bulgaria?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.   This would actually the ""current yield"" of the bond.   Not to be confused with interest rates. 

I think the thing that confuses people most is that bond yields are determined by bond prices, and bond prices are determined by interest rates

Edit:  

When pundits talk about the Fed cutting rates, they arent talking about cutting the yield to the 10 year (or any other ""yield"" that they show on CNBC).  They are talking about cutting the prime rate to control inflation.  As the risk prime rate climbs, the interest rates rise with it and bond prices fall.  As the bond prices fall from the rising interest rates, the yield (what they show on CNBC) rises.

I wish they would do a better job explaining stuff like that.  I'm probably not the most eloquent, and I wouldnt doubt my retard brain has some things wrong, but its disappointing they dont go over it more."

When I started in the biz there were still 30yr bonds from Jimmy Carter’s presidency, coupons of 18% were normal and when rates were around 7-8% they were priced in the 250-275 dollar range.  When I tell people a bond issued at par with a 4% coupon and ask what the bond price would be if rates went to 8% they guess 75-80 then they learn closer to 50 and they don’t believe me.  Just wait til these bonds issued at 2.5% to 3.5% drop as rates eventually get back to a more normal 5-6%, it’ll get ugly fast"

Because even though ""*we*"" as a collective of redditors come together to discuss stocks and therefore can be grouped as such a collective, ""*we*"" can *not* be classified as a collective that is actively manipulating the market for our own gain.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comes back to that hard times make tough men. Tough men create good times. Good times create weak men and by extension a weak country.  US is no different currently. 

It's global."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah there’s some far off places left that are more “aware” given their lack of exposure to screens.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some shares a few weeks ago but jfc this company likes to bitch. Not saying they're wrong though, I hope it works out"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So we are dead huh?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember, with no options expiring soon there won’t be the normal thumb pressing down the scale that we normally see. UWMC is going to fly this week"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,F to my 3/26 calls
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I yolo'd as well. I'm relatively new so I put 14 contracts in on $15c 4/16.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whether or not this is intentional, this is the effect."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You will be fine with these. The indices were nice short term bumps but you'll be good on $9 by may with or without them. Company fundamentals are rock solid.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel doomed
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a valid strategy if you never buy something that actually goes down permanently (because of bad fundamentals). That's the thing, I can't see a future where Americans suddenly stop buying mortgages. Even if UWM was broken down today and all the mortgages it owns were sold off at market prices, there'd be more than $8 per share of value. The lowest lows below $8 are just unrealistic assessments of the company value - they assign actually *negative* premium to the growth potential and the competence of the company management. I mean, fuckups do happen (everyone remembers how Nokia was Elop'ed), but this is just unfair, because UWM has been doing totally fine and is expected to be on a growth track."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny how all you think is the Index. The stock is great and has loads of potential.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"im really buzzed and cant stop laughing, scared the shit out of the dog. thank"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is being excluded because its business practices are not in the best interest of the brokers. UWMC's ultimatum will allow brokers to work with any of their competitors except RKT and Fairway.. aka 73 other companies.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp rip to that, it's already down 7% pre market"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This might depress people. But it’s not likely that the hedgies are buying 800c. Rather selling 800c and cashing in on us to kick the can down the curb. Which is why we need to stop wasting money on options and start buying the shares. Not financial advice
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Betting against the house, rest assured the house is gonna get theirs. I don't doubt they will make a shit-ton off of options, regardless of whether or not they close or not. My concern is that they would likely try to use those options to also fuck up the voyage as a nice 🖕🏽 to retail.

We're exposing alot of shit with the attention vacuum that's been created around GME. But none of it is new shit. A fool and his money shall soon part is still the motto of wallstreet."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m so dumb, say it like I’m wearing a matching helmet/diaper ensemble."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the OI is so high because it’s the first monthly option after the ER.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point. At some point the short squeeze will happen and at that point it won't have mattered how many calls they had exprie previous or lost money rolling to a new strike date. When the squeeze actually happens $800c will look like gold. 

I am not saying buy way OTM calls people. Not financial advice. Nobody knows when the squeeze will be squoze and anyone who says they do is lying."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bankruptcy is irrelevant. Someone still has to cough up the money when the time comes and you click that four-letter weird troll button that starts with S (at $100k+/share of course).
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the almost right answer. When volatility goes insane, contracts can be mispriced so selling a 5p when volatility is very high provides low-risk gains"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 🚀💎
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't they already driving the price down as much as they can every trading day now?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of this has to do with how S3 decided to just change how they calculate SI%, right in the middle of the GME saga. There should be one website that publicly shows outstanding shares and options and short interest for every ticker. It's 2021 and we're all guessing for like 3 factors when calculating SI%. It's not fair to retail."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Those $30 puts could have easily been bought as the lower leg hedging a put spread. (long position)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean the market makers, but there could be overlap between the market makers and the shorts."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will always have more shorts. The options aren't at the point where they can rebuy the stock 4 times over. Shorts will murder them. They're only play has only ever been to get out of their short positions.

I think the high options are a few retail, but mostly other HFs who are trying to hedge their bets and be able to reallocate their other funds if they get a chance to buy options when the price is high.

They're not going to tie up money for long periods, but they'll gamble a little that it might go up a lot."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you might be right. I remember reading the squeeze would happen in Jan, then Feb, then March, and now it could happen anytime but don’t pick a date. 
Turn off the lights on your way out."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My life's kind of on hold right now regardless.  I'm keeping an eye on my dad while he recovers from covid.  I've really enjoyed having a fun distraction learning about this even if it caused a mild mental breakdown.  Cognitive dissonance is a bitch.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh you were asking if it’ll still happen sarcastically. Sorry. I didn’t catch that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I hear you. I went into it knowing there would be fuckery afoot. I got in sub 100 so good either moons or long-term investment. This was a wager for me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apologies, I should have added /s. 
Enjoy the week."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I got in at 120.  It was all money I could lose.  FUD still got to me.  I was learning more and more about the mechanics of stocks and options.  At some point I learned enough to disprove my previous beliefs.  Now I'm right back to 🦍💪💎🙌🚀🌕 and it's a much more pleasant ride.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not yet we can't, but once all those hundred of billions of sweet, sweet tendies come in....?

We could start up an anti-hedgefund hedgefund, targeting and taking them all down, one at a time, until they team up to beat us, but by then our war chest has grown too large, as we consume each subsequent HF."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I usually do, and same to you!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBC- redditors that legally form a hedge fund are manipulating the market!!!!! They should be stopped!!!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail didn't throw almost 2 million shorts at it on Friday in the last minute of the market being open.

That was a planned attack from a HF."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok. Noted! Thank you! Probably will watch the options and how this plays before entering. I do agree and understand timing the entry. Just a choice for me of buying a dip or options. But i will do more looking and keep a close eye on your points mentioned
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm very sorry that you think that someone simply trying to discuss not necessarily the bearish case for GME, but rather the overwhelming amount of disinformation in DD surrounding the company, is somehow spreading FUD.

Every reply you make further confirms my suspicions that you're not really investing logically, but emotionally -- you *need* the stock to go up, you'll never sell at a loss, you will hold it and fantasize if it never goes up again, and you are letting confirmation bias guide you. If you're okay with that, that's fine.

But I *have* received a lot of support from traders less emotionally invested in the stock, and who are just trying to learn, and separate the facts from the falsehoods. Good luck to you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you have received support from other shills and bots..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should be able to give me an example of just one blatant shill/bot, then."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because someone disagrees with you and gives evidence for their reasoning doesn't make them a shill.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is if that's practically the only thing that person posts about, I went through your posting history"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then I guess you would've seen [my top-voted comment of all time](https://www.reddit.com/r/videos/comments/l6uur7/payne_sounds_off_on_wall_st_over_gamestop_all_of/), where I spent hours compiling and correcting and amending a list of brokers who stopped GME and others for trading.

And, tbf, GME is all this entire sub is posting about lately. By your own logic, should I accuse *you* of being a pro-GME bot/shill?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,ok shill
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You mind sharing which strike & expiry you got? Thinking of trying this
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard that was Octavio.  He did something nasty with his sisters once.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey! I like the cut of your jib. Nice work.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a few shares at $3.50 average cost and some similar option calls but only a few. I like this stock. Good luck! 👍
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent DD my man. Read every word. Was a wee bit disappointed not to see the index inclusion but only because I like short term gains like everyone. Fundamentally, UWMC is undervalued as fuck and I have a large percentage of my portfolio in this. Looking forward to Q1 earnings. 🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't read it. I just want to know how much Adderall was consumed before writing it.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Doomsday tomorrow? Or must we hoooold
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,$UWMC will make us rich. Then I'll use them to buy a house. A poor dude can hope in one hand...
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good read. I don't think you added that UWMC's ultimatum ultimately paid off hard af. (they reported). I always wanted to see the balanced sheet and my eyes could have used a break in between paragraphs.

I'm in for shares and a call. Might up since I didn't know how close they were to liquid value."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am broke, but when the virus hit I waited for the downward trend to break on mortgage companies and bought the massive dip just under the assumption they would either die or have to return to normal eventually.

I haven’t made much off them but I’m proud of the couple bucks I made off of IVR, and GMPT. They had very consistent prices for so long, and the dip was unimaginably large. I took my smooth brain graph knowledge and bought in. I’m retarded so I have no idea, and have done little to no DD or anything, but if this company is similar it should rise with the trends of these two companies as well, maybe? But with much more force considering its earnings. I work full time, am a gamer, and am in school, as you can imagine I am much too lazy to actively look at anything other than my GME graph.

If someone with a couple wrinkles in their head bundles wants to look more into it for a point of reference, and maybe give a new perspective, I’d really appreciate it. I thought I might as well slap what little I have to offer in here.  I’ve lurked here since NIO made me 40$ and have never said anything worthwhile."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the company has a solid moat, good fundamentals, and a bright future ahead. My only problem with this company is the founder. He’s an opportunist, as should anyone be, but the bad kind. He saw what was going on with the GMA hype, and decided to get the sub behind him with all the sky high promises. If he was rejected from being included in the Russell index because he holds 90% of the float. Any founder who is not willing to give up more than 50% of the company and is offloading it on to a public market, is looking to grift."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,In Florida you can't go *anywhere* without seeing housing communities being put up. The supply side is catching up on new construction down here
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,you are a legend in your own mind
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I held every one after placing and canceling four sell orders. And bought 30 more. I'm either a genius or have a brain tumor. 🧠
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, Florida has always been a hot bed for real estate.  We have a large concentration of clients in Florida versus most other states.  Contrast that to other states like South Dakota (no offense to anyone who lives there) and it makes sense.

I've actually thought about moving down to Florida as it's similar to Texas but with better weather.  Texas, specifically Dallas, is a great real estate market as well comparatively."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh I was so excited looking at premarket. I saw it tanking down to 8. I was hoping I could write a bunch of those may 21 7.5s. now its tracking back up. might not hit the contract price I wanted. boo
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep telling yourself its a great stock.  Heck, why don't you go ahead and put more money into it?

OR - why not maybe take a good hard listen to the counter point rationally instead of blindly attacking the counterpoint?

The best investors takes the counterpoint seriously and doesn't just dismiss it to validate his/her confirmation bias.

BTW - markets are up huge, but UWMC down.  Go figure."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You only comment enthusiastically about meme stocks 🤔
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My brain when I see a math symbol on Reddit - 404 ERROR
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess the solidness of my DD, and institutional belief in the stock held up. It's not a bad idea to buy in the 8's whatsoever. We'll see what happens this week, but I'm looking ahead. I purchased more April and May Calls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope the haircut was a good one

I'm not giving up my 8 shares even if they are synthetic. I paid my hard earned money on them and I'll bite a mf on the leg in court."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi All! I made a new post on this topic, as promised!

edit2: its back up lol"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree, but a plan alone does not justify the current price. I have no doubt that they will turn it around, and once they do, I don't think a 1k price is outrageous.

But this transformation hasn't gained momentum yet, and so I don't believe the current price is representative of value. They did start though, so that's a great sign. I think it'll take at least till the end of the year for us to really see the ""new Gamestop"". For a conversion of brick and mortar to mainly e-commerce, that is still impressively fast."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This one weird trick amazes your mom and keeps your wife’s boyfriend sleeping at night.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,The plan will justify a price of $1000-1200. Analysts don't wait for a plan's completion to justify a valuation.  They're speculating a price based on future prospects.  Once analysts start to consider the plan and new direction their price targets will increase dramatically.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget the bit where the topic was about value based on fundamentals. The price skyrocketing without any change in the fundamentals is practically by definition not going to be valuation based on the actual fundamentals.

Rampant speculation without any definitive action (i.e: they haven't actually done anything to start or announced any sort pivot to e-commerce or what not) is also definitely not valuation based on them.

Gamestop wasn't being artificially suppressed by shorters, it was just never valued at even close to $100+ per share."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is a good point and then again. Sometimes something in the market changes which affects a company. But the price action for GME was definitely based on speculation ;). 

That being said I'm staying because I like Gamestop, I'm a gamer by hearth and I believe the growth potential is enormous. Also this has changed beyond normal meme rally. The closest the market has ever experienced something like this is Tesla. People don't just buy stock they buy products and gets hyped about the stores. Insane amount of free publicity."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started mine Thursday. It still hasn't changed from the first --> 

It says in progress, but I haven't gotten a email or anything. It weird idk, is it messed up?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've tried to transfer like 6 times and it's died at the ""Robinhood approval"" stage every time.  I don't really know what else to do at this point since RH customer service doesn't seem to exist.  Hopefully it goes better for you."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s in the app. I had someone ask me earlier how to do it on PC and it’s not possible there. I’ve already gone through this process so I can’t say for sure if the option for this is where I say it is, but for me to RE-enable this (which is not possible without customer support, by the way) I navigate to Profile (bottom right-hand corner silhouette of a man Scaramouche, Scaramouche), Menu, Investing, and down to the bottom is an option for me to “get robinhood instant.” This is the setting you are looking to disable.  
  
Be patient and scour the app."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you! Idk if there are just fidelity shills all over wsb, but every time I bitch about their application process I get swarmed by assholes telling me how great fidelity is and it's probably just my smooth brain that's the problem.  I make 100k a year and they denied me margin and options. So idk if you have to have been trading since the 80s or if you need to be Jeff Bezos.. because they don't fucking tell me anything.  And their call center won't fucking pick up.  I get instant feedback from this Chinese broker.. granted they are probably giving my info directly to the CCP, but apparently that's the only viable alternative to getting fucked directly in the ass by a domestic broker."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"No margin, full transfer. Not sure if all positions were settled but its likely they were as I wasn't really active on that one"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elizabeth Warren and other Progressives in Congress also want to protect from yourself by taxing your transaction. The money will go to disadvantaged groups. I mean, it’s all your fault."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better to use a different broker. Some *better established* brokers are more flexible than others and vary in degree of more passive vs more active strategies. Most importantly, they're better than possible future corporate espionage (WeBull) or literal Madoff based RobinHood.

I didn't like Fidelity because requirements for their margins and options were subjective vs something like TDA where they are more clear on these requirements. Everyone has their preferences. As long as the broker provides what they are required and aren't a blatant conflict of interest. They need to work for you, not the other way around."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a traditional and roth IRA through Vanguard. They're great for set it and forget it (automatic monthly withdrawals, paycheck deposits, etc) but when RH screwed us over I just opened a Fidelity Brokerage account. Over the last three months I've used both and if you're making frequent trades fidelity >> vanguard in terms of UI/UX, at least in my opinion.

While not intentional, I also like that my retirement stuff is over at VG and my brokerage stuff is separate at Fidelity.

p.s. I tried Fidelity's 'trader pro' software and on macOS it's a nightmare, so I've just stuck to the website. maybe it's awesome on Windows; one of these days I will try it and if so build out a pc just for trading."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The issue with CSP is you gotta have 2.2K in your account for every put, which is a lot of cash just sitting around and not invested in something else.. it’s why I prefer to just buy and sell CC’s and worst case scenario I can break even if the stock drops"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is invested though, I'm getting ~6.5% ROC over 30 days. If I could keep that going that's 78% a year. It's literally just the inverse of buying the shares and doing a CC, the collateral is locked up either way whether its in shares or cash. The only real benefit to a CC is if the stock pays a dividend or the market is very bullish and call premiums are better than put, but that hasn't been the case recently. CSPs also have the benefit of being able to use margin without paying interest. 

My goal is just to collect premium while IV is high, I don't want in PLTR at the current price but I wouldn't mind getting assigned at ~$20.5 cost basis so CSPs work better for me."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah i see - I'm quite new to options so I never thought of it that way, but you're right - both methods tie up your cash.

I guess in my case the stocks I'm selling CC's on are those that I'm long for, so to me buying it makes sense."

Cold fusion or something. It's just good business.  


$AMC for me is still a going strong leader, and even if they issue more shares, they'll likely gain more value anyways. The idea is that they just want to make sure they hold the pot at the end, when they call all those shares in."

Thanks for proving my point. You ignored $50 million dollars in your initial biased reception and noted that Lordstown is backed by GM through official documentation.

It may be a drop in the bucket according to you but $25m in cash and $50m (assets, permits, and operating costs) earns GM a seat on the board of directors. 

Also, while you were skimming through the investor materials, you probably ignored page 4. - Maybe read through the whole deal to educate yourself a bit more and learn why this company won't fail.

Let me know where I lied and was deceptive. Looks like you're the only shill in this conversation."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Analysts](https://money.cnn.com/quote/forecast/forecast.html?symb=OAC) have street high of $20 (38% upside). The CEO has a long term goal of 20bn market cap which is ~$125/share.

imo though there’s execution risk, these guys have potential to surprise to upside by expanding across services. If growth goes to 50% (management originally guided 30%), we could see re-rating and $30-$40 price targets. Obviously, if they don’t deliver stock price plummets, but keep in mind it’s only a 3 year old company and management expects $200M in revenue this year.... that’s pretty impressive and earns some trust with me in their ability to execute

If we collect all of the REAL physical silver and then begin to demand delivery for the physical silver shares we own in Trusts and ETFs. Then the curtain is pulled back and the REAL supply numbers become evident. The supply numbers are currently just a lie promise like a fed reserve note. They know full well how damaging this is but they’re balls deep Melvin’s mashed taters style, perhaps worse. Perhaps a lot worse. Then there’s Basel 3. For some reason though I have a feeling we might not make it that far before the fit hits the shan. Mints are already trying to hide the default. Apes take millions of ounces off the market daily yet the price doesn’t stay above 26.00 for very long. These guys are just trying to waffle stomp the turd down the shower drain before their wives walk in and catch them shitting in the shower. I suggest buying silver.

If you really think AMC only goes up, buy the dip. Or at least take advantage of short-term puts / covered calls."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying more TELL
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Please post your loss porn after this vote is approved. The carnage is going to be legendary.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If anyone cares to understand the situation better...

The CEO sold 750K shares on Friday.

Wake up. The real shills are the ones insisting you hold the bag... **without a good reason to**.

Saying amc is fawked or going down 🙄 oh bois bois bois your so predictable at this point you need to change your algorithm.

To be clear I like the stock amc I like it alot ...so guess we know who's down voting.eh?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Move to gme boys
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,12.50 AMC puts gonna print today
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Disappointed on the lack of questions.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they don’t raise more capital they’ll be fragile and liable to go bust, making the shares worthless.. how does no one see this?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc is dying in premarket. I wanted to by puts Friday at close but didn't have any cash available :(
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"we all want the same thing here guys, so its time to leave amc and get in to GME

 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Watching AMC going down.  Looks like way more bids to asks to me. Like 10-1 to 40-1.   It appears someone trying to buy up all the bargain shares being produced by this thread.  But what do I know.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I vote yes
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yoikers, back to GME!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc the sinking ship.

Hope everyone put's there money into gme to make a profit"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold AMC, now all in GME lets go.

 🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀 

Back in AMC after votes"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you guys feel the walking dead extended season will affect the stock price?  Today was a major cliffhanger episode, has me worried people might be upset"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So did everyone vote no? I’m late to the party.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently it wasn't too late for AMC puts. Went in deep, looking good so far."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Voted no on dilution
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Boys AMC tanking real hard already, it’s obvious why, stop being delusional and fight for GME so apes can catapult each other to mars already. AMC never gonna happen. At this point I believe ppl telling you to hold AMC are the actual shills"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,yes or no?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted against dilution!!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck I live in Leawood I’m gonna go represent the sub.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,And nostalgic films from our childhood like backdoor sluts 9
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed 100%
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn if that ain’t a sign I don’t know what is.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey. I'm looking at this and it's just not adding up. I need someone to clarify this for me or I can't go all in on this. The last result that immediately pops up on google is from the 26th of February, and it says that 26% of available shares are shorted. But when I did some digging and went to another website, I found an entry from the 19th of March 2021. Only 8.9% is currently shorted. 

Is this squeeze built on a house of cards?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope.

I'm absolutely committed to gme and believe in the business direction and that shorts r fuk. 

I have been warning against amc for *months*. I've been insulted, called a shill and spammed with more bots than you can imagine.

I've had people stalk my account, spam my other comments and ... reply to the wrong comment. How much more blatant could a paid commenter be at proving their malicious intent, than by clicking on the wrong comment in my history and pasting the wrong reply to it?

I'm absolutely convinced that amc is being *promoted by* shills. Not criticised by."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that they have new movies. Not the old shit. Get Galactus out here.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, just wish their board wasn't as greedy 😪"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,not with a mask on my friend
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought twins...the way they move.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a meme momentum stock that isn't relying on fundamentals, which are trash. The fact that the company is trying to sell out investors and people are still yelling how unsinkable the Titanic is as it is sinking is truly embarrassing. Step back. Build a case either way and figure out what you believe without your confirmation bias."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The squeeze can still be sqozen. 

That being said I have puts. Cheering for you holders but things looking grim."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,bro amc is literally driving itself into the ground 🤣🤣 i’ll buy puts when GME prints
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I can correlate my losses with idiots going into amc and not gme. Why? Because every shill absolutely pAMPS the fuck out of this stock and insists that the stocks are the same.

There was only ever one gme and it's gme.

What unaccounted short interest in amc? THEY. DILUTED. SHARES. FOR. 450M DOOLAHS.

THAT MEANS SHORTS COULD COVER.

That was also the 4th time they diluted the shares by the way... the 4th time in 12 months.

Now, they're proposing to do it again."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,450M
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It is possible 500 million new shares being created could be to make space for an amazon or netflix acquisition. That would still be good for us but that's entirely rumor and speculation so I still voted no. We need the shares in our ape hands right now
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,this guy gets it
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Never underestimate the institutions and hedgies who hold up to 70% of the shares and therefore have a large say in the voting outcome.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No no shares fuck at that noise
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is embarrassing, My "" TiN FOil Hat"" confirmation is BS. Get out before this clown and let him hold your bag. Friday AH was the signal and this week is going to be brutal, but down vote me to hell for being the voice of reason."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,pretty sure I can knock together something similar looking from stuff from Harbor Freight. You should give me your money instead.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking shill diamond hands are jewelry
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don't wanna spend the extra cash, Amazon has a great knockoff for the bracelet!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do not bail. Worse case scenario: shares are diluted, Amazon or Netflix buy the controlling majority and it stabilizes at 20.00 thats the reason AMC want to divide the shares. It ensures a bigger company will foot the bills of the debt."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc isn't concerned about your imaginary 10000% gain. They need to raise money to stay afloat or your shares will be worthless regardless.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Purple, it is underused and underappreciated.  It needs more exposure."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,White. Make em work for it. 😆
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Enjoy your bags mi amigo. You have earned them. If you ever return to investing, I hope you realize not everyone is out to get you or is a conspiracy and some are genuinely trying to help who have been there before. Those bags get heavy"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is that pushing people away from gme?

Do you really have to hate yourself so much as a personality trait?

""*yeah, fuck those guys trying to explain to me the risks of my investment and how their investment is less risky in the long run, God dam shills*"""
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">you’re only pushing more people away.

Then it's working..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the stock 

💎👐"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Regardless of if you were given a share for referral bonuses you were given a share it is up to the brokerage to prove to the sec that the share is legitimate
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,no one REALLY knows what the short intrest is at the moment. all we can go off of is weeks old data which could be irrelivent by now. so that is what the fuck is going on.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here's a piece of info. Hedge Funds are not required to share their short positions.

Brokers share data bi-monthly, but even that is finicky. There is currently no reason to supply accurate data on shorts. They use to announce their short positions because that would drive the price down even more. ie, the more money they make. Even if brokers decided not to share the data, the fines would be less than their friends stand to lose. ie, why the hell share the data that is going to cause them a headache.

&#x200B;

Trying to squeeze now is more a gamble than ever. Ask yourself, do you think they covered?  Ask yourself why the CEO bought more shares. Somethings about to happen, and its in your favor."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They can also take other routes to short a stock in an untraceable fashion, such put options"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They hide the shorts in synthetics.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME was well over 100% and didn't go to the moon, but here we are trying to convince new idiots that every stock is going to the moon. The institutions with their billions of dollars won when it came to GME and it going to moon, but here you are talking about AMC like it would ever do the same. It's truly laughable."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC as the most held stock tells you enough. For every synthetic shares, someone is sitting on the other side. One has to assume most retails are long so who have the shorts? Bingo. You got the picture."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Were all friends here :)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It depends if you have the courage to move your price point up. Be careful on this sub Reddit. Lots of Hedgies and Gme bag holders just talking smack or manipulating minds to get AMC apes out of AMC. It’s a financial war and bag holders are obviously desperate as well as Hedgies: AMC army stay strong .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you squeeze a stock with like 500 million shares outstanding that’s up like 300+% already?!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if we hodlll
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Dale, why don’t you ask your wife’s boyfriend?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Hard
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Amc is going to pennystocks fast
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It already did. This ship has sailed with a bunch of uninformed apes showing up late to the party being like why didn't it moon?! You have nobody to blame besides your own lack of research and honestly I can't wait until you all fuck off and let us get back to making money without having to spoon feed basic fundamentals to you. But sure we are ALL SHILLS. Look past your own bias and do your own DD.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are you fucked? Nothing has changed, this is old news and the squeeze has yet to squoze. AMC to the moon"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll be fine. Squeeze out no squeeze AMC will hit thirty sometime.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,$17.25 here my brutha. Kinda thinking about investing in KY Jelly now.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are.  Why haven’t you averaged down

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Competitive landscape.  AMC only needs to exist.  GME needs to innovate to gain market share.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,No more dips. No more . Fight to hold and go higher
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"The company is holding a vote of shareholders over whether or not to add 500,000,000 shares to the float, some board positions, and a company accountant. Adding that many shares will just about double the total number of shares iirc"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,There is only a dip of you let the dip happen. I’m moving my average up tommorow. This is a fight with the Hedgies for 15. Going to buy quite a bit. I’m confident if we stay United and not sell we will push to 20 This month.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is two days old... would be nice if AMC got some mod love instead of just GME.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't understand why some people here bother so much about what the others are holding or buying. This kind of effort to talk people into selling is very suspicious to me.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Your in the negotiation stage of loss
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course it isn't.

But this isn't wallstreetbootlicking, it's wallstreetbets"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll post a pic of your mom
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"My understanding was he transferred 750K shares to his children.

I'm wondering why?  My guess is so his family has shares that aren't locked out when it moons.

Edit:  Yep, it's right there at the bottom of the report.  Transferred to his 2 children.

Daddy going to moon it for them?  Thinking he is...

Hold on to yer a$$es, s\*\*t's about to get real!"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine cherry picking data.

I’ll leave the part he left out here for you all to decide if this is bullish or bearish if the ceo 

“This transaction represents a gift from the Reporting Person of 250,000 AMC shares to each of his two adult sons, both of whom are living outside his residence. The Reporting Person currently owns more than 1.2 million AMC shares. He previously has been granted more than 3.4 million additional AMC shares assuming he remains employed at AMC Entertainment and that certain performance goals are achieved at target (the granted amounts can be increased or decreased based on actual performance), and which vest over the coming 34 months.”

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not much apparently
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off shill
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Naw it's a vote to allow
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way

Have also

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to do a lot more DD, there are conflicting reports issues from institutions so you won’t get accurate data across the board.  There is also a huge net of misinformation and silencing of mainstream media about this issue.

Good luck and open your mind.  Don’t stop here or at google but also read between the lines"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Call me an optimist (or just stupid) but today the number of people vaccinated is the same of people infected with COVID. I suspect in a couple of months the number of people vaccinated + people that acquired some level of immunity because they already had it will be very close to herd immunity.   But remember I am always super optimist (or super stupid)
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I stepped back and I see hedge funds over extended themselves in shorting gme/amc and because of Covid-19 these companies stock are on sale so no matter what tactics they use or how low the price goes we can all just hold until the first good earnings report after the world opens back up.  If dilution in May lowers the price we buy more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s so much shit people r saying “why would Aaron who just got millions of shares and some other higher ups, then dilute the stock” the other is “they’re not dilute the stock it’s just a vote out so they can get a count of the real shares out there vs syn and call out Hedgies. I’ll see how I feel once APRIL 20 Roles a few around and move from there..."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm bias toward the stocks I like tell me why I shouldn't like amc!!! 😃
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the squeeze to happen it is going to take MASSIVE upward pressure, which isn't happening. Look at Friday, it moved right because the volume wasn't there. People have to buy the stock which isn't happening. This is like a pyramid scheme that has run out of huns.

It would have to rely on a gamma squeeze which isn't happening because the price is stagnating. A gamma squeeze, and thus a short squeeze, relies on huge upward pressure that forces the price upward, but that isn't happening. This shit is basic. Help yourself by GTFO of this dead beat stock. If this means something to you long term, get out and buy back that it is now collapsing and hold for 10+ years, but I suspect a darts throw at the board would have better returns than this stock. People laugh at 10 year bonds, but watch these clowns hold bags for that long and make less. I'm here for that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I went in equal on gme and amc. Their destiny’s have been tied since the start. One hand washes the other. It’s like attacking from multiple fronts where the enemy is weak rather than the place they expect you. Don’t blame the people investing in amc/gme blame the people bold enough to keep doubling down their shorts because they think their untouchable with their influence in the media and ties to the government.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,When do you think it could reach this price? I’ve been holding for 3 weeks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Up 420.69% in the last 3 months. 

You’re right, those bags of cash do get heavy bro."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If AMC is the most held stock, the short is so huge.. Because in order to create synthetic, one side long, the other side has to be short"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. Should I buy into this at all? Here’s my best idea to minimize risk:

Find every estimate of the short ratio the last 5 days. Then plot them on a bell curve. If it’s a normal distribution (if it’s not I’m fucking out) look at the middle 50% of data points and assume that’s pretty close to reality. Then make a decision from there."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Squeeze harder?

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, I'm quite a few drinks deep and fed up with all of this bullshit. This shit is just embarrassing.

I went all in on the first buy"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So go all in!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"They also need to make enough money to pay off their billions in debt (they can issue shares, or ya’all can get off Reddit and go see a movie)"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a strange line of reasoning. AMC only needs to exist to justify this share price? Pretty sure the same argument could have been made for blockbuster and any other now defunct business. Every business on earth needs to continue innovating and building or else they die. Sure there may be next to no competition right now, but if the profit margins are there a competitor can spring up out of nowhere and then what, they're just fucked?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Its horse shit

Literally. I can facetime you, zoom... whatever. Give you a full fucking peek into my boring and bleak life.

Whatever it takes for people to see writing on the wall for what it is.

Edit: this comment had 7 upvotes earlier and now 0. Yeah aight, and I'm the sus one."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, now you've actually switched accounts. Great job."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, I'm balls deep in GME and have not been paying attention to AMC. There are bots on the GME megathread doing the exact same thing and forgetting to switch accounts.

This clown is buying more/ gifting his children stock because in 10+ years it will be a good deal and his job depends on it. For the rest of us, we are trying to make money now and see little positives in them fucking us over to stay afloat, but sure hold those bags for 5+ years if you need to be a part of the ""DiAMoND HaNDS"" who get slaughtered or were we not  supposed to say the quiet part out loud."

This isn't like ""of hey this company will do crazy because they are opening up soon"". That's laughable. Look at the fundamentals. They have diluted their stock countless times to stay afloat and the current price is 3x pre- Covid. Where is the value? This company is actively trying to screw over us apes to just stay solvent and people here are like ""I Can't Re@d, I HoDl"" and are going to be surprised when it collapses.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL got me. Still a smooth brained ape though
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh my god, I think I love you"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can believe whatever you wish. Amazon. Bezos wants AMC for many reasons. It’s not rumor and I know this very well. Amazon executives have had numerous meetings with AMC executives. Even if it doesn’t happen now. I believe eventually Amazon will own AMC. Unless a crazy squeeze happens. And I am not expecting that. I am confident AMC will get past 20 within a few week. Summer news, and 1st and 2nf qtr results will keep AMC in the news and keep people investing for months to come. I’m AMC “long” longer then ...."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,My personal opinion. If we all keep holding and raise our price point just a little. Within two weeks it’s possible to hit 20.00... also it’s possible to hit it much sooner. We are going to hit resistance at 14.00 and 20.00 if we can push through those two walls. Then truly AMC will pop!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are **you** up by that? Because there are a LOT of people who are still **down** on this stock.

Also, there are a lot of people who sold at 20, 15, 10 and 5... and rolled it into GME when it was at 40 and *wow*, even the people who bought in at 20 and sold at 5 to buy GME... are **all in the green again**.

Funny that."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it also popped up to 19$+. We aren't talking about fundamentals. We are taking about a meme stock that has run out of trading volume. Unfortunately, the stimulus pop didn't happen because it was all priced in. The last pop was 30% less than the last. I would assume the same for the future as people lose interest in this stock. They are actively bending you over and you are asking for another. 🤡🤡"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you already had shares in this company I would sell them or sell calls depending on how long you are trying to hold them. The premiums aren't huge, but they are something. I would avoid it until prices consolidate at lower levels that reflect fundamentals. Otherwise, it's a lottery pick where the odds aren't in your favor because it already popped at ATHs and then popped 30% lowers. Nobody cares about a pop that is 30% lower than that as momentum shifts, which is why it traded to the right on Friday before falling off a cliff."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, what?

No please...

**do explain** your thesis?

I am absolutely curious to see what your understanding is."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They might not get the votes and that doesn’t take place until May. Also the reason they are doing it is that Amazon and Netflix want to own amc. And control the board. Obviously they don’t want to pay over 20 per share for control.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Voting on whether to have the option to add those shares, not to actually add them.

In the process they'll know who the owners are. And how many shorts there actually are, because guess what, no one knows.

The CEO just bought a bunch of shares and gifted some to his son's. Do you really think he's looking to drop the value of his bank account now that the theaters are opening again?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude this is wsb I risk going to take a piss I might miss gains or see losses. No one is here to save money it’s yachts or food stamps. People don’t care on here lol. It’s like beating a dead horse.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s not the question, you as a share holder want your shares to hold the most value no? And issuing more shares every chance they get does the opposite of that. 

Go watch a YouTube video or something seriously."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol

It’s right in front of you and not in front of you.

If it doesn’t make sense, does it make sense that it doesn’t make sense?

We are talking about institutions here that cannot agree on these numbers.  Brokers and clearing houses are not reporting the same numbers... meaning someone is fixing them... or not reporting them properly on purpose.

Which takes us full circle as to why there are phantom shares... and over shorting/ naked shorting... 

Welcome to the rabbit hole, hang on...."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not worrying me it’s pretty clear what’s going on. I already have my play set up. 1500k AMC makes a movie as it reaches its peak slowly before the vote results are our in...I got 200 in that other one that’s been doing shit lately to Gameplop or something..they r due for a run. Little shift of AMC to GME I’m on a timed dip (prob anytime tomorrow or tuesday)and boom ....the RC nut fluffer band takes me to my destination...I moon either way, likely twice ....don’t be mad....bc when I get back...Aamc will be on a dip too I sure if it....u know the rules."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like AMC and GME should merge to create a network of entertainment and gaming spots for everyone.  A new term ""gamtertainment"" will be created.  They should also create a robotaxi service to drive under 18 people to and from these gamtertainment hubs."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"A. They currently aren't that.

B. There are currently no plans for them to try and do that.

Why is everyone throwing money at this stock again?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Any credible evidence beyond hearsay or rumors about a possible buyout? I haven't seen any.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, are you directly employed as a shill?

I'm really curious at what's gonna happen to you guys when AMC and GME moons.

Do you have a back up plan or employment or is this something you do in your off time?

If you're actually working in one of these hedge funds, will you be protected when they go under?"

No joke. I also have worked at Amazon for 8 years now. Bezos wants AMC. You don’t have to believe me. I’m just telling you a fact. He was going to buy it a year ago then it tanked lower then he thought it would. As he waited to buy it. A miracle happened. He then want to buy Regal. Regal told us to pound sand. 

I could go on for an hour. I don’t have time. I’m doing homework on my next kill.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rey, I’ve answered this literally 3 dozen times the past two days. look it up. 

Rey... I’ve worked for Amazon for 8 years. Regal told Bezos to pound sand. Bezos wants Amazon and when AMC sank last year he waited because he thought it might go bankrupt then he could scoop it up. A miracle happened and now amc is going to dilute shares. Price will lower and he’ll probably make an offer. 

Now the rumor is Netflix wants in as well. That’s the rumor. 

Amazon wanting amc is not rumor brother.... you don’t have to believe me. Bezos wants amc. Think about it .. can get it cheap and distribute content in his own theatres and get premium price for it. 

I love it how people always say... I’ll stream it.... yeah it cost a fortune for Netflix, Amazon, etc to produce content. Bezos wants the content to pay for itself"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It's gonna take a lot of growth to recover from this dilution.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve purchased enough shares to make us comfortable if it moons but not worried if it doesn’t.  Both amc and gme will be forever changed after this, these stocks will be meme stocks 4ever but will be great growth stocks.  Boomers are just so tunnel visioned right now, you are witnessing history.

I have averaged all estimates dating back to late last year."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about the industry not the stock.  And its people like you that cause people like me who try to address the negatives about the stock to get downvoted so hard.  This doesn't have to be a war.  I get the argument about dilution and im very worried about it but to say the theater industry is going to fail is ridiculous.  Amc might fail but there are other chains.  Theaters and studios have been around a long time and have gone almost bankrupt many times.  History repeats itself.  And honestly the way people talk about the ceo on here, yeah he's a scumbag, but that has nothing to do with squeeze potential.  It's just as emotional as all the amcers who don't want to acknowledge the dilution.  

Also gme tanked pretty hard too.  I have both and I'm not happy with either right now.

Edit: I wanted to add a controversial opinion.  Amc and other theater chains don't need to innovate.  3d, 360 movies, smell o vision these are all gimmicks to put butts back in seats but they didn't bring back audiences.  The films did.  You know why April 2019 was the last peak in amc performance?  It was because it was the end of the avengers.  Excitement over movies comes and goes but at the end of the day what matters is the movie, not the innovation.  The argument that streaming will kill the theater industry is the same as tv would kill the theater industry.  It's just not going to happen.  There are plenty of people who like going to the theaters for the experience.  Theaters are not the same as gamestop.  Gamestop has to innovate to compete with things like steam, uplay, battle net, epic, and origin.  I think their vision is interesting but we have yet to see if it works.  Honestly, I think the most important thing gamestop can have going for it is exclusives that come with titles.  That's the only thing that kept it afloat all this time."

Call me a shill or bot or whatever, but honestly, AMC is a turd and it's clear that management and execs are trying to cash in on everyone's stupidity. This upcoming vote should should scare the fuck out of every current shareholder. If I held any AMC shares, my market sell would be in before 9:30am tomorrow morning. Straight up, if GME pulls this shit at earnings, I'm cashing the fuck out asafp. It's VERY clear that higher ups in AMC don't give a shit about YOU."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I never thought going to the movies was cheap.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, all my research has resulted in zip, zilch, and nada, regarding any substantial evidence that AMC is getting bought out any time soon. If you have actual open source evidence, then post it as a DD and put the rumors and FUD to bed. Otherwise, I don't believe you.

Either way, I'm in as long as the price keeps going up. As soon as it starts tanking, my trailing stop loss will kick in and I'll be out. I made my profits and I'm moving onto my more serious plays that I'm actually bullish on in the long term."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Not necessarily for institutional investors who have millions and billions sunk into the company.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck, dude. I'm personally not that bullish on the movie business or movie theaters and made the AMC play in case of a short squeeze. That doesn't seem like it's going to happen now, so I'm bearish."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This article is from May of 2020 just like the last one. Show me evidence that isn't over a year old. Either way, I'm not bullish long term. Best of luck, I hope you make your tendies."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like a small bump is big when it occurs over thousands of shares and/or you have significant holdings within the company and want to get paid over a number of years. The big funds investing in AMC are playing a different game than we are, unless you are bullish on AMC over a much longer term than the next year or two. I am not."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Still, I don't think it's right to contribute to the FUD. We gotta stick together in this.

I have another stock that is slowly and quietly being muttered... It’s at its 52week low now, and has better fundamentals then any meme stock. Coivd crushed its industry"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly !!!! Yes both articles are old... yes and the talk about it has never stopped because the talks have never stopped. Lol. I told you I work at Amazon for 8 years In Seattle offices and now am split between two other locations. Lol. Ok you owe me an apology the day Amazon scoops up amc. The rumor is Netflix .
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, it is not, but...
This is the way😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Trey's Trades has a good breakdown of this on youtube
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I pulled out of amc and went all in gme. It made sense for myself.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are.  They’ll dilute the shit out of this and still continue to lose money

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm here to make money not to be an activist.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,That's only after they think about how to get as many bonuses to executives as possible.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. But you can't make one billion shares into two billion shares with a five hundred million share issuance cap.

I can't think of a single reason the company would ask shareholders to allow them to double shares OR why they would need to print a billion shares... Unless they want to open the ability to split.

Edit-Correction: dilution is the answer"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't think of a single reason? Not one? Not like... **diluting shares to raise capital**...

Like the **last 4 times they did it last year?**"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once I read the news about the bonuses and dilution, I decided that I needed to exit all AMC positions before mid April"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good call. I went and read up on their dilution history. Yikes. This is way more plausible. 100m shares in 2019 up to 450m now and raising the ceiling from 500m to 1b...they are as you point out just raising their dilution ceiling, and fast.

I 450% recind my split theory. And fully buy your dilution prediction."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,wow that is great. thank you for posting that.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, I'm not saying investing is better than trading or anything like that. I'm just saying if you're trading, especially with 250k of trading volume (in some unidentified time period), Robinhood is costing you shittons of money. Every time you make a trade, you lose money compared to the price you would've paid with a normal broker with comissions."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"You interested me enough to find out exactly what the fees are. So, before, i thought that the fees were relatively insignificant. Upon researching i have learned that they are actually non-existent for options trading on robinhood. Robinhood does not charge any fee whatsoever ever on options trading. Perhaps you should consider moving to robinhood?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you should research a platform before you decide to become a customer (or just follow the news). Robinhood sells order flows, which means when you set a buy order at $25 dollars, Robinhood passes that information to others who can then buy in a few cents lower and then sell it to you. There's been research into the actual costs of payment for orderflow, and the outcome was that users with Robinhood pay more than users of platforms that charge regular fees. Robinhood was even fined heavily for misleading users this way: https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2020-321"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t care for dividend personally but I got in on RKT when the meme began and was in for 1000 in shares at 22 and sold it all at 35. I’ll take a dividend if my stocks not up but if it’s up 50% I’m out with my profits and leaving in my initial investment if I like the stock. I don’t like RKT as much as I like MSFT, WMT, AMZN, BAC, JPM, or COST which is where I prefer to keep my money until a play becomes available. UWMC is a company I know very little about but this move is just based on a few simple things for me and it is something I’m in for about 12k in stock and another 8k in options expiring 2023 ITM so nothing extreme or short timed. The stock is giving a 4.5% dividend at the current price, analyst have it at the low end 10.50 per share, the earnings have been good, the largest shareholder sold none when the stock reached an ath and the stock at anything below current price means higher return on dividend which is a value investors wet dream. If the stock hits 10 I’ll sell all of the options and take my profits to safer long term companies however since this is stock at below $10 I’ll likely keep my initial investment there and hold a 700-800 shares until I see a dip in one of the blue chips."

Again I'm a retard lol. Like say u physically bought 100 shares yourself at like 100 a share and set up a call option at 800. Say it closes at 805 or someone executes the option. Wouldn't u technically only have to sell them those 100 shares at 800 so no matter what ur up money."

In this specific case there is a loser (the shorts) on the other end of a trade.

LOL - I'm sure they will change their tune when they need cash.  

Listen; I'm not saying I agree when the Fed comes to the rescue of companies taking risky bets.  Sometime it's a necessity (08 bailout when liquidity went tit's up).  My point was that there is ample precedence for Fed intervention in the event of a moon shot that runs the risk of contagion.  

It can't hurt to review those examples, understand how that may come to play and have an appropriate plan in place to protect your assets.  DFV has taken enough profit to safe his family's future.  I see too many people here Yolo-ing money they can't afford to loose gambling on 10k --> 2m a share because some ape made a chart with a triangle....

If the fed get's involved it's game over.  Personally, I think that's some where in the 2k-->10k range.  I'm not long anymore on GME but I'd dame sure have some limit sales in place on the ride up."

Like I said before if I bought 100 shares @100 long time ago and set up the option with those 100 shares of my own so covered I wouldn't technically be lose any money right? Or do u have to buy the 100 again at 800 to cover that call even if u already have 100 shares? 

Like it seems to be if no matter what the option maker will never lose profit if people are paying the premium for 800c. Like as long as you covered it you still be up a shit ton of money right? Cus u be making 700 bucks per share and the premium on top. Or I'm a missing something."

It has the best UI and the other apps do the same thing as RH. They are also most likely to be positioning to help us if it happens again. I have a backup account elsewhere too just in case I’m wrong."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would they be positioning to help us?

I think Robinhood should be held accountable for what they've done. We'd already be on the moon by now if it weren't for them. A lot of us lost money due to them stopping buy orders specifically for our stocks.

Nobody wants to see people using Robinhood anymore."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a shallow summary of the situation that doesn’t accurately reflect things, IMO. RH got swamped with more buy orders than they could afford because we showed up in such huge numbers immediately, if they didn’t come up with the money they’d have been forced to freeze everything and it would have been worse. It very clearly looks like shitadel forced their hand in halting only buys in exchange for the money to meet the new capital requirements we accidentally forced on them. 

The market makers hate RH and want to turn the retail traders into more pawns for their rigged game. RH stands to profit more if we win and keep doing what we have been doing to disrupt hedgies. They threw RH under the bus and want us to jump on board and I’m not having it until and unless RH does something to screw us without external forces on their hand."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't buy RH's excuses. If it was really about that, they could've temporarily disabled margin trading or a number of other things. Anything but killing our rockets last month. Instead that's what they specifically did to us, and with the insult of ""protecting you from yourself"".

Why do market makers hate RH? How would we be used in their ""rigged game""? How does RH profit more if we win?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t buy their excuses either, looks like blackmail from Shitadel no matter what Vlad is saying. I have eyes. I also follow politics so I understand the existing regulations. The SEC should have had RHs back and used their powers on the hedgies but instead they allowed it. That sentiment seems to be shifting based on the House Financial Committee hearings and the tide seems to be shifting in our favor."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember losing 23% on an apple call one day when the stock was up .58%. Needs to be 3% to get a real boost.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would people not like to hear that a bull market is over? Again, do you sincerely believe that you can only make money when the market go up? Why would I be mad about a bubble that is definitely coming? What is stopping me from shorting massively and doubling my money? 

This of course because for you, making money when the markets go down is probably a foreign concept - since the way you talk about “taking out money cause of the impending bear”. You can make money if the markets go up, down, left and right. If you are seriously THIS sure about a bubble- as I said, post your short position. Other wise your opinion is basically a fart in the wind. 

“People” don’t like to hear that bull run is over because “people” are you, that have 401k where the most riskiest stock in your index is Apple. Gamblers don’t care if it’s bull or bear- volatility is what doubles your money- no matter which way."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. It depends on the IV most of the time. You could even lose even if it gains 6% if an IV crunch secures your profits. 

Although I highly doubt apple doing 6% would make for a loss, but generally it is possible. A .58% apple uptick is good enough for profit on a 3 month call 80% of the time. Won’t get you much- maybe 5% but it is there."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t play with shorting as that’s outside my risk tolerance. Furthermore, I’m actually willing to accept that I might be wrong, unlike some...

You also assume I’m referring to just a bear market. Not dangerous inflation, rash and idiotic decisions from the fed to keep the plate spinning, etc. We’re in uncharted territory here and I see a lot of people I consider more savvy than I, recognizing this potential and acting accordingly. If you weren’t blinded by the salt in your eyes you’d recognize that the repositioning is TO MAKE MONEY IN A DOWNTURN AND PROTECT WEALTH. 

And the labeling and pigeonholing, that Is so common today by the intellectually deficient that can’t structure a defensive argument, further supports my initial reaction of not feeling compelled to defend my position to you.

Stay mad."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Markets going down. YES or NO? 

If yes, why arnt  you shorting it? If no, what was the point of the conversation? 

As I said again, you went from saying “bubble is imminent “ to “well it’s too risky for me to short”. These 2 statements are counter to eachother. Either you are unsure that a bubble is forming and therefore won’t short, or you are sure a bubble is forming and should have not a problem shorting."

I use an AMD in one of my home PC's, people act like they have zero problems between their CPU's / GPU's and it isn't true. Intel parts are so much easier to find when something needs to be fixed or upgraded / downgraded, AMD is very limited."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm talking about AMD CPU's not servers.. The reason most corporations don't use AMD CPU's is because programs either don't run on AMD at all or are buggy to hell. 

Source: Tried using them at my old job."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,They released the F series that have fewer cores exactly for the per core pricing. They reach higher frequencies and get 90% of the performance of double the cores part.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Youre talking IOMMU groups now yet you made such a terrible post. Wow.
What about constant security vulnerabilities of recent Intel silicon when running multiple processes?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMD CPUS run the same exact instruction set. If they didnt, it wouldnt be possible to run the same os on AMD as it does on Intel. This is due to the architectural differences. Examples of architectures are ARM, MIPS, x86_64, and RISC-V. These architectures use different patterns of bytes for it.

Saying Servers makes more sense, CPUs are hardware, and the hardware runs the same software (Windows, Linux) and thus are able to execute the same code. I think you meant the whole computer is buggy at your work. NOT the CPU. CPUs are significantly different than the whole machine. I worked IT, and am a CS major. I had to study Assembler (Machine Code), and Architecture, which went over the way CPUs logic gates works. Because the code uses the same instructions, there is no way they are not compatible with Intel Code. You can say the performance may be low. But saying the code is incompatible is incorrect.

Anyway, the machines you use at work chances are older AMD Sempron models, which are Single Core machines. These single core machines can be extremely slow as these chips are scrapped from the bottom of the barrel."

But I do have one question/comment'. You assume all of the GME holders are willing and want to lend out shares for shorting, OK at face value they earn some interest no harm no foul. But as these holders know these are predatory shorters trying ultimately to bankrupt GME, probably off the table now Cohen stepped in, but they are still trying to drive the price very low at worse.

&#x200B;

Why would I as a share owner enable somebody to ultimately devalue my holding substantially? Now in the case of Citadel as a MM I can get, that as these guys are clearly market manipulators at this stage that's obvious (also stating the obvious!) I also do agree it could be dumb retail holders buying on margin and therefore allow share loaning.

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most institutional lenders(pension plans, mutual funds insurance cos and sovereign wealth funds) do not specify whether to lend any individual stock. They either participate in securities lending on the whole portfolio or they don’t. ETF families are some of the largest lenders of stock as that income can materially offset fees and increase returns. Individuals are the most active in decisions not to lend their stock. That said most people dont realize they may be lending their shares already."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agree any lender can refuse to lend their stock.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"I generally agree it’s normal practice to lend “en masse”‘so to speak but they do have the ability to restrict lending if they wish on individual security and in this case it would seem counter intuitive not too given the unique circumstances. Most shorting is done for marginal gains this is not that.

I do believe many folks on these subs continue to be oblivious their shares are being lent."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice! All the better of a story :D
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok you win
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hang in there bro. You broke even. We got you. We'll help you find another one. Or we'll all go broke. Either way, take a breath, relax, unclench that ape jaw. Talk to someone if you need to. The sun is gonna rise tomorrow, and you'll get through it. Unrealized gains are unrealized. Stock market is the craziest casino in the world. In my opinion breaking even is a win. Get some sleep, we gotta do some work tomorrow."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,you've never felt pain if you think letting these institutions just disappear one day is the correct way to manage an economy. we have an easy alternative solution to this: just don't let them get that big. we've fucking done it a thousand times before. we just stopped doing it. we already have the laws on the books for christ's sake
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,a bail out means compensating the executives. there's nothing stopping the government from taking over and letting things fail gracefully
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's ok, your brain may be smooth, but it's not ""I don't know the difference between selling a stonk and a distribution from an IRA"" smooth."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,">nowhere did I say I owed anybody more money....

Nor did I? Buddy get your head straight.

>ALL my bills are paid, what I said was that my savings is gone....

Yes, and I'm advising you to restore your savings before gambling it, idiot. Failure to do that is ""making poor financial decisions"", which is what I said originally. Nothing about owing anyone more money or whatever shit you think you read.

God you're such a moron. Keep giving me your money when I sell you your FDs. You're feeding the hedgefunds too that you seem to hate so much lol.

Loser."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes you did... you claimed I need the money elsewhere... ELSEWHERE is taken care of you illiterate shill!

PISS OFF SHILL!"

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GM bagholder checking in.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve literally only picked the losers of all these posts 🤗
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,GM APES TOGETHER STRONG MUST HODL 💎 🙌
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Just bought the GM dip. God help us
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"After seeing everything i buy calls for fall, I might be better off buying puts on things i like. I'm looking at you GM... 🙄"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me: Well ya know I'm pretty bad at investing if I do say so myself. Oh look a person who does good content. This will go well

GM enters chat"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I should have held to my normal strategy of no moves until 10. Then I'd be much happier about the GM calls I bought.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Up 32% on GM, are we bagholding?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm with you brodie on the gm. 80$ 6/18 first time playing boomer stock 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,FWIW you weren’t completely off on GM.  I waited for the dip around 1030 and the weekly 58c still hit 30-40% which is not nothing.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the options play on Docu?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"PTON - calls or puts?

I wish I bought puts when it was at 150.
That Amazing growth won’t happen in 2021 when people go back to work and use their normal gym.

However they may still get a lot of reoccurring revenues.  The drop from 150 to 100 was the play."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Praying for you to get rich cuz it means I’ll break even lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Was the plan not to buy it this morning? Thought the pump wasn’t until later today

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agrred and calls!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, I hope you break even! Breaking even is a good feeling sometimes"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought Friday at close as Mondays are generally green-ish. Regardless I was not expecting such a massive nosedive to hell
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, same plays."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool I’m with ya
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, yeah I’m not confident of calls or puts at this price range."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. When I see the weekend post the last couple of weeks I see big green gains Monday and realize I'm a weekend difference behind the whale. I jumped on GM friday thinking haha gottem. Just kidding they got me again.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,BRUH! I'd be crying if this wasn't so funny 😂 😂 😂
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO THE FUCKING T2 INVERSE CURSE!!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is great DD. As someone who's used Pinterest at least once a week for about 10 years, I agree with most of it. 

I'd say they need to optimize their ad sales better though. They're great at content curation through e-mail and notifications, but their matching of ads to their target audience needs a lot of improvement (for example, I keep getting cheap China-made plastic cleaning crap as ads, where they'd get better success targeting me with companies like Sephora, Net-a-porter, luxury food stores etc).

Basically the opposite of Etsy, where the ads are highly targeted to your searches, but the content curation is horrible. I'm happy opening the Pinterest emails, whereas the Etsy ones go straight in the trash.

There's also a fine balance with ads to ""real"" content, that can drive people off the platform if not executed correctly.

But I think the growth potential in new customers is huge. I use Pinterest more than google, especially when looking for recipes, home decor, beauty products, clothing, jewelry, art inspo, travel ideas etc. If you like to get your ideas in curated picture form, this is it.

Also, I think you might be discounting the Pinterest scroll. For me at least, I'm way more likely to get stuck there than on Instagram or Facebook."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good fucking write up. Makes me more stoked to buy more.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,All I know is I’m going to buy and watch.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Electric planes are probably BS.

https://youtu.be/dMmaG_3NnGs

It just doesn't make sense from a power/weight ratio."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added /u/NrdRage as an approved submitter. Hey OP, mention any crypto, SPACs, or stocks under the market cap lower bound (1 billion) and this will be revoked."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Which makes it an even better buy now!
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the batteries have to get A LOT lighter weight wise for this to be practical. Hybrid makes more sense near future. A lot of aero companies are testing the waters but the fact is it's a way out. Now drone taxies.. that's more practical use that would be feasible in more near term.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever, I still think it's a selling point."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the DD. I like the company, I'm holding for the company. If the squeeze happens, great. If it doesn't, I'll still get my money back as I've got in at around $5."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please tell me then where you’re talking about that’s paying 60k at a ruby Tuesdays. Let’s get right to the point. Cause you’re full of shit. Of 558 locations 43 are not in the USA. So the odds of you living near one and not the the USA are pretty bad; not impossible but prettyyyyy bad. Again back to the point the USA is not the world, neither is one restaurant, and your info is shit to top it off. Sure you can find me a job posting if I’m wrong one across the country must be looking for a manager"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,So I will do this : instead of options I will buy the stock. I don’t know about you but I don’t give a fuck. I am not your fucking financial adviser. 💎🙌🚀🌒🚀🌗

But if you’re not comfortable don’t fuck with options haha"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk im kinda an options guy 🤷‍♀️, but people should do what they want with their own money."

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Close, but it closed at $200.27."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"right, it closed at that but ended AH at 199. you're right."
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao where do you get that metric they’ve crunched the numbers etoro alone has about 10 percent of the float. The float is way to big and the volumes not there for a squeeze
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to do some better DD. I suggest buying a subscription to Fintel or Whalewisdom.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,As do you! what makes you think a company with 400 million shares is squeezable? especially when they want to double it to 1 billion shares in a cash grab that throws there shareholders under the bus and stops the short squeeze.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,You're assuming that the quality of the business has a bearing on the stock price. This isn't a reality in this market unfortunately
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m long term pltr. Not a wsb play.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. And yet here we are. In the wsb sub. Weird
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,It has no reason to adjust.... would’ve adjusted on the day after the ex dividend date. Option chains already have been adjusted
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this stcock

03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Myth? [It's been documented](https://youtu.be/qtkaMx12otQ).
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Norbert gambit wit questrade is the way to go my friend.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just checking in. You “squeezing” today, bro? Looks like UWMC really “mooning” this morning 😂"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Only squeezed your moms titties today so far.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Carrey has gone nuts again.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a morbid pet fascination with Burning Man. Any colorful details of what he was like?
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wether they were armed with firearms doesn't change what literally occured, and what it is literally classified as. I'm not sure what you're arguing, that it could have been more violent? That they could have used an even less appropriate level of force?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What force?  They were let in a side door... the videos of the capitol police letting the protesters/rioters behind a barricade and then in a side door are all over YouTube.... the only legitimate use of force was a cop shooting an unarmed woman....
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I count myself lucky to have almost suffered big losses in options trading around 2 years ago.  Got lucky and exited breaking even after an unexpected market reversal.  Never touched derivatives since then and just traded stonks.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,/u/irishdud1 I just started transfering my shares and options from TDAmeritrade to Fidelity. I'm concerned that when the squeeze happens I'll get locked out of my account like last time. I probably should have waited till after this week though. whoops
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,This is honestly this years nio
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the brokerages and clearing houses file for bankruptcy wouldn't they be definition get bankruptcy protection? If that happens, who is going to pay the longs?"
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,I already imagine you sand blasting with your pops.
03/22/2021,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with that?
