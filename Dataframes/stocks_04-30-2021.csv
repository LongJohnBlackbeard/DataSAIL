2021-04-30 19:50:16,stocks,Geez....way to ruin a stock. Please stop talking about my stock picks here. I lose money most of the time they are mentioned.
2021-04-30 19:48:31,stocks,"I was in it and think it’s a great long hold. I compare them with Trane (TT) price. Carrier just broke from United Technology just over a year ago and should eventually become more like Trane. I’ll get back in it after I hit on AMC. Liquidated most all my holdings to go big with AMC. Not a financial advisor, just my opinion.  Good luck on your portfolio."

2021-04-30 19:00:09,stocks,I did find one which was When ACE insurance bought out CHUBB a few years ago. CHUBB was trading at $94. And the buyout was $123 per share.
2021-04-30 19:47:56,stocks,And I have Aerojet Rocketdyne right now which is getting bought by Lockheed. I suspect they will just buy us out of the shares as opposed to giving us shares of LHM but I don’t know.

2021-04-30 19:03:49,stocks,"Many major funds have a higher allocation of tech - some between 20-40% and that’s with a total market diversification. What is your rationale for 10% tech?

Also, what about consumer staples or energy/transportation?"

2021-04-30 19:29:38,stocks,"You're missing energy/materials that are both doing extremely well right now,  but they move similar to cyclical stocks where you're overweight so I guess it's alright. 

I think the theory is to periodically reballance so when your cyclical stocks run you would sell some and buy the cheap stuff like health care or defensive.   I don't sell much,  I put my paycheck contributions in whatever is light to attempt the same thing."
2021-04-30 19:06:29,stocks,"Tech seems low.  Consumer cyclical seems very high.

2021-04-30 18:35:55,stocks,"Yeah, actually it's funny, my individual picks were *too* defensive.  I was looking for companies that I figured would do well in all sorts of markets.  The problem was that I think I overestimated the chance of a big pullback, and I underestimated how much better index funds would do compared to my picks.

I sold the following: COST, FDP (Fresh Del Monte), NSRGY (Nestle), more mining stocks (NEM and GOLD), some energy companies with entries into renewables (NEE, EDPFY, IBDRY).  Also sold a ton of lower conviction tobacco plays (MO, JAPAY, TPB, SWMAY, UVV).   IDEXY - Inditex and SONY too.  I think that covers it.  Overall it was a small gain on my rotation out.

My portfolio was kind of all over the place and, though I did plenty of research, there was not much rhyme or reason to it.  Index funds just made more sense and since I love tobacco plays I think I found a nice niche for them with my current allocation.

Thanks for your kind words!"

They have an expiration date on them, he is bound to offload some of his contracts to offset that big taxation."
2021-04-30 18:08:52,stocks,Well I’ll give you a quick summary then. He has around 69 million option contracts around 0.35-0.85 expiring on 12/03/2021. He sold like   ~ 10 million so far to pay taxes so he still have a good chunk of options left. Lets see if he gonna pull a dfv or just die with the rest of the dinosaur
2021-04-30 18:16:21,stocks,"Could you explain what the possibilities are regarding his option contracts? As I understand, if he exercises the contracts before 12/3, he will buy the x amount of shares at a 0.35-0.85 price?"

2021-04-30 19:47:56,stocks,"I think there is a lot of status quo bias here. It is easy to see that Buffett has lost his edge because his fund is too big. Apple, et al, have similar issues, their next idea has too be huge or it does do enough to keep them on top, they must eat more snd more market share or implode with their growth focus, and a few bad ideas, or even no new good ideas could cause a cascading effect.

Will Google’s AI pay off huge, or forever be a few years away; will Facebook be on top of the next trend, or bring us the next beta max; will Amazon’s increasingly unreliable ratings, predatory practices snd poor public relations drive us to the millions of competitors that are here and/or coming - focussed on niche markets snd a better experience?

The problem with success is that it demands more success. Large utilities or telecoms have massive entry barriers, but disruptive tech is difficult in conception but the barrier to entry is lower everyday.

My kids are just as happy watching teenagers play with dolls on YouTube as they are watching cartoons; and YouTube is not necessary to that equation. 

I think it’s a good question, all technologies have at their core their own extinction; they push us further but there is always some aspect that is lacking. Have the big players become too large to pivot and too bureaucratic to innovate? 

For my money, I think Apple has. Phone sales (number of units) has fallen while prices rise, innovation has stalled, brand is waning as others catch up, and without something new to capture the imagine become a “dad” or “mom” product rather than cool.

But of course just my opinion, and I invest in broad market ETFs mostly, so what do I know? Probably not much."

Near term, this stock is likely to trade sideways for awhile based on the valuation. I don’t expect it to bear significant fruit for 1-2 years, and consider it a long term stock."

What if instead of missing they announce a completely blow out year? Lmfao

They grew revs 50% this year, without being well known or a big player in the public sector, and we have clowns like you saying 30% is optimistic. 

Based on the fact that they grew revs 50% ...IN A YEAR WITH A GLOBAL PANDEMIC AND LOTS OF COMPANIES LOSING MONEY..... I'd say it's more like that they blow the 30% out if the water rather than underperform."

The stuff I did read about the company sounded really cool and I found it interesting. And Karp seemed like a bit of a quack but also a breath of fresh air from many traditional CEO’s. Ultimately, the events that have transpired up until now had me sell at a loss - but that’s my fault. And I’m glad I got out because I was willing to wait for a bit, but I’m not interested in money I could be using to make more money sitting there bleeding slowly until things change. I still follow the stock, and I wish all the investors who held their position the best. But it’s not for me and that’s why I’m out."

Tesla has seen absurd growth within the past year whereas Palantir has seen nowhere near that meteoric rise. Moreover, Elon's compensation was tied to extremely aggressive growth milestones which he has miraculously met (in part due to sheer luck with the inflow of retail)  whereas Karp's package is grossly outsized relative to Palantir's revenue projections.

I firmly believe that an individual investor whether he made 1 million or not gets hurt alot more because that person doesnt have the tax shelters, or shell companies or other business tax advantages.

Additionally you penalize people for keeping their money in the market longer the whole benefit of capital gains for 1 year over scalpers and day traders. Also for day traders or swing traders the additional single digit increases are also very significant taxed as ordinary income."

2021-04-30 18:25:47,stocks,Totally agree. And...what I hate about this is they focus on capital gains. They penalize individuals for making more money but when you lose more money you arent afforded meaningful tax breaks or relief to reflect the fact that investors win and lose. Its capped too low. They should focus on loopholes that companies have rather than the indvidual investor.

Why even bother with earnings reports anymore? Just lower stock price 5-10% every four months and skip the fucking charade."
2021-04-30 16:32:56,stocks,"Personal income jumped 21% in a month...

Great ratings, ALL upgrades besides TWTR, which has the most potential for growth in the entire list."
2021-04-30 16:56:24,stocks,Amazon blows.  Get that shit out of here.  Not going to hit that price target or even $4000 this year.  I have never seen such a fragile stock in my life.  Shouldn’t be recommended to anyone at this point.
2021-04-30 17:38:47,stocks,"AMZN hit a new ATH earlier today before it slipped back down.  Its still trading 13% higher for the month, 43% higher for the year, and 462% higher for 5 years.

If you cherry pick your highs and lows, you can make any stock look bad.  If you look at the big picture however you can see that the stock is a winner."
2021-04-30 17:06:14,stocks,"Because it’s a dead money stock.  Three straight $100B quarters and it’s lower right now than it was at one point in July and September.  Think about that.  It’s gone down.  It was up $180+ in after hours yesterday and ended in the red.  How does that even happen?  Alphabet and Facebook were able to sustain most of their gains.  If you have money in Amazon, you’re screwed."
2021-04-30 16:50:26,stocks,How so? Hasn't its user growth been pretty shit for a while?
2021-04-30 17:34:08,stocks,Can I quote you in January when the stock is at 4k?
2021-04-30 17:34:17,stocks,Amazon stock is a money printer
2021-04-30 17:45:08,stocks,"Man those are some excellent points, and I appreciate you for making them. 

Here’s what confuses me: If a company has a bad ER, the price generally goes down, because they failed to meet expectations. If a company has a great earnings report, the price often goes down because the news was already priced in before the ER. 

So why would anyone ever purchase stock before an ER, and why is there a pre-earnings run? It seems like 75% of the time prices fall after earnings,  no matter the report. You’d think everyone would wait to just buy until after earnings, after the drop. 

I’m pretty stoney, so I hope that all makes sense 🍻"
2021-04-30 18:02:01,stocks,"And when you just throw out percentages without context, you can make anything look good.  Trading 13% higher for the month... yet it’s still well below it’s all time high.  In fact, it’s lower now than it was at points in July and September.  It was so bad that it dipped under $3k last month, so that’s where you are getting your fun little number now.  It’s been a dead money stock for almost a year now.  I don’t care what it did 5 years ago.  Plenty of stocks have been hitting home runs while Amazon has been striking out.  Fact is, and this is indisputable, unless you bought at the bottom of one of the multiple big dips it has had since July, it has been a bad investment."
2021-04-30 17:14:56,stocks,"Never invested in AMZN, luckily !

It’s just all such confusing bullshit. AAPL crushed earnings and is down ~1.3%. I understand the logic is that that news was “already priced in”, but then why even fucking bother with the report at all?"

2021-04-30 17:39:50,stocks,"No it isn’t.  It’s a dead money stock.  It’s not even at it’s all time high.  Incapable of sustaining stock gains.  This is the 5th time in less than a year it has immediately given up gains, and the 3rd straight $100B earnings report where the stock immediately went red."
2021-04-30 17:57:16,stocks,"I agree on the earnings. May be a small sample size but 3 completely random companies TTEK, PINS, and AMD all plummet right after every quarter. Especially near the end of the month. Then the first week of the month are up 5-10%. Should just trade 4 times a year like that..."
2021-04-30 18:20:08,stocks,"Because some people like to gamble.  Which is exactly what purchasing a stock before earnings usually is.  Sometimes you can hit a big spike...like SNAP did this week.  Others you will get a dud...like Netflix.

Thats why most seasoned investors dont play earnings, they just invest in stocks they trust and ride the waves"
2021-04-30 18:16:34,stocks,"I'm getting my ""fun little numbers"" from literally hitting the ""1 month"", ""1 year"", and ""5 year"" button on the stock ticker.  Thats it.  No cherry picking like you are doing in July and September.

Once again...sell the stock if you hate it.  It was at ATHs today, you should have taken profit.  Maybe invest in something like GME.  Its up 17% this week.  That sounds more up your alley."
2021-04-30 17:20:42,stocks,"Do you see those things as driving user growth, or just enhancing the experience of the relatively static number of people who already use the platform?"
2021-04-30 17:42:33,stocks,Im taking that as a yes

2021-04-30 18:26:39,stocks,"Clicking one month and five years is just as arbitrary as me pointing out July and September.  So let’s look at the pattern.  Retreats instantly after any sort of substantial gain.  In fact, I was wrong about July and September.  It’s July, September, and this month that it went above $3500.  Each time it quickly gives back a substantial amount of gains, if not all of them.  Then let’s look at the last three earnings reports.  You couldn’t dream up better numbers.  $100B each quarter, plus tons of other goodies.  Stock goes down each time.  This time it went up $180+ but ended the actual next day in the red.  And the final, and I think biggest point, is that it’s not like it just underperforms or retreats on just overall bad days.  It certainly does that, though.  Markets not even down 1% and technically Amazon lost 5% between announcing earnings and the closing of the next day.  But it does this when others have been flourishing due to a once in a lifetime investing opportunity, starting just over a year ago.  All of your highlights about them is past news.

If you've got 8 shares of a stock trading at $100 for example you should see $800, if you don't then it's in all likelihood a software bug with your brokerage which will resolve itself. Assuming you do then the next step is to go look at your cost basis and make sure it's at or near what you paid for them. If both of those numbers look correct then the loss almost certainly came from somewhere else and you may want to just give your brokerage a call to get a better breakdown."

2021-04-30 16:43:07,stocks,"It largely depends on your state’s 529 program. Some states allow more discretion in what to invest, others offer less. Some states let you deduct your contributions to a 529, some don’t.

When it comes time for your kid to fill out FAFSA to see how much aid they qualify for, a 529 will be counted as the student’s assets whereas other account types will be counted as parental assets.

I’m not a financial expert, so I recommend looking at your specific state to see which option makes more sense. If your state doesn’t allow your contribution to be tax-exempt and doesn’t give you any freedom to choose investments within the account, you might be better off avoiding the 529."

Now I'm not too concerned as I am placing .2 delta covered calls against my LEAPS to mitigate any downside or sideways trading movements, and the theta for my LEAPS is in the 0.0001 range.

2021-04-30 12:39:36,stocks,"It's impossible for anyone to tell you without knowing the exact dates and amounts you bought/sold.

The general rule is that you can't take a capital loss on a trade if you buy the same stock again within 30 days. 

But that has nothing to do with the cost basis. The cost basis is the cost basis. Wash sale has to do with calculating the capital gain or loss for tax purposes. You will need to look at all of the transactions individually and figure out which ones may have triggered the wash sale rule where you can't take a loss for that specific trade.

See https://pocketsense.com/calculate-wash-sale-5313540.html for more details on how to figure this out."
2021-04-30 13:54:09,stocks,"When you sell at a loss then buy the same shares within 30 days the loss gets carried over into the cost basis of the new shares, it all works out to even when you file taxes but it prevents people from selling everything at years end to lower their taxes then buying back in on the start of the new year. The reason why they do this is that if some of those shares are gains and some are losses, then they can tax just the gains, and YOU can't deduct the losses.

Example: If I average down a bunch on a stock then sell it above my average cost basis, I wait 30 days before trading that stock again to have my losses realized. Otherwise I can't claim the losses on taxes.

Your cost basis is including the losses from your previous trades so if you want to break even you sell when the price says its above whatever, and your losses are divided amongst all your shares when you do sell, so if its a $500 loss with 500 shares, it increases the cost per share by $1, or 5000 shares $0.10.

Edit: Definitely read up on it because I could be mistaken on a few points, but this is how I understand it from my own reading."
2021-04-30 12:37:57,stocks,"My understanding is it all evens out and you only need to worry if you carry a position into the next tax year or trade in that security within 30 days. So you could just close out whatever your position is on, say, December 15th and not trade it again till January 16 and you’ll be fine. 

But if I’m misunderstanding someone please correct me."

As I work forward I'm increasing my risk tolerance and that is how I'm learning. I could take a very large hit on my invested amount and be ok, but tolerance wise I'm very risk averse for now which has actually caused me problems where I stopped out of a few positions only to have it bounce and skyrocket.  It's a learning experience!"
2021-04-30 16:47:57,stocks,"This is 100% correct.  To add, given that he mentioned it was all in the last month, wash sale is 100% for sure triggered. 


So to OP, based on what you said, if you bought 10 shares at 180, that is your ultimate cost basis for those 10 shares, selling those and rebuying does not reset your cost basis.  To my knowledge your new cost basis would be set at the weighted average of the first time you bought those shares.  For example, if you sold and then bought 20 at 18.50, you'd have 10 @ 18 and 10 @ 18.50.  I'm a bit fuzzy on how that works with multiple rebuys of varying size, but the idea is you can't game the system to reset your cost basis."
2021-04-30 13:58:33,stocks,"Thanks, this is a great explanation of the scenario, and I dug into my various trades and found that it is taking the loss and placing it here, as it should. It is just a coincidence that the new cost basis aligns with the very original sale I made."

If the loan was for a year at that interest, the borrower would pay back $604.80.   That is a pretty good margin.  That is a better margin than what payday lenders get which is usually around 36% interest/year.  Not sure if the Mafia get that kind of vig on their loans.  Also wonder if SoLo has leg-breakers (like the Mafia) on staff to collect on overdue loans.

2021-04-30 12:53:20,stocks,Well there is an option prior to offering a loan to ‘purchase’ a type of insurance to cover your capital so you get a full return if the person defaults. I also wouldn’t loan to anyone who doesn’t have a social credit score of less than 60 which seems like a safe bet. Let me elaborate to explain people earn their social credit scores by how many loans they’ve successfully taken out and repaid. They get extra points for paying off loans earlier than required.
2021-04-30 12:29:05,stocks,So far the two small loans I have offered there were options to protect your capital by clicking an option for $5 to come out of the original loan to ensure you get your capital back should the person default on the loan. So I loaned $100 to someone. They are charged $117 for the loan total. Within the contract the loan recipient has an agreed upon time limit to repay. Then I would get $112 back in five days and the SoLo gets the reminder. I believe. I just found this which is why I asked.

This interest rate is still usurious."

2021-04-30 12:46:09,stocks,No those are valid points. Not all the loans are set at $17. I have one where they could only offer $6 to pay back in two weeks. Again that’s just why I asked bc it seems like an easy thing to do. Also they assign a social credit score to help people who can loan small or large amount to make more informed decisions. So I guess we will see how it goes.

2021-04-30 13:04:03,stocks,"Yeah I mean the lending business is all about assessing the risk of defaults, and charging a high enough interest rate that you make money overall even when some percentage of your portfolio defaults.

* BHC announced AUG 2020 that they would be spinning off their eye care business (comprised of consumer, contact lenses, surgical and Rx) in 2021...Let's call this NewCo as a name hasn't been announced yet.  The remaining company would be comprised of gastro, derm, aesthetics, generics, neuro and dentistry divisions.
* In JAN 2021, Carl Icahn established 7.8% of BHC and placed two of his associates on the board. 30% of the company is owned by activist investors.
* Two days ago Bloomberg reported that a company insider confirmed Bausch was exploring a potential sale of its eye-care business rather than the aforementioned spin-off.

IMO, if the NewCo does get spun off I believe there is good value here.  The consumer division is extremely profitable, surgical is a good business, and Rx is average.  In contact lenses, they are the number four player with only a 10% share of the category and that business has been losing money for years.

Now what you own will be the remaining business (or ""RemainCo"") which will be the gastro, derm, aesthetics, generics, neuro and dentistry divisions after eye care is spun off or sold.  This business is pretty much trash with the exception of  Xifaxan and the Solta  (which I expect to be sold).

I think there will be a pop in BHC once a decision is made.  I am targeting $40-45 as a possible target to begin divesting.

I am looking to generate discussion on this because I am interested in people's thoughts on how these events will impact investments and particularly how you will react to it from a strategy perspective.

&#x200B;

If conversation delves into how particular companies will be impacted, that could provide a good case analysis, however I am also interested in how this will impact sectors as well as specific investment types. I thought this might generate a good discussion on investment theory at a macro level.

&#x200B;

With this last 12 months being such a success for many people, it is my hope to look forward and examine what is on the horizon. Please feel free to expand the conversation to other factors in addition to possible increase of govt spending and end of mortgage forbearance. Another factor that I was curious about is how inflationary impacts will influence various investment types as well"
2021-04-30 10:58:28,stocks,"I think mortgage forbearance is less an issue than commercial building loans and people not (yet) returning to offices.
On the residential side, I think all the people who bought into an inflated market are going to have a hard time:
their mortgages were based on a reduced monthly expenditures and in general perceived to be able to make the payments, with spending going back to normal how hard will it be for them to make their monthly cash flows especially when they get that first repair bill on the overpriced house they bought with no contingencies"
2021-04-30 14:37:40,stocks,"No change in strategy 

I dont see much issue with mortgage forbearance ending.  Most jobs lost were not held by people with large mortgages.  After the mortgage crisis the requirements increased and fixed rates are the norm.

And say it is an issue....the government has gotten pretty good at stepping in to prevent disaster lately.

Not saying a drop cant happen, I just dont think this is going to be it,  and i dont think I could predict it, so why worry?  Try to stay employed, keep investing, pay down the house, and spend brain power elsewhere"

the ex-date is what you care about. you need to buy the shares before that, and make sure not to sell until after that.

Around this time, the UK went into lockdown again. Why would there be growth during this time?

I'm speculating that theres more spending in online stores and takeaways, but for an almost 30% raise in price? If you can, help me figure this out. There must be a perspective I'm missing.

  


I dont have any positions in the UK stock market at the moment."
2021-04-30 09:50:11,stocks,"First of all, it's not the UK100. The FTSE 100 is the main index in relation to the UK.

&#x200B;

Having said that, the UK was the first country to get vaccine rollout going. They're currently at 50% of total pop vaccinated I believe and therefore they will be the first to resume business as usual. The market is always forward looking, so even if UK's biggest companies haven't returned to their normal revenues, it's expected they will, and therefore the market has priced that in.

If you want an abridged version, *I assert* the banking regulations following 2008 have rendered banks impotent at fulfilling their role as intermediaries between the treasury department and the public. Incredible levels of new debt being printed and inflexible balance sheet constraints have pretty much begged hedge funds to come in and soak up the free money from these banks unloading bonds at a discount. Then they take out an overnight loan against the treasuries they buy and make plays on equities. It is quite literally a well of free money and everyone is getting onboard. Either JPowell pulls the rug by fucking with banking regulations, LIBOR goes up, or we hit critical mass where too much leverage is required to push up equities. Then it collapses like 1929.

1: I think there's a strong chance of their share price hitting $100 within a year.

2021-04-30 10:28:46,stocks,"First of all, upvoted.

1: Shell's earnings have been getting revised lower literally multiple times a month, consistently, for 4 months. I don't buy it and I don't think most investors buy it either or else their dividend yield wouldn't be over 11%. Exxon was brutally honest early on and came close to what they said they'd do, managing to beat it ever so slightly.

2: Do you think that the 11% dividend yield is supported with equity upside? If so, can you post your positions in Shell? Because if I thought the 11% dividend were supported with equity upside I'd put like 20% of my portfolio into Shell. Way more than I've dumped into Exxon. Who's to say they're not going to slash their dividend again?

3: They're so much smaller than Exxon that I don't see how we can expect more upside in an industry where scaling is so important.

I don't know if we can compare fundamentals on face value without taking into account that one company has consistently been honest and accurate with its forecasting and the other has consistently gotten it wrong towards downside.

If you can convince me 11% cash in my pocket WITH equity upside is supported I will a million percent dump thousands into Shell TODAY. I want you to convince me. I want you to be right."

What's your solution? Stop using oil for anything at all, immediately? What's your thought process here?"
2021-04-30 11:33:11,stocks,"1) This is because they cut drastically their dividend. This was definitely an overkill but it was very healthy for their balance sheet.

2) When they hit 65B debt, they will give 25-30% of their operational cash flow to the shareholders, I can see them getting back to the pre corona levels pretty soon (Q2-Q3). Look how much they progressed in lowering their debt, they are killing the earnings. This month alone the average price of a barrel Brent was 66 dollars. This is higher than the average during Q1. The world is opening soon and the OPEC will make sure that the oil price won't drop, they aren't scared of shale oil production because it is too risky with Biden. The oil prices will just keep on rising. My positions? I'm a poor college student so I could only spent a couple of thousand with an average cost of 39ish

3) Shell is diversifying and making themselves future proof. They made CO2 neutral kerosine, they are focussing on hydrogen, natural gas... It is more an energy company than just an oil company. Funds are trying to invest ethically, so they want to invest in more green companies and Shell is one of the greenest of the Big Oil. XOM and CVX will start to struggle soon with keeping up with their dividend. This is the first time XOM had profit since 2019... how will they keep up with this..."

They also don't understand the industry in terms of how much oil is profitable for recovery in today's reserves,  how long it takes to find new reserves, and how the scales are tipping with supply/demand. We're at an inflection point where the combination of the massive glut driving exploration budget cuts and private capital taking a big step back from the industry is going to put us in a position within the next 3-5 years that $100+/barrel is likely.

The trend is that every pension, every institution, every mutual fund, every muni, every hedge fund, every sovereign, every endowment, every university... all have banned fossil fuel investing.  Whether they're right or wrong for doing so isn't the point, it's that for every dollar you might want to buy oil with, there's a million dollars who want to sell it.

2021-04-30 17:00:01,stocks,"I understand all of that very well.  However I'd point out that when it comes to share prices, such things don't matter very much, if at all.  

Markets are forward looking, and favor growth.  But more significantly they hate, abhor, and destroy on even the first glimmer of shrinkage.  

Fossil fuels have multiple purposes, but three of key ones are transportation, heating, and energy, making up an aggregate of 80%.  And it just so happens that alternatives are crushing in those areas.

If *any* kind of company were being assessed by the market, and it was a known fact that 80% of their key business was being successfully and permanently assaulted, that stock would probably not fare well.  

Fossil fuel stock talking point repeaters always claim ""it won't every full go away.""   The thing is, the market doesn't sit idly by for decades waiting for that last domino to fall.  They strike when the first breath of wind seems like it might hit the first domino.  Fossil fuel's dominance is already falling, and has been for a decade.  

Turns out people ranging from the treehuggers to the ultra-greedy like the concept of getting free energy from the sun, where they don't even have to pay for barrels or rig workers.  They like the free input cost of the wind blowing and water running.  For many years such ideas were fanciful. Now, you can buy products that make it happen.  And because it's becoming profitable, the cycle of change is becoming self-powered.

I'm with you on certain concepts.  There is currently zero chance of electric planes, or people in cold countries surviving even one winter without fossil fuel.  Natural gas is a pretty clean and useful fuel but the price per unit dropped so we foolishly just decided to waste this finite resource by dumping it into the air or burning it off.  Someday our children will be astounded that we did that.  It's like how helium was treated as waste and valueless, so we did pointless balloon releases and sent all our helium into space.  Now we need it for medicine, but we threw it away."

2021-04-30 16:34:39,stocks,"Thanks. Very good points in there. Ultimately, I don't think one should favor dividend stocks over non-dividend stocks and agree with that point. But once a company hits a certain size, I have no problem if they want to distribute profits directly via dividend. Unfortunately, the dividend can create complications for management. In XOM's case, they didn't cut the dividend last year. They should have, but management views it as critical since so many of their investors rely on the dividend income (it's probably better for an investor to take the dividend than sell when the stock was $35). Protection of the dividend can cause a company to act somewhat irrationally, which is unfortunate. 

I actually prefer a dividend to share buybacks. Buybacks are increasingly self-serving to management because they can show EPS growth just by decreasing the denominator used to calculate EPS and I'd rather get the cash and either invest it in more stock myself or move it into another investment if the stock is too high (I don't participate in any DRIP)."

1. Finite supply drives price and profitability up

only if people are buying.  And only if the sources - which they don't necessarily control - are available.  Given global trends of limiting increase oil production that seems like finite is going to become *very finite* over time.

2) FALSE it is MORE in demand.

Because of world population growth, but the oil demand growth is dropping *proportionate to the population,* so no, not really the demand you're looking for.

*3)*  You think green energy will keep getting subsidies forever?

They barely do as is (comparatively.)  And as that subsidy increases coal and oil's will decrease, causing even higher prices that, again, drives people to look for cheaper alternatives.  You think they're going to do better without  $20.5 billion **annual** in subsidies (Oil Change International).  Don't see that happening.

4)  Negative public opinion is priced in.

Lmao, no it really isn't.  Their interpretation of it is.

5)  Foreignly sourced?! How is that bad? Lots of things are.

Because people would rather own their source of power, or a local source of power, obviously?  Global and local distribution to delivery are also repeatedly at issue.

We can agree to disagree.

The *entire world* is making a shift *away* from their core product - how you think that means their business will do *better* is super confusing.

You think nations are switching from oil stocks because they see big growth in it?

This is kinda all wishful thinking IMO.

Sure, there are ""green"" energy sources and those are great, but they have reliability issues that are not inherent with running a coal or natural gas fired power plant. You can't run on 100% green. You have to have a backup. No one wants nuclear, so that is increasingly nat gas. 

Nat gas is huge. We will be on it for decades. You simply can't heat the northern hemisphere with any other fuel source. 

Oil is huge. Plastic demand is rising. That's oil. Fuel demand is rising and will be high for decades to come. The entire global logistics network would come to a screeching halt without hydrocarbons. Container ships ain't gonna run on electric. Airplanes ain't gonna run on electric. Over the road tractor trailers are going to take decades to convert to electric and will entail a massive buildout of power supplies if they converted. Hydrocarbons are king in pretty much everything we do and will be for decades. 

XOM has 37 trillion cubic feet of proven nat gas reserves. As policy makers move to increase population in the West via immigration, you'll see even more demand for logistics services that use hydrocarbons and heating that uses hydrocarbons.

how tf is the market not at all time high?

if the market sentiment was akin to what it was like back in 2016 or 2017, we'd be at SPY 500-600 points already. not even exaggerating. coz 410-420 is a joke of a range. its irrational fear dominating over the sentiment."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Exiting Mistakes What’s your strategy for cutting losses on things which look like mistakes?

Do you get out once you start thinking you made the wrong read?

Is there a time you let it sit 9 or a % drop you exit at?

Do you let it ride forever until it recovers or till you get a better next idea for the money you take out?

What’s your approach?"
2021-04-30 08:33:06,stocks,"I bought 2000 shares of nio for like 1.50 and it dropped, and I lost $300 and I sold it. 

I fucked that one up bad"
2021-04-30 07:40:07,stocks,"I baghold but will jump ship at any opportunity.

&#x200B;

As an example, I regretted buying GSK. When an activist investor came sniffing, the share price leapt up. Nothing concrete, just that they were building a stake. I exited that so fast and somehow made a 2% profit.

&#x200B;

For others, I have exited when opportunities elsewhere arose. I started in Nov and made a fair few mistakes. When the NASDAQ had some wobbles, I decided to crystalise some losses and use those funds to jump into tech aggressively. These mistakes ranged from overpaying, or having too many similar companies, or buying business I didn't understand.

&#x200B;

The 1 mistake I am sitting on is GAN, down >25% on a large holding. I bought a little before some very disappointing results. I am bag holding until next QTR, when I'll either start clawing that back or if disappointing again, exit my position. I have decided not to DCA down because the business hasn't proven to me it's fundamentally there for the longhaul, and I want to limit my exposure. If it recovers I am fine making less money that I could have done. Whereas with GENI I did average down and then up, as I think there's a solid business in the making and its NFL tie-up confirmed that.

&#x200B;

With GAN, I have ringfenced my exposure, and will be prepared to jump ship. At current levels, it would reduce my over-all profit (both realised and unrealised) by about 10% if I realised the loss. But I have never regretted selling mistakes, and I'm not going to start now. Things can always go down further, and I'd rather protect that 75% of capital that remains and start over."
2021-04-30 11:31:25,stocks,"I recently sold a couple positions at a loss because something else came along I believed in more. There were a few things I bought that were stressing me out so much I couldn't stand to look at them in my portfolio, so I wanted them gone. Was it the best move, from a profit-standpoint? I dunno. But I feel like I believe in what I have now, moreso than what I had before, so that's helped a lot."
2021-04-30 08:45:12,stocks,"I mean for me personally the % it has dropped is not nearly as important as to why it has dropped.

For example especially in this market you will get great solid companies dropping just due to the overall market tanking a dump. If I buy Microsoft and it drops 5% on no news but just because of a tech sell off, if I believe in the company I wouldn’t sell regardless of the % drop. If anything it could be a good chance to take advantage of market fear and buy more.

On the other hand, I tend to ruthlessly cut companies where either the future outlook has changed due to subsequent news/updates since I bought, or where I just f*cked up in the first place.
An example is BB - I admit I got caught up in the Reddit fomo and bought in at nearly $20, only to see it drop 30%. Maybe the company does recover long term but personally I don’t see it given the management doesn’t seem great, they’re a mature tech company not making any money etc.

And that brings me onto my final point - could your money be invested elsewhere? Psychologically it’s tempting to baghold because then it’s “only a paper loss” - but if you baghold for a long time this has a real opportunity cost, as you can’t use that money for new ideas/companies that might have much better growth prospects.

So yeah in summary, the % drop is really a bit irrelevant - it’s why that counts. If it drops and there’s been no news to change my idea and I believe in the company long term, if anything I will use the opportunity to buy more"
2021-04-30 19:58:23,stocks,When I decide a stock has become a bad investment I'll typically sell on a broad market pullback and put the money into something bulletproof that is also down and more likely to recover
2021-04-30 07:42:02,stocks,"I don’t have a set strategy to exit at a loss like I do for profit because of the inherent volatility in the mid-high risk stocks.

For my YOLO plays I make sure I always own increments of 100 to offset the potential losses with the weekly calls revenue. Beyond that, I take each situation as it comes. Did it drop 20% seemingly out of nowhere? Better check trading volume and see if any other indication of insider dumping is happening. Otherwise it might be a “buy the rumor sell the news” situation."
2021-04-30 09:49:34,stocks,"If the company is good and its stock price drops, dont sell. The stock price will recover eventually. I learned it by selling stocks at the loss, to see it grow nicely afterwards."
2021-04-30 11:24:42,stocks,"If you can, wait until after 30 days to exit for tax purposes. If you expect significantly larger losses, then you'll need to decide which benefits you more."
2021-04-30 13:24:49,stocks,"If my conviction on a holding changed, sure I may cut my losses. I know there’s some who refuse to realize a loss, but if you think you can put that money to better use in another holding then why not? Opportunity cost is a thing too. 

If I bought something I have high conviction in and it goes red but my conviction has stayed the same, I hold or average down.

You can even write off some losses when you file taxes so if you think a holding of yours may recover but you can put that money in something that’ll recover faster, sometimes it’s beneficial to realize the loss and reallocate the funds."

Even on the disappointing results they revised revenue guidance upwards and are expecting 2021 revenue to be 3x 2020 revenue.  Patience young Jedi.
2021-04-30 09:37:51,stocks,"Your question doesn’t really make sense to me tbh. The value of a stock is what someone is paying for it, not what I paid for it. Holding it doesn’t mean I didn’t lose money. I manage my net worth, not a stock.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,UA vs. UAA ... is one technically preferred stock? I just came across that Under Armour has two listings - UA and UAA - but immediate search doesn't label either as preferred stock although it says a main difference is voting rights (which is a differential between common and preferred stocks usually).  I am probably missing something and really just curious what the differences are between Under Armour Class A and Class C.  Thanks!
2021-04-30 07:47:16,stocks,"There can be multiple classes of common stock.

Some companies do a thing where one common stock class has no or limited voting rights and this class is distributed out to the public; and the other class has the real voting rights and the CEO and key execs hold onto most of these shares. This way the founders and or key execs can retain strong ownership control of the company. Facebook does this, for example. Under Amour probably does too."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Disposable income as a result of the pandemic No knock on those who lost their job during the pandemic (I truly empathize), but those that were able to work probably were able to save more than normal due to the abilty to curtail the entertainment tax. With things looking to open by summer, there should be a healthy flow of capital into this lagging sector. Added on top, biden wanting to spend on infra sounds like there should be a large injection of spending definitely this year and bleeding into the next which should equate to a robust economy.

I'm thinking maybe sports, booze, and gas will go up, possibly even the whole energy sector as businesses and events ramp up. People are sick of watching movies after a year of being cooped up (sorry AMC holders), airlines and cruise stocks aren't as attractive as people think and a few of my friends are executive chefs struggling to find staff to stay open. I'd like to get into something involving the new infrastructure plans laid out. Any suggestions on which ETFs or stocks affected by a Biden infra boom that I could read up on would be appreciated."
2021-04-30 10:33:53,stocks,"I’m a little wary of inflation and have adopted my holdings based on it. That said, there are counter views that could well turn out to be the case.

U.K. focussed, but this report from the Bank of England found that about 28% of people they surveyed had saved more as a result of restrictions. 10% of those people planned on spending what they saved, with the remaining 90% either holding on to their savings, or paying off debts etc.

My sense this that in spite of this, we might see a bit of inflation filtering through as a result of lifestyle inflation where people make up for lost time and enjoy more recreational services than previously, though I’m not expecting a massive ‘big bang’ of spending either, particularly not from those who saved the most.

I had bought a new PS4 and games I wanted to play, back in late 2019.  SO, the Pandemic gave me ample opportunity to entertain at home.  I had already shifted my career to a new school training program, so I had no responsibilities outside of the house.

But in the end there is an infinite sea of information about investing out there, some if which is good, and some of which is total nonsense. Best way to learn is to just start and keep asking questions. Why did this stock go down today? Why is this companies market cap higher that this ones, what even is a market cap?

There is no clear cut path to learn everything. Just start with a small amount of money and slowly invest more as you get more confident in your own knowledge."

Just find some index funds or ETFs and put a portion of your salary into them every month or a few times a month and if you want to add alpha then pick the winners from those funds. I've been at this for 15 years and my best results have come from lucky timing."

If your looking for Pump and Dumps to loose all of your money on this is a great place to find it! 😂 if you cant tell im a pump and dump bag holding champion. Been investing since october of 2020 and was day trading for a while. Made some really great money and then lost out on some really awesome returns by selling too soon. Decided to switch up my investing strategy back in February right before the mother of all pump and dumps happened and every single stock plummeted! I turned my $78,000 in to 40,000$ in only 3 short months! Follow me for more great investing advice! Lmao. Little salty about this market right now!

Most fundamentals are updated every 3 months due to the fact that corporations release earnings reports every quarter, so traders are always speculating at what those earnings will say, and investors may change the size of their holdings based on those reports.  Expect a lot of volatility around earnings, but it usually doesn't matter if you're holding long term, but keep in mind the importance of earnings reports because a trend of declining earnings or a decline in some other fundamental will drive the stock down over the long term as well.

See the following word cloud and click through for the wiki:

I was looking at VERBUND these past few days and think that there is a potential play here as sector and currency risk diversification.

In a nutshell they are Austria's largest hydro producer and also engage in electricity trading. They have also partnered with Google and are trying out AI systems for machinery maintenance and better electricity trading.

The company seems to be trading around its intrinsic value based on my DCF valuation.

- being frustrated not getting into LVMUY so bought it yesterday when it was up .06 when today instead it was down 2.5% or so. Dumb and impatient.

- Buying BLNK after seeing it was down 3.4% yesterday only to see it be at 2.6% when I updated the stock seconds before buying and panic bought it rather than waiting another 20-30 minutes. Emotional.

- Lesson as usual: Be patient and emotionally controlled!

Might read some more of the Intelligent Investor this week..


But overall a really nice solid week. A bit concerned in my greed I bought some slightly volatile stocks which goes against my thesis, but time will tell and we shall see next week with another 6-7 of my stocks up for earnings..

Won't lie I first partially bought it not too long after it IPO'd cause ""Ooh green sparkly stock"" and didn't bother learn more about them as a company. Ad then averaged up on it like an idiot at the worst possible time and then wash saled it bad right as the big correction bottomed out. I don't feel like averaging it down and its cost basis is pretty oof at this point.

2021-04-30 19:33:49,stocks,"So, apparently quite a bit of gamma was indeed rolled off today in SPX and NDX. 

That explains a few things given what the story of 2021 has been (every single time gamma has been rolled off, it's problematic and it's been the main driver behind minor pullbacks with 1 real exception, that being early March and particularly March 4th). 

There will be more of a clean slate next week, should start to get more clarity then, but it wouldn't surprise me if early March gets repeated to some extent with this week. Maybe get a midweek low, then 1 more rip before it's consolidation station for some time.

You'll have to have somebody else explain gamma. It's above my paygrade to explain it, I just know that when gamma has been unwound this year by the market makers, it's been problematic for the major averages.

Edit: Nonetheless, it was a great month, and after early March, I did well by mostly sitting on my hands."

2021-04-30 13:51:59,stocks,Should I still be holding AAPL? Read that their profit margin is the highest it’s been in 9 years and there’s fears that they won’t be able to keep this monument up long term so stock isn’t gaining as much after latest earnings. Should I hold or sell?
2021-04-30 08:49:25,stocks,"Notice how before earnings calls big companies will hype up their business by throwing some good news out there, then their stock goes way up for a few days just before it tanks. This can't be a coincidence. Mofos are trying to find people willing to buy their huge loads of stock (whoever those people are). It would be a perfect time to unload. A lot of volatility due to ECs, and some hype around a company will let big investors sell at high prices without being noticed. If you know an EC is coming up and a company is feeding you some news, especially news in a ""potential"" area, not facts, I suggest you sell and sell quick. Watch for unusually high daily volumes prior to that. Pfizer's EC is coming up next week. They just said covid medicine ""might"" come out by the end of the year. I wonder what's going to happen with their stock now. Watching it like a hawk.

Not a financial advice."

You need to understand that type of growth is extremely hard to maintain over a long period of time. We are still in good times, put your money in smart plays and let them grow for you. I designate 5% of my portfolio for high risk and another 5% for medium risk. The other 90% is in companies such as AAPL, MSFT, TGT, COF, and DIS.

&#x200B;

Be smart and stop thinking you are going to double your money in a week/month/year by getting lucky. GME is not a strategy."

2021-04-30 08:45:24,stocks,"I'm a bit confused. Pending home index is up yet again, implying strong demand for housing. The correlation between housing and the S&P is about 0.73. I guess the surge in US household income is causing the drop, but that includes the stimulus check. My opinion is that it's a net positive, but futures seem to say otherwise. I guess we'll have to wait until open to see what the true story is."

2021-04-30 15:41:36,stocks,"So AMZN looks like its going to consolidate back down around 3400. This after having one of the best earnings quarters imaginable for a large cap.

Wondering if it might be time to do the unthinkable and sell my AMZN positions. Jassy/Bezos seem fixated on the ""prestige"" of having an insanely high stock price. Institutions are just going to sit on what they have. Fractional share investors don't have the capital to move a stock like this or they wouldn't be fractional share investors. Seems like retail will be priced out for the most part. 

Also, no dividend. So there's really no reward for just holding for years.

Great company that will continue to be profitable. However, as growth investors, is anyone else wondering if their money might see better returns elsewhere?"

ARKK: +0.68%

It is already leading the legacy automakers in the move to EV. Stock is up over 60% in the past 3 months alone.

\- Partnering with QS on solid state battery that could be a game changer  

\- Looking to operare over 18K battery stations in Europe and plans to have similar model in China

Like all automakers VW has it's challenges - namely in VW's case - Euro exchange rate, China competition and the lingering emissions scandal. Having said that it is better placed than most auto makers with their growth potential

That's not true.  And it would be illegal to make material announcements during the quiet period.  

You're possibly confusing what bystanders and analysts speculate ahead of earnings season.  That's not the companies themselves doing that.

> Mofos are trying to find people willing to buy their huge loads of stock (whoever those people are). It would be a perfect time to unload.

Again, that's false.  Except in rare and transparent circumstances, the shares you buy don't come from the company itself.  You buy them from other shareholders.  When you buy stock of company XYZ, you're almost never getting it from them.

In the highly rare event they are selling stock, it's highly publicized and done by outside brokers.  You would absolutely know it if you ever obtained stock directly from a company."

2021-04-30 09:54:00,stocks,"I know, I sold MO, not only because of the regulation, but also because of a shitty Q1 and looking like they aren't gaining any traction with their beyond smoking products.

2021-04-30 14:26:53,stocks,">You should go look at their demo day and ask yourself if that is a cutting edge product or some bullshit from radio shack 40 years ago.

17 years and they haven't turned a profit. Insiders dumped shares like they had covid. I brought at 24$ following lock up expiry, was an idiot for not selling at 29 the next day, ended up selling at break even before I got into lossy territory. Glad to have learned the lesson."

2021-04-30 09:58:25,stocks,Apple hasnt gone up in 6 months now. Basically any stock in the S&P would have been better this year
2021-04-30 12:40:15,stocks,Yeah seems like just a reaction to that and Japan’s pandemic response being slower than other countries. Bought a lil SONY on the dip

2021-04-30 12:10:57,stocks,"Looks like it has a pretty solid support at 255.  Has had some huge gap downs which might get filled.  And even though it was probably overvalued at its peak, its still ~100 bucks off its high."

2021-04-30 11:20:42,stocks,"every time man. and then what I buy dips.

But I know MSFT and SCHD will grow long term. They are very long term plays for me anyways.

just hate to see it lol"

2021-04-30 08:04:46,stocks,I think the semiconductor shortage is definitely contributing to the pain because it is prevebting businesses from meeting their demand and thus hurting their output/profits. I think it is just adding to the worry about inflation and higher taxes.
2021-04-30 09:46:15,stocks,"Yeah, it's just irritating watching this sideways market"
2021-04-30 08:17:20,stocks,Ive also been thinking of how google is huge and IF feds ever crackdown they'll be in the crossfire for sure
2021-04-30 09:55:31,stocks,I was off by like 0.05% for 2 days when S&P barely finished red and I predicted green. I’d say I’m getting a bit better but idk lol

It's got support now that it didn't have before"

2021-04-30 16:56:26,stocks,"This so much. When shit has no fundamentals behind it to keep prices sensible, and there is too much money in the system, it just can't stop going up."
2021-04-30 16:51:19,stocks,"Agreed, and that was the reason behind my comment. Great companies like AAPL, or MSFT go down after smashing earnings but they will go back up without a doubt and a dying company like GME(we all know and loved them) is going up but it will not last."
2021-04-30 16:54:57,stocks,I wish lol.
2021-04-30 09:08:13,stocks,I just scheduled an automatic $250 investment on the 1st and 15th of each month. It isn’t a lot but better than nothing.

2021-04-30 13:54:48,stocks,"I feel like a deal is coming - I even have a rando idea on who it might be, but it’s shaky then the sec changed spac rules so they have to navigate that too. I’m not sure the timing is working out, feels like it has to be in Q2 or it’s dead"
2021-04-30 15:46:36,stocks,True. Most price targets ive seen are around 4000. But how long till it hits that? But how long to reach that lvl. Would your capital be better placed elsewhere?
2021-04-30 15:53:33,stocks,"Most analysts upgraded their targets, 3900-4500. Usually that means 12 month+ targets. I don't own any, but plan to buy next sizable dip. Markets are in a holding pattern to see if this growth can continue past our recovery reopening quarter we just had."
2021-04-30 15:53:16,stocks,Pretty much my thought process. If it drops back around 3200 in the next six months im going to seriously start looking at other options.

2021-04-30 07:45:55,stocks,"Can we just add the caveat that while timing the market is difficult, you should still do your research and know when a stock is overvalued? Just because a stock is good doesn't mean you should buy it. This specifically goes for individual stocks."
2021-04-30 16:14:17,stocks,"Just buy leaps tbh, short term options in this market right now is very risky"
2021-04-30 10:49:07,stocks,Then you watch the Mandalorian and buy some shares.
2021-04-30 16:35:28,stocks,"Yeah lol, I should specify, I set that limit when it was around $80, so the difference was actually $15 back then, the $1 is sort of that feeling, like at the casino when you're trying to hit a target, but come just short of it, I'm also not in a rush to buy, since I'm really adding shares to what I own, so might just take my time."
2021-04-30 15:49:52,stocks,Yes timing the market is a good investment strategy. “It’s not looking like it will rally anytime soon” can you please check that crystal ball again and let me know what date it will rally again? Thank you.

2021-04-30 15:06:51,stocks,I don't believe there is any restriction against contributing to 2020 if you just opened your Roth.  you might want to contact webull support and see if you can get any clarification on their notice.
2021-04-30 15:26:46,stocks,"No, you should be able to contribute to 2020 until tax day.  You did so well before as it was extended to the middle of this month."

2021-04-30 15:55:05,stocks,"I think it’s a promising play in the short to medium term. I’m heavy on aerospace with Boeing Airbus and Rolls Royce. Short term if COVID gets definitely under control travel will restart with a vengeance, airlines will upscale and the industry will recover.

Boeing specifically, the new leadership seems to be taking seriously the job of clearing up the mess left from the old. The fact that a variety of manufacturing problems on existing planes lately keep being discovered is bad advertising, but to me also a sign they are reviewing their operations and taking responsibility, a positive for the future.

Analysts are also generally very positive, and such a legacy company I imagine will see long term investors come back aboard once the situation normalizes.
The recent drop after earnings seems a good entry point, both for the above reasons and because technically Boeing stock price has been jumping up and then slowly bleeding down since 2020. It’s been bleeding for a while now and there are potential catalysts in the coming months as the vaccination campaign progresses and some form of regulation for safe travel will probably be established.

Another reason is that I don’t see many alternative investments that feel safe. I’m not going to buy growth stocks at all time highs on a highly leveraged market under the specter of rate increases. Bare minimum, I want to see a correction first.

If it’s not yet obvious from the price swings, the market is largely controlled by speculators, wildly buying and shorting and **taking profits**. The main US indexes went up a lot, and while they may go even higher I’m pretty confident they won’t remain there.

So right now I prefer to trade short term, or buy out of favor stocks and wait for the sentiment to change. I also own BABA and BP, in that regard."

2021-04-30 09:31:30,stocks,"The theory is that long term the market goes up, so even if you put all your money in one day before the Covid crash, or one day before the dot com bubble burst, you'd still be way up in the long term. The only thing you really lose in that type of scenario would be opportunity cost... if you had waited one more day you would have been able to buy a lot more assets for the same dollar amount. The problem is nobody knows when the top is, and nobody knows when the bottom is, either. 

It's also because, as you said, time in the market beats timing the market.  If you just put a lump sum in right now that money is working for you right away.  If you average it out over time you're losing out on gains while you wait. 

Check out ""Bob the world's worst market timer"" on Google, he still did very good despite having the worst possible market timing.  Again, though, that experiment doesn't account for the lost opportunity cost. 

Me personally I was skeptical about lump summing when I got into the market 2-3 months ago, especially in tech stocks which seemed overvalued.  I was right and tech soon had a correction.  But that may have been beginner's luck on my part, or just common sense seeing how high those numbers were.  Things have since leveled back out, though, and I have done enough research to have a decent understanding of what's going on in the market right now.  So, in the end, I did sort of lump sum into the market over the last 1-2 months (unless you consider that timeframe averaging, I don't, I was just being somewhat cautious and trying to make sense of things). 

It may bite me in the ass if we correct 30% today or next week or whatever.  But long-term I will be okay, that's the lesson.  And I don't expect a correction soon based on what I've seen, but hey, anything can happen. 

I think it comes down to what you're willing to see happen to your investments. If you're really scared about putting all of your extra cash in the market all at once and potentially seeing it decline 30% shortly thereafter, then yeah, dollar cost average over time. 

However, given the fact that cash is trash right now and the market is super heated with fiscal stimulus and QE, I prefer to have that money in the market yesterday.  There's still room for it to run, crazy as it may seem. 

Just the way I see it, I've put a lot of thought into this the last 2-3 months."
2021-04-30 10:54:58,stocks,"I guess it depends on the what the state of the entire market is. 

I have a long term view on it though, it could be red for a few months, but by the end of the year you should be green. You can't time how long the red will be, you might invest it all on a red day, and it might be red for only that day, the next month could be green, and everything you drip feed from then you miss out of the previous days green. Same goes the other way around too ofc.

That's why going all in at once evens out at the end. If it's red for 6 months then either you picked the wrong stocks or the market is fucked for everyone."

The Ringer, Gimlet and Joe Rogan.

Of the three, the Ringer has been a plus for them, and their content has only gotten better during the pandemic.  Bill Simmons is doing a good job putting out content that people like and Dave Chang has been a big win.

Gimlet absolutely imploded during the pandemic, and their flagship podcast Reply All fell apart. Alex Blumberg basically got spanked by Conde Nast and the NYTimes.

Joe Rogan, too early to say. He already had a big audience, and I think the audience remains big. He remains controversial, but I think that controversy only helps him."

When I started investing a drop of 3% in a day in a stock would be considered a massive selloff.  Now that happens regularly and people don't bat an eye.  More often than not stop-losses will just result in you getting stopped out of good investments only to watch them rebound and keep going up.
2021-04-30 06:02:06,stocks,depends entirely on your investment strategy. Do you plan on holding them for the longterm or just want to see a short term gain.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Any Canadians here that can answer some TFSA questions for me? I’m new here to this subreddit but have been dabbling in stocks the past couple months.  A few people suggested that I open a TFSA and keep my stocks in there instead of my personal account.  I looked into it and it seems like that’s a good idea but I don’t completely understand how they work in regards to stocks.

So I use Wealthsimple and opened a new TFSA account.  That was easy and took about 30 seconds.  Now I have the option to deposit money into it.  I don’t think transferring stocks is an allowed.  

Do I need to sell the stocks in my personal account then transfer the funds to my TFSA in order to consolidate everything there? 

I know there’s a yearly contribution limit.  Does that only apply to funds transferred?  

Do gains count as contributions?  

If I liquidate my personal account, I’ll have to wait three days to transfer the funds to my TFSA, then I can buy back my stocks.  If I do that I’ll have to pay conversion fees since most of them are in USD.  I might have to pay more than I bought them for too.  Or less.  Is it worth doing that?  

If anyone has suggestions or advice I’d appreciate it.  Thanks."

2021-04-30 16:48:35,stocks,"I'm pretty new to investing as well, but I also opened up a TFSA recently to do all my trading.

To answer your first question regarding contribution room. You use up contribution room when you transfer money from your chequing account and open up a TFSA. If you already have a TFSA account with your bank and want to transfer that into your Wealthsimple TFSA, that usually will take 4-5 weeks and you will get charged a fee to do this (although I think wealthsimple may reimburse you for this).
Log into your CRA to see how much contribution room you have left. If you are transferring from your TFSA to wealthsimple TFSA, (as mentioned above though direct transfer), this does not go against your contribution room. 

The beautiful thing about trading in a TFSA is that YOU DO NOT HAVE TO PAY ANY TAX ON YOUR GAINS. This is huge.

The one thing to be careful about when buying stocks in Wealthsimple is that they charge you a commission fee when you buy/sell US STOCKS. So, it's great for trading Canadian stocks, not so great for US stocks. Yes, you are saving on not having to pay a $10 fee anytime you buy a stock, but you end up paying way more in commission fees when selling a US stock and converting back to CAD. This is because the commission fee is charged against your gains as well, not just on what your original purchase was.

Aa somebody else mentioned, buying US stocks through Questrade is better, even though they charge you $10/trade. But if you plan to buy stocks like BlackBerry or other promising Canadian stocks, wealthsimple is amazing. Hope this is helpful."

2021-04-30 06:55:31,stocks,"Mate, my family runs restaurants in the UK, there are always problems ontop of the existing duties you have to do. 

They always have high staff turnover, waiters/waitresses are usually young and end up going to university or moving away. Chefs/cooks can be difficult people to manage. Ontop of that you have to deal with health and safety standards in your local country.

The easiest period when running a restaurant is the opening.  Because all of the equipment is brand new and will have 3-4 years before it starts breaking or needs maintenance. After that its like you're constantly on catchup. Its a full time job in itself. 

Yes running a portfolio is much easier, you aren't reliant on anyone but yourself, you can easily invest in blue chip stocks for the dividends or EVS or whatever massive growth sector you want and know you'll be set for life regardless. If you want a low maintenance business, the food industry isn't it. I wouldn't touch that industry with a barge pole."

lots of sweat equity (which initially i did not draw a salary for - now i do).

we are looking to expand. if we are successful, we can assume (obviously a million reasons why assumption can be bad) my passive income will double, while I won't have to put in another $ of my own money. So now we're talking $150k annually in passive returns off $20k investment and a lot of sweat equity. rinse and repeat and then we're up to $500k+ annually in passive income off $20k investment."

It’s a hard business and most owners/chefs would tell you not to get into it unless it’s your only passion. Hours are long, margins are razor thin, and one bad spell could end you. You won’t end in a thrilling way either - it’s more in a “the horse is dead but people keep kicking” kind of way. 

To answer your first question...yes. If you can build a portfolio of sufficient size you can withdraw money on an annual basis and live on that. It’s what retirees do every day. Only downside is that the portfolio has to be of sufficient size so you don’t run out of money even when the down spells inevitably happen. Ideally you don’t even want to touch the principle."

I think that's mostly true of business in general, but it goes double for low margin, high work, businesses like food service. Running a business can absolutely make more money that just investing. A whole lot more. But you are going to be putting in long hours with high risk. 

FYI If you plan to live on investments long term, most studies show that you can count on about 3-4% max if you want to ensure your money lasts and keeps up with inflation. So a $2mm portfolio would really mean a $60k-80k income. Don't let the last few years of easy mode investing fool you."
2021-04-30 11:13:09,stocks,"I own a restaurant. Generally a very successful restaurant will net 5-9% profit. Sales vary wildly but in my experience, a very successful restaurant will see revenue anywhere from $1.5-4mil, making profit anywhere from $100k-$350k.
Keep in mind, this is the very successful scenario. 85% of restaurants close in the first 5 years and a large chunk never turn a profit, not even a single month with profit.
The industry is incredibly unstable and has hundreds of things that could go wrong and wipe out any potential profits. You could have a great month but your walk-in goes down and now you have to use all of your profit on fixing it. You could need to buy more plates because they got broken or went missing. It takes a very skilled and detail oriented team of people to make a successful restaurant.
Success in restaurants comes down to sales. The higher your sales, the higher your profit % and stability. But even with high sales, you still run the risk of one bad month wiping your current or even previous profits. 
If you don't have the skills and experience or you don't have a team with a good track record that you have 100% faith in, you're almost definitely better off investing elsewhere."
2021-04-30 08:32:00,stocks,"Fuck restaurants.  This question is debatable and personal preference for any industry except restaurants.

Restaurants fail because the owners are not personally involved, overseeing staff, or running the kitchen, or general managing.  It's got terrible hours, lots of ass kissing, dealing with the petty fucking public.

* Shit hours
* Usually shit staff
* Shit customers (each one is very small % of revenue but can leave powerful negative reviews)
* Shit margins
* Shit job in general - wash dishes when they call out, wait tables when they call out, plunge the toilet b/c there is no budget for a on duty maintenance worker, etc.

You can have 2 million dollars or have to get yelled at by some loser who think's they're Jesus because they're spending $18 on Salmon and the 19 year old waiter forgot to sub baked potato instead of rice.

You can also get unlucky and invest that $2M just before or during a bear market and have to wait for years to break even again.

However, there are very similar risks involved in owning a business because having a stock portfolio is pretty much being the owner of a small part of mulitple businesses. So, in a way the stock portfolio is actually safer because there's no single point of failure. I believe that around 90% of startups fail, so odds are against you unless you have a great business plan and know very well what you're doing. Owning a business is more risk, but also more potential for reward though"
2021-04-30 04:12:01,stocks,"I only recently talked with a friend about exactly this topic.

consider this: avg margin of profit for large companies (not outliers like AAPL , MSFT etc) would be like 2-5% / year. and thats being generous. there´s business that are happy to beat 3% regularily.

now lets compare a super boring portfolio:

all money into one ETF:like $VOO: 10-15% / Year.

&#x200B;

that might not be the smartes way to allocate for risk,, but I think it covers the basic idea.

conclusion:

why on earth would I invest all my capital into a company that is much more complex, harder to manage, has social responsibilities to employees, legal stuff..

when I could also invest it all into the market, get much higher returns and basically have only taxes to worry about ?

so from a returns / mnagement perspective, the portfolio wins, hands down. I don´t think the comparison is fair though.

socially and in regards to ethics, I would think owning and running a business has far more value than just owning shares.

you provide jobs, offer measurable services / products to society. you bring value.so even though it is much more hassle and stress, I think running a business is actually worthwhile.

99.99% of people reading this could never be the successful buyer of the new McDonald's franchise in your town.  But you *can* scoop up some $MCD.  You probably don't have fifty million to open a truck dealership.  But you *can* afford to become one of the owners of Ford Motor Company (which is having a 10% off sale for new owners today.). Can't buy a few Starbucks locations?  No problem, because you can buy a few dozen $SBUX shares.  Google wouldn't hire most of the people here, but you can own them through Alphabet.

And as a new owner of these companies, you don't actually have to do anything.  They'll run it all, and send you a payment when the profits come in.

2021-04-30 09:49:41,stocks,"Restaurants: these sound fun: Be the owner, everyone comes to see you and eat/drink, many friends, blah blah.  But especially on the ""local"" level... if you haven't cut your teeth and turned something into a local institution over years of (your own)  sweat and tears... I don't think you can imagine the work that goes into making one survive, let alone become successful.  The ""owners"" who want to hire out a staff to ""run it"" while they sit back have (IMO) a far greater chance of failing, as the staff is just doing a job.  It's not their skin in the game.  When it's all said and done, they don't care if you make it or not.  Restaurant workers, to include upper management, can be transient, finding other work quickly.  As well, people who DO succeed with a new spot often are already well-connected and networked in their community, already having something of a following of some sort or another.  SOMEthing needs to get the attention of the community.  A lot of how a new place pops off (or doesn't) can be based on somewhat of a popularity game, TBH.  Not every time, but enough to make it a thing.  Then on top of that... it has to be a place people will come back to; i.e. it's actually good.  I've seen multiple places in my town fail in a spot, only to then see another place pop up in the space and crush it. I couldn't tell you why- but it happens. 

A good friend on mine came up in the food and beverage biz in the south and head a natural head for numbers and logistics in the food and beverage biz, and a knack for both attracting (and keeping through good management) the best people.  As years went by it was evident to everyone that everything he touched turned to gold.  But... he was so hands on, it affected his family life and became the crux of his social life (although it IS a pretty social industry to begin with, I guess).  Financially successful, sure.  But at what cost.  Even he eventually got burned out at the hours and attention to detail (which he excelled at) he needed to constantly give to keep an operation running successfully. Now he is a sought-after consultant for most any bigwig coming into town with big money and dreams of opening the next big spot.  (in a very well-known southern city where the hospitality industry is one of the primary industries.)

I guess my TL:DR on restaurants would be... careful what you wish for.  The majority of new places won't make it simply because the owners had all the visions in their heads, but didn't really think things through.  Money, your ability to manage, having the right people and especially your willingness to sweat and bleed yourself to make it happen are essential to even a hope for success.

Re: your ""10% return on investments"" assumption"":  this is very optimistic.  I believe people were paying Madoff out the ass to achieve 6-8%.  10 is doable, but in today's environment, is requires investments on the (relatively) more aggressive side, and (in my experience as a client) a very hands on money mgr who won't just set it and forget it.  Assuming an ""average"" of 10% is even more hopeful, as you're assuming there will be higher years to average out the lower.  Could there be?  Yes.  Will there be?  I would caution such optimism."

My family comes from a food industry/ hospitality background. I had worked restaurant (fast food and fine dining) during my teens. So I convinced my parents to loan me some money so I could run my own restaurant. I made profits but it is extremely hard work for very low margin.

I sold that place in a year paid off my car and gave the money back to my parents the initial cost and a lot more. They decided to open another restaurant with partnership, and I helped however I could. They have bought and sold multiple restaurant by now and don't need me to help them.

My parents work 7 days a week 11-13 hrs a day. Food industry is very competitive and it is hard. Depending on the type of food you serve your net profit will be probably 10-15%.

My suggestion to anyone that wants to open a restaurant is look for a niche market with low competition. Selling food product that doesn't perish quick is also something that you would want to look into i.e. smoothies, coffee, bar with quick snacks.

If you want high profit return your initial investment will have to be insanely high and it is still not guaranteed to do well.

We have had many cases of employees stealing money and product and is very very common occurrence and that is with us monitoring the business. If we hadn't there would have been more theft. Even when I worked in a 5 star restaurant I knew cooks that stole entire boxes of food and would sell them to other businesses."

One guy had been working for the franchise group longer than I had so he knew how much inventory to stock and when. Lowered that cost.

If you are making 200k passive off stocks my advice to you is: avoid the restaurant industry like the plague.  It's hard work, never as ""glamorous"" as tv/movies make it seem, and it's a huge risk.  You could easily lose that 2 million and have no idea how you even spent it (or know exactly how, which might be worse)."

The MAJOR benefit of a business, is your business can pay into an individual 401k. The last three years I've put around 100K in my personal pretax 401k. 10-20 years of 30-50K pretax contributions would put you at an insane retirement income.

My business nets about 25-30% ROI compared to a stock market average of 6%. Business's are a PITA to manage, but the value is their if you find it. I will most likely ""retire"" when I have kids and boop around managing my business/playing with kiddo's."
2021-04-30 15:45:19,stocks,"Restaurant owner here!

I bought a commercial-residential building over a decade ago. It’s a family run ethnic restaurant. We live upstairs. All expenses are covered by the business. I practically take home 50% of our revenue a year (at least $150K on a bad year). My work hours is almost like other people: 8-9 hours (10AM to 1:30PM and 4:30PM to 9:30PM), 5 days a week. We can even nap in the afternoon—I am in bed right now with my wife and my 6 months old daughter. 

Note, we are very efficient at what we are doing now. Cashflows is awesome in this kind of business. I am not stealing from the government, but if I wanted to, they wouldn’t know; therefore I could’ve taken more home. Some of my friend took half of their cash income off the book (that’s a lot of money).

My wife is a visiting nurse, she’d be home before the evening service or sometime earlier than that. 

My brother is an insurance broker, he works all day and works until 9 or 10 at the restaurant. 

My sister-in-law is here full time with me. We are doing OK at lunch on our own, especially during pandemic since we only do takeout now (since the first Canadian lockdown—14 months and counting).

On weekend before pandemic, we hire a dishwasher so we can sit on our ass at the end of the service.

Basically, if you are really efficient at what you are doing, you don’t need to hire that many people. If it’s a family business and the restaurant takes all the expenses, you’re golden. Keep your overhead really LOW! It’s great when you own a building and better when you paid off the mortgage. 

All of us can retire right now with all the rental properties and investments we have. Plus, my wife and my brother can still take home at least $100K on their own. Mind you, we are not even close to 40s, my sister-in-law is barely early 20s. But why throw away a solid take home $150K+ business? Our cashflows is way too good to give up. Plus, we are the top restaurant in town and that comes with connections, prestige, and privilege.

If I ever want to retire, I’d just buy another sizeable house with commercial zoning and turn it into a restaurant that we can live upstairs, and we’ll just host private dining (reservation per approval only) 4 evenings a week: Thursday, Friday, and Saturday. I guess, this alone can tell how beneficial the business can be. 

I wouldn’t put $2M in this kind of business if I cannot run it the way I’m doing though. Most of my bigger rental properties are $2M-$3M, and they all take home around $90K a year. So maybe take that into consideration."

2021-04-30 17:40:37,stocks,"A 2M portfolio is NOT like owning a business. Let's walk through some numbers and let's also forget revenue and talk about take home:

&#x200B;

If you're looking for 200k/ year, that business will cost roughly 600k. The down payment on this loan is 120k. So for 120k, you are getting 200k in income. For the first 5-10 years a large portion of income will be diverted into the loan payments. This is basically buying a job though; you'll be building equity which can be pulled out on a business sale, but you're buying a 200k/yr salary. The equations to know here are:

* business valuation is \~3x cash flow
* down payment is roughly 20% of business valuation

In other words, you're leveraging your money nicely, building equity, and buying a job. Is that what you want? Sounds like no.

&#x200B;

Let's look deeper. Since passive income seems to be the goal, you will likely NOT want to work, manage, run this business. Something magical happens at roughly the 1M business valuation point- Management & employees. With managers, you can take more of a backseat role and focus on big picture actions while avoiding day to day.

&#x200B;

For 2M in cash that you mentioned, a business acquisition can be made on a company pulling in 600k for the owner. This would be a loanless deal. Without the loan, that's immediately a VERY high standard of living. Adding cash to the business for growth could make the eventual business sale quite large as well. There's also the advantage of avoiding a SBA loan- always a good thing.

&#x200B;

A couple caveats:

* **Restaurants suck. Avoid these.** Resale is hard. hours are bad. take home is bad. Not always, but actually always.
* Business is risky. Events like like 9/11, covid, and recessions DESTROY businesses
* Business ownership is different than a corporate job. Stepping into these shoes is often difficult

\*\* This is not financial advice. I'm familiar with business through years of discussions with business brokerages\*\*"

2021-04-30 08:30:41,stocks,"It really depends on what question you're asking. If you're asking about pure money making, $2M could be more lucrative than many business ventures. But putting $2M into a business venture could yield MUCH higher returns. It has higher risk though since that $2M could easily become $0M when your business goes bankrupt.

It feels like you're thinking explicitly asking about ""money in your pockets"". If that's the case, the question is ""how much is enough"". $200k a year from a well diversified portfolio of dividends and growth would be really nice. But assume you put $2M into developing a small software startup, or a fleet of food trucks, or you bought a small manufacturing facility, or maybe a gym? There is potential that if the $2M is properly invested and you have a good business head on your shoulders, you could turn that $2M into $10M in 5 years. That would beat your theoretical gains.

But here's the biggest kicker you're missing. Most business folks and entrepreneurs that invest $2M in themselves vs the market are doing it because of intrinsic motivation. They want to create something. They want to own something. They want to win. The question you're asking is purely about passive income. There is no alternative for passive income except dumping money into VOO/VTI and just waiting. Its the ultimate no brainer passive play."
2021-04-30 08:31:51,stocks,"100% yes. Not having the daily headaches from employees, customers, what can go wrong, etc. Every business owner wants to grow it and sell it to turn it into a portfolio."
2021-04-30 08:33:29,stocks,"I think you’re comparing apples and oranges. 

If you’re asking which can be more profitable...small business owners concentrate their assets into the business because they believe this is what they have expertise and competitive edge. If they put the money in a portfolio then they might no be able to get the same return. Not all small business owners starts with that in mind. In fact most have a different motivation for owning their own business like freedom and control. 

A portfolio or strategy usually start off with the investment manager seeding the portfolio with his/her own money usually at least 3 years to show a live track record then they can start attracting clients to invest with them. That would be both 2M in a portfolio AND in a small business. 

So my answer to which is better? Depend on what you can do. If you stumbled upon a bag has 2M in cash....don’t try to start a restaurant...put it in a few index funds."
2021-04-30 08:34:16,stocks,"I would take the $2M portfolio any day. Restaurants have low profit margins and high failure rates. That doesn't mean you can't get rich as a restauranteur, but unless it's something you have a lot of experience in already, I wouldn't recommend it.

By contrast, a $2M portfolio would be enough where you'd be earning more than enough to live on. If you really wanted to invest in something other than the stock market, I'd suggest commercial real estate. Instead of being the restauranteur, be the guy who owns the real estate that the restaurant rents.

That’s him working literally every single day.. as for me, I built a small grow in my basement 13x24’ flower room that puts 100-120k in my pocket. Pretty much depends on how hard you want to work.

It's all in perspective I suppose, people are different and want different things, but my take is that I would rather invest."
2021-04-30 09:02:46,stocks,It can be very profitable. But as others have said it's a metric ton of work. It's not passive at all unless you have tip top staff. First couple of years you will lose money as you build a customer base. Nothing passive about it though 10 hour days are lucky.

2021-04-30 09:46:51,stocks,Far better than owning a business. You have zero diversification with one business. And the majority of startups / small businesses fail. A $2M business is pretty small. I mean this is why you can stop working and retire when you've got a $2M portfolio. Why would you instead invest that in something that is going to demand long hours and lots of risk?

2021-04-30 09:58:50,stocks,"Depends what business it is and how it’s run and performing. You’re assuming your 2 million portfolio will give you a steady 200k every year, since your using a 10% return I’m assuming you’re talking about something very close to an S&P 500 investment, you have not accounted for down markets and bear markets. That 10% is averaged over a long time span, it’s not going to be 10% every year, it could be negative."
2021-04-30 10:02:57,stocks,"This is a false equivalence because you picked a restaurant. Hugely risky business. And you chose to put the whole $2m into the restaurant. 

Pick a stable cash producing business like a dry cleaner or hvac repair or laundromat or storage location, etc. and don’t invest all $2m into it. 

Now you have the best of both worlds, you are not dependent on your portfolio for you income so you can focus your portfolio on growth to beat inflation and generate additional capital and your business income can take care of your basic needs. 

The business income will grow with inflation because your prices will also increase with inflation and its resale value will also grow as such businesses typically sell for 3x annual profit. 

And (since you bought the business with 3x profit, and it’s only 15-25% of your portfolio) you can live off the income from your remaining portfolio in the first three years until your business is paid off."

When you factor in all the time, hassle, constant investment and employees, it becomes complicated in a hurry. I am slowly getting out of it and into my portfolio much more. For me, I will take nice portfolio generating 8% a year, over a business anyday. It can be time consuming too but not like dealing with a business."
2021-04-30 10:05:47,stocks,Somewhat unrelated but if I did have 2 mil to build a portfolio where should I put them? ETFs? Mutual or Index Funds? Safe Blue Chip stocks? Is a 10% yearly return attainable?
2021-04-30 10:08:06,stocks,"Depends, if im right in thinking a business with a turnover of $250k a year has a capitalisation if $2.1m
But im not sure if thats before or after tax bit it comes out at something like 8.5x yearly income again not sure if thats net or gross. 

The advantage of a portfolio is that you can more easily liquidate parts of it for cash when needed.

Thats my 2 cents."
2021-04-30 10:14:34,stocks,"Depends on the business.

A 10k investment into running my own machine shop can pay myself and the business 100k/year working only 40hr weeks.

Your heart has to be in it and if you think you can just ""manage"" it, you're in for a big surprise.

But on the upside, the financial freedom is absolutely worth it. Not going to say how much our take home is because it's too private for even an anonymous online post, but it was enough that we never worry about making ends meet and carry zero debt. Including housing."
2021-04-30 10:15:57,stocks,"After being an assistant general manager and GM and opening a restaurant from the ground up, I'd take the $2 million portfolio any day (but I also want to go into finance after I finish my degree this year). Yes, in theory it's easier to control your portfolio. The problem is is that returns are never promised and being good at making returns in the market does take some work."
2021-04-30 10:20:08,stocks,"We (my family) own a franchised QSR. I’ve also owned a bar. Location matters and certain things (road construction, speed of development, Covid) are always out of your control no matter how well you treat people. Currently, the labor force is nearly non existent. I don’t think I’d recommend it. We also own gas station/convenience stores and property. Majority of cash flow comes from gas stations. If you do decide to open a restaurant, even a franchise, understand that there is a honeymoon period. Pay down as much debt as possible during this time and don’t just spend money like it’s always going to be coming in."
2021-04-30 10:20:13,stocks,"These two options are polar opposites. 

In order to be successful at running a business you need to have a passion for whatever it is you are doing. Because at least at first, you will make mistakes. Even if you buy an already running business do you see obvious(to you) ways to improve margin or sales?  If not why would you be buying someone else’s dream. 

You also have to be prepared for things that may unexpectedly happen. How many small business owners were crushed by the actions to stop corona this last year?  Nobody really could have been prepared for a year of quarantine. I’m sure many small business owners were stressed most of this last year. 

Also I don’t think you can guarantee a profit from any business. The consumer is fickle and what is making money this year may not attract customers next year. 

Investing in a portfolio is passive income and while you wouldn’t be able to net the deductions a business has, it would be stress free as the money rolls in. 

However, Investing in the market is NOT a steady 10% income. You will see down years in the future.  Or, even just slower growth of 2 or 3 %."
2021-04-30 10:21:11,stocks,"10% return over how long is the question, if you are thinking in any kind of short term that is unlikely.   

Depends on the business, if you have low overhead and a good service/product it is better imo. You have control of something I guess you would enjoy and do well. However a restaurant is one of the worst businesses to be in for money. I know a lot of people that are in it/got into thinking it would be better than their previous ventures. It is a hard business with low margins and especially nowadays very easy to lose everything."
2021-04-30 10:24:36,stocks,"From my experience both have risk.  Your big portfolio could take a massive hit and turn into a medium sized one.  It could have great years and bad years.  
But restaurant is also tricky.  My family was on the business for 30 years (I spent as much time in the back of a restaurant as I did in school during my younger years). 
A restaurant requires good employees, which can be hard to find.  It can be profitable if you do it right and get a loyal fan base.  But it has the same risk as everything else.  My family had a chain of 5 locations.  One burnt down when the plaza it was in caught on fire.  The insurance company fought like hell not to pay, and it hurt because it was our most profitable location. That hurt things, then covid hit and the business was destroyed.    Luckily I had already gotten out of the business and started a new one of my own I'm a different field. 

Also, a restaurant will require your attention constantly.  You need to plan on being there open to close everyday of the week.  Or have another person that you trust to watch over.  If not employees will take advantage"
2021-04-30 10:26:18,stocks,"Something like 90 percent of businesses fail in the first year.  It's a very difficult thing to do. 

You can so everything right and still fail. 

 Some people are very successful, some people  do well enough, and some end up being owned by their business.

 Keep your money in my opinion."
2021-04-30 10:29:18,stocks,"Yes, still stressful, but less headaches"
2021-04-30 10:29:26,stocks,"People seem to forget that 10% each year isn’t feasible long term. The last few years have been good, but that doesn’t mean the next 30 will be.

2 mil would be nice to have but that’s definitely not retirement money for many people these days. You mentioned restaurant owners, that’s probably the worst business you can have if you care about profit. It’s also too broad of a question because a restaurant owner bring home 100k in Kentucky is was better off than an owner bringing in 100k in New York.

I have friends who own manufacturing, trucking, and construction companies, they’re all doing extremely well.

Another consideration is control. As a small investor, you only control where you put your money, nothing else. Yeah, you have voting rights, but let’s be realistic here, your 1000 shares don’t have much pull. As a business owner, you have full control over everything. My friend with a manufacturing company has experimented with different products over the years and found what worked well for him. He also employs like half his family at this point so he’s providing others with a good income as well. He had rough patches, but implemented some changes and got out of them. If your investments aren’t doing well, your only two choices are wait or sell at a loss."

No one should work harder than they have to and with that kind of money invested properly you dont have to work. That's me though if the goal is to win the game of capitalism you may need to work harder. Me I like to play the game of life and that means when I can comfortably sustain myself with least amount of work possible I win."
2021-04-30 10:31:57,stocks,"I mean, I am neither a 2 million portfolio owner nor a business owner, but consider that if you're choosing between a balanced portfolio versus a single business for your cashflow, then only one of those offers any diversification. With a business, leaving aside the fact that you'll likely need to do some work on it, you're fully exposed to the ups and downs of it's market segment. 

Just one persons opinion but fully passive and reasonably diversified income is like the gold standard for me and I'd gladly accept reduced returns / reduce my expenditure to be able to live off of passive income if that was practical, verus higher returns for something more involved"

I've seen restaurants owners over pay themselves and do very little work. The staff eventually finds out and this demotivates them."

If you're talking about $2m in stocks or in real estate, that's a more equal comparison. And outside of restaurants, I would say owning a business is more risky but also has a higher possible return. Though if you're passionate about the business you start, I would say that probably shifts the calculus as well. 

Personally, I'd go real estate or ETF/index funds."

For one, it's exponentially less stress, effort and grants me far more free time.

So why do I do it? Angel investing supports early start ups that otherwise might not see their ideas get to market. People with brilliant minds and grand visions deserve a leg up.

And why do I own a business? It creates jobs, it gives people benefits and keeps people motivated. I'm hands-off the business but angel investing requires that I act as an advisor and mentor.

Start off with a food cart. I have a neighbor who sells hot dogs outside of Indy league baseball games and he hauls $500 a night with a cart he paid $1000 for. 

Margins are razor thin (often less than 10%) in the restaurant business. Food has become more expensive due to supply chain and labor costs. There’s also more incentive right now for people to collect unemployment rather than pay their liabilities.

So if your argument is $2M in sales generating $200k profit then you've got a very margin rich industry AND you have to be able to maintain those sales YoY"

2021-04-30 11:41:42,stocks,Hey buddy. This is a good question and it should always be taken into account when considering an investment as it is with businesses. When business analyze future revenue they do it at a discount rate. That discount rate is essentially the hurdle you must achieve to not be losing out by having your money elsewhere. Companies often use 9 or 10% discount. You should always discount your future cash flow when evaluating a business decision.

2021-04-30 12:24:55,stocks,"Unless you really love the restaurant business and know the ins and outs, I wouldn't get in it. And I mean everything, from washing dishes, to hosting tables, being a server, bartender, alcohol, cooking, knowing recipes. Especially if I have a 2 million dollar portfolio, I think they are better more secure businesses out there. People get into restaurants because they like restaurants (who doesn't?), but don't realize the low margins.

My family was in the restaurant business, and while they made pretty good money (300k to 450k a year), it was 6 days a week, 12 hours, coming home at 1 am at the earliest. They wanted all the kids to get office jobs even they it was less money. I thought about doing it myself, but I wasn't sure I was cut out for it. I chose the easier path (9 to 5 with investing). I liked everything about the business but the cooking part lol. While I'm not making that much money, I'm also not stressed out and I like the idea that I could cut my job anytime and move to another city.

And as a child, I hated that my family was in the restaurant business. They didn't believe in baby sitters, so I'd get stuck there on weekends while all my friends were playing sports and having fun.

Not trying to discourage you. But just saying if you just want to open a business to make money, I don't think a restaurant is the best option. If you love everything about the restaurant and think you can be successful and be happy doing it, go for it! Especially if you have good friends and family that you think would want to join you. It can be fun. Sometimes I regret not sticking with it, because as I got older I liked the night life and even the money as an upscale restaurant server was pretty decent. So being an owner could have been good money. But I wasn't sure if I could be the head honcho if the head chef is sick, then I need to step up. Or limited vacations. Trusting the people below me while I am gone (it's VERY easy to steal and take from a locally owned restaurant)"

All small businesses have a 50% failure rate at year 5, so it is the absolute worst performing segment of business you can get into. The people who succeed in the industry do so by not using their own money, but by bringing in investors and plan for a 3-4 year cycle. Bring in investors, keep 20% equity for yourself, pay yourself a salary while you open, run, then close the business. Liquidate, rinse, repeat. The only ones that do well consistently own their buildings outright or are supported financially by the hotel they are in, and even those seldom make the 5 year mark. If you are a hands off owner and not a day to day manager, then the numbers get even worse for you. As a hands on owner and manager, expect 12-14 hour days, 6-7 days a week, and all holidays are your busy periods, so you need to plan on sitting out this time with family.

2021-04-30 13:06:03,stocks,"So I think the question here is a little flawed. And I'm not seeing comments considering what I consider a valuable piece of this puzzle.

Most resturants are opened off of less than $250k so you might be looking at this scenario after the tipping point where its definately worth it to live off of investments.

From my experience working with business owners and thumbing through a couple franchise magazines a single restraunt thats well run (generating revenue of approx $1m/yr in USD) can generate 30-60k/year in net income. And thats after the salary of a general manager is accounted for. So assumping you want to finance a resturant and then let it run completely hands off and just collect your check you could see returns of 12-20% ROI (you could also have bad years and lose money too!)

But the big factor here is that when you own a business. you can sell it! Most businesses in this space can sell for between 1.5-2.5x annual revenue so you need to account for the fact that a business thats thriving is also a valuable asset that could be converted to hard cash.

Personally I think the business worth 2m is more valuable than 2m of stocks because not only can you make an income but you also support an entire group of peoples income benefiting your local society in the process of living off your own investments."

2021-04-30 13:29:26,stocks,Interesting question! Enjoying the responses
2021-04-30 13:30:57,stocks,"Your proposed average 10% return (yielding $200k) is very different from the ***safe withdrawal rate***.

You could in theory take out 10% of your portfolio every year, but even if that portfolio would average 10% returns over the long haul, you would very, very likely deplete that portfolio.

Some years are big booms, others are busts, and sometimes the stock market spikes but the returns are not real (example A: the stock market has risen by 30% in the past 365 days, but the fed has also printed an additional 30% of the money supply in roughly the same timeframe. These are probably not real returns, as we have yet to see the inflationary kickbacks of the government 'bailing us out' in the pandemic).

Most people put the safe withdrawal rate somewhere around 4%, give or take. A 2 million portfolio would yield you $80k/year indefinitely, and the portfolio would likely continue to grow over your lifetime. This would help you adjust that 80k upwards as dollars get inflated over time, so you have a true 80k in spending ever year into the future.

IMO, anything *aggressively* above the 4% withdrawal rate is probably asking for trouble (my hot take, 6+%). Your portfolio will take a bigger hit from withdraws in the down years, and will struggle to recover when large sums are taken out year over year.

&#x200B;

Disclaimer: For anyone responding with arguments that 6+% safe withdraw rate can be achieved because of some unusual circumstances (i.e. *I am super smart, manage my own stock portfolio, and have beaten the market my whole life*) this post is not for you. OP seems to fall into the layman category based on his/her post."

I would put $1m in ARCC as their dividend has been consistent with 10% annual.  I would split the other $1m in 2.  I would focus on two growth companies with massive growth and catalyst coming.  Wash and repeat and add $1m to my ARCC every year or half year never taking that investment out with guaranteed dividend.  

I will be investing in depreciating assets to offset my income from this year.  (rentals/houses) adding more llcs under those assets, each being their own business and asset.

Figure, next year you could have $6m. $3m in ARCC equates to $300k annually to start your business or businesses not even touching the principal.

The sweet part is pretty obvious but you feel lost waking up the next morning having nothing to do.

Call it 7% average annual return from the stock market, and then a reasonable comparison for a business worth actually getting into in my opinion is at least 20% margin.  I think food related businesses like restaurants can be low margin but 20%+ exists elsewhere, just not easy from what I can tell based on the businesses that are being sold.  The second question is, how much of your life then becomes a business expense that you can then deduct against taxes.  I don't see much in the way of business out there that I could reasonably succeed in versus the guaranteed 7% of passive income from stocks although this would be different for everyone, based on a variety of factors."
2021-04-30 17:18:04,stocks,"You’re not going to be consistently making 10%

Maybe 6% and more likely 4% when you account for inflation.  It’s only 10% when you’re willing to draw down the principle to guarantee earnings.

What naturally motivates you? Break this into two categories - 1) Freetime 2) Community or value to society

If you see no motivation to provide a service that satisfies a need or to a service that expresses yourself in a society, local or otherwise, then I'd invest it and focus on the shit you want to do without the demand to churn a thing.

If you're motivated to build something, nature it, grow it and get entrenched in that work then invest that money into a brick and mortar you love. 

The ROI should be less of a concern beyond your own cost of living, cost of entertainment and the ability to grow your net worth.

More importantly is feeding what makes you tick."

2021-04-30 18:33:11,stocks,I think it really depends on the business. Owning a restaurant is hard and I have known people lose it all owning a restaurant. I have also seen people becoming rich off a restaurant do to serving a specific population and having a great location as well as food. If you are trying to start a business in the food industry for the first time you are probably better off leaving that much money in your portfolio vs going into the unknown and make a restaurant. Just my opinion.
2021-04-30 18:33:18,stocks,"Been in the restaurant business over 10 years and Ive worked every position from dish to management. I can safely say restaurants are already in a bubble thats about to burst. Not only is it a terrible idea if you don't have serious experience but like I said its a bubble.  A lot of people think ""I have the money I can just hire good people"". The problem is without that experience you wont actually know what good people are and they will notice your inexperience and inability to play the owner role and will want a lot more salary in return.

Say your chefs gotten lazy. Youre going to need to sit there after hours and go over how to gut a grill, how to clean a fryer, how to pull down hoods, how to scrub an oven while its baking hot, how to remove carbon from metal, ect. You basically need to be the onsite expert in all categories otherwise you will almost always get taken advantage of. When you notice people are cutting corners you have to kind of be the bad guy who stays on site with them and goes over how to do everything just to drive the point home.

During Obamas presidency so many service sector jobs were created. The problem? People are leaving in droves. Most people thought they could eventually move into management, the problem is management often pays lower than say serving or bartending and on top of that you only need so many managers. Service sector is dead end for the average employee. Theres only so much room to move up and only so much money to be made.

I live in one of the biggest tourist economies in the country and places are shutting down left and right despite how busy things are now that we've reopened. Between uber and the back to regular life rush the workload is so high and no one can really afford to pay more. People are simply moving on. They arent going to significantly more work for the same pay. Beyond that the customers that do come in are generally fucking nuts and have become way beyond entitled. I havent seen customers this crazy in my entire time in the business. Everyone's stressed out and venting it out on servers and generally starting to treat them like indentured servants vs servers.

Season is almost year round now that were a state thats reopened but no one can find cooks. The stress of your production team actually failing just isnt worth it and that leads to servers and bartenders also quitting. Cooking is by far the hardest position to last in when it comes to high volume and offers the least reward. It really isnt shocking cooks are just leaving in droves. People often forget cooks produce the main product that attracts customers, they are the core and backbone of the restaurant. Without good food you are nothing.  


Edit: typo"
2021-04-30 18:59:08,stocks,I am in a similar boat but smaller in size lol. My wife and I both make a combine of 225k in salary and had saved up 350k. We invested that last year n turned it into 500k. Now what we have been thinking is to make 10% of 500k each year as a side income. We had thought about getting a small business too but with one kid it wud be very stressful to have a business n manage home. I think getting 10% return even in a bear market could be done with patience. If greed/fomo can be controlled then 10% seems very reasonable so we are planning to do that. Let's see if we can do that year after year but so far this year we have realized 33k profit on it already.
2021-04-30 19:04:42,stocks,"It all depends. Some bars and restaurants print money. Most fail. Likewise many investors can far outpace 10% but most are in the single digits.

So yes owning $2000000 of stocks is definitely better than owning a business."

I haven't owned a small business, but I've known several small business *owners* and while they would never admit it, I could tell they all kinda hated it. Most businesses have a laundry list of things to do and if you're not paying someone else to do them, then the boss does them at 9pm or later. Do this often enough and your social life goes down the toilet, which causes frustration and irritability. You have to live for your job.

Compare this to simply having a portfolio, you're still 'working' ideally by researching and following investments, but if you aren't 100% in risky bets then you can reasonably disconnect from the world and have no responsibilities."

&#x200B;

As we are potentially pushing into the ""lost decade"" Japan-style across the developed world with the following risk factors  


* Massive ageing population - any growth instantly goes back into feeding and clothing the old
* Low-interest rate
* Low GDP growth

To assume the future will continue to yield 10% growth per year as the past did is absurd. No economy/stock market continues to grow indefinitely at 10%, eventually, the growth will slow. The 50s-90s were an entirely different time when the US was able to exert its influence as a global hegemon, with China and most of the developing worlds stuck eating shit off the ground. That's not the case anymore, America is not a young growth economy you're not going to be able to just close your eyes throw it into S&P and just pray it'll go up (it might because of asset hyperinflation with the billions the FEDs threw into the market in terms of commercial bonds but if that happens you aren't really buying anything fun with your toilet paper money).

Most businesses are risky and low margin and a ton of headache. But some are already set up for success by someone else and the main reason more people don’t do them is the entry barriers. $2m solves those barriers."
2021-04-30 08:57:40,stocks,"> make an average ish 10% return 

Yeah, no. Plan on 6 or 7%, not 10%. Then to make sure that it is growing, and not shrinking against inflation you need to leave \~2-3% of the growth in the account to keep pace and not get devalued. 

It is not $200k per year you can skim, it is more along the lines of $100k before taxes. Assuming you are in the 15% cap gains bracket, you are taking home $85K of that $100k, and that is before you look at other costs like fees on your account, or whatnot. 

I would personally prefer to wake up tomorrow with $2 million in my brokerage account, but that does not mean if I had $2 million I would keep it all in the market and not look into diversifying into other income streams like rental properties, a restaurant franchise, or a diagnostic lab."

2021-04-30 11:24:10,stocks,Stocks are a business and even if you make 10% dividends that’s technically like company revenue. Just imagine you are a firm who invests money. Technically you could become a business just have to register. 10% annually on 2 million is 200k before taxes which to me as the CEO of a 2 million $ company is quite a lot considering this is the amount like Coca Cola CEOs make.

Unless you love it, stay away from owning a restaurant. My wife and I love being around each other. She's my best friend. I love chatting with customers, cooking... and the best, at the end of the day you feel good like you accomplished something. However, if your heart is not in it you will die a slow painful death. Owning a restaurant is a passion not a job. You won't make millions but if you surround yourself with good people, run a tight ship and be open to ideas it's extremely rewarding. On a side note, during the early years of owning our place I still worked in the construction industry. I did both jobs. Long long days. I eventually worked my way up to (in the last year I was there) a base salary of 133k a year plus, bens and bonus. I left that job to go full time into the deli with my wife. I prayed for months before making the move, and was scared shitless. You get used to buying ""stuff."" Within weeks my whole demeanor changed. I felt young again and alive. Less is sometimes more. Long story short do what you love and you won't regret it."

She does own the property now, so that is is a nice nest egg, but liquidating 'the business' would be like saying, hey how much you want to pay me for this 75k/ year job with infinite hours and responsibility?  She's put managers in place so she can work less hours, but still those fuckers come and go and don't work out, so she'll never truly stop ""running it."""

Then again 2 mil is ridiculous overkill for starting a restaurant, he could easely get both options which makes it seem he is not well versed in any of them.

Heck I'm pretty sure he could start a business from the % the portfolio would make. Most people I know would be astonished to have even 100k to start a restaurant, people pull ropes and make it happen with a lot less"

Isn't there also a known thing that 90-95% of restaurants (or mabye small business in general?) fail and have to shut down within 12 months?

And as far as which is better, I guess it depends on what you like. If you don't like being hands on day in and day out, then investing is good since it's sort of passive.

But if you don't mind working 24/7 and the stress that comes with owning a small business, then that is good option especially since depending on the kind of business you go for, you could get much higher returns. 

That said, running a small business is though. You are never ""off the clock"". You're always working. It's a lot of stress and hard work. You are the boss. The buck stops with you, so anything goes wrong, you are on the hook. 

At the end of the day, like most other things in life, they each have their own advantages and disadvantages."

My thought is, if I build my own ""bank"" then maybe I can have a fully developed (maybe profitable is a better word) business before needing outside financing.

To your point, I think the point (at least in part) of money is to create the future. Sometimes the future has a shitty ROI while you're alive, and you need a better motivator than wealth."

2021-04-30 09:51:47,stocks,Dividends are still taxed as income though. I'd rather just keep it in an index fund and sell off periodically. 10% vs what 25+ (depending on where you live)?
2021-04-30 10:45:25,stocks,I think the strategy of just selling 4% of your portfolio per year is also a sound one. I'm skeptical of dividend chasing because they can vary and that can lead you to ignore overall stock growth (like maybe it pays a high dividend but it's growth is questionable).
2021-04-30 12:12:14,stocks,"Good luck with 5%, particularly after tax these days. But yeah, even if it is more like 30-40k a year that is still nice in covering lots of costs"

You’ll see that for many years it was up 20%, some years only 5%, which is why the average is 10%.

You have to pay your cooks a competitive wage if you want them to be good at their job and continue to work for you. Whatever you don’t hire out you have to do yourself. You can’t make a host serve or a server cook. If a manager has to serve, bus, or cook then you have to manage. If you don’t want to manage you better make damn sure you pay somebody handsomely to be your general manager and then you have to make sure they actually care about their job. Passion is not guaranteed at any position in a restaurant. If your servers are not hospitable then it doesn’t matter how good your food is. If your busboys are not motivated to move fast then your guest count gets lower. If you go on a two hour wait and your kitchen crashes then you lose the people that were waiting to come in and your night basically ends there. I could go on if I felt like thinking harder.

If you set a lifestyle that spends 10% of your principal annually, and you hit a decade like the 2000s, congratulations your bank account is now at $0.

Edit: it's tempting to set up an Excel spreadsheet that starts at an arbitrary point in time with $2 million and tracks the S&P500, then compares what would happen if you spent 4% of the fund each year vs. 10% (or a fixed $80k vs a fixed $200k), but it's well past midnight here.

2021-04-30 12:04:31,stocks,"No. I mean the safest way to do it is to live only on the earnings every year. You need to keep enough money in the investment so it can keep earning to give you funding for the next year, etc. only problem is that because you need that money to live you don’t want to put all of it in a risky investment. You’ll want to park a large chunk in something safer which automatically implies lower reliable returns. 

Instead of 10% returns per year, you’re better off planning 5% or something like that so all of a sudden that $2mm portfolio can only counted on for $100K per year (before taxes)."
2021-04-30 13:13:03,stocks,Normally it's not about principal and earnings but about choosing a safe withdrawal rate.  I mean there are years where you'll have no earnings at all so what are you going to live on then?  There have been studies that say you can withdraw 4% consistently for the rest of your life and never run out of money.  There have been other studies that say if you're willing to withdraw less in bad markets then you can withdraw more than 4% in good markets.  It also depends on what level of risk you're willing to take.  If withdrawing 8% means you have a 30% chance of living off of nothing but social security at 70 then that's not the worst thing in the world and maybe you're OK with that.

A line of tickets that would take him an hour I could clear in 10 minutes and move on to the next station. I guess he came to the restaurant to learn high volume but all he did was argue. The sad thing was is all his training did was make him stubborn about shit. Every chef does things different and you have to go along with that. If you know a better way to do something by all means do it but some people will just have it backfire repeatedly and blame everyone else.   


He really didnt understand the front of house or basic things like why you cant take 10 minutes to put together a single plate. He would get complete tunnel vision and had absolutely no hope of being able to take control of a line and actually lead his team to success. I know he recently opened a restaurant because hes been begging me to work for him for the past year.

2021-04-30 16:56:11,stocks,"> What income during a bear market? How do you suppose it has been for property landlords the last year in which tenants couldn't pay, and laws gave no recourse?

The last year with associated eviction and notice period extensions has been pretty damn unusual, even for a market down-turn. Landlords with mortgaged (particularly highly mortgaged) properties had real trouble in the last property cycles when house prices dropped and secular changes in rental demand may have worked against them at the same time. But residential property income in non-rural areas is pretty damn stable compared to risky small companies or stock prices. 

> Unlucky? Hardly.

Yeah, unlucky. The bad luck is getting an asshole tenant, or one who makes you drag them all the way through the court process and get bailiffs to evict. That is not usual if you have selected your tenants (and property) carefully. If it happens despite that, that is bad luck. Like PLUG investors getting whacked by accounting problems.  Due diligence isn't just for stocks. 

> Almost like dividends?

Dividends per share dropped by ~24% per share in 2008. But rather more problematically for this scenario, many people also generally rely on selling a portion of their portfolio growth to make 'income'. 

> That's the problem. It ""seems"" like it, but isn't.

We're going to disagree here, just because I knew plenty of landlords back in 2008, and they all did fine. The house price plummet in many areas was a problem if you planned to sell, or if you had a high LTV mortgage; if you didn't it wasn't the same sort of oh-no situation as somebody wanting to sell their property or their portfolio."

To me money is like an oven.

I love pizza, ovens help me make the pizza, i don't have a relationship with the oven. I have a relationship with pizza.

The oven is just a tool, if i can make pizza another way, i'd make pizza another way.

That's the way I see money. Money is an oven.

A tool that is sometimes helpful in getting me what I need/want.

Money is great as much as it lets me do what I want.

If you promise me tons of money but to get it, I have to sacrifice what I want, then I would obviously refuse.

Money is just a meaningless digital stuff in the air that's useful for doing tangible stuff like being able to spend more time with your family/kids, maybe being able to do volunteer work or being able to write a book or spend more time on your hobbies etc.

Landlords with mortgaged (particularly highly mortgaged) properties had real trouble in the last property cycles when house prices dropped and secular changes in rental demand may have worked against them at the same time. But residential property income in non-rural areas is pretty damn stable compared to risky small companies or stock prices.

Not really unusual.  Good landlords have difficult all the time.  Over and over and over and over.  

Find what you think is the best income property deal.  I guarantee you I can find twenty stocks that trounced it.  

Even your hottest income property would take weeks to transact, with thousands or millions in costs.  And it would be highly dependent on a there being a qualified greater fool in the exact right time and place.

> Yeah, unlucky. The bad luck is getting an asshole tenant, or one who makes you drag them all the way through the court process and get bailiffs to evict. 

That's not bad luck.  That's a highly predictable result based on the realities and probabilities of the situation.  Most people with loads of assets and stable income aren't month-to-month renters.  So your plan is already pre-selected for problems.  


> That is not usual if you have selected your tenants (and property) carefully. 

Lol.  Tell my landlord acquaintances to ""select better tenants"" when their units are sitting vacant and they have no applicants, save for a couple with fraud convictions already.  How do you choose the best when the best aren't applying?

I owned 25% of that startup.  This last one is still around and they are working towards a production release, the valuation was by a VC firm when raising funds so it's fairly legit based on IP and potential profit valuation.

The stumbling block was that I delivered the agreed on technology for my equity share and the two main founders felt I should just have to continue making the new improvements they decided were needed before going to market and I said I needed a salaried position to continue to provide enhancements since I was tired of working 100 hour weeks.  Ultimately I went from 7.5% to 5% ownership just to not get it tied up in courts because the two main founders have money and absolutely would do shit like that.  I figure $1 million without a fight is a lot better than $1.5 million with a fight considering it may never actually materialize.

Mate, I'm pretty sure that given that I was peripherally involved in the advertising process for new tenants and building management for half of them, I'd have noticed. I even vaguely remember visiting a few apartment building properties around then because special arrangements got made for one very long-term tenant who lost her job, got ill, and her flat didn't quite work for receiving housing benefits (nice lady, and we sorted it. An unusual heart-warming moment).

I'm not claiming ""all landlords did fine"". I even gave two examples of groups who didn't.

The point isn't maximising growth (though hindsight always wine anyway). The point is a relatively stable income stream that is, while not independent of the market, at least not directly affected the same way. With taxes where I am/was you don't get property flippers the same way really either. The time it takes to complete a sale may be annoying but is hardly a deal-breaker for such a long-term hold.

> Not really unusual. Good landlords have difficult all the time. Over and over and over and over.
...
> That's not bad luck. That's a highly predictable result based on the realities and probabilities of the situation. 

I mean, if we're talking about predictable results and probabilities- yeah, there's a reason we're so obsessed with vacancy rates in an area, and demographic changes/population movement for buys, etc. You certainly shouldn't pre-dispose yourself to problems. And even if you think you didn't, and you pick good tenants, and do everything right... Yeah, you may have problems anyway. Rather like picking under-performing stocks! Or putting too much money in a bank that went belly-up.

2021-04-30 13:28:02,stocks,"An idea sure. This all depends on what kind restaurant we're talking. Are you hiring a chef or a kitchen manager? A chef isn't gonna want to share menu writing responsibilities and whatnot in most cases. 

If you're hiring a KM then all the menu creation is on the owner. Most owners think they know what they're doing. I mean its just food right? But you're talking recipes and procedures for every item you sell. Its a lot and most owners who aren't familiar with the industry go for low budget which usually decreases your margins. So unless the owner is familiar with the industry and knows what they want to do and how they want to do it, you need a chef to at least guide you. Otherwise you end up with upper management who resents you for your ignorance of the industry. 

Been in kitchens for 15 years. It's really obvious to see the owners who know what they're doing and want to be there and help vs the owners that just see dollar signs.

2021-04-30 04:58:54,stocks,What im saying is if you give bad advice on GME you cant be trusted to give good advice regarding stocks. You need some experience in the sock market to give good financial advice. If you only started trading in January 2021 because of GME there is a good chance that you dont know what you are talking about.
2021-04-30 11:23:12,stocks,"DIV. Is a dividend ETF. So you you know there whole thing is long term. They ain't gonna stop paying a dividend, and it's a basket so it's not at risk of the company going under. I also like to put big names in there. I scooped up BABA, not a dividend, but something I intend to hold long term. Same as DIS. they have frozen the dividend I believe while they get the streaming platform up and running. Otherwise BAC is another I hold. 

I don't advise any of those, but those are what I like. I am not really a dividend person. Most of my money is actually in super risky stuff. Try Joe Carlson on youtube; https://youtu.be/lZQrc7nN17Y I like keeping up with what he's at (dividend portfolio). 

Otherwise, my advice is think about your timeframes. This is an account for like 20+ years. So you want stuff that isn't going to irrelevant by then and not just a fad. I chose DIS for example because in 20+ years if Disney is gone I will eat my entire wardrobe of clothes. Those fuckers would need to be killed like twice, in a ritual circle, while rolling straight 6's 🎲🎲🎲

Edit: also if this 10k is more than say you can invest the rest of the year; like if you intend to invest another 2k for a total of 12k by end of year, I would also scale in if possible. Else you may end up dumping In 90% of your portfolio at the wrong time, and then DCAing is gona take you a lot of time and effort. Aka, invest at a steady pace that matches what you earn, not what you simply have available at the time."

What would make a difference is the number of people who could invest in the company and those purchases would clearly drive up market cap.   Most people can’t do fractional trading, and $3500 per share isn’t possible for the average investor.

I'm by no means educated here. I'm only piecing stuff together as I go"
2021-04-30 02:32:51,stocks,"Not that kind of deduction. Investment income is taxed as income, either long term or short term. It's net proceeds so add it together and pay taxes if it's positive. In op's example there's no gain so no tax.

I personally don’t like to trim and instead hold mine for the long haul. I also don’t like moving in and out of undervalued stocks and am fine owning durable stable growing companies. That’s a personal preference though.

I’ve found over the years that I do better owning a few amount of stocks I know very well than a scattershot approach. 

Personally I think the efficient frontier is a bunch of hogwash right now and owning bonds in this environment is insanity. The theory made sense when you were getting a real return on bonds.

Let’s say I want to buy a call option for 90 days from today. Let’s say stock zxc is at 100$. Is it better to get the call for 102.50$ in 90 days or the call for 110$ in 90 days?

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"APHA & TLRY Merger Forgive me, I am just too confused, and am hoping to receive some clarity on this merger.

I understand the terms of the merger, or, should I say, the reverse merger.

Aphria is absorbing Tilray, but the APHA ticker will change to TLRY. There will be 7 original Aphria board members, only 2 original Tilray board members, and the CEO of Aphria will remain the CEO. So, it's really Aphria, just rebranded as ""Tilray.""

I keep reading advice that encourages ""buy Aphria stock, even ahead of the merger, just in case the Aphria shareholders vote against the merger.""

However, in my opinion, the merger is more than likely going to happen. And, assuming it does, the TLRY ticker is what you're going to want in your portfolio. NOT APHA. Especially considering the disadvantageous 1 to 0.8381 conversion from APHA to TLRY.

Assuming the merger happens, the masses are only going to be ecstatic about the merger and buy more TLRY stock (ahead of the very possible positive earnings in the next couple years). I just don't see the price of TLRY tanking any time soon. Especially long term, where Tilray will probably start turning positive revenue.

To me - there are bear factors to keep in mind, as there always are - but there's far more bull factors that are playing in Tilray's favor.

I'm long-term bullish on Tilray AND TLRY's price. Is there a piece of information I'm missing or don't understand? That may change my mind about Tilray?"

I'm under the impression that there'll be an artificial rise in TLRY right after the news. Then a steady return to normalcy, and then start to climb again once revenue starts to turn positive in a few years.

I don't disagree they are all monsters still growing, but do you think your money is better elsewhere, especially if you're like me, and have a 30-40 year timeline?

If you do, what stocks in particular do you have in mind? I personally think TSM,ON,AMD,etc will have higher returns long term."

I actually think in a pullback these will fare better than a lot of people think. I sold a lot of my value stocks (LMT, VZ, BTI, MRK, etc) and feel much better sitting in Amazon and Microsoft.

I think TSM is a great business and is a juggernaut right now. One option is you just buy a small bucket of stocks and don’t look at this as either-or. The two industries I know very well are cloud tech and semiconductors and I own more of Amazon than anything else followed by Microsoft.

Edit: I’d much rather own a company that fails most of their acquisition pursuits, it is an indicator they’re willing to walk away and not overpay.

2021-04-30 16:09:59,stocks,"No doubt they have a pretty strong moat, but that won't necessarily translate into very high growth in the future. I'm not saying that the growth will be bad, but I just think that there are other companies in the advertising sector that have better growth opportunities ahead of them. My biggest growth conviction in the advertising sector is Pinterest; I think that they have much more growth opportunity ahead of them in the coming years than Google does at this point.

And then looking outside of the advertising sector, I just don't have as much confidence in Google's ability to successfully execute into new profitable areas as much as I do with the other Big Tech companies given their track record over the last decade and nothing gives me reason to believe that this will change. Google tries to do so many things, but unlike the other Big Tech companies, they haven't had any big success with any new thing that they have tried in a very long time and have just been living off of the success of things that they created over a decade ago. And then they end up killing off so many of their products after only a few years which I think is also beginning to create a trust problem. Why should I, as a customer, invest any of my time and/or money into new Google products when given their track record there is a high likelihood that they will just kill it off in a few years before it even has time to mature? I think that this, along with increasing privacy concerns, will hurt Google's ability to get customers to trust them with their new products in the future; we have already started to see this trust problem with things like Stadia when from the moment it is announced people are already talking about how long will it be until Google kills it off."

2021-04-30 04:32:22,stocks,"This resonated with me: 

Tesla's plan is not to be a big EV company. They already innovated with EV years ago. It panned out into reality and changed the market, and it has been going excellently for them for quite some time now. But we're at today, not then, and Tesla is in the business of pushing for innovation around breakthrough ideas. What could such an idea be for today then?

I believe their plan is to be the first to realize the SMART (autonomous) CAR, together with a broad-scale DISTRIBUTED and SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE. Think car that a) drives you where you want to be, b) takes off to find a spot on its own, c) goes to recharge if necessary at a supercharger hub which is d) owned by Tesla with power provided by its own network, power storage, and generation, and e) the car drives back to pick you up when you want it.

And that's why Tesla is focusing on autonomy + energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities by selling batteries and roofs here and there, or making advanced driver assists. It's the start to GROWING into something groundbreakingly different as a company, and they are again going to be the FIRST to do it, thus having a good chance of dominating the future market.

Pretty much like the back then ""overpriced"" Amazon who ""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world"" as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets one HAS to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain **tarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)

2021-04-29 22:08:45,stocks,"There is zero doubt that it's overvalued.  Some analysts have the fair price at $435.  But it's fair to be overvalued if buyers believe in its future.  And so many do.  And to be honest it's not really that far overvalued.  

But unless you're long on the stock (and willing to tie up money for a while) a lot of people get antsy when it stops growing at 10% a day, week, etc.  

It was kind of natural/healthy for it to stall a while and likely trade sidewise for at least a while. 

I'm actually not a holder, but I think only a fool would think that Elon/Tesla won't be one of the dominant EV/battery/solar players for sometime to come and that very good returns are in its the future."

2021-04-29 23:15:18,stocks,"In terms of valuation it's hype.

People do like their cars though. You can like something without investing in a company."
2021-04-30 15:55:31,stocks,"i think tesla is great but just insanely insanely overvalued. they are the leading manufacturer of evs, but volkswagen is making a lot of evs too and they can ramp up production way easier than tesla. vw will probably sell half or a little less the evs tesla will sell this year, but vw is worth far less than half of what tesla is.
but people are also pricing in robotaxis, solar, and energy storage. i have been studying autonomous driving hardware over the past few months, and i think tesla might have played themselves in going for a pure camera based system, and elon recently said that the front radar will be removed as well. take lucid or rivian for example. both have way more cameras and radars around their cars, with lucid even including a lidar, but are only aiming for level 2 to level 3, whereas tesla is aiming for level 5 with less sensors and cameras. theoretically, tesla is right, since we humans do indeed drive purely with sight, our eyes. however, the software of teslas cameras and image recognition must be god tier in order to actually work wella and accurately without the assistance of any additional radars and potentially lidar. radars are purpose built, just plug it in and write a simple code and it will work like its supposed to. training and programming a camera is far more difficult and requires an insane amount of software, as well as ultra powerful conputers to handle that much image processing. having radars and maybe lidars could alleviate some of that stress as well as reduce the risk of some errors in the software of the camera system. lidar is not necessary, like elon said, but having a pure camera system for level 5 is gonna be really really hard. plus i hate the fact that tesla didnt use a capacitive steering wheel for the current autonomous driving. its really dangerous, and i lost control of my car twice because of that. out of spec reviews dude also said something about that in his mach e review.
second is solar. this is where tesla really lost its edge. once tesla acquired solarcity, that business basically got cut in half and is stagnant. sunrun is by far the largest residential solar provider and has better business in the solar sector than tesla does.
lastly power storage. this is where i think tesla does have a decent potential of growth for. places like india for example have really unreliable electricity, and having clean energy plus a nice battery pack is really beneficial. powerwalls are included in this power storage.
i am a bearish bull of tesla, in a way. i have been a tesla fan since the original model s, kept telling everyone to buy teslas and invest in it (everyone listened to me except my own dad but thats irrelevant). i have a very early model 3 with full self driving (enhanced autopilot is by far the best system to buy, fsd is a ripoff). i have tesla solar with tesla powerwall. i have tesla merch, and a cybertruck reservation.
but will i buy another tesla? probably not. the fact that they are aiming for level 5 autonomous driving, and still dont have hands free driving while gm, ford, nissan, and a growing number of other manufacturers do is pretty sad. i bought fsd purely on the robotaxi idea so i could get some revenue from that. my favorite car now is the lucid air. by far the best ev architecture (900v, versus tesla 400v. hyundai and porsche use 800v which is still better than what tesla offers), best hardware setup for autonomous driving, really nice interior, and really good efficiency. its actually the the best ev money can buy. but i cant afford that, so my two options i am looking at are the mach e and the ioniq 5. no more tesla, mainly because i dont really trust that minimal hardware setup for autonomous driving. and fsd in city is useless anyways. for autonomous driving on the highway which is the most common use situation, there are so many systems that can do what tesla does, and some even better, such as gm super cruise, and now the ford blue cruise and maybe nissan propilot 2.0. and dont forget the startups lucid and rivian.
so even though tesla does have really good ev sales, lots of the things that are priced into their stock are going to be very hard to achieve. even though i am a tesla fan, and really like what they have done for the world, i dont see that valuation ever making sense.
edit: also those elon peepee suckers that think spacex and starlink are part of tesla are completely delusional."

Still, the hype train can certainly continue as long as the new products keep dropping every year regardless on when they come to fruition because investment sentiment still favors speculative growth. And this won't end until the music stops from the Fed."

They are having issues in China with protests and not being allowed onto certain highways and bridges and parking lots. That lady is not a one off of people complaining about Tesla quality, and the government seems to be putting pressure on them.

There are some marketing demos of it already on youtube.

Allegedly the reason intel/mobileye and Tesla ended their deal to supply Tesla's autopilot, was because Intel wasnt willing to make the claims Tesla was, and wasnt willing to have deaths on their hands like Tesla has.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"My friend wants to buy dividend stocks, then sell covered call options on them. Is this a good idea? For example he is looking at buying Telus shares. He wants to load up at least 100 of them before the record date in order to collect dividends. He then plans on writing a covered call on his 100 shares in hopes to get some boosted gains. If his strike price is perfectly set, and people buy his option but then expires worthless, he makes gains on the share price going up, as well as dividend payments AND the premium of the call option. Seems juicy!

My counter argument is that it limits his upside, and also potentially covers some losses if he sells the option and the stock drops. But besides those two factors, wouldn’t it just be better to buy and hold the same stock? That way you at least have the option to hold your shares or sell them."
2021-04-29 21:38:33,stocks,Typically the high div yield stocks have a very low IV and very low premium. Not that it should stop anyone.
2021-04-29 22:51:53,stocks,"Yep! I sell covered calls on all my positions, its a great and low risk way to generate modest returns and get a tiny bit of downside protection. Its also where most people get their start with options, then typically dabbling into cash secured puts to run the wheel strategy (sell puts until assigned the shares, then sell calls on that and repeat until the shares are called away and you sell puts again). I typically sell my cc's at .30 delta or lower. I also use long dated itm options (LEAPS) which don't decay as quickly as near dated ones to simulate a buy and hold strategy, then sell calls against that. This is known as ""poor man's covered calls"" and are the most profitable part of my portfolio. Its a synthetic/leveraged buy and hold strategy, I typically reinvest the short call profit into shares of the underlying. So instead of buying 100 AAPL shares, I buy 5 itm 2023 AAPL contracts and sell calls near term against those. That way I control more shares, typically 5 contracts at .7 delta (delta = move in the underlying aka if AAPL moves a dollar in either direction and I have 300 delta, I would make or lose 300 dollars). Perfect strategy to run on low volatility names like AAPL, MSFT, or etfs like SPY, QQQ, IWM, etc and great if you can't afford  a 1 lot (100 shares). I use it as an engine building way to build out my long positions, you can think of it like a DRIP approach on steroids. If you have questions about options and particularly selling options I highly recommend r/thetagang. I post all my trades there every day as well as at https://thetagang.com/RetireWithRyan if you're curious."
2021-04-30 03:40:41,stocks,"Or... when his shares get called away, he can start writing cash secured puts at a slightly lower strike weekly. Eventually the stock will dip briefly and he’ll have been paid to buy back his 100 shares. Rinse. Repeat. 

This is called the wheel, and it’s fucking fantastic."
2021-04-29 21:05:00,stocks,Sounds like an infinite money glitch. Literally can't go tits up
2021-04-29 21:10:43,stocks,"Yes it's called selling a covered call. Very common strategy. Sell delta around 30 with Days till expiry around 30-45 days close early about 2 weeks out or simply let expire. 

Before entering the long stock which has to be 100 shares to sell a call against it. 100 shares = 1 option contract. 

Sell a Put ATM collect premium untill assignment of the stock then sell OTM calls and collect premium untill stock called then rinse and repeat. 

Good to know the stock and it's fundamentals., Good to know options and the greeks, Good to know Technical Analysis. 

Good luck"

2021-04-30 10:55:04,stocks,"Also, if the stock starts creeping towards his strike and he doesn't want them exercised, he can always roll the call out and up. Ex. my safe NOK CCs yesterday 5/7 4.5 were suddenly going to be ITM, rolling (buying my contract back and selling a new one) up to 1 23 7c, the IV had suddenly popped due to volatility, allowing me a decent profit even though I had originally sold the 4.5 strike weeks ago for almost nothing."

Why not buy the high dividend stocks, use margin from those stocks to buy high flyers, and then write options on the high flyers to pay down the margin?

2021-04-30 00:52:46,stocks,"It’s not the worst idea TBH. I do this with T, which moves at glacier speed but carries a high dividend. The premium isn’t much but you’re collecting dividends at the same time.

One thing about dividend is be careful selling calls around the ex-dividend dates. Your call can be exercised early if the dividend payout is greater than the call’s value."

2021-04-30 08:44:55,stocks,"He won't do better than buy and hold in the long term unless he has good understanding of the companies he holds and of their  industries and  follows company events and wider market and macro factors. He'd ideally also have to combine long and short options strategies, which have different risk profiles and fat tails. Option strategies require quite a bit of work and analysis to be successful in the long run, so they are not an easy way to make money. In particular they require careful risk management with a quantitative bent, which most novice investors don't know how to do. I would recommend that he studies the subject of option risk management in some depth before playing with large sums in options.

In the example at hand, it is not trivial to set the strike price and expiration date properly and to determine the right moment to sell calls so one has to consider all the factors above. Otherwise he will likely limit his upside potential and underperform buy and hold in the long run.

He can learn the basics at /r/options and /r/thetagang but imo he has to be more quantitative and analytic than most people there, especially when it comes to estimating risks and payoffs."

2021-04-30 14:37:48,stocks,"If you want to write covered calls on moderately high dividend yield stocks like utilities or telcos, I think the play is to write the call a few days before it goes ex dividend. The utes and telcos usually range trade upward going into the ex date, get marked down for the dividend and usually range trade down a bit after the ex date so the time to write a call is near that apex on the buildup before the ex dividend date. Of course, there can be surprises like AT&T going up a decent amount (for T) when they reported great subscription numbers for HBOMax, but by and large that pattern holds fairly consistently across a lot of the low beta dividend payers in ""boring"" industries. The Verizon chart is pretty indicative of the pattern. The key is to make sure you don't write a call 45 days after the last ex dividend date while the stock is in a trough. If you write it too close to ITM you'll get the shares called away in the buildup of the stock price and if you go way OTM you'll maybe get like $2 per contract or something insanely low that's not even worth doing the trade."

2021-04-29 23:17:27,stocks,"Wow okay this is a lot to digest. Thank you very much for all this info, much appreciated. Very cool regarding the wheel strategy too, I like that idea of option trading. 

The thing I need to understand is the whole covered call play. So you set up the covered call with the strike price you choose and you get the premium if the option is purchased. You run the risk of getting your covered call option getting executed and now you don’t have any shares to make the same play."

If the underlying stock price does a repeat of last year, you should profit .74% or so on the underlying stock price($22)

So 297 profit. For $3125 investment. Or 9.5%. For a year.

2021-04-29 23:21:52,stocks,"Haha yeah sorry, when you're just starting out it can be a lot. To clarify, you always get the premium when you sell a contract upfront in full, it's yours. So if I sell a covered call on AAPL at the 140 strike expiring in two weeks for 50 dollars, that 50 is now in my account. Its mine. If AAPL finishes above 140, my shares will be called away, I will get 14k(100 * 140) PLUS the 50 that I get to keep. You could buy to close early though and thats highly recommended as expiration approaches if you wanted to in which case your profit would be 50 - cost to close. But you always get to keep the premium if the option expires either in the money (itm) aka 140 or out of the money (otm) aka 139 in my AAPL example. I generally scalp about 25-50 bucks per 1 lot (100 shares) on AAPL a week selling .30 delta calls. Not bad!

I highly recommend tastytrade videos on trading options, it all comes with practice. This is their video on the PMCC I explained above: https://youtu.be/hZ8FDD8Y_JE. Let me know if you have questions, always happy to help people learn options."

2021-04-30 12:49:40,stocks,"I like doing it myself a lot more because I manage my positions more aggressively than a simple 30dte covered call strategy, but I do hold QYLD in my taxable account."
2021-04-29 21:35:21,stocks,Probably safer doing the CC still a good system. Even if you get called just buy it back as the premium is always working for you. Really no downside as if you get called you got your intended sell price at 100% price target.
2021-04-29 22:18:04,stocks,"That's a covered call.  The option premium on dividend stocks is generally low. Stocks like ATT or DUK, lots of dividend but not much option premium."
2021-04-30 03:22:24,stocks,"Take a look at KMI, might fit the bill."
2021-04-29 21:43:33,stocks,"Just set the strike higher than your cost basis. I bought 1000 shares UWMC @7.70 and sold some 9$ and 10$ monthlys. So what if they exercise the contract? Im getting good profits either way.

I also bought some 8$ and 9$ calls right after I bought the shares, so I can get some shares back if needed."
2021-04-30 05:21:01,stocks,"Options were designed to be used as a hedging tool for portfolios, but have also been used for speculation purposes. 

Option exercise can be very expensive, as you need to have the exact amount of cash available.  If I decided to theoretically exercise a CMG $1480 call, I would need to pony up $148,000. 

That and a trader may not be interested in owning the stock, but wants to speculate on the price in an attempt to make a profit."
2021-04-30 11:54:31,stocks,"Whoa. Didn’t see that last paragraph coming, but certainly something to think about."
2021-04-30 04:02:26,stocks,would need 500 shares for that though. one contract = 500 shares.

2021-04-30 11:52:53,stocks,Has it returned more than just holding AAPL?
2021-04-30 02:53:53,stocks,That manuever gives you a 12％ yearly return at the cost of potentially missing some rapid growth
2021-04-30 02:07:12,stocks,Didn’t I see you say you made mad money on GME cycles? 30 to 200j or something?
2021-04-30 02:43:04,stocks,Thanks for this info and the links. I'm just starting to get into options and it's like a whole new wonderful world.
2021-04-30 13:41:39,stocks,"I would be careful with QYLD. They write ATM calls, so any upside means that their assets will get called away. This also means you are being bearish on the Nasdaq-100. In addition, an ETF like that will roll their covered calls so you have no control over when they are going to do them. This means that they sell covered calls at a market top, AND at the market bottom, the worst time to sell covered calls because you are basically locking in losses. The yield looks extremely attractive only because they are doing ATM CCs, which of course will have the highest yield because there is 0 upside. Look at the performance of QYLD vs QQQ and then decide whether you actually want 0 upside."
2021-04-30 11:07:29,stocks,"Right, that makes sense. But if a call is in the money, won't someone eventually exercise it? Even if not the original option buyer? Or does the seller usually buy to close?"
2021-04-30 11:55:28,stocks,When you're selling covered calls out of money you ARE just holding AAPL lol
2021-04-30 10:24:59,stocks,"Yep that's correct, I played GME with long calls and shares in early January and used options on it to ladder in and out collecting premium these past few months. I continue to use theta strategies on it. Took the account from 30 to 220 as of yesterday, yes. With half the profits I went back to my normal trades/theta strategies. This is all for my IRA account that I exclusively use options for. My taxable is all in buy and hold at the moment, hard enough to beat the market AND the tax man."
2021-04-30 14:02:46,stocks,"Yep 100% agree with everything you said. Its a small dividend type holding for my taxable account, I would never use it as a replacement for QQQ. I just don't have any CC exposure for dividends in my taxable account since I don't want to generate mountains of short term capital gains and tax headaches for taking all the risk with my sold options. I only trade in my tax advantaged accounts for that reason."
2021-04-30 19:37:09,stocks,"Depends how far in the money it is. If you sell a CC for $1.00 (so you collect $100) and a strike price of $50, for it to make sense to that buyer, the price would need to hit $51 or higher. Otherwise, they would lose money if they exercised when the price was anywhere between $50.00 and $50.99. They would break even at $51."
2021-04-30 11:45:45,stocks,"I've never understood this part of options trading.
Is it a game of hit potato, where the last person holding a call either has to exercise or let it expire worthless?"
2021-04-30 11:56:06,stocks,Doesn’t it limit your upside? My understanding of covered calls isn’t great...
2021-04-30 11:44:01,stocks,You make 190k in 3 months? Why the fuck am I working like a pleb?
2021-04-30 19:49:33,stocks,"Well yeah, but they lose the $100 either way. So that point anything below $51 would make sense for them.  


I understand how the math works, I was just questioning the assertion the guy above said. Out of curiosity, not criticism."
2021-04-30 13:00:12,stocks,"He can sell the call/put to a person during the deadline day, and that person will almost for sure exercise it."
2021-04-30 12:10:13,stocks,"Well ya, that's the downside lol. If there were no downsides why would anyone do anything but sell covered calls haha. And that's really all there is to know about the general principal with covered calls."
2021-04-30 13:14:29,stocks,"It limits your upside but if you're good at reading technical data you can time x amount of contracts expire worthless for every 1 that executes and limits your upside, and if you're really good then you can time it so that it'll dip the next week for you to sell cash secured puts for multiple weeks out or months, and have so many of those expire worthless and then buy in as its starting to climb again in time to sell more covered calls. I was able to do this with SRNE in December-January and made about 7k on options expiring OTM with only 15k invested in shares(2k shares). So yes I limited my upside when they executed ITM, but I wouldn't have made that 1-2k/wk otherwise. Also once they did expire ITM I also made a profit of 4-5k from the strike difference not including the premiums."
2021-04-30 12:42:36,stocks,"As they say, 'No risk-it, no biscuit.' But that wasn't investing, that was gambling. I was buying a risky depreciating asset (long call option) and shares with an asymmetric risk/reward profile. The lessons to learn from my GME experience when trading are threefold:

1. One in the hand is worth two in the bush. Take profit! I rode 30k to 75k, took profit, rebought at 40(I genuinely do like the board and the space so I was happy to own at that) then sold out again at 300. Then rebought again at 120 for where I'm at now. When I say sold and bought, I was using sold options to do this, so collecting 2-5 grand a week at least via premium through march just to take my positions because implied volatility was so high. That was the 'theta' piece of my long position.
2. This isn't an investment strategy. You can use options to get a lot of leverage, but its not sustainable to simply jump from meme stock to meme stock using long calls on high IV names. Thats a suckers game. Thats WSB in a nutshell, 'lambo or ramen', many more ramen eaters than lambo drivers doing scratch off options like that.  If you win at the casino, you walk away, not walk over to a different game and put it all on the line again. 
3. Taking this gambling analogy further, you always want to be playing the 'house' where possible. You want to sell risk to people that depreciates over time. Selling options is simply selling insurance. On the put side, you get paid upfront to take on all the risk the stock goes to 0, and on the call side that it goes to infinity. As long as your positions are covered, and statistically speaking even uncovered on lower iv names, this is an actual investment strategy over time.

Options are hedging vehicles at the end of the day. They give you different tools for your investing strategy besides 'buy and hold' and allow for managing risk. I am not in the business of buying them to manage risk usually, I simply use them to extend buy and hold with leverage while maximizing my dividends, per say. People tend to think of them as degenerate lotto tickets but thats just one small piece, though what you read about because getting rich quick stories seem attractive. A more systematic way to do options is playing the house by being the seller in my experience. Don't go gambling unless you have an actual thesis on the company and want leverage, and even then not when its already priced in. It's usually too late to get outsized gains after there's a big movement in the stock, GME was unique in that respect."
2021-04-30 13:38:35,stocks,"Right, and I was questioning the idea that it rarely happens"
2021-04-30 15:49:17,stocks,How did you learn how to do all of this? I'm starting now. Reading and watching until all this makes sense.
2021-04-30 16:04:50,stocks,"Besides just jumping in and doing it and losing money for a year before getting the hang of it I did a lot of reading and youtube watching.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"3D Systems has launched VSP Hybrid Guides — the latest addition to its VSP surgical planning solutions portfolio. This solution for maxillofacial surgeons combines the strength of titanium with the relative softness of nylon in a single patient-specific guide with registration to the dentition for added confidence in guide placement and surgical site visibility. This latest innovation was engineered in response to customer feedback and demonstrates 3D Systems’ commitment to driving better outcomes for maxillofacial and reconstructive surgeons and their patients. 

VSP Hybrid Guides aim to capitalise on the benefits of each material. Tooth-based registration is achievable with nylon material, and the profile advantages of a rigid metallic cutting and drilling guide are preserved. The new guides are assembled with easy-to-use connection sites that are engineered to confirm a proper connection. Depending on the surgeon’s preference, patient-specific instruments can be designed that allow multiple cutting/drilling locations on a single occlusal-based guide. 

A secondary benefit of using occlusal registration is the potential for a reduced guide footprint. The slimmer profile guides not only provide easier placement in areas with limited exposure but also improve a surgeon’s visibility of the surgical site.

Dr Jay Neugarten, New York Center for Orthognathics and Maxillofacial Surgery, said: “3D Systems and its VSP surgical planning and guides are an integral part of my ability to deliver highly successful outcomes for my patients undergoing corrective jaw surgery. The new VSP Hybrid Guides are the next generation of occlusal-based surgical guides. To be able to combine two materials - nylon and titanium - to create cutting and predictive hole-drilling surgical guides that register to the dentition enables a precise and accurate surgical outcome for my patients. Using the VSP Hybrid Guides together with Stryker’s Facial iD customised plates streamlines my workflow in surgery. It’s like using a satellite navigation system compared to a paper map. This ability to seamlessly transfer my digital treatment plans to the surgical arena allows me to provide the highest level of care for my patients.”

The surgical guides developed as part of this new solution are manufactured using 3D Systems’ LaserForm Ti and DuraFormProX PA materials on the DMP Flex 350 and ProX SLS 6100 production-grade 3D printer systems. Creating patient-specific surgical guides as part of the VSP System has been shown to save surgeons and patients hours in the operating room.

Menno Ellis, executive vice president, healthcare solutions, 3D Systems, said: “3D Systems prides itself on our customer-centric innovation, and our ability to deliver patient-specific solutions that change the way healthcare is delivered. With the introduction of VSP Hybrid Guides, we’ve elevated the capability of our renowned VSP surgical solutions portfolio to facilitate craniomaxillofacial procedures. In partnership with our expert biomedical engineers, surgeons can develop effective surgical plans and patient-specific devices that help improve patient outcomes.”

3D Systems’ VSP technology has received FDA market clearance as a service-based approach to personalised surgery, combining expertise in medical imaging, surgical simulation, and 3D printing. The surgeon initiates the process, bringing their clinical knowledge and desired surgical plan to an online web meeting with a 3D Systems biomedical engineer to simulate and plan the surgical procedure. The outcome is a digital plan that is transferred to the operating room via 3D printed patient-specific models, guides, and templates. 3D Systems has provided VSP solutions or anatomical services in more than 140,000 unique patient cases.

2021-04-30 09:25:53,stocks,"Palantir has a huge huge potential.  They do not have a competition.  They are not just a big data company or a services company like SNOW or AXY.  They offer visualization, deep analytics, machine learning, and increasingly powerful artificial intelligence capabilities. Like all in one solution and remarkably scalable.  They are a marketing clout away to make a juggernaut run commercially.  

They do have a lot of challenges ahead.  Growing expenses can trim margins, revenue growth can slow down from long sales cycles, business can be fluctuating from potential seasonality and slowing pace of innovation.  There’s also risk for  security breaches and hacking.

Right now short term, they are volatile because it’s hard to place value on what they have.  They have a revolutionary product which makes them unique and sticky one to boot.

I would say 5-10 years will determine their true value.  They are well ahead of the game that make it so difficult to appreciate it when still most does not understand what they can be capable of.

2021-04-29 22:02:05,stocks,"i really like hedgeeye but it is a bit advanced (the ideas are great).

I'm actually working on a book (i have 10 yrs wall st. experience) to pass along knowledge - I wrote about a concept here - [https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n1im7n/learnings\_from\_10\_yrs\_wall\_st\_experience/](https://www.reddit.com/r/StockMarket/comments/n1im7n/learnings_from_10_yrs_wall_st_experience/)"
2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"PEG Question on AMD I’m trying to break down the math on the PEG ratio for AMD. Why? Because it now has the highest PEG ratio that we have seen since 3/31/2021, which implies that it is more overpriced now than it has been in a year. This is ludicrous sounding to me since the guidance of earnings has gone up (should lower it), the price is stagnated (this should keep PEG lower), and earnings are growing (which should lower it). So clearly I’m doing my math wrong, please someone tell me where my mistake is. The following data is either from Nasdaq or AMD. Price 83.91, earnings (12 month forward from Nasdaq analyst averages) 1.77, growth 50% guidance for the rest of the year. I’m assuming this will carry into Q12022 as well.

(83.91/1.77)/50=.948% which would imply we are underpriced and is logical to me

What Nasdaq shows is a PEG of 1.54 (using 12 month growth), using the same price and earnings we can extrapolate their projected growth to be 30%. Where are they getting this? Why is this number being published on Nasdaq, Yahoo (5 year growth), Zachs has 2.07!?

I know I’m stupid but can someone explain why I’m wrong?"
2021-04-29 20:14:25,stocks,"Maybe they still use old projections? Or they have different horizons? Amd won’t be able to have this kind of growth for 5 years. 

When you say ‘the highest peg ratio’, do you mean the one by Zachs?

I do agree tho that Amd is really undervalued here. Price/sales is less than half than that of NVDA, which is ridiculous imo."
2021-04-29 20:20:04,stocks,"This is just a guess, but some of these calculations might be handling the deferred tax credit (over a billion dollars) posted two quarters ago in different ways. On the income statement it goes down as earnings, but obviously a deferred credit counting as earnings is pretty weird. If you keep it in, the PEG is probably excellent. If you remove it, not as much."
2021-04-29 22:28:38,stocks,"Nasdaq uses 12 month forward, yahoo does use 5 year. Highest peg ratio is actually referring to Amds peg ratio over the last year. Amds peg hasn’t been this high since 3/31/20, which makes no sense."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"NIO is ramping up for big things NIO Inc. (NIO) is announcing the beginning of construction of NeoPark, a smart electric vehicle industry park it is co-developing with the Hefei government, ahead of the Chinese automaker's quarterly earnings release after the close Thursday. 

What Happened: Work on NeoPark has kicked off, Nio said in a Thursday press release.
The opening ceremony was attended by several officials from Anhui province, where Hefei is located, as well as William Li, Nio's founder, chairman and CEO.

Nio's China headquarters are situated in Hefei. The collaboration agreement with the Hefei municipal government for NeoPark was signed in early February.

NeoPark is conceived as a smart EV industry cluster, encompassing R&D of vehicles, core parts and components and autonomous driving. It was envisioned to evolve as a pioneering innovation chain with global competitiveness and a hub for hundreds of key supporting industries and a highly clustered, full-fledged industry chain, the company said.

The 16,950-acre park features three main function areas — smart manufacturing, R&D and living space, and Eco park. NeoPark will likely contribute to peaking carbon emissions and achieving carbon neutrality, according to the company.
The park, according to company, will accommodate over 10,000 R&D personnel and 40,000 technical workers. It's expected to have an annual production capacity of 1 million vehicles and 100 GWh. The annual gross output from the park is expected to reach 500 billion yuan ($77.3 billion).
Why It's Important: Nio has embarked on a broad push to drive volumes as it comes up against fierce competition in a crowded EV market. The company has announced innovation in battery technology, charging infrastructure and services, while also announcing new models.

The company confirmed Wednesday that it is setting up operations in Norway, terming it as the first leg of its international expansion.
The investment in Neo Park is also seen as a payback from Nio to the Hefei city, which bailed it out with financial assistance when the company was running out of cash in 2019."

2021-04-30 08:28:39,stocks,"Doesn't matter, look at the past 1.5 months, HFs have been pumping and dumping entire sectors. EV sector gets a run up over 3ish days, then tank it hard as they move money back into another sector they dumped previously, the sector trades sidewaysish for a weeek or bit less, then gains back the 15% or so they dumped out of it. It's been this like clockwork between EVs, big cap tech, energy, and consumer cyclicals. rinse and fucking repeat on 1-2wk cycles for 2 months. They're loving this concerted pump and dump scheme they've got going on repeat. News, earnings, none of it matters, you see normal trading on that, then massive dumps at open or massive buys as they do their thing, with way more millions than retail has.

So DD means nothing. Buy the dip once it trades sideways-downish for a couple days, and be rewarded in a week. Your bet if you want to hold it through the next cycle as it goes back down again.

Especially during all this nonsensical anti-China rhetoric."

2021-04-29 22:39:56,stocks,Q2 which Li Bin said was a tough time regarding chip shortages seems like it is a nonfactor. Q2 delivery numbers per NIO's press release and the call expect 21-22k which is higher than Q1. It is also expectations for Q3 to be less constraining on chips.

The west won't allow a Chinese company to muscle their way to the top of this nascent market. Nio is heavily funded by the government and Biden has shown no indication he will change the anti China rhetoric. They're a prime target. As far as how the Chinese would respond: Tesla is a good a target as any if that comes to pass.

2021-04-30 01:18:58,stocks,"Non gaap eps, which is what analysts always use for estimates, Nio got $-0.04 which is a massive beat. Gaap eps (shown in ur article) was a miss though

https://m.benzinga.com/article/20879626

And delivery was known a month ago, not a surprise. This was due to chip shortage and 5 day factory shutdown, which has been discussed for a while now and people adjusted their expectation to under 20k cars, which Nio exceeded. Even compared to the delivery expectation before chip shortage and factory shutdoen, its a very small miss.

Everything else was a significant beat e.g. vehicle margin and revenue.



Also: 1 key figure that noone seems to mention is that net loss has significantly decreased to about $70mil from $270mil just last qrtr. This is why i think Nio can be profitable this year! Realise how crazy this is.
BUT its possible that spending might also increase because of the EU expansion and Neopark development, which can postpone the profitability. But im in it for the long haul and these are great long term game plan. 

For the actual q1 report.

People may misunderstand and think that this massive new EV park means NIO has suddenly become a huge company and any benefit belongs purely to shareholders. That's wrong. The massive amount of assistance the CCP provides to 'state-sponsored' companies and initiatives like this has tradeoffs. It's not free. Best case it's a loan. More likely is they dilute and/or lose their independence."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Basic question about margin interest. I have recently opened my own personal brokerage account for the first time. I have my home paid for and my wife and I have our own retirement account set up. I have some extra cash and opened an account just to have some fun and hopefully generate some more income. I have always just invested in index funds, so I never attempted to trade or short any stocks. I wanted to try shorting a stock, so I used about 10% of the cash in my account to short a particular stock. The stock has decreased in price, but I have not bought to cover yet. However, I don’t seem to be being charged interest on the use of this margin. My assumption was that selling a stock short would result in my taking a margin loan that I would then have to pay interest on. However, when I look through the balances on my brokerage’s webpage, it list my margin interest rate at 0.000%. And it lists my margin interest accrued at 0.00, both monthly and daily. But I have been holding onto this position for a few weeks. Am I paying interest on this position? I have a decent amount of cash in my account at the moment. Do I not have to pay interest on margin when I have cash in my account?

I am sure this is a stupid question, but I would appreciate any answers."
2021-04-29 23:44:36,stocks," Directed at your question : from my understanding shorting a stock works the same as below. Short answer = If you have the cash on hand you do not get charged interest. 

Edit : I keep this comment handy to answer this question when it comes up.

Edit 2 : Keep in mind you are only charged interest if you hold the stock over night. So day trading is a bit of a loop hole as you never really hold over night. Ive traded value wise millions of dollars. But that is pretty darn easy when I buy 400 DIS shares at $130 = $52k but then sell it 30 seconds later. And then buy it again 5 minutes later on the next leg up where I would sell it again on the next leg down and then buy it again at the high to then sell it at the low. :) So far in my margin account I have something like $25 dollars worth of interest charges.

I have just went through the woods on this ""well kind of I started 8 months ago on learning wtf Im doing"" Now let me preface this with : All brokers are different. I use E-Trade so TD may vary a bit.

Once you are a margin account you are always a margin account. Once you are a PDT you are always a PDT. You have to jump through some hops to change back down to a cash account. Now lets run through a quick example.

Cash Value account : $30,000

Margin Value with above account : Cash value $30,000 + margin $60,000 = $90000

If this account is PDT depends on how you trade. More than 3 ""I think"" same day trades in a rolling 5 trading day span auto converts you to a PDT account.

\-Trade 1 : 100 shares of MSFT at $150 = $15,000 ==== $5000 against your cash and $10,000 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $25000.

With that trade because your TOTAL shares are valued below you $30k cash value you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 2 ""while holding trade 1 still"" : 1000 shares of PENN at $13 = $13000 ==== $4300ish against your cash and $8600 on margin. Cash value in your account is now $21000.

So with the 2 trades above you have roughly $27000 worth of stocks. However your Cash value is $30000 so you do not get charged margin interest.

\-Trade 3 ""while still holding trade 1 and 2"" : 10 shares of AMZN at $2400 = $24000 === $8000 against your cash and $16000 on margin. Cash Value in your account is now $13000

HOWEVER you now have $15k + $13k + $24k = $42k worth of stock so $12000 on loan from your broker. You get charged margin interest on $12k PER DAY! So with E-Trade that is 8% so with some quick ""probably wrong"" math we get

$12000 \* .8 = $960

$960 / 360 ""360 why they calc 360 and not 365 I do not know"" = $2.66

So to borrow $12000 is $2.66 per day. Really not to bad but can get out of hand REAL fast. get stuck in a trade that you ate shit on and then the stock gets a halt like Linkin Coffee and you are paying interest to not even be able to trade and take the fucking lose.

Happy trading sir!"

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about risk and profit management Hi all, I've got to ask you about opinions and suggestions on my current risk and profit management.  


  
I've been using it about a while to a success but now I'm thinking that it might be tweaked a little.  


  
So basically I have four Risk Percent thresholds of possible losses: 10%, 20%, 30% and 40%. Each of these is correlated to Decimal Amount of profit (reward part of risk and reward), 10% is 0,25; 20% is 0,5; 30% is 1 and 40% is 2.  


When setting stop loss/take profit I first set my entry price. From that I calculate stop loss by doing simple equation: SL= Entry - (Entry \* Risk Percent).   


  
After SL is calculated I calculate take profit: TP= \[(Entry - SL)\* DecimalAmount \]+Entry  


So what do you guys think about it? I was thinking that I might be taking too little profit, especailly that I'm more of a swing/position trader.  
What would you guys suggest?"

Significant institutional and large investor demand for FANS/FUNFF:

 Despite seemingly being a lesser known Canadian microcap company  there are significant clues pointing to the fact that Fans is on the  radar of large and institutional investors across North America.

The first piece of evidence corroborating this is in their most recent financing.

On December 15th [Fans announced they were looking to raise $5M](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C!FANS-3005936/C/FANS) for working capital and general corporate purposes.  [Due to overwhelming demand that $5M was raised to $11M](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C!FANS-3006860/C/FANS) less than 24 hours later.  And that $11M raise ended up[ closing at $13.38M ](https://www.stockwatch.com/News/Item/Z-C!FANS-3015207/C/FANS)while still turning would-be investors away as there was no more headroom in the round.

**Recap:** Announce a $5M raise, 24 hours later upsize it to $11M and close $13.38M.  Enough said. Demand is there.

Further evidence of the pent up demand to grab a piece of equity in  FansUnite is evidenced by what happened when they got an OTCQB uplisting  in the U.S. last November.

Prior to that point Fans had been trading on the Pink Sheets.  And  not all investors can access the Pink Sheet markets for one reason or  another.

When Fans uplisted on November 16th there was an immediate and clear  volume increase stateside.  Previously volume was hovering between  200-500k shares per day on the OTC exchange.  Immediately upon the  upgraded listing volumes catapulted to over 3M shares per day.

Fansunite is a small company with a BIG team behind it:

I’ve written about this on several occasions over the last year but  it’s still worth going over again.  A primary way to mitigate risk in  microcap investing is to properly vet the team (the CEO in particular)  and their vision.

Behind FansUnite there is an incredible amount of experience, knowledge and industry success.

Having such an impressive board of directors not only signals that  these experts believe in FansUnite’s vision, it also provides confidence  that Fans has the support they’ll need as they push to the forefront of  the gaming industry in a sustainable and efficient manner.

And with that kind of support behind him it’s no wonder Fans’ CEO  Scott Burton is emerging as an iGaming and gambling industry thought  leader in North America as he led his company to have a [seat at the table of the Canadian Gaming Association](https://www.fansunite.com/assets/files/press/nov-25-gaming-association.pdf) and has begun [writing insightful commentary](https://www.gamblinginsider.com/magazine/15/canada-a-tectonic-shift) on the North American gaming industry.

What is Fansunite's vision and path to success?

Ok, so we’ve established that Fans has the interest of large  investors and the support of industry thought leaders.  How are they set  to capitalize on the opportunity in front of them?

As a smaller company, Fans has the agility and talent to focus their  efforts on the problems and opportunities that bigger companies don’t  have the time or talent to address. To this end, Fans is innovating in a  very significant way by making games and software that appeals to  younger adults that keep players engaged throughout their experience.

I’ll come back to this point shortly, as that’s not all Fans is creating.

Fans is a full service gambling software and support provider:

* If an online poker room needs a sportsbook to tack onto their poker room, Fans can provide that.  
* If a sportsbook operator wants to add eSports betting to its offerings, Fans can provide that.
* If an existing sports discussion forum wants to add sports betting as an offering for its community, Fans can provide that **along with the necessary licensing in some jurisdictions**.  The forum would just need to sign the dotted line and do a deal with Fans to start monetizing its platform.

While Fans can offer just about any kind of software, licensing or  support in the online gambling space they’re not coming to the market  looking to compete with the major players.  Instead they are offering  their software to casino operators as a service.  Having a full suite of  offerings means they can fill in any gap for any given operator.

In addition to being able to fill in gaps for casino operators, Fans  can bring betting options (and monetization) to many online communities  with an existing user base like I mentioned in the third bullet point  above.

Now, why would a casino operator or platform come to Fans for their gambling software needs?

Because Fans is innovating very engaging experiences for bettors.  Their software keeps players engaged and entertained on the platform  during sports or eSports events.

While an eSports fan is watching the game he/she has prop bets  rolling in on the the right side of the screen every 30-60 seconds.

I can see something like this catching on for real sports games too.   It’s fun and engaging.  And even if the game action hits a lull one can  stay entertained making silly side bets.  

I’ve spent enough time around the poker table to know that gamblers  absolutely LOVE this kind of stuff.  If the action at the poker table  gets slow gamblers will inevitably start betting on whether the next  card dealt face up will be red or black.  To spice it up even more  they’ll make a bonus, double-sized pay out if three in a row are the  same color. That’s just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to creative  prop bets offered when sitting at the table with fellow gamblers.

When gamblers love a betting option casino operators are going to be  compelled to oblige them. This is what will get Fans’ foot in the door.   And once Fans has integrated with an operator’s systems it will be  seamless to toggle on any other features the casino operators want  installed.  Having a full suite of offerings makes Fans a one-stop-shop  for any casino operator or any gaming platform looking to integrate new  betting features.

Fansunite business model and revenue streams:

Like I wrote above, Fans isn’t coming to the market trying to compete  with the behemoth stalwarts of the industry.  Instead they are looking  to offer services to them.

But Fans IS agile and opportunistic.  This is reflected in their  business model.  They’re not coming in as competing casino operators in  crowded markets.  They are, however, seizing the opportunity to be  operators in underserved markets.

It’s best to break down Fans’ business model and revenue streams into three categories.

1.  B2C – Operating online casinos in underserved markets.  This  not only generates revenues for their software development efforts, it  field tests and validates those offerings for prospective B2B partners.
2. B2B  – Offering their betting features and software to existing casino  operators.  On this front Fans collects an integration fee, a minimum  monthly recurring revenue **and a revenue share** of profits generated from their integrated offerings. Revenue-share in the casino business is a real blue-sky opportunity.
3. Askott  Games – This is an arm of the business we haven’t touched on yet.   These are stand alone video-game-themed gambling games.  Think of them  as the slot machines for the younger generation that prefer interacting  with the game rather than watching spinning fruit wheels.  These also  generate **revenue share** and are another blue-sky opportunity when a game gains popularity.

Fans has developed innovative software and gaming experiences and they are distributing and monetizing it in a very smart way.  

Offer software services to bigger operators in crowded markets. Do  the same for jurisdictions with thickets of regulatory red-tape which  would make market penetration as an operator expensive and difficult.   Then also set up shop in underserved markets and put their skills on  display while generating revenues to offset the burn rate.

In short they’re getting their technology to market in the most  efficient ways possible while generating minimum monthly recurring  revenues and still keeping intact an uncapped upside with the revenue  share monetization strategy."

I read a few articles  claiming over the next 8 to 12 weeks the stock price will go from 7 to 100. This may be a stretch but if it is looking to get a jump I'd like to invest.

2021-04-30 01:06:29,stocks,Its stock trading so I assumed I'd have some losses getting into this. But if I can make the payouts worth it then I'm totally game!

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"How do you combat DCA inflation anxiety when considering where to invest new cash? I try to deposit to my personal investment account frequently when I have extra cash available (most of cash goes to my IRA and 401k get monthly deposits that go into total market funds and such).

One issue I have pretty much all the time is nervousness about purchasing more shares of an existing position due to having previously gotten a really good price for that position.

For example, my average cost per share of MSFT is 171.18. At time of post, MSFT is trading at ~252. I have some cash to invest but am hesitant to do so because I want to keep my avg CPS lower. I think it's a good buy at the decent price, but am so addicted to that 171 number I can't pull the trigger.

Anybody else run into this psychological stumbling block? How do you deal with it."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Thursday, April 29, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Thursday, April 29, 2021**

Stocks hit fresh record highs as market participants considered a batch of stronger-than-expected corporate earnings reports and new proposals from President Biden aimed at revamping the US’ infrastructure and supporting families, children, and students. The S&P 500 (SPY) hit a new intraday record, driven by gains in mega-cap stocks like Facebook (FB) and Apple (AAPL), both of which reported blowout earnings. 

Last night, President Biden addressed a joint session of Congress, during which he said “America was back on the move again” following the coronavirus pandemic that devastated the economy. In his address, President Biden touted his $2 trillion infrastructure plan and unveiled a new $1.8 trillion proposal aimed at supporting children, students, and families. This proposal, called the American Families Plan, would be funded in part with the newly proposed tax increases on the wealthy. [Read the details of the proposal here](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefing-room/statements-releases/2021/04/28/fact-sheet-the-american-families-plan/).

Earnings season continues to deliver blowout results, with Apple and Facebook massively outperforming analyst expectations. Facebook’s stock, in particular, gapped up more than 7%. The strong results from these companies adds to a parade of mega-cap companies that have vastly outperformed estimates, driven by a surge in demand as the US economy gradually reopens thanks to effective vaccine distribution. According to FactSet, as of early Wednesday, companies comprising nearly half of the S&P 500's market capitalization had reported earnings results, with 83% of these corporations topping estimates, and by an average of 21.7%. 

Market participants also digested recent commentary from members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which included no major changes to policy but did highlight recent improvements in the US economy. FOMC members said the effective distribution of the vaccine in the US has improved economic conditions but reiterated interest rates will remain near-zero and the current pace of the asset purchasing program in place. The Fed said, “Amid progress and strong policy support, indicators of economic activity and employment have risen.” The committee remains optimistic about the rebound in economic activity, describing the most affected sectors as “having shown improvement”, but shows no signs of slowing quantitative easing or raising interest rates. With more than 8 million people still out of jobs compared to pre-pandemic levels, FOMC reiterated its commitment to supporting the economy.

**Highlights** 

* The Labor Department released its Weekly Unemployment Report, which shows fresh pandemic-era lows as the economy gradually reopens.
   * **Initial jobless claims, week ended April 24:** 553,000 vs. 540,000 expected and an upwardly revised 566,000 during the prior week

* Shares of Uber, Lyft and Doordash (DASH) fell sharply after Reuters reported that Labor Secretary Marty Walsh supported reclassifying gig workers as employees. This change would give workers additional benefits at a large cost to companies. Recall the battle last year over Proposition 22 in California, which eventually passed in favor of companies in the gig-economy. 
* US gross domestic product (GDP) increased at a 6.4% quarter-over-quarter, seasonally adjusted annualized rate in the first three months of 2021, [the Bureau of Economic Analysis said Thursday in its first estimate on GDP. ](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/us-economy-accelerated-robust-6-123644612.html)This marked an acceleration from the 4.3% annualized growth rate from the fourth quarter of 2020
* New York City [Mayor Bill de Blasio said ](https://twitter.com/Morning_Joe/status/1387733678093127684)that NYC would open with full capacity beginning July 1. ""Our plan is to fully reopen on July 1. We are ready for stores to open, for businesses to open, offices, theaters, full strength,” de Blasio said. 
* The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said Thursday it is auditing Boeing Co's process for making minor design changes across its product line after a 737 MAX manufacturing issue grounded dozens of planes.

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Amazon Smashed Earnings Expectations KEY POINTS
Amazon released first-quarter results on Thursday that trounced analysts’ expectations.


Amazon shares climbed as much as 5% in extended trading Thursday after the company released its first-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street’s expectations for earnings and revenue. 

Here’s how the e-commerce giant fared, relative to analyst estimates compiled by Refinitiv:

Earnings: $15.79 per share vs. $9.54 per share expected
Revenue: $108.52 billion vs. $104.47 billion expected

Few companies have benefited from the pandemic-fueled surge of online shopping as much as Amazon. The company notched record profits and revenue last year, while CEO Jeff Bezos announced earlier this month that Amazon crossed more than 200 million Prime subscribers, up from 150 million at the start of 2020.

In 2020, Amazon invested heavily on coronavirus-related measures like safety protocols and wage increases for front-line workers. As a result of these costs, Amazon last quarter forecast operating income of $3 billion to $6.5 billion in the current period. Those coronavirus-related costs are expected to slow this year, although on Wednesday, Amazon said it would spent more than $1 billion on pay raises for more than half a million of its U.S. operations workers.

I've always been in the ""Apple will keep doing it"" camp so I was buying when it was trading at a crazy low PE around 5 years ago.

I do think it's true though that Apple's margin of error in execution is far less forgiving than those other companies.  I say this because they push out specific products a few times a year and if one of them turns out to have a terrible design flaw it could cause some serious financial hurt.  Meanwhile, for the most part those other companies are running services which they can break and fix routinely without losing any customers at all.

There are plenty of other great phones out there and switching cost is low."
2021-04-30 03:56:10,stocks,"You might be interested in my ramblings so here's some more :)

I think Apple has a huge moat, and the risk I was describing was more about Apple actively harming it by fucking up vs another company out-competing them and taking market share.

Aside from Apple fucking up badly, customer loyalty is huge.  Once in the ecosystem, a person or household tends to stay there.  Even with an upgrade cycle of every 4 years per device, that's still a decent amount of profit per customer annually, and Apple's complementary services revenue has a decent attach rate too.  Their products are relatively  expensive vs alternatives and have a very good profit margin, but... they also actually provide a really good value considering how much utility you get from them.  I'm not saying this isn't also true for Samsung phones, for example, but if you are only buying a phone every 4 years, does it really matter if you pay an extra $100 for an Apple flagship device vs the equivalently-sized Samsung device, for example?

I think in a household budget, a prioritized list of discretionary expenses probably has new phone, new headphones, new tablet, new computer near the top at least every 4-5 years per device.  Regardless of what brand, these things give you a ton of value for their price vs spending that money on restaurants, bars, movies, any other form of entertainment really which are basically one-time events with no lasting value (except for priceless memories but those probably aren't standard).  This is just to say, I think Apple's revenue is fairly resilient even in a recession, because electronics have a high value proposition and Apple has loyal customers in its ecosystem.  Why do I think about recessions?  Well, they eventually do happen, or at least they used to.  Maybe recessions just can't happen anymore, and every time one starts to happen the government will just print more money and send it to the bottom 80%.  

So all of the above is why I thought Apple with a priced-to-shrink PE of 10-12 was just an insane bargain and I'm surprised that opportunity existed for *years.* 

At this point, with a TTM PE (after yesterday's earnings) of 29, Apple is much closer to fair value.  But I'm still holding, because this is actually a ""modest"" PE ratio in our current low risk-free rate world, and I think Apple is doing all the right things to keep growing."
2021-04-30 03:59:39,stocks,"Yeah, but they are add-ons to hardware customers for the most part.

I've also pointed out that Apple hasn't invented anything since Steve Jobs was healthy.  I've pondered when that might catch up to them.  I exited a substantial position when iPhones were flat for 2+ years.

Not sure if you're being sarcastic here.  Apple is famous for fraudulently pretending their software magically and suddenly doesn't work anymore.  And for allowing App Store vendors to kill off (aka steal) previously purchased software.  

I'll give examples, but in exchange for the research work I want to be compensated in the form of replacement Apple hardware/software for each example.  It won't be cheap.


> For the rest most average customers don’t care about repairing their phone or even notice the CPU slowdown.

Uh, everyone noticed it.  Apple had to do a big fake ""battery swap"" charade program to get around actually admitting and fixing it.

Whats is the Apple ecosystem? asking seriously. I know about itunes and some Apple only apps, but is it really that of a big deal? Do they offer anything android based phones don't? I don't have an iphone but I do own a Macbook and a few iPads. The Macbook has some issues but I'd admit I don't see myself buying a non-apple laptop anytime soon. I had a bad experience with other laptops and I'm also using the command line and I don't want to deal with Linux based laptops (and I did try). But I cannot say the same thing for the iphone. Maybe it's because I don't own one, but I never really had an issue with my Android based phones to thinking about switching. I do know that iphones are very popular among millennials in the US  (not my demographics) because of the iphone brand and popularity, similar to Nike, not because of some real moat."

2021-04-30 09:52:32,stocks,"Sorry if I came of argumentative was trying to play devils advocate for the most part.

The CPU slowdown was bad not defending that story at all but for the decision making on buying future phones I don’t think it did much besides the tech enthusiast crowd who are mostly divided in products already. People like my parents will still continue to buy iPhone products and new phones are so fast that even if there was slowdowns they would barely notice.


I personally think it’s a lot easier to go into a store and buy an Apple phone then a google phone.

Apple phones are all the same it’s mostly size and age of phone to choose from.

Biggest moat by any company was definitely hyperbole but what I meant by that was if you’re a person who has an iPhone and one or more secondary Apple products like AirPods or an iPad it’s harder to leave the ecosystem. Even if you think the latest android phone is better then the latest Apple phone is it worth switching and losing the easy pairing of your airpods/ airplay with iPad/ iMessage etc.

It’s very easy to get entrenched with the Apple ecosystem and it becomes easier to justify a premium price for a product like an apply tv vs the competition when odds are Apple will support the device for a reasonably long time and it’ll pair with airplay and your devices smoothly for the average consumer.

Hope this doesn’t come off aggressive at all. I do agree with where your coming from and Apple does have to worry about the issues you brought up but they’re very stable for now and will have to have a serious problem or a few to really have mass exodus of people leaving their ecosystem"

I understand there's an eco system like icloud for example that works better if you have an iphone than something like the Google's version of it. But all these things like icloud, airpods, etc, have solid alternatives in the android space. Basically, you're not losing much by using android. Maybe if you're already invested in the apple eco system then it's harder to switch, but if you're not then you have great alternatives that are as good or sometimes better.  That's why I don't see iphone as a moat yet. It's a great product with a strong brand."

For context, I specifically swing/day trade stocks, but in the last two months i've gotten into call options because the profit is much better. I've noticed how much my portfolio declines after a day of gains, almost nullifying what I got, so i'm looking for tactics to grab my money on both the incline and decline, and puts seem like a pretty good way to do this.

The problem is, I did not know how weird this would be. 

First off, what is the more preferred method of puts? Buying or selling? From what I see, selling puts seems like a way to collect crazy premiums, but it also holds your money.... collateral? Its just a weird mess imo. Buying puts looks like the easier way out, but its kinda lackluster in terms of profit, but also doesn't include the same risk as calls. I bought ONE put for CLOV $10p May 21 (BEP $9.60) today, just to see how it is, and I made $32 off of it. The price at the time was $60. Am i supposed to buy these things in bulk? Also, if i were to sell this, it says ""Premium (received): $110"". Does this mean I already collected the $110? Or is it implying something else?

So, what exactly (besides price decline) am i looking for, what indicators can I use (implied volatility im guesssing), and what level of risk am i looking at in comparison to calls, and what level of profit could I be expecting?"

If you are interested in a stock watch it for a while before buying and be patient. You will see the low end of the fluctuations and high end. Once you've got an idea of what the low end is wait for a red day and buy in for the best value. Also, if you did impulse buy on the high end don't forget you can always add more on a red day to average down your cost 😊 or just wait for a green day and sell and wait for a red day to buy back in. In the grand scheme I'm still a noob myself so don't rip me apart for stating the obvious but I feel some people starting out could use this advice.

**Company Overview**

**Heron Therapeutics (HRTX \~$17.6) is a small-cap pharmaceutical company (\~$1.6B market cap) focusing on two main areas:** Chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting through their CINV franchise and Post-operative pain through HTX-011 and HTX-034.

* CINVANTI & SUSTOL are FDA-approved antiemetic treatments that delay nausea and vomiting. CINVANTI is an established brand among clinics and has captured 40% market share.
* **HTX-011**: first non-opioid post-operative pain treatment drug that has passed Phase 3 trials and is currently waiting for FDA approval with deadline on 05/12/2021
   * Utilizes a combination of bupivacaine and meloxicam to treat post-operative pain through local anaesthesia and decreasing the inflammatory response
   * Attempts to capture the huge market for non-opiod pain killer, $1B+ market

**THIRD TIME'S A CHARM**

**Two previous times were delayed with Complete Response Letter but never because of a safety concern with the drug.**

* April 2019, 2020 CRL (denial) was related to a manufacturing facility issue, which has by now been fully cleared
* November 11, 2020 CRL was also related to non-clinical issues. (Concerns over levels of three excipients in the formulation, all of which have been around and are considered safe)
* 90% of applications subject to extension were approved by PDUFA deadlines given

**WHY BUY, NOT TOO LATE**

* Upon approval, HTX-011 becomes the post-operative pain management SOC (standard-of-care) in a more than $1B annual market
* Priority on ex-US approvals and commercialization
* Analyst consensus shows nearly 200% upside potential
* **HTX- 011 approved by European Medical Agency (EMA), opening up international markets**
* **Canada approved HTX-011 for use in 2020.**

**BALANCE SHEET**

* HRTX only has $5.62M in debt, but $71M in cash, and $320M in short term investments (not highly leveraged)
* Total short-term liabilities, including debt, is $96.7M, far below Heron’s short-term assets and cash $40M
* Net increase in cash (steadily increasing)

**RISKS**

* Several critical components used in manufacture of CINVANTI, SUSTOL, and HTX-011 come from a single vendor, which, if disrupted, would clearly be problematic
* Slow releases of data and confounding from COVID-19 have made HRTX stock trade wildly
* HRTX was already known for providing minimal information to investors, in reality, the company remains on track to succeed

**POSITION DISCLAIMER**

* $13 Call 06-18
* 1000 shares

**TD;DR**

* **Heron Therapeutics HRTX buy for 05/12/2021 FDA approval for non-opiod post-operative pain relief HTX-011**"

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Huya-DouYu merger may be blocked (what does this mean?) I refer to this report posted 30 min ago by seeking alpha 

https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3688020-douyu-falls-on-repot-that-huya-deal-may-be-blocked

Before this, my assumption is that the merger will go through, although I personally hope that it wouldn’t. 

My reason being that Huya, as a stand alone company now is trading at extreme attractive valuations. 1.6B USD in cash holdings in a 4.1-4.4bil market cap industry, 30 PE ratio and etc... (it’s quite late over here so this is rough numbers off the top of my head)

However my main point is, assuming that the in the possible scenario of Huya merger doesn’t go through, we should expect a spike in Huya stock right? Or do you guys think that my assumption is false and Huya will also drop significantly due to the merger failure? 

1. We already know that Huya is the “chosen” company by tencent, recently they were just awarded the streaming rights to LoL worlds or sth in China

2. Huya is significantly shorter at 10-30% range, and now more so for people who are trying to take advantage of the arbitrage differences in price. 

When the merger specific deals was first announced, we see Huya drop by roughly 10-15% while DouYu rose by 10-15%. 

Is Huya valuations being artificially suppressed? 

But I think that in the scenario that the merger were blocked, there is also a possibility that both may drop in the short term due to uncertainty in the market.

What are your thoughts?

I am also quite bullish on Huya partly because of tencent strong focuses on gaming and how crazy Chinese fans are on gaming. I personally do not foresee a future where tencent offload their positions in Huya."
2021-04-30 01:21:53,stocks,Do you think huya or douyu is a better investment now?
2021-04-30 05:54:52,stocks,"I don’t know. I think the merger complicated things a lot, without the merger (not merger failed) I would be very glad to purchase much more Huya share 

1) My assumption is that, if merger goes through, we should expect Douyu to spike and Huya to dip to cover the difference in price between the two of one douyu = 0.73 share. 

There is also a possibility that both will spike i.e Huya spike lesser than Douyu, if the market have an extremely positive outlook for the merger. But that may be challenging 

2) if the merger doesn’t go through. Hypothetically I believe Huya may spike slightly, while more certainly Douyu will dip. 

However there is also a possibility that Huya will dip together with Douyu in the short term (but with less % of course), due to the merger failure and market uncertainty/fear. 

But my opinion is that, Huya (and also Douyu) have already taken significantly beating to their valuations since the announcement of the merger. We shouldn’t penalize them twice for the same thing. 

However people who longed Douyu and shorted Huya will have to cover their Huya shares, this can possibly cause a small short squeeze, I see that as an added bonus. Huya is heavily owned by Institutional investors, so the number of available shares is actually very small. 

That’s my take. I personally prefer to go with Huya, if the merger goes, I will take the possible short term hit due to the price difference, but you now have a potentially stronger company. 

If the merger doesn’t go through, I certainly want to be the one holding Huya instead of Douyu (better valuations and also possibly the one chosen by tencent to be the leader - they recently won the contract for exclusive LoL streaming rights to LPL and etc in China. This is also supported by the fact that tencent wanted to merge Douyu into Huya and not the other way round. 

So I think it’s very subjective, there can be many outcomes. Personally, I will go with Huya."

2021-04-30 00:00:00,stocks,"Thoughts on PTON as it lingers below 100 Just my opinion, and I would love to hear other thoughts.

Earnings will be a significant driver of price movement in the short term (duh).  I remain bullish on the stock in the next 1-2 years based on the loyalty of PTON's user base and the likelihood of continued pandemic restrictions being adhered to by a significant portion of the population, making gyms seem less appealing. Also, the continued liquidity being pumped into the middle class will allow folks to reach for a PTON product instead of a cheaper alternative.

The thing to watch out for is if there is ANY public talent (instructor) attrition, especially among Tread+ or Bike instructors. If they start hemorrhaging that talent, I'm moving to sell pretty quickly. The bigger the name, the bigger the issue. Generally though, their instructors are the secret sauce and make that recurring revenue story stick."
2021-04-30 05:13:14,stocks,"You either think this a fad company or genuinely are impressed with the company. If u like this company I would buy more and expect short term for it to dip even more as we reopen.

The recent treadmill news is bad for the stock especially if it recalls but tbh bad news is usually great for stocks u like. 

I plan on holding and adding more if it dips below 100 mainly since I already have a decent amount relatively. Big disclaimer the entire market is really iffy rn especially for growth / tech imo since none of us know when rates will go up so be mindful of that. 


Bull case:

- Great brand name and business model

- No real competitors in the workout at home space 

- Same target demographic that loves apple, starbucks, lululemon ... Cult following

- Social media influencers are the instructors

- Lots of room to expand with the precor deal since their main issue this year was too many ppl ordered pelotons

- In the business lifecycle stage this is early which is great for growth opportunities 

- hiring talent

Bear case:

- reopening and ppl will go back to gyms and cancel their subscriptions, maybe sell the bikes?

- won't see demand like this year 

- spend a lot on advertising 

- lots of fitness things are fads tho some do stick (crossfit) 

- treadmill news and possibly recall

- overvalued but tbh this one is hard to judge for an early stage company that hasn't decided what it's end game is"

But... this is a thread on PTON stock. I guess I'm wrong to assume that most people either want to contribute info they know or learn about stuff they don't. But as you said, yeah I'm wrong, forgot that people naturally want to contribute strong opinions even though they know nothing, which kinda just sucks but is expected haha.

> Also why am I considered vocal?

> The problem with PTON is they dont really have a killer product

> There is nothing unique about them

You don't know their product, are saying things I think are actually 100% false, and other people just see your comment and agree. Like IDK what the point of posting this is besides trolling/trying to spread misinformation if you honestly don't know about the product.

> You say you instantly understood why their equipment is great. Please share.

If this is serious, not sarcasm, and you honestly, truthfully think you could hear an argument and not think PTON is stupid, fine. https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/mu45ha/good_opportunity_to_grab_some_pton/gv4i3oc/. https://www.reddit.com/r/pelotoncycle/comments/d8946l/peloton_vs_nordic_track/. https://www.reddit.com/r/go_echelon/comments/kt971d/i_ended_up_settling_for_an_echelon/.  And as far as purely equipment goes it's top of the line. Competitors like Echelon/Bowflex are at ~$1000. All of these are bring-your-own-screen-- most will use an iPad, which just is a worse experience than the big Peloton screen, which already accounts for a large part of the price difference. Can we agree that if you want an indoor bike experience with an app that tracks your workout that the price differences aren't **that** exorbitant, especially with the bundled screen?

> What is the competitive advantage? That they have a marketing budget so huge that they can convince rubes that they are cool? It basically puts them in the realm of designer clothing and such. But is that it?

Did I ever mention that? I'm a 30 year old programmer that hates fitness, and I DGAF about what's ""cool"", i seriously cannot stress this. This is so irrelevant to the reason I think it's a good product I can't help but think this conversation will go nowhere. I play games in my free time and don't watch any ads, my bro bought one, I laughed at the price, I tried it out, and instantly was like ""oh thats a good product"". It's so quiet you can't hear someone going HAM at 5 AM if you're on the couch next to it. Had no issues with the app, everything worked perfectly.

Anyway regardless of your answer here I might be done! I seriously don't care about peloton much, just hate that everyone who posts negative stuff about it hasn't tried it. Can't get a real discussion about the stock on reddit and its mildly frustrating but I'm chill lol"

2021-04-29 22:54:39,stocks,"Ok bud go be done then. But if you want to entertain the discussion, explain to me why your ""strong"" and biased opinion about the product is somehow more productive? Youre doing exactly the same thing and playing it off like youre cool or something. Youre just passive aggressive which is just as bad.

But lets talk nuts and bolts, programmer to more experienced programmer. Case and point:

*prices that ""aren't* ***that*** *exorbitant""*

Love how you phrased that. For people who make average salary, the prices are indeed exorbitant. Not everyone makes what we do (assuming youre in the US). If the prices were good, then Peloton wouldnt need to spend so much on marketing because they would sell themselves.

Here is the reality. The Peloton products have a very narrow customer base. Much more narrow than the people here want to admit. This is why they arent making money. They get sales, but the cost of the sales is insane thus they cant turn a profit even though this is not really a product that scales very well.

Yea I know you will bring up memberships. Those wont last. How do i know? Glad you asked. Aside from being a jock through high school, I was a gym rat till my mid 30s. I literally trained everyone I knew (though not that many people honestly). I am also married to a personal trainer who just so happens to do sessions for several companies. Memberships wont last because in the exercise industry you have a lot of flakes. In fact, something like 50% of people who get into exercise routines stop doing so in a few months tops.

Now you will say there are a lot of steady folks too. Yes but the great majority of those guys dont need these devices either. Those guys are self starters to begin with and have been doing their routines for years. Most will not want personal training because no one is qualified to train them.

So you are now down to just people who are simply entertained by the interaction. But for someone like me, for example, or even my wife, we arent going to pay for these memberships. Its a total waste of our time and mind you its not because we cant afford it, its literally because we wouldnt use it even if you gave them to me for free even tough I am at the gym all the time and even though she teaches classes as a side profession.

See what I mean by a very narrow set of customers? And it gets worse if I keep going. Most of my family are in the gym 3-5 times a week and they still have a home gym. I have one too. Want to know how many of us have a bike? Try 2 out of maybe 15 families. We just dont care for biking. We all have treadmills but we generally get heavy duty gym grade stuff with 4+ hp and 500+lb frame because those last unlike the cheesy 2hp machines. But those generally only cost about $2k-$2.5k for really nice stuff or a little over $3k for 5+ hp. Or you can buy a used for around $500 of which, there are tons during non covid times. Which brings up yet another issue... bankrupt gyms.... etc.

Bottom line is this. I dont see Peloton doing anything new. Maybe they make thing more ""convenient"" but thats 100% opinion. Its not a fact. Attached screen is not more convenient for me and most people will not find any benefit to it. Its just bells and whistles for a normal person. And personal training apps are a dime a dozen and they all work just fine. Dunno why you think the Peloton is easier.

The last problem is their product is not unique nor is the idea patent-able. Anyone can do what they are doing. The barrier of entry is low.

Anyway Im done too. There is no point to all this aside from the entertainment of it (lol). Feel free to read some of my other posts if you want to see what I actually know, which is far more than the rubes pushing this company as it is now. Is there potential? Maybe. Depends on how their buyout spree goes."

Thus the irony is your statement about bringing value to this conversation. I brought value... quantifiable, actual real value. 50% (conservatively) fallout rate for gym folks people likely leading to massive cancellation on memberships. Exceptionally high marketing costs due to niche customer base. Behavior of gymaholics and why the most valuable clients arent going to buy these machines. Etc etc...

2021-04-29 20:07:19,stocks,"Think I might be in a minority here with the following but: \*absolutely not\*.

If you look at the top ten companies at the beginning of each decade for the last 50 years, they have changed \*a lot\*.

If you're investing for the long term and you're starting to earn money which you can build up a serious portfolio, I would advise thinking about what your portfolio construction plan is \*now\*. Diversification is key across geography, sector, market cap.

Are you an index investor, a value investor, a growth investor, a dividend growth investor, a dividend investor or a hybrid investor?

Are you going to go for a Core-Satellite portfolio construction of 70% indexes, 30% actively managed funds or stock picks?

I think making a plan now, whatever it is, will hold you in far better stead than going ""Apple - i lIkE tHe StOcK"". Your plans and style will change over time which is perfectly fine. But approach this with some conservatism and sound logic rather than buying Apple because everyone is and you always buy iPhones.

2021-04-30 03:56:46,stocks,"I’d say it’s safe to leave it in Apple. As you earn money you can diversify into something else but generally speaking, don’t touch it. You’ll have to pay taxes on your gains if you sell which can really cut into your profits.  
  
Since you’re young, you want to get the compounding growth ball rolling. I’d slowly start investing about $400 of income from work into another stock until 70% of your portfolio is Apple stock, with that 30 ratio as a riskier play like Tesla, Coinbase, Nio, or Palantir. That gives you a strong safe base and a speculative position that keeps you interested. Keep that extra $100 from work for yourself; you earned it.  
  
As your portfolio grows, probably around 10 or 15k, leg out into another safe position in a different industry. Disney, JP Morgan Chase, Costco, Starbucks, are all solid bets. Weight it at about 20% of the portfolio and then consider just maintaining that amount. Don’t be alarmed if it takes a few years.  
  
That’s what I’d consider a balanced approach. If you want to be a little riskier, tbh it’s fine to just load it all into Apple; the company is still very innovative and growing. Just don’t bury it all into risky plays or options."

2021-04-29 20:07:12,stocks,"Step 2 - do ETFs until you have $10k


Step 3 - only do stocks with money you are comfortable losing and have time to recover from

Step 4 - accept that stocks are like pets, they deserve a certain amount of attention every day that you own them, from research to learning the markets, listening to conf calls, reading reports, etc. 


Step 5 - with step 4 in mind, be diversified.  For most average individuals, that means at least 4 or 5 stocks representing different sectors, while remembering you still need to keep up with each of them.  

Step 6 - don't fall in love with a stock such that it becomes your one and only, or a ""forever"" commitment.  It's a piece of paper, or not even that.  Have a target in mind and be prepared to sell it if it achieves the target.  Be mindful of looking for what the *next* AAPL might be.  

Step 7 - get enough invested so that your money is working for you, not you working for your money. 

Step 8 - optimize the emotional aspect.  If you get to the point of doing it full time, strive to have many positions so that there's always something happening that pertains to one of your current tickers.  It keeps things interesting and keeps you motivated.  I wasted years fixated on my tiny list of positions because I considered them ""best"" while I got disillusioned watching scores of tickers on my watch lists have exciting events and thinking I was also so close to owning them.

And Step 1 is buy or go to the library and get a Jim Cramer book that explains similarly, but in more detail.  He may play a crazy person on social media and, to a lesser extent, on TV.  But his lessons for beginning stock market investors are rock solid.

I don't see those companies ever falling from grace, and if they do it is unlikely to be an overnight event and you will likely have time to get out of your position with profits, but of course there is still always a small chance for the unlikely to happen, so it's good to have a ""contingency plan"" of sorts or to expand your portfolio to hold a few other companies/index funds."

2021-04-30 06:20:49,stocks,"Im advising banks on this matter. Let me give you a little insight:

- Diversification is a bitch: It's generally very hard to find meaningful quantitative measures for the diversification of a portfolio. Something to think about: Let's assume you made a bad investment, should you really increase the diversification of your portfolio by making another bad investemnt? Typical real world example on this matter: Let us assume that your portfolio consists of 1’000 small investments of an average size of $1k in different companies. But than there's also is the 100k you invested in your wifes boyfriends craft business... if you would come to me with this portfolio, i would tell you that your wifes boyfriend is a very big cluster risk for you. How could you increase the diversification of your portfolio and reduce risk concentration? Two ways: a) Get your wife to dump her boyfriend (not going to happen bro) or b) invest another 100k in your wifes other boyfriend.

- What is “diversification risk”? Simple. If you invest 10k in one company there is a decent chance that you lose your full investment (if the company goes bankrupt). If you invest 10 times 1k in 10 different companies, the probability of you losing the full investment (10k) goes exponentially down (i.e. the probability of n companies defaulting at the same time gets exponentially smaller with n).

- How do banks approach diversification? They start on the other side of the equation. They don’t start by asking “how much diversification do we want” but rather by asking “what risk are we willing to take”? The risk they are willing to take (risk appetite) is usually given by a combination of their strategy and the regulatory requirements (capital requirements). Starting from this they then calculate the required diversification of their portfolio to stay within the borders of their risk appetite.

-What does this all mean for you? Nothing. Don’t worry about diversification (especially not at the beginning of your investment career). Ask yourself how much risk are you willing and able to take (good indicator: if you are constantly checking the movement of a stock, you probably took more risk than you should have). If you stay within your comfort zone, you don’t have to worry about diversification."
2021-04-30 04:06:06,stocks,Ideally you should always be diversified.
2021-04-29 22:45:55,stocks,"OP's goal is to make money, not file for bankruptcy in a few months"

2021-04-30 03:42:17,stocks,"This is the worst advice in this thread. Any serious investor including Warren Buffet will tell you explicitly not to put all your eggs in one basket, but diversify. In any University level investment course they'll tell you that it's generally advised to save enough money until you can diversify in around 20 stocks.

Edit: I will however say that if you do decide to take the risk and put all your eggs in one basket, AAPL is a good choice"

AMZ in particular is interesting to me as it's been near low 3ks for a better part of a year. Either it's been priced in about a year ago or its undervalued now. IMO it will push through here at some point. I see both as a buy now with a decent upside.

They're still very clearly moving backwards at the moment and the stock has very little upside until they make a clear turnaround, which could be up to a decade away.

There are a lot of hot stocks of the past that dies out and no one remembers them because well they're not relevant anymore. In fact, there're a lot more of them than today's winners, otherwise everyone picking stock would outperform S&P. So of course when you only cherry pick today's winners without considering today's losers, it's easy to be right.

Typical drug development from molecule to market is 10-15years with approximately only 1 in 5 compounds making it from clinical trials to market. Only 1 out of 1000 compounds even make it to the clinical research stage. Its believed that it costs on average 300mil to bring a new drug to market. These might be dated numbers, looked at one of my old textbooks. 

Needless to say, it is a very very lengthy and expensive process to bring a new drug to market and the success rate of doing so is very small. That being said, when it comes to stocks, I would focus on the pharma companies that have a drug already vs discovery of one. Chances of discovery and getting approval.. oof.

They have a calendar with upcoming dates for clinical trials, IPOs, and PDUFA dates for all of the major pharma companies as well as dozens of small biotech companies.  Its really helpful if you're gambling on the clinical trials.


Rode the wave on a few guys, but its not really my bag anymore.  
A few lessons I learned, the trials really won't move the needle on a large company like Merck or Pfizer. 
If you're going after yolo bets, you might as well stick with the smaller companies.  

Pay attention to the companies investor relations page, listen to their earnings reports and conf calls, read their press releases etc. 
 If the company is expecting to or  ""confident"" theyre going to pass clinical trials and they miss, the stock will fuckin tank, hard.  

If they're certain they're going to pass and it does, it doesn't have nearly as big of an impact i.e. its probably priced in already.  

If there is any sort of uncertainty like ""we're hopeful"" or ""optomistic"" in the press conference, that's when the stock will likely make a big move if they do pass."

The sources I've looked at essentially explain it as ""leverage means multiple times more reward/gain, at the cost of multiple times more risk/loss"", which makes sense, but I'm wondering what this means for market indicator ETF's like TQQQ (3x leveraged, NASDAQ-tracking ETF) and SSO (2x leveraged, S&P 500-tracking ETF).

If market indicators practically always trend upwards, wouldn't leveraged market indicators have really amazing returns in the long-term? I know that if the NASDAQ drops 33% then TQQQ goes to $0 and if the S&P 500 drops 50% then SSO goes to $0, but, assuming this is an acceptable risk, why don't people invest into these leveraged ETF's over long periods?"

LOGI's stock dropped 4.5% after showing growth of 117%. - because guidance was flat for a year...

2021-04-29 23:06:08,stocks,"Based off the way 2021 has been going, if a broad market selloff was going to happen, it was likely going to start last week after options expired, the only thing that has mattered so far in 2021 are the structural flows of the S&P (it's above my paygrade to explain this), and unless something comes up that would interrupt it OR you get a capitulation push up somewhat like June 5th-8th/September 2nd/October 12th last year, the window is closed on a deeper pullback for now.

I have a feeling that capitulation is coming soon, it just hasn't quite yet. Since this post options expiring window failed to be more, while late May could do it, my guess is that we wind up with somewhat of a June 2020 repeat in June with a quick pullback and then chop (so it'll be the 5th time where this 2021 pattern fails)."

Because you're 3 times leveraged, that means you need the nasdaq to go up 16.4% to *break even* (meaning you'd be in a right now if you'd actually done this in feb, even though nasdaq is higher right now). In a normal market, 10% a year is a good return - if you need 16% just to break even...

And thats during a minor, everyday, market correction. In a larger correction of 20% or a crash of 30%...you could quickly lose all or most of your money. Market corrects 20%, you lose 60% of your money, you now need more market to go up by 150% to break even.

But yeah, thermo is the gold standard for a lot of common equipment like incubators and water baths, and for things that there are ""better"" companies for like centrifuges (beckman coulter/danaher #1) and chromatography (waters, agilent), thermo still makes pretty good equipment. I was trying to think of something thermo DOESN'T have and I thought of NMR... but lo and behold I looked it up and they do have NMR equipment, albeit minor stuff (bruker is #1 for NMR). They basically offer must-haves as well as high end innovative equipment in the realm of mass spec and cryoEM. So not only do they have this massive array of products, there's also constant innovation. And the recent acquisitions of patheon and PPD show them diversifying their offerings into the services side of thing. Patheon and PPD actually complement each other quite well. Patheon is a CRO that does work more on the manufacturing/distribution/logistics side of things and PPD is more on the clinical/testing side of things.

2021-04-29 20:09:50,stocks,"Most of the people on these subs do hype it up as a long term play, but yeah the hype revolves around a short squeeze. The reason people think it can hit astronomical numbers is because we are pretty certain there is more than 100% ownership of GME, which is only possible because of short sellers over-shorting the stock.  The current available float is around 26MM, not including ETFs and smaller whales that hold shares. I saw one post that added those up and the float came to around 16MM, i dont know how accurate it is, but one things for sure. There aren’t many shares left. A whole lot of different calculations from different DD’s point to retail easily owning more than 26MM shares (if you’re interested I’ll try to find some). We won’t truly know though until the votes roll in for GME’s shareholder meeting in June. 
With this in mind, if/when the short positions are margin called, they would have to buy back everything until there are only 70MM shares in existence again. BUT, if retail owns the float, retail sets their own price for selling shares the shorts are covering. This is where I agree with you on the cultish nature of the sub, theoretically in this case retail can hold until a share is worth millions, but psychologically I don’t think it will go that far considering shorts would have to cover until there is 70MM shares in existence again. 
The reason the ludicrous hope of a short squeeze is justified is because it’s likely retail adds up to more than 100% ownership, and with GME’s future looking brighter, the shorts will have to cover at some point. How ludicrously high the share price can go though, we’ll have to wait and see. All depends on what price retailers will begin to sell their shares."

Here's an article about his vision currently, and as you can see, he has already implemented many of the strategies he wanted to since November.  Plus more, like paying off debt early.

I think he's moving customer service centers to the US, and he's going to make the customer service more like it was at chewy, with a personal touch.

I think he's going to continue with the buy online, same - day pickup or delivery, and expand that as much as possible.

I think they may use retail locations as gaming centers for esports and they'll start selling PC parts.  I think maybe they'll even have an option to pick the PC parts and have it put together for you.

I think he will start doing mail- order trade-ins.

I needed a webcam for video conferencing and that was the only place around that I could order online and pick it up so I guess I'm biased.

2021-04-30 13:27:08,stocks,"I think the big catalyst here (understanding I'm coming in a bit late to the conversation) is the government contracts. First, charging stations to support the GSA fleet the Biden Administration is pushing. Second, with the various state DOTs to install charging infrastructure on the nation's highways. Third, with corporate fleets or as mass charging stations around office parks and buildings. I do not think what I call ""short-term destination"" charging is going to take off because it's simply not needed. Let me explain.

EV users generally charge in one of three places. At their homes, at designated charging areas along highways during road trips, or at their place of employment. Why? It's easy, figures into a plan, and in the case of the highway spots necessary. Short-term destination parking I define as limited trips lasting less than an hour round-trip. Those chargers in library parking lots, randomly placed on city streets, or at the grocery store fit this area for EV users out and about on errands.

I rarely see EVs plugged into them and when I do (and when I do it myself) it's generally because I forgot to charge or just need an extra few miles to get me comfortably home with room to spare. The Blink chargers in my area never get used. The ones on city streets are limited to an hour before you -must- move your car to a different non-charging space, making them a huge headache. The power company installed ones near a grocery store that see the odd Leaf parked at, but nothing else. No one is going to go through the hassle of getting an account, downloading an app, and spending 5-10 minutes setting up to plug in for a 30-minute trip to buy something at Trader Joes. Let alone that the EV chargers are often installed out of the way and require a walk or traversing a street crossing. Simply put, they are not practical and no one needs to use them to carry on with their every day lives. That is the problem.

With fleets, can you really see the Amazon van drivers pulling over at a charging station to waste their precious lunch-break (do they get those? Maybe?) moments. No. They are going to stop when they can before keep going, not wasting time to charge in-between runs. Like most fleets it'll be charge up in off-hours, unplug, do what fleets do, then plug-in once done.

The real money maker for the long-play is in infrastructure buildout and fleet support. I see CHPT winning in the field and that's where my money is going. Why? They are positioned to pursue contracts because they already have relationships with the manufacturers that will build fleets - GM, Ford, etc."
