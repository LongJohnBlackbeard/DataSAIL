2021-05-12 19:41:23,wallstreetbets,"Your point is true that assets do not lose value with inflation. But true ""assets"", not artificially inflated assets due to low interest rate."
2021-05-12 19:36:45,wallstreetbets,The only things that are really inflated here are my tiddies.
2021-05-12 19:57:05,wallstreetbets,"OP the entire market is not confused as to what inflation means, but thanks for trying to clarify in your  own words. You are missing some key points. 

Consider the following — the market is a discounting mechanism. Future cash flows are eroded when the discount rate increases. Treasury yields are a component of the discount rate. Further, inflation reduces the purchasing power of the US dollar, which means investors would demand more cash flows to achieve the same nominal returns considering inflation."
2021-05-12 19:52:59,wallstreetbets,Stock market in the 70s would like to speak with you
2021-05-12 19:38:10,wallstreetbets,If tech multiples weren’t already through the roof I would be less worried about inflation. But with Apple and Google at 30x multiples during the start of this sell off with the threat of looming rates on the horizon of course the market especially tech is going to reset.
2021-05-12 19:39:11,wallstreetbets,"Inflation means much higher rates, much higher rates means many of the companies that took out massive amounts of debt will have to refy at much higher rates. Most wouldn’t be able to cope with the debt burden... so on an so forth... be careful out there.  Corporate debt is at record levels almost 2x of the debt during the peak of 08 financial crisis."
2021-05-12 19:37:15,wallstreetbets,Bring it!
2021-05-12 19:39:18,wallstreetbets,You forgot to factor bonds into your theory.  That’s what you’re missing here.
2021-05-12 19:54:39,wallstreetbets,Your analysis isn't wrong... But your conclusion on the why is off. They aren't selling in anticipation of prolonged inflation. They are selling off in anticipation of a fed rate hike reaction.
2021-05-12 19:56:17,wallstreetbets,"We printed 25 % of ALL CASH in America in the last year. Tell me hyperinflation won't follow, you're crazy."
2021-05-12 19:37:51,wallstreetbets,"Same here, buying dips is my favorite 😍"
2021-05-12 19:47:12,wallstreetbets,"Inflation affects future value my friend... market is forward looking... inflation makes it all the harder for future growth of an equity.. you know that thing called p/e... price to earnings.. it’s never 1, right, the average in the S&P is 23... what does that mean.. current price is based on a multiple of 23, based on EXPECTED future earnings... with inflation, that means it’ll take even more future revenue than currently factored in... make sense.. that’s why “growth” stocks with little to no real revenue, no dividend, just expected future revenue and a “great” business model, are selling off...basically, look for value and growth... and a dividend... if you look close enough, you’ll see VIAC is that stock.. and why it’s barely down on a week that was a bloodbath...."
2021-05-12 19:38:26,wallstreetbets,Mmmm tiddies. Need pics.
2021-05-12 19:53:53,wallstreetbets,"Always a treat to hear about your tiddies, u/manbeastjoe."
2021-05-12 19:50:39,wallstreetbets,"While this is important, the impact is far less severe on average than the impact rising rates has on the value of a firm's cash flow."
2021-05-12 19:47:04,wallstreetbets,wouldn't bond owners still lose since the rate won't keep up?
2021-05-12 19:48:29,wallstreetbets,"What are bond rates doing? They're rising. Bonds are units of debt. Meaning when they are rising, they're being sold. Normally, when cash moves out of the debt market it moves into stocks. Using today as an example.. We have have bonds rates going up along with the markets dropping. Cash is flowing into cash.

Cash doesn't stay in cash for long, especially when it's reason for going into cash is inflation (meaning when cash is devaluing). This cash is gonna go somewhere once it wakes up and smells the coffee.

Where? My bet are known inflation hedging assests. This would not be the first example of this. History is chalk full of cash fueled with fears of inflation and where it typically ends up."
2021-05-12 19:39:38,wallstreetbets,Same if by buying dips you mean buying what you think is the bottom and then losing an ass ton of money
2021-05-12 19:40:02,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, can't find a big enough lens for my camera"
2021-05-12 19:58:41,wallstreetbets,"Yup, the future discounted cash flow goes down, which meant so does the firm’s value"
2021-05-12 19:55:00,wallstreetbets,"Exactly,! When you factor the yields with the rate of Inflation.. your return is less than zero. These are called ""Real Rates"". 

You warm my toxic heart."
2021-05-12 19:41:24,wallstreetbets,"Nahh, I invest to win. I don’t panic and sell for losses. It’s called - don’t invest if you are not willing to risk 😌"
2021-05-12 19:48:02,wallstreetbets,Funny... I can't find a small enough one for my....oh never mind.
2021-05-12 19:57:01,wallstreetbets,"That sounds like “I invest to win... or lose. Either way, it’s OK.”"
2021-05-12 19:43:22,wallstreetbets,Now is just good time to buy. No?
2021-05-12 19:24:41,wallstreetbets,Yep and Citi gave PLTR a price target increase from $15 to $170…now they say it was supposed to be $17…I say…WSB should take it to $170 anyway!! 😂😂😂🦍🚀

That being said...always love me a little VIX."
2021-05-12 19:06:55,wallstreetbets,Except OP is so retarded he thinks UVXY and VIX are the same thing
2021-05-12 17:48:15,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, market goes down again tomorrow and I profit. Market goes up and I'm buying a bus pass.

Black jack dealer never questioned me for hitting when I have 20."
2021-05-12 18:33:06,wallstreetbets,I just bought them near the end of the day. Day gain won't be accurate until tomorrow. Total gain is accurate so far.
2021-05-12 18:00:57,wallstreetbets,"UVXY is also very unkind to sideways. Its programmed to hit a 1:5 split at the bottom, just a heads up."
2021-05-12 18:34:29,wallstreetbets,Better than me. I bought VIX PUT yesterday ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)

2021-05-12 19:01:20,wallstreetbets,What about the GLD etf? Would there be more advantages to owning other gold funds?
2021-05-12 18:35:41,wallstreetbets,Inflation + Stagflation for a few quarters >> Depression. All of these 3 scenarios are Great for Gold and silver!!!
2021-05-12 18:31:16,wallstreetbets,"general thesis is good

actual numbers are hilariously off

id be surprised if gold runs more than 15% before the hike expectations lands and people shift to something else

still, 15% is nothing to sneeze at

youll get more bang for your buck from silver though"
2021-05-12 17:57:21,wallstreetbets,I prefer the digital gold. The computer currency ;)

2021-05-12 19:10:31,wallstreetbets,They’re mostly the same. The benefit of owning the miners is that they produce income (through buybacks and dividends) and grow production (very marginally!) while holding physical gold yields no income. And the miners’ returns tend to be a more leveraged form of the physical commodity.
2021-05-12 18:46:27,wallstreetbets,"Yes the magnitude will depend on how long it would take the Fed to prioritize inflation over employment.

A thought on gold/silver - the gold/silver ratio has historically been anti-cyclical, so silver outperforms in good times and Vice versa. I would think gold would re-take the reigns in this scenario"
2021-05-12 19:18:18,wallstreetbets,LOL how are your ARK funds doing lately?

2021-05-12 17:28:47,wallstreetbets,"If interested, please take a look at what happened to solar names in December of 2015 when solar ITC was extended for 3 yrs (they rose ~50% in a few days)...Biden announced he wishes to extend it for 10 yrs, presenting a very asymmetric opportunity. Aside from a healthy short interest, an oversold condition, this stock has a very high concentration of passive shareholders (specifically coatue and tiger global) who did not touch their stakes when the stock was at 96. Lastly, analysts have PTs between 70-80. Will post monthly updates, but the fun begins in July (when infrastructure is expected to pass)."
2021-05-12 19:21:40,wallstreetbets,Can confirm this company's leadership is top notch and they are 100% trying to be the top solar installer and they are killing it. In for 360 shares

2021-05-12 19:05:07,wallstreetbets,sold last week when it was trending down and thank god i dodged this bullet. unreal.
2021-05-12 18:26:51,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, a buying opportunity? Good write up."
2021-05-12 18:32:45,wallstreetbets,so should we buy? it can’t go much lower right?
2021-05-12 19:21:24,wallstreetbets,Wow you bought? Really? I mean really? Holy fuck you might actually be brain dead right now. Close the position you fucker and protect your capital

2021-05-12 18:09:09,wallstreetbets,These share buybacks are huge with such a small float.
2021-05-12 17:24:44,wallstreetbets,"The idea that someone shorting 1200 shares drove the price down doesn't really make a lot of sense.

You don't even know that the drop in availability was due to someone shorting.  It could just as easily be someone whose shares are available to be borrowed sold some shares (and the rise to 3000 could be that someone bought some; not necessarily someone covering).

Personally I have 33k shares and about 25k are lent out.  Fidelity pays me 60% of the borrow rate and today I was getting 2.5%; I'm hoping that it really has spiked to 40% (which would pay me 24% annualized)"
2021-05-12 18:03:07,wallstreetbets,Why do you assume that because the stock went down that it was due to shorting activity?  People could have been selling to close long positions.  That's common at the end of the day (when day traders who are using their day trading buying power are forced to close their positions)

2021-05-12 16:59:05,wallstreetbets,I was deep in calls and shares already before today. I'm gonna liquidate some crap to load up more this thing is just ripe for launch
2021-05-12 17:45:18,wallstreetbets,"No explanation needed I will tell you what happened.

I sold my 5/21 10c and five seconds later UWMC rocketed. I had to give the guy who bought it a hand jigger just to take it. You're welcome."
2021-05-12 18:04:56,wallstreetbets,I averaged up and then averaged back down on this stock. I'd love to see a little pop on this bad boy.
2021-05-12 19:11:13,wallstreetbets,lets go
2021-05-12 17:17:41,wallstreetbets,Well guess its time to buy.
2021-05-12 16:50:32,wallstreetbets,"Do you know if there's any way to actually know if the buybacks are happening? All I can see from the rules is it needs to be disclosed on the quarterly report. Maybe shares outstanding goes down?

UWMC can buy about 21 million shares before reducing the public float below 5%, preventing Russell inclusion. About half of the 300M authorization at this price."
2021-05-12 16:55:57,wallstreetbets,This is a great explanation of what is currently in play.
2021-05-12 17:06:32,wallstreetbets,@ $8ish they can buy back almost 1/3rd of the float I believe!
2021-05-12 17:39:05,wallstreetbets,Good write up - thx.
2021-05-12 19:04:44,wallstreetbets,"Also for reference, while yes, Matt can buyback shares, according to 10b. He can only make 1 purchase per day and no more than 25% of the daily average. If im understanding that correctly. 

Feel free to correct me if I'm wrong."

2021-05-12 16:52:55,wallstreetbets,Tl;dr. Buy more UWMC
2021-05-12 18:09:47,wallstreetbets,Waiting for UWMC to RocKeT
2021-05-12 19:11:50,wallstreetbets,"Unlikely they blew their load on day 1 of the buyback, there were likely other market factors at play, like the CEO doing interviews talking about how they are less cyclical and their earnings felt more of the bump in interest rates quicker.  He called out his competitors who take longer to close of having more benefit this quarter as spillover from the previous quarter.

There is some logic to what he's saying, and they haven't been public long enough to call bullshit on what he says.

If this goes much lower, they would essentially be buying the float, and they have the cash to do it.

Home sale volumes were slower in Q1, UWMCs strength is new home purchases, not refinances.  We'll see if volumes pick up in Q2 and Q3 which are traditionally stronger months, and what margins end up looking like."
2021-05-12 16:56:13,wallstreetbets,"Solid explanation! Looking forward for a potential shorts squeeze and or gamma squeeze. Why someone would hold a short position after today is beyond me, but more than happy to take their money!"
2021-05-12 17:24:11,wallstreetbets,Puts will print
2021-05-12 18:29:26,wallstreetbets,dead cat bounce
2021-05-12 17:51:29,wallstreetbets,"Considering the market shit a brick the last 3 days amid inflationary fears, UWMC going above ten percent at one point in today is noteworthy. Don't get me wrong, it's still down, but if you bought in the 6's or low 7's or averaged down to that you're quite happy. 

I think it will continue to go up, based on what's currently happening, but today was exceptional comparatively to the broader market."
2021-05-12 17:56:36,wallstreetbets,"Yeah lmao, 1200 shares is fucking nothing. 100-300 times that amount was being traded every five minutes at points today."
2021-05-12 17:45:03,wallstreetbets,"[https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC) will tell you  the fee. 

With that said I borrow desk gets its data from IB, and all data is sourced from there for the availability of shares and rates. Per their FAQ:  

""It's important to understand that because IBorrowDesk only reports data from a single (albeit very large) brokerage, the fee and availability reported may be different at other brokerages.""

Your rates are likely different since you're on Fidelity.

With that said. Low volume driving prices up or down, even significantly so, has some basis in fact. If you look at the volume and price fluctuations in the after hours you can see that in play for example. A five minute period in the normal trading hours could have more volume than the pre-market and after hours trading volume. 

Even so, it's likely that short activity was using shares from places other than IB or in addition to IB. The five minute period from 3:55 to 4:00 is when it dived somewhat. That period had volume of roughly 111k shares trading hands. If they are borrowing from more than one brokerage suddenly you can see how it can start affecting prices at certain inflection points."
2021-05-12 18:00:39,wallstreetbets,Why do you let hedge funds destroy a stock that you own?
2021-05-12 18:08:24,wallstreetbets,"To open a short position, a trader must have a margin account and will usually have to pay interest on the value of the borrowed shares while the position is open. At least for Iborrowdesk (IBKR), each share is for short selling because there is a fee associated with it."
2021-05-12 17:28:08,wallstreetbets,Green tendies for everyone.
2021-05-12 17:50:43,wallstreetbets,Heavy bags here too but looks like the trend is reversing now. Congrats to apes who entered at these good prices though.

2021-05-12 19:11:33,wallstreetbets,666 the number of the beastttttt!!!
2021-05-12 19:56:12,wallstreetbets,"That's a loaded question because there are so many variables. In order for this to work we would need 5/21 9c to go ITM. If that happens and holds long enough that MM have to hedge with shares, this could gamma ramp... maybe 12.. maybe 15... maybe more... maybe less... OI on 5/21 calls is still high.

I do think it's going to be really difficult to get 9c ITM though... but it also depends on if Matt swings his big green hulk dick and if he does, how much he swings."
2021-05-12 17:30:23,wallstreetbets,Yes. Also set your sell limits high so your shares are on ‘order’ and therefore can’t borrow them to short...not that they would want to at this point lol
2021-05-12 17:09:27,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-12 16:58:36,wallstreetbets,"You won't know until then. However, if the quarterly report is released and there has been significant buy back, you don't want to be a short in that position."
2021-05-12 17:01:26,wallstreetbets,"Can’t tell ... maybe if the avg volume is higher than the previous day, that could be a sign that the buyback is going through but that could also just be more people buying now.... so not really, we have just slight clues. Happy hunting. #shortrfuk"
2021-05-12 16:55:45,wallstreetbets,"We'll only know on the Q, but considering the volume today compared to the last 2 days (or even the daily moving average), I wouldn't doubt it. Especially considering the dividend yield UWMC would be scooping these shares at.

To add to that he stated he would do a buyback today on the earnings call yesterday, and just needed to make sure with legal that he was doing it by the rules of 10b (the rules I speak of). Section 240.14c-6(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 governs false or misleading statements, and so I highly doubt he flat out lied to us. Legal likely cleared him to start buying today, and so he did."
2021-05-12 17:01:03,wallstreetbets,"It won’t reduce the public float.  They are retiring the shares and keeping the public float at 5%.  So, each share held is higher percentage of the company."
2021-05-12 19:47:47,wallstreetbets,7000  shares and 49 May 21 7.5C's
2021-05-12 18:34:41,wallstreetbets,Indeed!
2021-05-12 18:22:29,wallstreetbets,Did you not read the above? the more volume the more buyback that can occur! no need to wait!
2021-05-12 19:14:02,wallstreetbets,They're limited to buying 25 percent of the moving average volume per day. Blowing ones load means roughly 9 million dollars worth of shares were bought. Even if he did this for 10-20 days straight he'd only be done with 30-40 percent of the share buyback.
2021-05-12 19:51:15,wallstreetbets,He can only make one buyback purchase a day and no more than 25% of the average daily volume. Will more than likely be a few purchases a week as long as he is still buying at prices that make sense to him
2021-05-12 18:53:07,wallstreetbets,Because MM more than likely make up the largest portion of borrowed shares and they are desperately trying to prevent the 9c from going ITM. So losing a little money shorting shares is a drop in the bucket to what they could lose if this 9c go ITM and this gamma squeezes.
2021-05-12 17:42:29,wallstreetbets,They absolutely will and people will talk about how wsb lost them money next week when they just had to see the writing on the wall with all these shit dds.
2021-05-12 18:53:26,wallstreetbets,"Noteworthy, yes.  But I'm only green now because I was able to average down significantly.  Slowly clawing its way back (hopefully) in the direction of its target price isn't going anywhere near the moon, it's just recovering.  Slightly.

But hey, I'm back in the green, and I can't wait to see it recover more."
2021-05-12 18:14:06,wallstreetbets,"As I've said, the link i provided only tracks the shares available to borrow for IBKR which is only one of many brokerages. There are other brokerages, and if you tally it up that's when it happens."
2021-05-12 18:05:02,wallstreetbets,"I'm not stupid enough to believe that short selling matters to stock price.

I'm also not stupid enough to believe that all short selling on done by hedge funds."
2021-05-12 18:16:10,wallstreetbets,"How is that all at relevant to what I wrote?

Shares available to borrow can fluctuate without anyone selling short or any short covering.  If someone whose shares are available to be lent buys or sells that also changes the inventory.

The price dropping does not necessarily correspond to increased short selling.  People could simply be closing out long positions.  Day traders (who use buying power in excess of their overnight buying power) are required to do this at the end of every trading day (or face a fed call the next morning)"
2021-05-12 18:10:33,wallstreetbets,"I'm actually going to follow that up with this Investopedia portion to give you some insight:

Costs of Short Selling  
Unlike buying and holding stocks or investments, short selling involves significant costs, in addition to the usual trading commissions that have to be paid to brokers. Some of the costs include:   
  
Margin Interest   
Margin interest can be a significant expense when trading stocks on margin. Since short sales can only be made via margin accounts, the interest payable on short trades can add up over time, especially if short positions are kept open over an extended period.  
  
Stock Borrowing Costs  
Shares that are difficult to borrow—because of high short interest, limited float, or any other reason—have “hard-to-borrow” fees that can be quite substantial. The fee is based on an annualized rate that can range from a small fraction of a percent to more than 100% of the value of the short trade and is pro-rated for the number of days that the short trade is open.  
  
As the hard-to-borrow rate can fluctuate substantially from day to day and even on an intra-day basis, the exact dollar amount of the fee may not be known in advance. The fee is usually assessed by the broker-dealer to the client’s account either at month-end or upon closing of the short trade, and if it is quite large, can make a big dent in the profitability of a short trade or exacerbate losses on it.  
  
Dividends and other Payments  
The short seller is responsible for making dividend payments on the shorted stock to the entity from whom the stock has been borrowed. The short seller is also on the hook for making payments on account of other events associated with the shorted stock, such as share splits, spin-offs, and bonus share issues, all of which are unpredictable events."
2021-05-12 19:18:27,wallstreetbets,Baby ape checking in and supporting the cause.  Buy shares my friends.  Buy shares.

2021-05-12 17:38:59,wallstreetbets,Mine are locked up in covered calls. Collecting divies. Want some tendies from my 5/21 options.
2021-05-12 17:12:42,wallstreetbets,"Yes I do, my cost basis was 8.57/share. I was still buying at 9.50, I grabbed a bunch sub 7 to average down to 7.97. 

This has an annual divi of .40 so yes I think its a great long term hold. Will it squeeze? I'm not sure but the pieces are all there. If it doesn't squeeze I dont care, its a healthy stock to own."
2021-05-12 17:26:08,wallstreetbets,If you don't have money to loose don't play this game.
2021-05-12 18:05:49,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure I see how that math works out.

Let's say 7% (7/100) of the company is public float, 93% (93/100) is not.  The company buys back a full 1% of the public float and retires it.  The public float is now 6.06% (6/99) and 93.94% (93/99) is not.

Each remaining share is worth a larger portion of the company, but the public float is still reduced.

Or am I misunderstanding what it means to retire a share?"
2021-05-12 18:25:16,wallstreetbets,I was being punning
2021-05-12 19:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, the numbers are likely lower.  HFTs are usually a large part of volume, I doubt they maxed their buy today, but still possible."
2021-05-12 17:45:20,wallstreetbets,ShORt SqEeZe
2021-05-12 18:57:59,wallstreetbets,"Remember you now have a nicer yield and cost basis, and the stock is now moving towards what its FMV is meant to be. It's a glass half full, not empty, for you because you averaged down. Now, per dollar, you'll receive more economic benefit.

The market reached all time highs while this was diving down, but now the stock market is tanking and this stock is heading up. You have to weigh the pros and cons of that, and ultimately see if UWMC gets you a higher net return than the broader market YTD once this is all over. 

I hope i was somewhat clear in this comment."
2021-05-12 18:06:38,wallstreetbets,You don’t think short selling can manipulate the price of a stock?
2021-05-12 18:38:53,wallstreetbets,"I'm going to try to be clearer then. Fog of war is a bitch, and it exists for both institutional investors and for retail investors. However, fog of war is much higher when it comes to retail. I don't know what it was, and i doubt institutional investors would to. What we can do is hypothesize. 

The rule I mentioned bans a company of UWMC's size from buying back its stock ten minutes before close. What that means is that it is easier for someone short to safely short the stock in the last ten minutes of the day. With that said, that's not enough empirical evidence.

14.6 %	30,000	2021-05-12 09:00:03  
14.5 %	400,000	2021-05-11 16:45:03

These two dates matter. One is the last reported metric for 5/11/2021. The other is start of reporting for today. 370,000 extra shares were borrowed the following day at the start of reporting. As the day went on, the fee went to the mid twenties and then 34.9%. 

IBKR's margin is 1.5% annually if I remember correctly. Let's say that a day trader bought 1 Million on margin. 1M\*.015= 15,0000 in interest. 15,000/52=41.09$ a day in interest. Therefore, it is cheap to buy on margin for day traders. With that said, the stock didn't exactly look good from a technical standpoint, but hey, they could have been momentum or swing trading. Regardless, if they bought on margin, they made 8.69% at close. That would mean they made 86,900 minus 41 dollars. So, the chances that a day trader would need to close or fall foul of overnight buying power maintenance is a bit of a stretch. 

It could be some people realizing gains, from the 6's. With that said, volume has been thin, and i don't think profit taking would have been excessive considering the continuing upside, and limited downside. 

But here's what I -know-. As of the 30th of April, more than 15% of the float was sold short. And the second thing i know is that the amount of shares that can be borrowed is limited, and the fact of the matter is that the hard to borrow rate means that there is share compression for shares to borrow. Hence, i am taking the clues and making a hypothesis on what I feel is correct. 

But you can come to your own conclusion."
2021-05-12 18:59:05,wallstreetbets,"Hypothetically, if I borrowed 1 million shares at fee % of 3.9... and days later, that fee goes to 30% , would I be held to the 3.9% or would my fee increase as well?"
2021-05-12 19:20:57,wallstreetbets,"Short sellers factor in the fees when they take on the position.  Often positions are complex and not just one sided equity shorts.

Example, if you shorted 100 shares today at 7.35 with an expected avg borrow rate of 17.5% and sold a Jun 6$ put at the .23 last sale price, you would still come out ahead like $5 if the price stays the same.  Of course you are limited to (135 + 23 - interest) profit.  Point being if your thesis is the stock is going to drop by X amount by Y date, you can normally mitigate interest."

2021-05-12 19:00:51,wallstreetbets,Your margin and margin maintenance rate are in real time. Volatility forces a higher margin maintenance amount on you for example. To add to that there are the hard to borrow rates which can fluctuate day to day.
2021-05-12 19:31:22,wallstreetbets,If you truly believe shorts cannot effect a stock price.....
2021-05-12 19:02:47,wallstreetbets,So essentially the answer is yes... kind of... the 3.9 that I borrowed at is not fixed in place.

2021-05-12 17:24:46,wallstreetbets,"I can walk into a lidl or Aldi buy 3 tins of veg for a pound , monzarrea for 30 pence and like 5 large pizza bases for cheap plus some cheddar , so now I am make 5 large pizzas for 5 pound total economy of scale work great , have you guys tried farming with all that land you have ?"

2021-05-12 16:46:25,wallstreetbets,So buy in hopes that someone buys them. Looks like you'll be left holding the bag
2021-05-12 16:17:07,wallstreetbets,Damn son you about to be out 20 grand. I salute you
2021-05-12 16:22:29,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you just Venmo me this money instead of losing it all
2021-05-12 16:30:59,wallstreetbets,"You know after 10 consecutive weeks of institutional investors selling all their bags and getting margin called I think you might just have timed the market perfectly. 

I’m sure this can’t go tits up..."
2021-05-12 16:15:52,wallstreetbets,I fucking hope so. HD and MSFT were holding my portfolio together the last 30 days until everything went to shit this week.
2021-05-12 16:27:32,wallstreetbets,Good luck man. I would have at least push the expiration date a month later. 5-14 is really close. Hopefully you make some money
2021-05-12 16:38:12,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-05-12 16:17:33,wallstreetbets,i will buy tomorrow prob
2021-05-12 16:41:22,wallstreetbets,Brought a big position today too..but June 4th expiry
2021-05-12 16:52:22,wallstreetbets,!remindme 2 days
2021-05-12 17:24:00,wallstreetbets,I’ve got $230 leaps to 1/20/23.  They’ve been beaten up a bit.  I may double down this week.
2021-05-12 18:26:15,wallstreetbets,I hope so too or else I’m out 1500 from an earnings play
2021-05-12 18:40:40,wallstreetbets,"Good luck dude - with a VIX at 27, another day like today and this thing breaks 230 before it's even looked at for a buy from the big guys... selling pressure is high, MACD and CCI are pointing to bear territory and the latest round of news wasn't all that positive.

&#x200B;

If I thought you were right, I probably still wouldn't be buying calls but selling puts instead. if you're right, you collect up front and carry less risk.

&#x200B;

I wish you well sir, I hope I'm wrong and you get paid!!"
2021-05-12 16:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Nah Friday will be above $245. Market is extremely oversold. Inflation FUD will wear off tomorrow once people realize it’s not as bad as people say. Fed will calm the waters with their bullshit. People will realize that MSFT margins and profits are not affected by the employment numbers. Market took a shit and scalping is what I do.

Update sold 57 of the contracts for ~$3.30 at opening for ~50% profit"
2021-05-12 17:35:25,wallstreetbets,Because MSFT has closed its third consecutive red day. It hasn’t gone four since the covid slump in feb 2020 meaning the possibility of it going five is even lower. So if I’m wrong the entire market is going through a historic trend change and will be coming down. If I’m right it’ll continue it’s upward slow trend and worst case scenario I hit my break even.
2021-05-12 16:37:19,wallstreetbets,"You know what they say, timing over time in"
2021-05-12 16:40:58,wallstreetbets,I have 300 6/11 calls at $257.5 but that’s not a yolo that’s just common sense. This fits the yolo.
2021-05-12 18:45:41,wallstreetbets,"Well another day like today the whole market comes down. So it doesn’t matter where your money is at. I am simply betting the bull market is not over. I have an algo that tells me every time a FAANG reaches its most consecutive days red since the covid fall and I buy calls on the last days low. I haven’t lost one, but I haven’t yolod a single one. If this trend is broken I think the bull run is coming to an end."
2021-05-12 16:30:05,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 2 days
2021-05-12 17:25:51,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 2 days

2021-05-12 17:42:55,wallstreetbets,Good analysis ty
2021-05-12 19:00:32,wallstreetbets,"If you could pair your algo with some sort of technical analysis, I might give it some credibility...

Banking on history repeating itself again is just poor investment strategy. There's absolutely nothing that says that if a stock tanks 3 days in a row, the 4th will be otherwise."
2021-05-12 17:45:55,wallstreetbets,Not financial advice if you’re going to do the same remember a 1/400 still has a chance.
2021-05-12 19:03:34,wallstreetbets,"This is very true, that’s why it is yolo. Even more of a yolo when you add the immense pressure the market is under and all the FUD. Maybe this Friday will be the first time it’s wrong this year."
2021-05-12 18:17:52,wallstreetbets,Copy that financial advise was received I’ll keep you up to date
2021-05-12 19:06:15,wallstreetbets,"I'm more scared of people like you who are ""trying"" to make it work... all the retards on here - let's all be honest here...

How many of ya'll are loosing your asses overall? how many are scared their retirement account will take forever to get back to where it was just 30 days ago?

That's a bigger risk to the economy - a bunch of retards throwing their money in something they don't understand and end up broke..."

2021-05-12 16:22:29,wallstreetbets,Yea I bet I’m kicking around the idea of buying some calls for June 11th it’s the day after they release the CPI for that month and with it being summer I think the US will be feeling the gas prices rising meaning it’s not this “transitionary” inflation the talking heads keep pitching.
2021-05-12 16:21:49,wallstreetbets,"Haha yeah I thinking ""f* it, down 50% .. may as well let it ride to, $0"" but was taking a beating elsewhere and decided to cut my losses.

Real estate - yes we are seeing this already. A bubble is forming.

There's something not plumb, and I think it's that with poor jobs numbers, higher unemployment numbers, higher than expected inflation, highest ever national debt, and money supply up 500% in 12 months - well if they let the stock market tank like Taiwan has for example - then it would be an unholy combination of super bearish signals that would send the world into a tailspin.

Markets don't srop 9% independently, it's usually a problem everywhere when it happens and it ripples out, Taiwan took a beating, we got a minor slap on the cheek.

Lets hope they can keep it propped up, because if they can't then the fall out after trying to prop it up will be a major correction and a financial disaster for everyone, everywhere."

2021-05-12 16:08:09,wallstreetbets,"$UWMC ULTIMATE DD  
  
By now most of us are familiar with UWMC. The massive 5.75% dividend. Their insanely LOW P/E of about 3.9 and their insane income growth. 4,200% increase in net income! 🚀 (No that’s not a typo)  
  
So why would any one want to buy this stock right now ?  
  
The CEO is a beast. And not only did they reaffirm their dividend (ex date in June) and just make $860M in the first quarter, they announced the approval of a $300M stock buy back. That’s big money ! But let’s dive deeper. The $300M share buy back is of the class A shares that are in the float. $UWMC has a very small float.  
  
104M shares. $300M / $6.70 = 45M. That means at current prices they can buy back nearly 44% of the entire F\*\*kin float. You have never heard of that before and you probably never will again. On earnings call yesterday CEO says “We can start buying shares tomorrow and I am a buyer at this price !”  
  
So that leaves 60M shares left in the float. Institutions own 23M of them (I bet it’s higher) short interest is close to 13M based on latest data.  
  
This just caused the borrow rate to increase by 5X ! new data shows short borrow rates just hit 25%  
  
Apes, there are less than 35M shares freely traded in this stock right now.  
  
On top of all this we still have Russell Inclusion to be announced in June and another blow out 2Q is in the works.  
  
This is NOT financial advice but I can't think of a reason I shouldn’t park a few dollars in a highly profitable stock, trading at all time lows, paying a 6% dividend with a current p/e under 4?  
  
My position 7900 shares @ 7.64 and 45x 6/18 8c  
  
TL,DR 🏘=💵💵💵💵 = UWMC 🚀🚀🚀🤑  
  
Edit: since I posted there are only 2,000 shares to loan and the borrow rate is 35%!!?!??"

In 1999 eToys (dot) com were turning over $30 million a year, while toysrus were turning over $30 million a day. Toysrus made $376 million that year, while etoys eventually went bust with debts of $276 million (toysrus bought the domain name, if you tried to go to etoys you ended up at toysrus).

etoys had an enterprise value of 7.7 billion, 35% more than toysrus, because ""da future"".

Today tesla has a m/cap of 568 billion (and that's DOWN from it's high of $880/share) , PE of over 600 makes no money, costs are going up (metal prices are surging, and ev's need lots of metals), energy prices are going up, making running one more expensive too, and they are expensive to start with.

But it's the future.... So was etoys.

Being able to explain how glutamate might provide a better approach by forcing more mechanisms of action, how and what neuroplasticity means (and by default now looking at brain care similar to training or anti-aging), and how these treatments may actually be useful for maintenance protocols for a wide swath of people, reinforces your investment thesis.

2021-05-12 16:21:42,wallstreetbets,"I would argue SSRI and SNRIs are not major breakthroughs at all.  In fact, the mechanisms of the drugs and their explanations are horse manure.  

Ketamine has been around longer than any SSRI and SNRI treatment.  It works in glutamate pathways as does psilocybin.  Given the prevalence of glutamate in the brain, we see explosive action in the brain with these alternative treatments.  I would caution you with your equating psilocybin mechanisms to any SSRI action.  It simply doesnt work like these drugs.

Medical psychiatry has unfortunately harmed generations of indviduals with reliance on SSRI and SNRI drugs where efficacy rates border on laughable in placebo tests.  They create dependency, almost uniformly have no impact on plasticity, and have horrific side effect profiles.  However, they have dramatically increased dependency on psychiatrists and driven revenue for the health system with med check up visits.

The DEA and our politicians also bare a tremendous responsibility on the current state of psychiatric pharmacology."

We are slowly chipping away at the iceberg which froze all of the research and finally turning the tide of the war on drugs, showing the world just what silly little charlatans the narco pigs are! We all need to do our part to support research, and guide the legislation, one day ending prohibition once and for all!"
2021-05-12 16:23:43,wallstreetbets,All these med students thinking they are finance majors 🤣 ayeayeaye.  This stock doesn’t have any fundamental value right now and won’t for 5 years minimum.
2021-05-12 16:29:25,wallstreetbets,"They need to be significantly better than ssris. That's the problem.

They are entrenched because they are ""safe"" and people actually believe they work well.

If you work in psychiatry you know how slow and lumbering that machine is, and you should know how promising novel drugs don't tend to get far. There would need to be vast amounts of data showing significantly better results + safety + somehow dealing with the stigma of recreational drugs.

It might well be the future, but it's 20+ years away, surely?"
2021-05-12 16:27:29,wallstreetbets,"The goal isn't legalization for these companies. People try to compare this to the marijuana boom. They are not the same.

Medical application of psychedelics is almost certainly going to be limited to clinical use for a long time. Stacked on top of this is how they are used. I suspect that psychedelic treatment will end up having efficacy that is more strongly linked to how it is used compared to conventional medicines.

I see clinic/therapist certifications happening in conjunction with LSD and  psilocybin therapies. I don't see this happening as a take home treatment anytime soon.

The industry doesn't really need public buy in. The FDA already declared these things breakthrough therapies. The lack of public fervor for the drugs actually makes it easier to be seen as medically legitimate compared to marijuana which many thought was only pushed medically as a backdoor to legalization."
2021-05-12 16:23:58,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for commenting! Marijuana is in a different category than psychedelics so it's difficult to compare. There are better drugs to address migraines and appetites stimulation and less addictive ones. The difference is in the administration of the drug. Medical marijuana is distributed by medical marijuana suppliers where they can be filled at anytime by the patient. Compared to psychedelics which will only be used in clinical settings. The drug will be given to the patient and then guided through a therapy session. The psychedelic will only be confined to the clinical setting. Psychedelics hyper-activate the brain and allow for immediate neuroplasticity. It is completely regulated and not freely given to the patient, like medical marijuana."

2021-05-12 16:46:34,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the input! Discerning emotions from comments is super difficult. I agreed with everything you were saying and there is still years of research to do. I'm behind you. To note, I got a minor in botany and I had to take ethnobotany, from those courses it seems Homo sapiens may have an evolutionary tie to psychedelics. They evolved together and it is hypothesized that consciousness may have roots in our evolutionary predecessors using botanical psychedelics. So who knows? Definitely interested in future research."
2021-05-12 16:31:28,wallstreetbets,I was never equating the MOA of psilocybin to SSRIs. I was just stating that SSRIs work by increasing serotonin concentrations. It was a simple explanation and I didn't want to get too far into the physiology. This isn't the place for to explain Ph.D. level science. I'm trying to appeal to the masses. If people want to ask about the differences I am more than happy to do so.

2021-05-12 16:48:09,wallstreetbets,"I'd want to see it compared to ketamine first, Especially if each dose needs a guided therapy session. Regular People can't even take their daily statin, how are they going to be convinced to go on a trip like that?"
2021-05-12 17:12:19,wallstreetbets,"Problem is med school perpetuates the stigmas. They aren't going to change quick enough. As of the last resident class I had on my floor in the hospital the med school is still teaching marijuana is an addictive, gateway drug. That report has been disproved 100 times in 30+ years. But it's still taught as gospel. I just worry the therapeutic effects of true psychedelics will get buried under all the garbage the new docs are fed."
2021-05-12 16:28:26,wallstreetbets,"No my point is that just cause you believe in the science behind what the company is doing doesn’t mean it translates to a good investment.  It’s a terrible short term investment especially in the current market conditions.  

I wouldn’t recommend anyone go balls deep on a Nasdaq stock right now.........  nasdaq is gonna buttfuck MNMD holders 

Yeah I like the company, but financially, they don’t make shit and won’t really give a good return anytime soon."

These in-depth treatments would be primarily for those who are experiencing severe PTSD, severe depression, severe anxiety, etc. These diseases are crippling and there are many people suffering. Eventually some of these people have to be hospitalized in psychiatric units. So it would be for these people first."
2021-05-12 16:36:35,wallstreetbets,Oh my bad bro!  I thought you were throwing shade. I completely agree with you. This is not a short term investment and I hope that people know that. Research is no longer in its infancy and is now in the developmental and clinical stage. More research is needed and clinical trials need to be completed. A few trials are in Phase 2 and as they conclude in 2023 the prices are going to be more then than they are now. It's a good 2-3 year investment.

2021-05-12 17:33:10,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for saying exactly what I was thinking. What folks seem to not realize is that the world has changed a great deal since last year. Most companies will have digitzed & increased profitability decreasing the pressure of inflation by increasing the amount of products/services they can provide. We've accepted work from home, we've decreased the amount of personel by just hiring back the 75% of the best employes, accepted telehealth as a valid options etc etc. We'll see it even more now that low paying jobs are not attracting workers.  
  
I'll not worry until we see sustained inflation, across all categories not just a few select that can easily be understod why."

2021-05-12 16:28:56,wallstreetbets,"Macro broadcasting more redflags for *stag*flation than were accustomed to.

Markets pricing in the return of the debt ceiling which yellen’s been mentioning with increasing frequency, alongside the expanding budget deficit; pair that with the big bad tool the fed can deploy to combat high inflation and you realize theyre about to dump on wall street or main street. That one fed tool is increasingly a zero sum tool at this point."
2021-05-12 19:07:54,wallstreetbets,"Supply chains will not return to normal for the foreseeable future (at the least, a year or 2). There will be major price fluctuations across industries/goods, but overall prices will rise in this time.

2021-05-12 16:07:40,wallstreetbets,"I definitely am retarded, but they did inflate the currency. As in they created in the neighborhood of 10 trillion new dollars in a year.  
Sure you can dice the numbers up how ever you want to get almost any answer. You can absolutely say....
""Hey ,last april .3 percent inflation, this april 4.3, thats an avg of 2.3 per year,  calm down.""

But your missing the ovbous. We intentionally inflated the currency in a major way. If there werent major inflation, the question would be wheres all the money? Stock market all time high. Houseing ath. Savings rate ath. Velocity of money all time low.  Even a retard like me knows when all that new cash hits the newly opened economy, and that velocity of money ticks up even a little bit, its gonna be inflation city, and we are only seeing the begining."

Define inflation for us, because the people on Reddit postings shit like this are using a different definition of inflation than the one in economics books. Your whole post is explaining why the numbers show inflation (base effects, shortages and supply chain issues). Then, you conclude there is no inflation. This is Schrödinger’s retarded cat.  Inflation exists and doesn’t exist at the same time somehow."
2021-05-12 17:42:30,wallstreetbets,And you actually believe the govt numbers. Geeze there's a sucker born every minute. OF COURSE THEY'RE GOING TO LET TIMING DIFFERENCES REGISTER. ITS THE PERMANENT DIFFERENCES THEY'RE MASSAGING.
2021-05-12 18:01:49,wallstreetbets,"I need to see headline inflation. CPI changes definition all the time, so no usage. 

Also if inflation is X%, but the fed rate is near zero, less demand to buy treasury. -> then fed has to buy it (more printing) -> more inflation -> more dramatic change in rate is needed. The economy will tank faster this way. 

The market is simply factoring into the real rate, and discounting tech... 2% is nothing in my mind."

Even when in the long run it will increase inflation, it doesn't mean you're gonna get any kind of insane inflation this year, nor the next one, depending on a variety of factors and how it's handled you may just have slightly higher inflation for several years."

2021-05-12 15:42:55,wallstreetbets,"Nah he's right, most Americans, or anyone living in stable countries knows nothing about inflation, because they don't deal with it, so they panic even if nothing happens. Trust me, our monthly inflation is twice as high as the US's annual one.

April's inflation was ""insane"" because it's being compared to pretty strange data. For instance, gas increased close to 50% compared to last year's April, which means... nothing, it was an exceptional situation due to COVID, oil price literally went negative for a while. This applies to pretty much everything.

There is more inflation than there previously was, but people are acting like you guys are gonna have like 20% inflation a year and truth is if you had like 2% then you're probably gonna have like 3% for maybe a year or two lol."
2021-05-12 15:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Well the CPI says you're getting scammed on your grocery bills. The increase of gas prices can be explained by plenty of reasons, none of which are inflation."

2021-05-12 16:13:08,wallstreetbets,"You could find data on that as well, Google is free, but since you asked food is nothing special, seeing a 0.4% change with a weighting of 13.97. Those above the average were Meats, Poultry, Fish and Eggs (0.5% with a 1.73 weighting), Dairy and related products (0.6% with a 0.77 weighting), fruit and veg (0.8% with 1.34 weighting). 

More specifically, white bread and cereals were both down 0.5%, flour was down 1.9% and sugar/sugar substitutes were down 0.2%. Does that help put your mind at ease?"
2021-05-12 18:36:20,wallstreetbets,"There's no simple or agreed upon way of measuring inflation, but CPI has been the most acceptable way for years. Inflation tends to be 3% each year, so you should be expecting that at the bare minimum."
2021-05-12 18:45:32,wallstreetbets,"I'm highlighting that most of the change in CPI can be attributed to the semis and lumber shortage, rather than inflation. All you have to do is remove used car sales, and CPI underperformed."
2021-05-12 16:53:09,wallstreetbets,Creating more dollars out of nothing and putting them into the supply that is currently circulating devalues the dollar. There's just no way around it.
2021-05-12 15:48:16,wallstreetbets,"It depends how much is printed and how the supply chain is doing. 

For example if we spent this much while our production factories were still under covid lockdown, hyperinflation would come rather quickly.

Also, printing money, even with demand for it, will still cause inflation unless people start removing money from circulation."
2021-05-12 15:44:07,wallstreetbets,"But as long as we both know its coming, whats the difference?"

2021-05-12 17:51:19,wallstreetbets,Agreed on the stupid part. And as soon as all that newly printed money hits the economy it will cause shortages of goods and increases in prices.
2021-05-12 16:24:33,wallstreetbets,"Do you somehow think that the prices of commodities show up immediately in the supply chain?  The ETF's tracking the commodities increased between 8-20% in the month of April.    


You explain away all the things that don't fit your narrative with a hand wave and say inflation is nothing to worry about.  And your proof of that is by saying ""there's no reason to worry"".  OK, tiger sign me up to your newsletter"
2021-05-12 17:08:10,wallstreetbets,That's not how CPI works. Like AT ALL.
2021-05-12 15:52:20,wallstreetbets,"That's my point, it just depends on a lot of factors, it's not like if you print money you automatically get inflation.

If you print a quadrillion dollars but it never makes it to the system because it's just ""stored"" then there's not gonna be any inflation. Then again if you print that much and give it equally to everyone then that's gonna inflate prices almost instantly.

I'm not making predictions, there's too many factors, I'm not even from the US, but people panicking so much are just people who have never dealt with real inflation, the US has never had very high inflation, from what I remember the highest inflation the US had was like 30% but it was over 200 years ago. Take what I say as something from someone who lives in a country with 40%+ inflation, you guys in the US have no reason to panic."
2021-05-12 16:04:08,wallstreetbets,"I don't really know where you've pulled the 14 trillion from, because from what I can find, there's no evidence of $14 trillion in spending. The only mention of $14 trillion is in household debt, and that's been going up for years, and even then has been simply following the trend. The common measure for inflation is the CPI, and them numbers are certainly nothing special when you look at how much the Lumber and semiconductor shortage have helped to inflate the number. Sure, the government has thrown money into the economy this year, but they did the exact same in 2008, and look how we fared. There will come a point in time where they will pull this money out of circulation, whether that be through taxes, or higher interest rates, but right now, I don't see it as a big issue."
2021-05-12 19:42:19,wallstreetbets,this is a global issue with inflation
2021-05-12 17:08:04,wallstreetbets,"Inflation isn't a new concept. Low inflation (~3%) is considered good for the economy. However, some people are trying to push the narrative that we're seeing hyper inflation, when the reality is that the numbers were very average. The increase in used car sales alone accounted for 1/3 of the YOY increase in the CPI. Its becoming clear that commodities are becoming a bubble. It happened in 2008-2011, and it looks very similar."

2021-05-12 16:58:21,wallstreetbets,and yet you can't come up with any legitimate long term source to back up your fear tactics of spending's negative effects on the economy :/

2021-05-12 16:30:32,wallstreetbets,"You asked for the numbers, I've shown them. Are you trying to argue on the legitimacy of the CPI? That increase you're seeing, evidently hasn't affected the prices of food products which use the commodities you've said, in fact CPI says they've done the opposite. We're clearly in the midst of a commodities bubble. It happened from 2008-2011, and we're seeing it happen again."
2021-05-12 17:20:37,wallstreetbets,I wasn't referring to CPI. I'm just stating a basic economic principle.

2021-05-12 16:47:21,wallstreetbets,"Serious answer, instead of a flip one.  You claim there is nothing to worry about with inflation.  Show that the majority of it can all be explained by semis and lumber.  Yet, there is no explanation for why you believe this won't continue into the future.  Do you think semis and lumber prices will decrease?  Why?  


So far, I've heard Buffet say he has experienced price inflation but they've been able to pass the cost through to the customer.  Will the same thing happen with the increase in lumber?  Semis?  How far out are their supply contracts?  This month the CPI increased.  What portion of that product was part of inventory that was paid for 6 months ago?  If they run out of inventory, will the commodity prices decrease enough so that they don't see a big jump in their supply cost?  


I know I don't have the answer to that.  But if the market is dropping, accompanied by increased yields in the bond market, and the Vix going above 20 again, I know it's not a fake news item.  So, whether or not you believe the current month's data shows inflation isn't a worry to you.  It's clear it's worrying to investors holding a much bigger share of Amazon that I could even consider buying."

2021-05-12 17:26:41,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is a very complex subject. Printing money technically doesn't cause inflation if people are holding that money and not spending it (i.e saving for a rainy day, investing)."
2021-05-12 16:00:57,wallstreetbets,"People are panicking and I'm suffering because they're panicking.

Guess I'm back to waiting for months... hopefully for it to recover, either that or years lol."
2021-05-12 16:24:10,wallstreetbets,"Ah ok, you probably shouldn't assume that 4 trillion will be added though, as the government tends to pull in revenues to counteract a lot of the money spent. That being said, these numbers have been out for quite a while, they're not news. The markets fell today for what I can only assume to be the first glance at CPI numbers, which shows how ripe confirmation bias can be, I guess. Until CPI numbers show a definitive change outside of those affected by lumber and semiconductor shortages, then maybe I'll be worried, but this drop, it's completely unwarranted."
2021-05-12 17:01:31,wallstreetbets,"The issue is whether they will be able to pass the price off to the customer. If the customer can't afford to subsidise the price of lumber, then we'll see either see lumber prices fall to a fair value at which the customer can afford the subsidy, or we'll see the wage of construction workers fall. I can't see the latter happening, but it's always a possibility. The same goes for semis. Tech may see revenue numbers fall, maybe substantially, if they try pass the price off to the consumer. The likes of car companies might be able to get away with passing it off, but phone manufacturers and the like will probably struggle to do the same, which may explain the worry for the likes of tech, but that worry isn't a new one, and has been going on for the past week or so. I can't predict the future, but looking at the present, there's no sign of worrying inflation, which is the narrative I'm seeing pushed today."

2021-05-12 17:30:58,wallstreetbets,I know that only money in circulation counts toward the supply. They're printing money AND putting it into circulation.

2021-05-12 16:02:23,wallstreetbets,Same here man. Same here.
2021-05-12 16:55:42,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. Do you think people will reach their senses or are we looking at another fatty drop like last year? I too think this drop is unwarranted as the kind of usual inflation we see associated with massive state spending usually takes a few years to surface. Yet I think the long term future is dead IF we continue spending at the current way we are now.
2021-05-12 17:04:50,wallstreetbets,"I don't think we'll see a quick recovery for tech, at least. In theory, the S&P shouldn't have gone down today in the first place, and the Dow definitely shouldn't have. For tech to recover, it needs some sort of stability in the semiconductor industry. If Biden gives money to semiconductor industries to build factories, tech will see a quick recovery. Otherwise, it'll have to find its own bottom."

2021-05-12 17:54:12,wallstreetbets,"A few things I would like to point out. For starters, I have been an advocate for uwmc for a hot minute and I do have a bunch of 5/21 calls. And this is not financial advice.

I was watching iborrow throughout the day as I was seeing big price action and I'm fairly convinced that there's ATLEAST  300k shares borrowed out in the high 6's that were never returned or covered today. And the interest rate for borrows at the time was 24 or 25ish %. Today's price action showed extreme potential in my opinion especially considering how absolutely fucked the rest of the market was today. Had today's market sentiment been better, I feel like the pop would of probably been bigger... there is still plenty of upside here.

If Matt decides to swing even a small piece of his big green 300mm hulk dick in the next couple days, this could actually squeeze. And he has the ability to buy 25% of the daily volume on a given day according to rule 10b

I'm thinking that the large short positions are market makers desperately trying to prevent 5/21 9c from going ITM. The high OI would cause a nice gamma ramp that could squeeze this to 15+ if we could apply enough pressure before 5/21 calls expire worthless.

It should help that the stock is cheap and moves a decent amount with relatively low volume..

The Board did approve a dividend, a $0.10 quarterly dividend to be paid on April 6 for all shareholders of record as of March 10. We expect this to be a regular quarterly dividend.

And so you guys know how we're thinking about this. Our balance sheet is a fortress. And our current liquidity position is very strong, and we have access to the capital markets as well. The way we think about this going forward is we're producing a lot of cash. We're going to maybe be more profitable than some expected and be very successful in 2021. And if we have excess cash that I and the Board deem is too much, we will be delivering that back. And whether we have to change the dividend in the future, as in raise it or a special dividend, those things are definitely on the table or even buying back shares.

2021-05-12 15:22:53,wallstreetbets,Gamma Squeezes turn me on.
2021-05-12 17:39:23,wallstreetbets,Glad to contribute with my 10c.
2021-05-12 15:54:36,wallstreetbets,Yessss!
2021-05-12 15:10:03,wallstreetbets,Good for you. Bought my last 500 shares at $6.45.
2021-05-12 16:13:19,wallstreetbets,Love green!
2021-05-12 18:06:02,wallstreetbets,Yeah MM's probably have a lot on the line May 21st with A LOT of OI on those 7.5 and 9c's.
2021-05-12 19:34:09,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but dip a little in the morning so my $9c can catch the bid price. I've got em queued for the morning. I've got Aug 20th $9c for $60 / contract... on queue, let em clip!"
2021-05-12 18:16:13,wallstreetbets,$10 is too little for me at an avg of $9. Ive been in the red so long i want my moneys worth. Looking at $13+
2021-05-12 17:44:07,wallstreetbets,It was a good day!
2021-05-12 15:04:49,wallstreetbets,I don't expect it to go to Pluto. I am cool with making a bit of money for earth.
2021-05-12 16:12:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah the are in the middle of a refinance revenue boom. They are still expecting more revenue in 2021 than 2020, one of the only mortgage companies to guide that way."

2021-05-12 15:53:50,wallstreetbets,This is crazy shit. How much is it? 😁
2021-05-12 16:28:41,wallstreetbets,"Well if a Lambo cost $200k then... somewhere around $3,500/share (ya know, cause taxes too). ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|laughing)"
2021-05-12 17:02:45,wallstreetbets,That might be true.
2021-05-12 15:39:58,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the data. We are definitely going to see share buybacks at these levels. I suspect anything under $8 is quick buyback territory.
2021-05-12 19:08:00,wallstreetbets,"I'm buying long calls tomorrow, but I'm staying away from shares for now."
2021-05-12 15:32:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah I really tried to not break any rules on this. The DD speaks for itself and the price action today is enough confirmation bias for me!
2021-05-12 15:22:27,wallstreetbets,yeah I was personally shocked to see it go under $7. But in the stock market anything can happen. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)
2021-05-12 15:35:31,wallstreetbets,Yeah little resistance before $7.5. We'll see if Ishbia does any buying before close.... ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|give_upvote)
2021-05-12 15:45:46,wallstreetbets,"You can genuinely hear it in the earnings call. He has been a private company for so long he has never had to worry about what Wall Street thinks about his company. Now that he has seen it, he doesn't like it. 

And I am too dumb to know... But the class A and D situation at UWMC seems kinda unique in that he can apply a lot of leverage to get the price up.   


AND, AND, we talk about stock price but the man runs an amazing, growing company. You know, stuff investors like."
2021-05-12 16:29:36,wallstreetbets,MOOOOO!
2021-05-12 15:34:26,wallstreetbets,I have some $9 calls I expect to be worthless but love the 350 shares! Those shares are a good long term hold and receive a cute 5.5% dividend.
2021-05-12 15:52:55,wallstreetbets,I have a few 6c for 6/18 I'm glad I held on to!
2021-05-12 15:05:19,wallstreetbets,This isn't even really a squeeze. It Mat Ishbia vs. Wall Street that doesn't like his company. This is personal.
2021-05-12 15:48:06,wallstreetbets,I'm grateful to be back in the green!
2021-05-12 15:55:12,wallstreetbets,Dividends along the way at least!
2021-05-12 16:26:53,wallstreetbets,Yeah and hopefully growing!
2021-05-12 17:01:36,wallstreetbets,My price target is $15 in two years.
2021-05-12 17:45:11,wallstreetbets,Mat Ishbia is an incredible executive. The board reflects his competitive nature.
2021-05-12 17:45:29,wallstreetbets,Let’s stay green together!
2021-05-12 15:46:03,wallstreetbets,Same here! Just along for the ride.
2021-05-12 18:03:40,wallstreetbets,Not sure where you are getting the $2B from. Rocket is larger and Robinhood has their market cap at about $33 billion
2021-05-12 18:44:43,wallstreetbets,It’s a tough market with refinances drying up… but I still think UWMC will grow through it.
2021-05-12 19:49:48,wallstreetbets,"Then we shall hold these rkt bags with hope, and continue being retarded. This is the wsb way."
2021-05-12 17:42:16,wallstreetbets,Yah
2021-05-12 18:17:57,wallstreetbets,For stocks regularly discussed on wsbs... today it actually is.
2021-05-12 15:08:51,wallstreetbets,could you elaborate?
2021-05-12 15:00:40,wallstreetbets,okay.
2021-05-12 16:13:04,wallstreetbets,Tell us your RKT position. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)
2021-05-12 16:35:07,wallstreetbets,"Wholesale or whatever the fuck they are doing they are still making a shit load of money and isn't that all that matters? The stock is trading near all time lows, they're making a shit load of money, the dividen payout is good, their balance sheet is excellent. Buy low sell high, this is how you make money."
2021-05-12 17:02:11,wallstreetbets,"Give your counter argument, so we can all judge your DD like you judged OP."
2021-05-12 17:27:42,wallstreetbets,Check this guy's post history. Rkt left him bitter as fuck and he's just upset he picked the wrong horse.
2021-05-12 18:04:25,wallstreetbets,I tend to gravitate towards boomer dividend stocks. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|shrug)
2021-05-12 17:40:33,wallstreetbets,"Best quarter in company’s history with all times low on the exchange? I would look twice, at least."
2021-05-12 17:43:43,wallstreetbets,Nobody knows what it is going to do. My post is about how it was up 10% today in a bloodbath of a market. The reason is share buybacks.
2021-05-12 17:57:33,wallstreetbets,Check the price today after three days of bleeding on wall Street
2021-05-12 15:11:53,wallstreetbets,Exactly. He’s not doing it cause he’s a great guy. Money to be made on the buyback in more ways than one. Also will not be paying the dividends on the stocks he’s buying back for a gain on some investors loss!  But if it can run up the price and possibly catch the hedgehogs sleeping let’s go!!!
2021-05-12 16:33:21,wallstreetbets,>I think that huge spike we saw today was him buying ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|upvote)
2021-05-12 15:20:37,wallstreetbets,I like the sound of that.
2021-05-12 15:38:57,wallstreetbets,So we need to get to 9.01 by May 21st?
2021-05-12 19:18:00,wallstreetbets,"Not worth your time to exercise at 9.01, needs to go higher.

Tutes are unlikely to cash in and go long over a weekend for a penny.  Would need to be a bit higher."
2021-05-12 15:53:17,wallstreetbets,Oh that should be easy!  Oh ... https://iborrowdesk.com/report/UWMC
2021-05-12 18:11:25,wallstreetbets,"High OI on 10c and 12.5c also.

If it hits 9.01 longer enough for MM to have to hedge, shorts are gonna have to scramble or else they will lose there ass.
It will gamma squeeze past 12.5 and possibly near 15.

They gotta be shitting bricks with the amount of power Matt has right now... im just hoping he uses some of it to fuck the shorts."
2021-05-12 19:47:08,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting it probably dips a decent amount right away in the morning. I would actually be surprised if it doesn't especially if the market opens red, which I'm also betting it will.  Shorts are gonna try to get this back under control. But if the market opens green, hard to say."
2021-05-12 15:09:38,wallstreetbets,This will go to pluto
2021-05-12 16:16:07,wallstreetbets,"Even if their revenue stays the same the company P/E is extremely low, if it stays like this it will outperform SPY over the years"

2021-05-12 16:35:30,wallstreetbets,So no lambo probably. Fuck.
2021-05-12 15:35:28,wallstreetbets,The calls were nice and cheap. Might flip soon if tomorrow's another good day!
2021-05-12 15:56:00,wallstreetbets,Damn I bet those are worth a lot. When did you buy them
2021-05-12 16:35:37,wallstreetbets,You think my wife’s boyfriend will let me sleep in the guest room if I manage to swing it green?
2021-05-12 17:04:05,wallstreetbets,Thanks.

2021-05-12 17:12:56,wallstreetbets,And boomers realising it had an almost 6% div which is kind of insane for a div stock that isn't bankrupting itself or using it to hide a bad earnings trying to keep the stock price high.
2021-05-12 15:43:12,wallstreetbets,Yeah but 9.02 is even better.
2021-05-12 15:56:58,wallstreetbets,WIth so few shares available hopefully that means IBKR is able to find someone to loan mine to!
2021-05-12 18:17:18,wallstreetbets,Well I sold cc's at $12.5 but I am happy to lose my shares at that price in two weeks ha.
2021-05-12 16:03:37,wallstreetbets,Back in March after it dropped.  Been waiting for it to come back ever since like a good autist.
2021-05-12 17:02:30,wallstreetbets,Nah but maybe let you use the downstairs shower in a pinch.
2021-05-12 19:53:16,wallstreetbets,Any time you enter a trade it is a gamble short term for sure.
2021-05-12 16:01:57,wallstreetbets,"Shares are only loaned to sell short.  You don't want them loaning your shares, the indication is that there are no more shares to short which is how you cause a squeeze."
2021-05-12 18:21:25,wallstreetbets,"Even if it does gamma ramp, I wouldnt expect it to hold that to expiration. Your shares are more than likely safe."
2021-05-12 16:12:22,wallstreetbets,"Damn, a few more days of bleed and I'll buy 1 year calls too! Last March I had no money to invest. Don't wanna miss the boat this time"

2021-05-12 15:40:19,wallstreetbets,Still a lot of time on this stock. Should end up with $8 per share once bankruptcy process is complete. Shares are trading below $6 right now. I d k how there would not be a short squeeze on this stock. So many people thought this stock was doomed and shareholders were going to be wiped out.

2021-05-12 18:45:56,wallstreetbets,The consensus at the momment is shareholder if Hertz will receive around $8 per share in a combination of cash and warrants for the new company stock. Hertz is currently trading below $8 and their rival Avis was just trading at $80 per share. I personally love the stock and believe people should be looking into this stock to see if they love it too.

Oh and btw, the first hospital group that was going to acquire carepoint after bankruptcy’s backed out at the last second… wonder what they found…"

All these inflation worries are also rubbish. it's just an asymmetry of supply and demand, demand just re-opened faster than supply. give it a few months and it will work itself out. the assymetry is where you make money. so buy while it's cheap and sell when it goes up. it's never gonna be perfect, but if you hold quality stuff through the dips, you'll end up on top, just depends on your time frame. when you expect it to happen tomorrow is when you lose to yhe casino. 

like who here has any doubts that shit like aapl, msft, amzn wont keep slaying, irrespective of what happens. you gonna stop using tech if interest rates go up? you gonna stop eating if food prices go up?

What i got out of it is no one knows when a bubble will happen but we can see signs of it  but there are also factors that make 2020 different than years of the past and this is a casino so just make your bets , you win some you lose some

But what you can do is look for odds enhancers through research and diligence, while managing your risk (the most important aspect)

Edit : it went into how to research, valuation techniques and formulas and industry comparison / strategies for options and investing as a whole taught by CFP who was a financial planner and investor at some high profile firms.

2021-05-12 19:20:18,wallstreetbets,Hell no. This is a buying opportunity.
2021-05-12 19:27:27,wallstreetbets,"Your problem is you are looking to swing for the fence, on every ball. Thats not going to work out. You need to slow down, look for those angles that no one else has found (or too small for others to find) and then systematically trade them. Of course - when you do find the occasional creampuff - take it. But dont bet it all.

At the end of the day - trading is all about risk and position management.

And as for buying calls (or puts) - think carefully about when you will make money.

If you think something will go up - buying a call will make you money only if it goes up. If you sell a put - you will make money if it goes up or goes sideways. Effectively doubling your chances of success. So start thinking of selling as opposed to buying options all the time. Make the greeks work in your favor."
2021-05-12 19:41:33,wallstreetbets,Its actually a GREAT buying opportunity if you are a long term investor. Its the only way to go

2021-05-12 15:41:31,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, I just bought good companies (strong growth guidance, strong debt ratio, free cashflow and profitability) that are already discounted by a minimum of \~22-23% from ATH

(Exception being Apple, ASML and NVIDIA, these are discounted by around \~12%).

I also bought on some growth that is discounted at 50%+, with great prospects.

I simply don't see how this market could punish these already punished equities more.

Despite what all the self-proclaimed Economics PhDs are saying on Reddit, I think inflation is great news, and it means the economy is finally standing back on its feet and people want to spend.

I seriously doubt that suddenly all the circulating money supply will go to bonds of a historically indebted US treasury.

Even if we keep dropping another 10%, I will just buy more and wait for the inevitable rise. Stonks just always go up, if they don't capitalism fails. If capitalism fails, we will have more problems to worry about rather than a few thousand $ lost.

I seriously, cannot possibly see 10 grand not being worth at least 20 grand + if you put it in $TSM and wait 3 years."

2021-05-12 17:23:18,wallstreetbets,Think of how sweeeeeet the bounceback is going to be after all this pain. You need the salty to appreciate the sweet. I cleared my margin to take full advantage of it on the ride back up let's gooooooooooo.
2021-05-12 16:03:02,wallstreetbets,3 years??? But what about tendies *today*!!!
2021-05-12 18:25:58,wallstreetbets,Well look at the big ape wrinkle brain on Brad!?
2021-05-12 17:28:37,wallstreetbets,In 3 years The market will probably still be down 60% from the bubble that’s going to burst.
2021-05-12 16:32:58,wallstreetbets,">Despite what all the self-proclaimed Economics PhDs are saying on Reddit, I think inflation is great news, and it means the economy is finally standing back on its feet and people want to spend.

Whats the correlation between money velocity and inflation?"
2021-05-12 19:41:12,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is a good thing.
LMFAO. Or cry. I'm old, lots of stories where a life lived prudently on one's annual salary meant you had excess capital to travel the world like a rich man with almighty USDs in your fist, not to mention generate wealth without really even trying. Indeed, some of it, real estate for example, was largely a result of inflation, but nowadays the overwhelming majority of people need credit cards and margin just to keep afloat. 
The fed sucks. The assclowns in congress giving away not just mine but future generations income with their little 3 card monte schemes suck even worse. Maybe not, the latter are fucking loser junkies and the fed is their enablers who have been buying their bags and spoons for so long they can't stop now.
No offense, but while- in my experience anyway- a double in 3 isn't the path of a loser or anything, but it ain't much better than some guy bragging he doubled in the last 12 months."
2021-05-12 17:33:06,wallstreetbets,SPY might tank to 200. Buy in then.
2021-05-12 19:58:51,wallstreetbets,I could see TSMC getting over run by the Chinese and turned into a state owned chip maker

2021-05-12 16:14:27,wallstreetbets,"Still holding bags on RIDE. Thought I was getting an awesome deal at 12, then 11 then thought 10 was a powerful support so buy mooooore. Now I'm just hoping we don't see 5's...."

2021-05-12 18:23:56,wallstreetbets,"I am staying away from my 401k. The ex devastated that one enough. I figured I could throw $400 in and see what happens. MNMD, QS, RIDE, and UWMC (today). Other than UWMC I have been focusing on the ""what if you bought Tesla before they had a car"" type of stocks. Even $100 could turn into a fancy trip to Tuscany."

Any particular reason why?"
2021-05-12 18:22:01,wallstreetbets,Tax the .01% reasonably and Americas fiscal problems disappear
2021-05-12 17:25:20,wallstreetbets,Inflation means stonks go uppies though
2021-05-12 18:00:29,wallstreetbets,"Nah. The possibility of the FED raising rates is exactly why growth stocks are plunging. Higher rates equal larger discount factor equals lower present value of future cash flow. 

All those currently unprofitable growth companies with high projected future cashflow are now suddenly worth a lot less, because a bunch of profits in five years time is now worth less then it was a couple of months ago."
2021-05-12 19:33:22,wallstreetbets,It's like 4.2% year over year and typically when mass inflation hits from mass printing it's a couple years down the road.    This could get real bad real quick.
2021-05-12 17:29:03,wallstreetbets,"Hope for the best, it 3xes the day after the ex-date for the dividend.  You lock in those divitendies and then get to exit the position on a pile of extra crispy tendies."

2021-05-12 15:33:22,wallstreetbets,"The classes 3 were good taught by a cfp who was a financial planner and investor at some high profile places. I was just simplifying it taught valuation formulas and how to go about determining value and PT and investing as a whole mindset not just buy stocks make money 

I would pay for it again luckily i got all the files so i dont have to

Could i have learned it all myself sure 
But i got a blueprint now

It has not been alot of money but im up 140% all time since I started in December 2019 and I wanna be at the next level so I looked into education, took out all my money and am making a plan for my future based off these classes"
2021-05-12 19:27:23,wallstreetbets,Lol I was simplifying it for all my apes and just joking but end of the day you can have all the research and some crazy shit happens i dont think you read the edit
2021-05-12 15:37:32,wallstreetbets,All shorts must cover.

2021-05-12 16:49:46,wallstreetbets,">I seriously doubt that suddenly all the circulating money supply will go to bonds of a historically indebted US treasury

Money went out of treasuries pretty darn quick in feb '20 ...can go straight back into them just as quick if there's a sizeable interest rate hike ...especially with the lack of confidence in equity valuations at the mo....imo

what would need a sizeable interest rate hike? What's currently playing out....combination of consumer inflation, monetary inflation, booming economy, and things like the climate crisis affecting crops + food prices. On top of that Biden needs bond sales for all his massive spending plans"
2021-05-12 18:23:24,wallstreetbets,"A government can spend all it wants until the production capacity is reached. After that, supply can’t meet demand and prices rise."

2021-05-12 18:18:01,wallstreetbets,I bought RIDE at $11 just before the class action was announced. I never saw it as an instant payoff type of deal. I am only risking small amounts on stocks that I hope will be game changing products. Imagine investing in Tesla before they had a car. We could still get tendies but mom hasn't finished building the chicken coop.

2021-05-12 17:17:53,wallstreetbets,Did the same thing but cut my losses at 7.75 and FOMOd into FUBO
2021-05-12 18:39:55,wallstreetbets,"I’m so fucked on RIDE and WKHS, I don’t know even know what to do. Been “averaging down” for weeks, but the down never stops, even in AH. Just so fuckin fucked. Staying in both till RIDE ER call on Monday."

2021-05-12 15:36:33,wallstreetbets,But the rate of fiating matters and the US has significantly ramped up their fiating.
2021-05-12 17:50:57,wallstreetbets,"All firms in stock market effected by the interest rates, while the interest go up it gives investors alternative to put their cash in bank and get better return without ""risking"" their money in stocks or just to avoid watching all day or trading, just more cash to make in a safer way.
But to be fair its BS, because investors aint the people to actually leave and effect the stock, its the big hedge funds moves it by take back the cash and then they just re invest it raising the stock even more(but not before they lowered them to a point they 50% almost cheaper and more people come to buy them)- making them attractive."
2021-05-12 19:27:39,wallstreetbets,probably not big tech. they have so much cash on hand that they gotta buy back shares cuz there's nothing else to do w the money. it's the growth stocks that will hurt when inflation rises because interest rates will rise to curb inflation and companies that are super sensitive to expenses and debt service are going to struggle.
2021-05-12 18:36:50,wallstreetbets,Ya I don’t think it’s ever stopped
2021-05-12 15:54:27,wallstreetbets,"You're missing a reading comprehension education.

2021-05-12 17:19:53,wallstreetbets,100%
2021-05-12 18:25:53,wallstreetbets,"Well that doesnt mean people arent trying,.  
   
Ive already seen pics of people  with ridiculous ammounts of gas canisters, and even plastic bags"

2021-05-12 17:33:44,wallstreetbets,140% with $100 is easy to do. Let me know when you're playing with 100k+. Bet you cant do 140% with that
2021-05-12 19:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Since the true pupose of government has alway been to protect the assets of the wealthy from the rest of us, I am betting the gov't will step in and bail out the crooked heggies, and find some way to replace the synthetic stock created by insane naked short selling with a low amount of cash, screwing us, because that is how it always goes.

But it will make for some wild news!"
2021-05-12 15:47:25,wallstreetbets,I think this has been proven false lately.
2021-05-12 17:50:55,wallstreetbets,Since the beginning of man.
2021-05-12 19:07:07,wallstreetbets,Good point considering all the the stimmy down payments that were probably a motivator
2021-05-12 17:57:32,wallstreetbets,"In early 2020 money was going heavy into treasuries (except for a small blip in mid March when funds were selling everything including bonds just to get USD).

For money to go back into treasuries, the yield on the 10 Y will need to get closer to the average CPI because people aren't stupid and won't buy an asset that can't even beat inflation.

If prices continue to march higher, expect more selling in bonds. If prices stop climbing and supply chains are restored, bonds should rally."
2021-05-12 18:18:56,wallstreetbets,You have it backwards
2021-05-12 19:49:39,wallstreetbets,"So it has been said, and taught for many years.

Look at the break even. Use [waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance) to see what prices will be way out. Indexes dont move much so if you do a long itm option you save a lot of cash that otherwise is parked in the index."
2021-05-12 18:19:38,wallstreetbets,"But see the thing is, the scenario is unrealistic. It's supposed to read:

Autist posts bullet-proof DD that the stonk literally cannot go tits up.

You buy.

It drops 50% and confirmation bias is posted to ease the pain.

It drops 50% again.

So while OP's math checks out and the stonk drops 75%, there is no known dimension where you buy after the first 50% drop, you will always buy before both drops."

2021-05-12 16:01:12,wallstreetbets,Just buy your casket now so you know you have it for the end of the week
2021-05-12 12:41:48,wallstreetbets,Yikes
2021-05-12 14:35:38,wallstreetbets,Uh you're supposed to put GME gains in GME...you've now cursed Ark further.

2021-05-12 15:05:00,wallstreetbets,"Just curious, did you save any for taxes? Or maybe taxes just ain’t your thing?"
2021-05-12 15:19:55,wallstreetbets,I only do shares derivatives ? I don’t spend or bet more than I have - plus the math is Scary 🤷 Is above picture ANY shares? Or all options? - since I don’t do options I have never seen a picture like this with all the Greek Speak
2021-05-12 16:11:38,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I feel better now"
2021-05-12 16:14:46,wallstreetbets,Women in general are better stock investors as they easier cut losses... Just like your ex-wife
2021-05-12 16:49:49,wallstreetbets,"Looks similar to what I did, just more complicated."
2021-05-12 16:54:37,wallstreetbets,"dont you have to pay taxes for the GME sell? and since you havent actually realized this loss that you essentially can't use it as a deduction for your capital gains tax?

&#x200B;

or am I mistaken?"
2021-05-12 17:14:25,wallstreetbets,Buy more lower that cost basis
2021-05-12 17:37:21,wallstreetbets,Could’ve reinvest in Gme though

2021-05-12 17:00:22,wallstreetbets,"next time you make 700k , just dump it all in an sp500 index fund"
2021-05-12 18:23:14,wallstreetbets,You still got 96.1k profit you can take out and enjoy.  Not that you want to hear that.
2021-05-12 19:29:13,wallstreetbets,You win bro
2021-05-12 19:51:50,wallstreetbets,You still got like 3 years to get there. You'll probably be posting gain porn in 2022 at some point.
2021-05-12 12:42:03,wallstreetbets,Agreed
2021-05-12 14:02:48,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much for your expert opinion
2021-05-12 14:58:39,wallstreetbets,Why do you think that?

2021-05-12 18:56:22,wallstreetbets,I don't have any of that but I do have a vagina beard.
2021-05-12 15:00:59,wallstreetbets,.... you could have just bought shares...
2021-05-12 15:11:37,wallstreetbets,I have until Dec 31 to sell and realize the loss why would i do it now lmfao
2021-05-12 15:16:04,wallstreetbets,You're dumb
2021-05-12 12:51:30,wallstreetbets,LOL

2021-05-12 19:13:11,wallstreetbets,can you give him his money back
2021-05-12 12:45:56,wallstreetbets,"look at the bottom where it says cost basis (how much he paid) and mkt value (how much it's worth), along with Unrealized P/L."
2021-05-12 12:46:16,wallstreetbets,Look at the bottom of the chart. Cost basis 572k. Market value 96k. Loss of 476k.
2021-05-12 17:02:08,wallstreetbets,(:
2021-05-12 13:57:59,wallstreetbets,you have to be to make 700k in fucing GME calls in the first place ty

2021-05-12 16:57:06,wallstreetbets,What woman in the first place would yolo into GME calls like a f-ing retard on Jan 22 and make 700k
2021-05-12 16:56:07,wallstreetbets,you are partially correct. I have until the end of this calendar year to sell and realize the loss though. I made the money at the end of Jan 2021. I have until december 31 2021 to realize this loss and offset
2021-05-12 17:02:26,wallstreetbets,you'll never win (:
2021-05-12 15:16:54,wallstreetbets,No but hey at least i'm only 24 with no debt so this is nothing worse comes to worst ill just sell end of year and have no gains
2021-05-12 15:20:08,wallstreetbets,Yup
2021-05-12 17:01:42,wallstreetbets,maybe - probably not I'll buy shares of things I like and sell CCs though xD

2021-05-12 14:59:17,wallstreetbets,Why do you think that? Any real reason? Or do you just hope it recovers?
2021-05-12 18:48:15,wallstreetbets,Wheres the fun in that?
2021-05-12 15:12:26,wallstreetbets,Uh that’s what I said 🤷‍♀️
2021-05-12 18:16:40,wallstreetbets,"Well dropping to 40 was hard but that was my GME initial cost basis- of course I bought more - Why am I answering someone who is MR 20/20 hindsight like all the CNBC assholes on Feb 1- if anyone is dumb? Well Calling stuff “dumb” given the situation innJAN? Basically we all observed Blatent market manipulation that should put lots of my neighbors in jail??? If I was dumb about Anything? It was that I wasn’t raised with cheaters and I wrongly thought Someone in charge ( president Wall Street SEC whom ever I foolishly thought they would play by the rules-

And I will not make that assumption again- Crooks that’s what was at the top of the Wall Street food chain- A sad truth to learn so late-"
2021-05-12 15:17:54,wallstreetbets,No I’m rich... now each person can define rich and what being wealthy or rich means- and by all my standards? I am... my time and decisions are my own-... Never bought into the “ American dream” of being strangled by stuff that owns YOU-
2021-05-12 17:40:59,wallstreetbets,He owns 1000 of the 4374 calls. He’s the market maker now!

2021-05-12 12:49:58,wallstreetbets,:( ... I can’t look🤦‍♀️😂🙏🙈
2021-05-12 16:58:15,wallstreetbets,Made 700k off gme calls safe to assume he took profits in January this year hes paying taxes for these gains NEXT tax season.
2021-05-12 16:16:04,wallstreetbets,Cost basis 572k. Where u put the other 128k?

2021-05-12 19:21:37,wallstreetbets,Not going to criticize you but half a mil is more money than most people see in their lifetime. You could have easily put that into a variety of funds and been set for life. It is objectively dumb to lose that kind of money in that scenario.
2021-05-12 15:22:39,wallstreetbets,"If you lost half a mil, you're plain dumb"
2021-05-12 13:32:23,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂

2021-05-12 19:59:14,wallstreetbets,"If his story is true, then it still *was* money that he was Ok with losing by apeing out. If dude has a lot of money, maybe $500k is just play money anyways."
2021-05-12 15:24:48,wallstreetbets,U assume I didn’t make more somewhere else...😀hey win some loose some - no debt ... So call me dumb if you want... I’m Good😁
2021-05-12 17:05:36,wallstreetbets,u are correct I am all set until next tax season
2021-05-12 19:41:34,wallstreetbets,I see.. well you should probably realize the loss it before the end of the year. That is if u care about your butt hole or not.
2021-05-12 17:06:33,wallstreetbets,yeah if you lose everything you pay no taxes.   Goal is not to lose everything though.   If you have a 700K gain on GME if you get down -700K sell and you are even Steven.  How does a 24 year old get this kinda cash anyway?  Or was it all paper gains from GME?
2021-05-12 15:34:45,wallstreetbets,!remindme 20 months

2021-05-12 15:52:34,wallstreetbets,It's bad indeed.
2021-05-12 18:15:00,wallstreetbets,"No but I AM anything but conventional -

2021-05-12 13:08:02,wallstreetbets,You didn't look at the graph. It helps to actually look at a link before talking out your ass.
2021-05-12 19:29:45,wallstreetbets,"Lmao she bought PTON and it was the biggest and most precise fucking head and shoulders I’ve ever seen AND it had bad news during a market sell off. “Buying the dip” doesn’t work so well on trash companies with extremely overextended price action for a year straight. She had billions to spend after COVID dip. What makes her any different than anyone else who did the same exact thing

She also bought DKNG from ~60 all the way down into the 40s. Like bitch. Take a loss here. No one cares about the message"
2021-05-12 15:09:04,wallstreetbets,"Alright so let's just pretend that the graph is not very flawed (it is in multiple ways): Then you are basically telling me that what seems to be a **mere 2% increase in short interest** as a % of float has caused ARKK to go down over 34%? 

Now for the chart. Notice how the chart says ""Average Short Interest""? Yea that's right, the chart takes the **average** of the short interests instead of the **weighted average.** Any time an ETF or Mutual fund is involved you use weighted averages be cause using non-weighted averages makes no sense whatsoever. Taking the real weighted average SI % we get 6.30%, a number which doesn't even appear on the original chart. Whoever made this chart clearly needed it to appear more extreme than it actually was so they cherry picked data.

Also, by using the non-weighted average the article was able to take greater advantage of a massive flaw in Bloomberg's short interest calculation of $SKLZ. The article claims that ""short interest in Skillz has skyrocketed to 60% of its entire float in recent weeks."" The 60% number is a flaw by Bloomberg. Bloomberg mis calculated the float  by subtracting shares that were already subtracted from the float. Both Capital IQ and FactSet show short interest numbers around 26%. 

So yea, the graph is useless."
2021-05-12 16:38:33,wallstreetbets,"I never said or claimed any of that, dummy. I just said that it ""looks like hedges are shorting everything she buys"" and nothing more. Can you not tell from the graph that short interest has a high negative correlation with the performance of her funds? That's the entirety of what I said, stated differently. Not a single word implying cause-and-effect. Learn to read instead of blowing-out your panties over something someone didn't actually say. You'll be better for it."
2021-05-12 17:48:48,wallstreetbets,"when I responded I said ""it is actually possible for a stock to go down without being heavily shorted."" then you aggressively responded with ""You didn't look at the graph. It helps to actually look at a link before talking out your ass."" almost as if looking at the (very flawed) graph says otherwise when it comes to ARKK. The graph is flawed and my original point still stands, a 2% increase in SI is not the reason why ARKK is down 34% as the article suggets."
2021-05-12 19:50:04,wallstreetbets,"One again, bonehead, you're making assumptions. And, once again, bonehead, I never said there was a causal link between the two. It was just an observation. What the hell is wrong with you?"
2021-05-12 19:52:28,wallstreetbets,So why was it supposed to help me to look at the graphs? I got no help from those. If it was just a “casual link” you probably would have agreed with my first statement instead of trying to refute it with the graph.
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Bought more GME cuz I’m retarded. 
2021-05-12 11:48:20,wallstreetbets,You got those juicy MM shares with the four decimals. GJ

2021-05-12 14:44:43,wallstreetbets,You’re a god. Let’s fuck Melvin over one more time baby

2021-05-12 15:03:32,wallstreetbets,Only if Vlad Tenev would use his powers for good instead of evil. That means turning the selling off with only buying.
2021-05-12 15:39:54,wallstreetbets,We are all retarded and this is the way. Can we all have a giant shareholders party when this shit moons? I want this in my life.
2021-05-12 16:45:12,wallstreetbets,"Ah, so you’re the one who buys my overpriced puts."

2021-05-12 15:41:36,wallstreetbets,Best hedge against this fucked up market.
2021-05-12 16:42:44,wallstreetbets,I rather be retarded than a MELVIN.
2021-05-12 15:16:52,wallstreetbets,"""I am retarded"" is not a valid a DD or a reason for any purchasing decisions... But good luck bro"
2021-05-12 17:25:26,wallstreetbets,The future loss porn is going to be epic when GME falls under $100 but I do feel bad for those who are playing this game that really can't afford to take the loss. God speed! My puts are so far out in the future I don't even care what happens with GME for the next few months so hope it works out for you. I will keep selling a weekly call until my 100 share are assigned. Too busy stopping the bleeding on my main portfolio to deal with meme shit stocks. . :)
2021-05-12 15:33:09,wallstreetbets,"Noice.
I lost 100k on GME.
Make it back for me homie."
2021-05-12 16:39:54,wallstreetbets,May as well in this market. That's a safe investment.
2021-05-12 14:56:38,wallstreetbets,Can it hit 5k per share in squeez ?
2021-05-12 18:35:48,wallstreetbets,"You are retarded, shoulda bought AMC🤣"

2021-05-12 18:49:53,wallstreetbets,It’s literally the exact opposite of that. I’m not sure you know what value investing is.
2021-05-12 18:58:03,wallstreetbets,I hope you’re right retard
2021-05-12 18:57:17,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck what do you know? Would you have to kill me if you told me?
2021-05-12 14:50:48,wallstreetbets,"Then once that doesn't trigger shit, we will come up with another inflection point that totally will."
2021-05-12 14:23:58,wallstreetbets,Hold it. It will go down. You will panic. Hold it. It will go up and you will think about selling when you’ve made 10%. Hold it. It will go down again (more than the last dip).  Ask your wife’s boyfriend to lend you his balls and hold it.
2021-05-12 18:17:39,wallstreetbets,"Come check out a subreddit called Supe rstonk (no space, I did that to get past the filters)"

2021-05-12 17:47:00,wallstreetbets,"Hold it and add to your position when it goes down , add little by little over time then one day you will close out that position like a baller. Worst thing you can do is paper hand like a bitch on the first 5% drop."

2021-05-12 18:11:24,wallstreetbets,"Pay no attention young ape. Some apes hate and mistrust AMC but they are legit apes. A lot of us own both, most important thing is hold through dips. We all are.

2021-05-12 14:48:11,wallstreetbets,So don't buy yet is what ur saying and wait til it goes down?
2021-05-12 18:08:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks bud happy to be here!  Waited way too long to join but I’m excited about where this thing is gonna take us
2021-05-12 19:11:06,wallstreetbets,"Thanks bud, keeping this a secret from everyone except my wife (who actually wanted me to throw more money into GME 😂)"

2021-05-12 15:28:56,wallstreetbets,ok
2021-05-12 15:35:37,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I’ll give it back to you when GME is down another 50% by the end of June
2021-05-12 15:51:13,wallstreetbets,"Didn’t your mama tell you that if you don’t have anything good to say about GME, then shut the fuck up?"
2021-05-12 19:06:31,wallstreetbets,To busy with her boyfriend.
2021-05-12 18:53:12,wallstreetbets,That’s awesome bro. My other brokerage account has a ton of shares in it but the cost basis average is also $172. I just didn’t have enough firepower to average down to 169
2021-05-12 19:32:25,wallstreetbets,Awww yes the negative beta. A sure metric to success in value investing. You’ve cracked teh code 🤡
2021-05-12 15:43:15,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-12 14:48:52,wallstreetbets,just fucking hold it. Once you hit a 10 bagger go ahead and sell.
2021-05-12 17:02:59,wallstreetbets,This is not how diamonds are formed... But it is definitely smarter than my retarded ass... Though let's be honest this could dip another 17 times before anything happens or it could blow up at any moment. We just don't know at this point.
2021-05-12 19:22:57,wallstreetbets,"If your wife likes GME more than you do, her boyfriend probably likes the stock just as much. Maybe that can be the start of a beautiful love triangle. You love her, she loves him, he loves your stock."
2021-05-12 15:10:27,wallstreetbets,"AMC has ~450 million shares compared to GME’s ~70million.  Just like everything, supply and demand will rule.  GME’s supply is much lower therefore the demand will be much higher (when the time comes) 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-05-12 14:43:48,wallstreetbets,No one knows but we just hate it.
2021-05-12 16:46:27,wallstreetbets,"Nope, afraid not. Fidelity and RH offer fractional shares and that's just the ones I personally know about; I'm sure many more do"
2021-05-12 17:28:00,wallstreetbets,AMC is a turd. I'm bearish on both but any retard can see why AMC is going to be sub $3 by end of year and will never squeeze.
2021-05-12 16:33:13,wallstreetbets,ok cool. welcome.
2021-05-12 18:12:28,wallstreetbets,Haha
2021-05-12 15:40:01,wallstreetbets,"Oooh, someone's real committed."
2021-05-12 19:52:38,wallstreetbets,Wait.  We’re trying to be successful?
2021-05-12 16:22:25,wallstreetbets,The way is this
2021-05-12 16:10:57,wallstreetbets,"Go ahead and sell 1 to satisfy your pussy hands (recover principal), hold the rest"
2021-05-12 15:42:17,wallstreetbets,"Rookie numbers kid, GME is a 10,000 bagger."
2021-05-12 17:26:38,wallstreetbets,I ended up buying 12 more
2021-05-12 19:24:34,wallstreetbets,😅 now that’s a romcom I would watch!
2021-05-12 16:00:05,wallstreetbets,"Of those 70 Million only around 26 are actually available for trade, minus institutions ownership."
2021-05-12 15:20:41,wallstreetbets,"Okay but amc has over 3.2 million shareholders, how is that not demand☠️"
2021-05-12 18:30:01,wallstreetbets,Thanks for your useful comment
2021-05-12 15:41:36,wallstreetbets,"Welp, don’t say nobody warned you"
2021-05-12 17:26:08,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-12 15:56:52,wallstreetbets,"10,000?  I like the sound of that!"
2021-05-12 16:08:49,wallstreetbets,"Yes, with that implied AMC also has less shares as well.  But I am unsure of those numbers as I’m a 100% GMEtard."
2021-05-12 15:45:27,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but don’t forget at the lower buy-in price of sub $10 a lot more retail investors are going to buy shares compared to GME.  That doesn’t equate to a large average share number though, since speculatively speaking - a lot of people on the AMC sub are single or double digit holders."
2021-05-12 18:31:49,wallstreetbets,Type Robinhood into wallstreetbets or Google it. How's that for useful?
2021-05-12 16:24:32,wallstreetbets,"if you're so committed, show us that you bought puts for June under $100 strike"
2021-05-12 18:38:36,wallstreetbets,"10,000,000*"
2021-05-12 16:09:39,wallstreetbets,Yeah I haven’t been reading into amc much either. I do hold a little value in it cause I saw the borrow rates rising so.
2021-05-12 18:36:58,wallstreetbets,"I'm already aware of its bad rep cuz people weren't able to withdraw right away or because they design their app to encourage you to trade more and hold less. I think if you're aware of these things it's still useable. Also I don't get what's the point of using multiple apps. The OP was asking him if he *only* uses RH, instead of implying that he should ditch RH completely."
2021-05-12 16:26:37,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I’m not betting money on it, that’s just my guess. Could bleed out slower. I’ve been saying since this thing was at 200 that it was gonna keep bleeding out and I’ve been right so far, though."
2021-05-12 17:33:31,wallstreetbets, I’m happy for the AMC folk.  If AMC spikes then it just puts more pressure on the hedges to try and meet liquidity requirements.
2021-05-12 19:06:09,wallstreetbets,"Oh, oh no....nonono."
2021-05-12 16:33:42,wallstreetbets,I guess it's easy to speculate on something when you have no skin in the game.
2021-05-12 16:39:01,wallstreetbets,"Should've bought Puts then, it's not too late."
2021-05-12 17:20:23,wallstreetbets,Sure is! Lol. What the fuck is your point? Nobody should have opinions about stocks unless they plan on buying shares or options? Cool bro
2021-05-12 17:26:33,wallstreetbets,It's easier to be delusional about a stock you're heavily invested in. Look at this sub
2021-05-12 17:26:11,wallstreetbets,"Oh shoot. I'm sorry, friend. Judging by your language, I've offended you in some way. English isn't my first language, so I think my point might have been jumbled as you'd say. What I meant was 

>I guess it's easy to speculate on something when you have no skin in the game."
2021-05-12 17:36:14,wallstreetbets,true. it's called confirmation bias
2021-05-12 17:44:29,wallstreetbets,"smh. Anyway, GME will continue to bleed out"
2021-05-12 17:46:05,wallstreetbets,cool. thank you for the financial advice. I'll buy puts on it tomorrow.
2021-05-12 19:58:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol, I doubt you’re serious but that seems risky to me. It’s been a pretty slow bleed and strikes that are close to the money are pricy right now. You do you though"

2021-05-12 11:55:28,wallstreetbets,Nice
2021-05-12 12:42:46,wallstreetbets,Not a  🌈🐻 but this is impressive. Nice win!
2021-05-12 13:15:32,wallstreetbets,I want to be like you
2021-05-12 14:56:04,wallstreetbets,I been getting into ours and it’s actually easier than calls. For calls you’re basically waiting and hoping it takes off on good news. When something goes up 50% in a day you know it’s going up so making money with puts is pretty much a guarantee.
2021-05-12 15:05:40,wallstreetbets,Sir I can’t read this

2021-05-12 11:53:47,wallstreetbets,I'm not tho. I'm 61 and I used to work for the CBOE before options where a thing. I was there when they were drafting the the ideas for options.
2021-05-12 13:04:29,wallstreetbets,I do this consistently. Talk about luck 🤡

2021-05-12 13:09:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah but how much did you lose to gain that? Lol. The natural flow of the market is up. This bull run since March 2020 bears and shorts have gotten slaughtered. Let’s see that all time chart 🤔
2021-05-12 11:52:48,wallstreetbets,"Hmm I might be a bit of retard, went heavy on may 21 5p 👌😁"
2021-05-12 12:22:07,wallstreetbets,"Don't. It is exponentially higher risk than buying stocks. Not only can options change value much quicker, they also expire so you can't just hold for 10 years and wait for the company to bounce back.

If you bet on options, make sure it is disposable cash and treat it like you would gambling at Vegas."
2021-05-12 14:06:24,wallstreetbets,"Look up “covered calls”. Easy, low risk."
2021-05-12 13:24:42,wallstreetbets,You have one post
2021-05-12 12:06:41,wallstreetbets,It's limited to what you pay
2021-05-12 12:10:16,wallstreetbets," On the contrary, you just lose the put price, which can be like 30 dollars or less (or more, obviously)"
2021-05-12 13:12:40,wallstreetbets,My p/l YTD is up 69%. Every one of my trades are not all green. But most of them are. And that's all pure profit. You are right that the direction of the market is up. But let me ask you this. Did you buy calls for $rkt. Because I max short on them and I bought hundreds of contractd and that it has been good to me.
2021-05-12 11:55:00,wallstreetbets,I did not think it was gonna move that fast
2021-05-12 12:26:02,wallstreetbets,"Sadly, most people don't know how to gamble in a casino either."
2021-05-12 12:26:05,wallstreetbets,"Well thats how youre supposed to treat any money invested in stock anyways. And yes i understand its greater risks but we all know with great risks come with great rewards, or losses. I just wish i knew where to start. Ive been reading up on it for months too but cant seem to take the leap

Edit: spelling"
2021-05-12 12:10:34,wallstreetbets,Is that a special type of put that it’s like that? I’ve always stayed away from puts because I thought my losses were without a ceiling (floor?)
2021-05-12 12:22:20,wallstreetbets,">which can be like 30 dollars or less (or more, obviously)

What a weird way to write ""which can be anything"""
2021-05-12 13:26:12,wallstreetbets,"Yeah rocket fucked me lol. Big oof 

What’s more shocking is that I didn’t become a millionaire in one of the most historical bull runs in history 🤮😭"
2021-05-12 13:54:40,wallstreetbets,"So you're selling puts to people who are afraid of taking losses on stocks. From what I understand, you should only sell puts on stocks that you're actually okay with buying at that strike price. Are your puts being exercised when the stock price falls below the strike or are you just collecting premiums? Just looking for some clarity so I can understand better."
2021-05-12 17:11:25,wallstreetbets,"Could I ask how you determine whether a company might be good for puts. I'm, trying to increase my knowledge because I've only traded calls so far. Like right now I'm trying to determine if I think CVS is in a position for a pullback but I don't know what I should be looking for to try and confirm that belief."
2021-05-12 17:38:38,wallstreetbets,do you think high valuation tech will still continue to tank for a while?
2021-05-12 17:47:46,wallstreetbets,"What was it before these printed? Careful on being overconfident based on a snapshot in time, especially right after a big gain."
2021-05-12 13:13:12,wallstreetbets,Just buy spy calls that expire a month out after a red day. Works like.. 80% of the time.
2021-05-12 12:34:35,wallstreetbets,"If you are set on trying it out, I would pick a cheap option with low IV (\~30%), maybe 3 weeks before they announce earnings. Make sure to sell just before the announcement to maximize IV benefit."
2021-05-12 12:12:45,wallstreetbets,The most you lose with puts is what you put and thats. The way to know if a security/derivatives is unlimited risk is if they ask for collateral.
2021-05-12 12:14:53,wallstreetbets,"That’s what my fear has always been too, so I’ve always stayed away."
2021-05-12 12:24:32,wallstreetbets,"The guy above thinks there’s unlimited loss, it’s important to explain that you can literally just spend 10 bucks on a put, nothing more. And yes, much more for pricier stocks, but definitely not unlimited risk lol, in fact it’s extremely “budget” friendly except for the fact that options are really risky and you usually lose it all 🤣"
2021-05-12 18:10:17,wallstreetbets,Does wsb think its a good idea? If so buy puts
2021-05-12 13:30:52,wallstreetbets,How much are they usually? Like how much would i pay tday to buy the call? Sorry for the ignorance just trying to up my game
2021-05-12 12:56:12,wallstreetbets,cash secured puts ask for collateral and it’s not unlimited risk. same with covered calls
2021-05-12 13:55:41,wallstreetbets,"Only unlimited losses are selling naked calls, and short selling. Those only ones I know of. Cash secured puts, buying puts calls etc are good. Ofc u have risk on margin but not unlimited unless those 2 I mentioned. And on buying options you can’t afford to exercise make sure you sell them before expiry or have enough margin."

2021-05-12 14:01:13,wallstreetbets,Nice. Thanks man. Around how much profit did you make on those calls? If you dont mind me asking. Dumb question i know

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is REAL I've read many posts today saying the CPI number was an anomaly at 0.8%, annualized at 9.6%, it's not.  Think about all the stuff you buy regularly, food up 10-20%, gas up from $2.10 - $3.10, that's 50%, lumber for housing, double last year, oil up, and going higher due to the ransomware hack last weekend.  That may be a 1-time event for that co. but it's happening weekly to different oil & gas cos. but didn't have as much effect on consumers so not widely known.  Even if inflation isn't 9.6% it is well over 5% and the Fed, still says they're not convinced inflation is a problem.  The last time the Fed poured money into the system expecting something that did NOT happen was 2000 (remember Y2K) and rather than use that $$ for an ""emergency"" it was invested and the market flew (Tech bubble) but when the Fed realized and it was too late the market crashed as the Fed took that money back, well this time it's MBS (mortgage backed securities) the Fed is buying $80b a month which keeps mtg rates artificially low, but when they take the money out of the system, just watch the freefall"

2021-05-12 14:14:21,wallstreetbets,"What a lot of analysis is missing is that inflation can be +8-10% this year, but then decline back to 2% the year after. If that’s the case, then the spike in prices will simply be the new baseline that the target 2% inflation rate will build off going forward. This scenario, which is the most likely one in my opinion, would keep the fed on hold based on their commentary around it be transitory. Of course this means these higher prices are here to stay, but the rate of growth can and will likely subside considerably."
2021-05-12 14:17:55,wallstreetbets,"Year over year price is misleading since we’re comparing 2020 corona virus prices...also keep in mind that there are tons of supply chain issues due to the chip shortage, hurricane yuri in Texas destroying a lot, and lumber shortage.

I’m not saying there isn’t inflation, but the high number is mostly due to YOY rise, supply chain shortage, etc...it’s transitory and things will start to self correct by Q4"

2021-05-12 16:59:34,wallstreetbets,"Inflation itself isn’t a problem (as long as it doesn’t become hyperinflation). The market isn’t reacting to inflation as much as it is anticipating a reaction from the Fed. The Fed response is all that matters. If they taper or increase rates, bonds become more attractive and everyone dumps stocks and gold and everything else to go get some risk free yield. That’s what the market is pricing in right now. And btw this will affect everything,not just tech. Commodity plays will be hit less hard no doubt but they will still dump if the Fed raises rates."
2021-05-12 12:41:43,wallstreetbets,"Obviously you didn’t even read the report.

It was entirely energy. Food at home was up less than 2% and food out of the home was up 4% from the increased wages/lack of workers costs.

2021-05-12 12:15:49,wallstreetbets,"Also keep in mind how the Fed has traditionally measured inflation: by sending shopping lists to people across the US and asking them to go to a store, shop, and report back the costs (very manual). With COVID do you think they were doing this? Think again. The Fed wasn’t concerned about inflation before because they couldn’t even fucking measure it."

2021-05-12 12:26:51,wallstreetbets,"There aren’t many ways, hold USED to be a hedge and may still be.  The way I made money in ~2000 was shorting long dated treasury bonds.

There are 2 minor differences 1. Margin rate on selling a treasury is 10% for a stock 33-50%, 2. you must pay interest to the owner same as a stock.  If the bond has a 2.5% coupon that’s $25/year or $12.50 every 6 months (bonds pay every 6 mos) so if you sell short 50 bonds ($50k) that’s $625 every 6 mos. not much if you’re doubling your $$$) 3.

2021-05-12 13:24:59,wallstreetbets,"Do you have a source for this? 


The Keystone pipeline is still in service. The Keystone XL pipeline (phase 4 of the project) was shut down, and it was never finished so it couldn't affect oil prices. 


Not to mention, overseas oil is literally cheaper than NA oil. Remember when oil was $30 a barrel one year ago? Oil rigs were being shut down everywhere because it was impossible for them to profit on drilling at those prices."
2021-05-12 16:02:15,wallstreetbets,"the pipeline was bad in the long term tbh 

&#x200B;

1. Building the Keystone pipeline and opening up the Tar Sands will negatively impact national and local economies: Burning the recoverable tar sands oil will increase the earth’s temperature by a minimum of 2 degree Celsius, which NYU Law School’s Environmental Law Center estimates could permanently cut the US GDP by 2.5%. At the same time state and local economies are already buckling under the real-time economic effects of our nation’s dependence on fossil fuels. In the past two years, the vast majority of U.S. counties ““ 67 percent ““ were affected by at least one of the eleven $1 billion dollar extreme weather events. Superstorm Sandy alone caused an estimated $80 billion in damage. The drought that affected 80% of US farmland last summer destroyed a quarter of the US corn crop and did at least $20 billion damage to the economy.  
  
2. The same fossil fuel interests pushing the Keystone pipeline have been cutting, not creating, jobs: Despite generating $546 billion in profits between 2005 and 2010, ExxonMobil, Chevron, Shell, and BP reduced their U.S. workforce by 11,200 employees over that period. In 2010 alone, the top five oil companies slashed their global workforce by 4,400 employees “” the same year executives paid themselves nearly $220 million. But at least those working in the industry as a whole get paid high wages, right? Turns out that 40 percent of U.S oil-industry jobs consist of minimum-wage work at gas stations. Instead of bankrolling an industry that is laying off workers and threatening our economic future, isn’t it time to take the billions in subsidies going to oil companies and invest instead in a sector that both creates jobs and protects the planet?  
  
3. Unemployment will rise: According to Mark Zandi, the Chief Economist of Moody’s Analytics: “Superstorm Sandy wreaked havoc on the job market in November, slicing an estimated 86,000 jobs from payrolls.” In the wake of Hurricane Irene, the number of workers filing unemployment claims in Vermont went from 731 before Irene to 1,331 two weeks afterwards. Hurricane Katrina wiped out 129,000 jobs in the New Orleans region “” nearly 20 percent. For the U.S. economy as a whole, 2011 cost US taxpayers $52 billion.  
  
4. Poor and working people will be disproportionately affected: KXL and projects like it result in disproportionately negative impact on already struggling working families. According to a recent report by the Center for American Progress called “Heavy Weather: How Climate Destruction Harms Middle- and Lower-Income Americans, lower-and middle income households are disproportionately affected by the most expensive extreme weather events. Sixteen states were afflicted by five or more extreme weather events in 2011-12. Households in disaster-declared counties in these states earn $48,137, or seven percent below the U.S. median income.  
  
5. Building the sustainable economy, not the Keystone pipeline, will create far more jobs: Our nation is in desperate need of jobs. Approving the Keystone pipeline locks our nation into a trajectory of guaranteed job loss and threatens the stability of the US economy. Why keep the “job-killing” course, when the alternative-energy path is already out-performing other sectors of the economy. For example, the solar industry continues to be an engine of job growth — creating jobs six times faster than the overall job market. Research by the Solar Foundation shows a 13 percent growth in high-skilled solar jobs spanning installations, sales, marketing, manufacturing and software development — bringing total direct jobs to 119,000 in the sector. And according to the Political Economy Research Institute at the University of Massachusetts”“Amherst, investment in a green infrastructure program would create nearly four times as many jobs as an equal investment in oil and gas.  
  
A study by Synapse Energy Economics developed a Transition Scenario for the electric power industry based on reducing energy consumption, phasing out high-emission power plants, and building new, lower-emission energy facilities. The study estimated the number of “job years” “” one new worker employed for one year “” that would be created by the Transition Scenario over a decade:  
  
444,000 job-years for construction workers, equivalent to 44,400 construction workers working full time for the entire decade.  
90,000 job-years for operations and maintenance workers, equivalent to about 9,000 full time workers employed over the decade.  
3.1 million indirect jobs for people designing, manufacturing, and delivering materials and jobs in local economies around the country induced by spending by workers hired in the Transition Scenario."

2021-05-12 13:46:57,wallstreetbets,"Could that possibly have anything to do with the gas prices returning to the same level prices of 2020 pre-pandemic due to more people and companies using more gas as things return to normal in a post Covid society? 

For some reason lots of people want to keep pointing at gas prices going up as something bad happening, but they're at a fairly similar level to January 2020. Now if it goes up another dollar this year that'll be a big deal for sure, but the idea that gas would stay around $2 a gallon (where I live at least) after this pandemic was a pipe dream."
2021-05-12 16:03:38,wallstreetbets,"The issue is that you blamed it on an issue that you didn't understand at all. You said the pipeline was shut down, but it is still flowing as we speak. The new construction was halted. 


Also, here in Texas, gas was $2.50-$2.60 a week ago. It did hit a low of $2 at one point, but at that time oil was so cheap that it wasn't sustainable (<$25 a barrel). Gas is only $1 higher because you're comparing it to a 5-10 year low gas price that we had a year ago. If I compare it to further back, when gas was more than $4 a gallon, gas has actually decreased. 


Inflation may affect gas prices in the future, but the current rise we are seeing is due to supply and demand, not inflation. Your friends with first hand knowledge are basing their opinions off of what they read on Facebook."

2021-05-12 19:01:17,wallstreetbets,these are no pre-covid prices. Gas here prior was at least $0.50 cents a gal cheaper than they are now.
2021-05-12 17:13:24,wallstreetbets,If you’re going to randomly pick a time when gas was $4 why not go back further and compare to the late 60’s when there was rationing and it got as high as .99.

INO has just released information on the effectiveness of their covid 19 vaccine and it performed very well on the 3000 subjects.

However, the stock is so heavily shorted that INO went down on such good news. INO is also developing non evasive treatments for cancer and so far has proven to be quite effective. It should be a crime to short companies trying to do good at this level.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inflation is not goddam transitory!!! Stupid!!! 🌈 🐻 So Jpow has been cranking the printer handle like his own meatstick at a furious pace. 120bn a month and stonks are flying to the moon, hedge funds partying and going all in on 20x leverage like degenerates. Margin loans are through the roof, higher than never ever ever before and Jpow tells us at this point that inflation is transitory.

Lets explore what that means via an easy to follow macdonalds example.

Suppose you work at macdonalds, i know they probaly dont hire people on the spectrum but bear with me.

Lets say you make 12/hr as a human hamberger robot. Prior to pandemic, you barely survive on your salary. But having now lived 1.5 years on gov assistance, getting paid more than your shitty ex job to do absolutely nothing, you are planning to max out this insane period by taking benefits until they kick you off. Meanwhile you look around the shops, everything is more expensive, food, drink, rent, houses, even the cheap Chinese made tshirt is twice the cost as before. Why? The dollar is down and raw materials are more expensive, shipping is higher, oil is higher. Cotton prices are through the roof, bread, fuck me it is up, pork is ridiculously high... In short there is nothing that is not up a huge amount. 

What does that add up to? Previously you were just barely surviving with your shitty 12/hr, now, if you go back to work, you will lose your pandemic unemployment assistance, which means a hefty pay cut while all prices have risen massively. You simply cannot afford to start working!!! If you work, you will work yourself into your moms basement because you wont be able to afford rent, will lose the free health care and still barely breakeven. You are below the watermark on being able to survive as a human. 

This means only one thing. Macdonalds is gonna have to raise wages and fast if they still need humans pretending to be a robot. Once they do, they will have to raiss big mac prices further to compensate for this and the 100% higher price in every single input cost of the hamburger. And once that starts it means you will need a higher wage again because you cant afford to eat and round and round it goes into an inflationary spiral.

By this process, once the fed gets its wish of unemployment falling, inflation will be in the teens, dollar will crash another 20% and they will need to hike to 15% interest rate again like in 70s.

Tldr. Inflation moves up in spirals. It has already started and cannot be stopped. Jpow has no idea what hes talking about. Full on 🌈 🐻. SPX puts.

clearly future expectations are based on historical events, but those entirely disregard current economic variables -- like pretending inflation isn't due to awkward supply demand changes and commodity issues arising as a result of public health FUD and physical changes to goods/services

of course an easy way to push and prod inflation is to dump FUD into the market and convince everyone that in a few months we are headed for the soup lines

2021-05-12 15:23:29,wallstreetbets,"The problem is, we don't really know how much of the consumer price index increase is real inflation or just reflecting the supply/demand shocks.

So many factors at play:

* Demand - It's still low in some areas and isn't coming back in others. But for some things like raw materials, demand is skyrocketing because of changes in consumer habits (like buying homes).
* Supply - Also like demand, it's down in some areas as certain businesses haven't returned to normal production levels. While in others it's unaffected.
* Job market - It's crowded in some places, which labor shortages exist in others. Especially in low-paid jobs. Labor shortages can drive up costs.
* Shipping - Almost every product needs to be shipped, often multiple times. But many truck drivers took the pandemic as a time to retire or take a career shift. Since people have been preaching how self-driving vehicles are going to put them all out of work for decades at this point. So shipping costs have skyrocketed.

So really, if you want to find the true inflation number. Find a collection of commodities that's not been impacted by supply/demand changes and aren't shipped or require low-paid labor. Measure increase in the price of that commodity. The problem is the pandemic is so impacting that almost no market was left untouched.

Really, what we're talking about, is how hard is it to actually find the true amount of inflation. No one index or figure tells the whole story, and it's not just the aggregate of all of them. Otherwise, inflation would just be GDP.

So yes, the price increases may very well be transitory in respect of the consumer price index."

2021-05-12 16:39:41,wallstreetbets,"Right, but what's changing the price. An increase in supply of the dollar, or the decrease (or more likely increase of supply costs) of the supply.

If a hotdog goes from being $3 to $4, it could be because the dollar has lost 1/4th of its value. Or because hotdogs have become more expensive to make or source.

CPI increase is concerning, but the implication that it's entirely or even mostly from monetary inflation is a fallacy. While it's traditionally been measured to monetary inflation, doesn't mean a change in it is directly related to monetary inflation.

The core of the modern monetary theory is that all money is on loan, and people use money loaned to them more responsibly (namely the banks/businesses, since the feds don't loan money directly to individuals). So the amount of money that contributes to waste is dramatically lowered and thus inflation rates are low.

This is why the fed has ""printed"" (in actuality loaned at very low-interest rates) money at very high rates since 2008 with almost no inflation. That amount has dramatically picked up, but simply by raising the interest rates the fed lowers the amount of money that's going to be borrowed.

So one-quarter of high CPI because of the unprecedented supply/demand shake-ups, or is it a refutation of the past 40 years of monetary theory? Chances are it's former and not the latter and thus once the markets figure out the shakeup, it'll iron out the wrinkles and return to more efficient pricing."

And your right that might make their prices lower. Its a story as old as technology.  It happens naturally in sectors all the time. 

But the fed has made clear, employment is their number 1 focus now.  So Automation causes job loss. Job loss causes stimulus and low rates. Stim/low rates creates inflation.  The fed needs to raise rates and stop the money flow. But they wont, because protecting the economy and preserving the dollar is no longer their goal. Employment is.  That means the government printing money and giving it to people to dig holes and others to fill the holes.  But that meaningless work creates no value, so those dollars flood the econmy and look like inflation, because thats what we are doing. Inflating the currency.

I think we will see substantially higher prices as a result of there being sooooo many more dollars, and the same or less goods.  But im also an idiot who knows almost nothing"
2021-05-12 16:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Prices will rise a little, but what we're probably going to see more of is automation rather than massive price hikes. We're already moving towards robots doing most of the work we pay minimum wage labor now, and if we incentivize that before putting some sort of protections in place (like, your automated systems should still cost you on your payroll taxes and should not be depreciable like other equipment) we're going to keep our cheap Big Macs but get rid of large chunks of our labor force."

2021-05-12 19:06:48,wallstreetbets,"Have you even looked into the CPI statistics behind that 4.2%?

- All items: 4.2%
- Food: 2.4%
- Enegry: 25.1%
- All items less enegry or food: 3.0%

Gasoline is up 49% since last year. (Remember when oil prices went negative last year)?

All of the statistics are dated in the price difference between April 2020 and April 2021. Hmm... I wonder if there was something happening in April 2020 that made prices of a lot of things abnormally low, and something happening now to make it abnormally high?

Good look for yourself at how useless this data actually is (Click ""Show table""): https://www.bls.gov/charts/consumer-price-index/consumer-price-index-by-category.htm

The idea that true inflation is anywhere near 4.2% is relatively insane. The median (which is maybe a more sane way of analyzing this data since obvious outliers exist) price of items (which happens to be fruit and vegetables) is 3.3%. However, even fruit and vegetables had an [insane time last year](https://www.google.com/search?q=fruit+and+vegetable+United+States&biw=1920&bih=969&tbs=sbd%3A1%2Ccdr%3A1%2Ccd_min%3A4%2F1%2F2020%2Ccd_max%3A4%2F30%2F2020&tbm=nws&ei=_F6cYLvMLpSGtQaUhr_gBg&oq=fruit+and+vegetable+United+States&gs_l=psy-ab.3..33i299k1l3.17789.20960.0.21062.14.13.0.0.0.0.131.1067.11j2.13.0....0...1c.1.64.psy-ab..1.8.659...0j0i333k1.0.2LYkooa3TuY).

So yes, I think the CPI data is actually kind of a garbage data point **for inflation** right now. It'll still have an impact on the economy because if people are paying more for say Gasoline, they'll have less money for other goods and services. But long term we should see a trend back to price normality with no long-term inflation."

2021-05-12 18:56:15,wallstreetbets,dispersion premium... Go read it up.
2021-05-12 19:27:44,wallstreetbets,"ok and just to be clear im asking these questions to be curious, not to be a dick or anything. 

The information I found states that dispersion trades can be used as a hedge or a form of ""vol arbitrage"", it also talks about the risk of the correlation falling between the stock and the index. The part im not understanding is that everything I found states it to be a two leg strategy, and that it is most successful when delta neutral. I understand the volatility is lower on an index, but that is obvious right? In relation to itself the realized volatility is still lower than the actual stock. which in turn mean less of a return on investment.

While volatility is cheaper on the index it doesn't really matter unless you are directly comparing it to the price of a specific ticker's option chain. SPX option are just expensive, and I would be surprised to see them be cheaper than puts on a specific company. Even if exposure to volatility is cheaper when purchasing the option, it shouldn't matter if you can just buy a cheaper option.

If I am sure 5 companies in SPY will fail I probably wouldn't buy puts on SPY.

I am completely open to missing something here but it really seems like you are just spending extra money on premiums to have smaller returns."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"New to options. Made a mistake! Hey guys! I recently started trying my hand at options trading. I’m still totally new to it and had a question for you guys. I think a bit of context might help you first though, lol. So I bought 100 shares of a stock at $4.43. I sold a call option at $2.5 cuz it had the highest premium. (I said I was a newb, I will happily take a barrage of insults!) and the expiration date was set for May 21. I entered the contract on April 25. Well 2 days ago I got a notification that said my contract was assigned and I no longer had the shares and lost $2.00 per share or something like that. I guess what I’m asking is what makes a contract get assigned? I was under the impression that the stock would have to fall to $2.50 for the buyer to exercise their end to buy my shares and if the stock did not fall to $2.50 then the contract would expire worthless by the 21st and I would keep my 100 shares and the premium. Could anyone enlighten me?? Lowly newb pleb guppy asking the big boy pro sharks for help!"
2021-05-12 11:21:16,wallstreetbets,Have you tried turning it off and on?
2021-05-12 11:17:34,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck. How do people like this get approval for options. They gotta start putting at least a basic test on the application.
2021-05-12 11:18:22,wallstreetbets,Tuition was 100 shares this quarter
2021-05-12 11:37:11,wallstreetbets,"When you sell a call you are entering a contract saying that you agree to sell 100 shares of the underlying company at the strike price you selected on or before a certain date. The contract buyer will have paid you a premium that you get to keep.
If the buyer exercises the contract then you have to deliver the shares at the agreed upon price (the strike), regardless of what you paid for them or even what the current market price is. 
Contracts are always in danger of being exercised early if they are in-the-money (ITM), or even at-the-money (ATM) if there are other factors at play (such as an upcoming dividend). 

When you sell options that are ITM always expect to be assigned and your shares called away. In this case the good news is that you get to keep all of the premium you received, which should make up for most of the loss you realized per share.

For your sake please learn a lot more about this before you do too much damage to your account. Options can get real screwy real fast, even if you do know what you're doing. Contrary to popular jokes, it really can go tits up in a fucking hurry.

2021-05-12 11:17:43,wallstreetbets,"You have it backwards. When someone owns a call, they have a right to purchase the stock for the call's strike price ($2.5 here). Those are in the money for the person who bought them when $2.5 is less than the stock price. If the stock price fell to $2, the contract would expire worthless."

2021-05-12 11:22:37,wallstreetbets,"They purchased the call option to buy shares from you at $2.50 a share (100 share per option) up until the option expires. Since $2.50 is less than $4.43 they exercised the option, since it would make them $1.93 per share (if they sold immediately). 

If the premium paid was less than $1.93 the buyer made money. If your premium was more than $1.93 you potentially made money. $194 (premium) + $250 (100 shares bought from you at $2.50) = $444 (minus any fees for the trade)"
2021-05-12 11:21:36,wallstreetbets,LMAO. Welcome.
2021-05-12 11:27:06,wallstreetbets,"no mistake, no success"
2021-05-12 11:28:43,wallstreetbets,FYI any option contract can be assigned at any point in time by the owner/buyer until they expire. Know the retards on this reddit some one probably will exercise way out of the money contracts too thinking their closing their position
2021-05-12 11:29:22,wallstreetbets,"You did not lose $200. The premium you got paid has the 4.43 price baked in to the premium. So when you add the premium + (2.5x100) you will realize you are very close to your buy price.

It’s not as big a loss as you think. Think of it as your mistake tax.

One thing I would highly encourage you to do is monitor a specific option atleast for a full 2 week so you understand how the options pricing is moving and whether it lines up with your research. If you feel options pricing is moving differently than what you expect then that’s an indication you do no yet understand options"
2021-05-12 11:37:15,wallstreetbets,"The buyer of the call you wrote has the option to buy it at 2.50 per share.  They paid you a premium for that which you keep in addition to the 2.50/share.

You basically did exactly opposite of what you wanted.  you bought at 4.43 shoulda wrote the call at 5.  SO they would pay you a premium, and then if they exercised that option at $5 they would pay you the $5/share

congrats on first lesson not costing you much money, but boy do you not understand what happened"
2021-05-12 12:12:16,wallstreetbets,You should have sold a put instead. It wouldn’t have exercised (usually) unless it dropped below $2.50 and you would get to keep your shares and premium if the strike price was more than $2.50 at the expiration date. Or if someone excercised and lost $ by accident like you did.
2021-05-12 13:23:54,wallstreetbets,"Call options need to rise in order to be exercised but can be exercised any time they're in the money. Put options are the same if sold in the money but if sold out of the money, put options are what needs to fall in order to be assigned.  Looks like you've confused the 2 and didn't realize the risk of in the money options."
2021-05-12 14:02:27,wallstreetbets,Ahahahaha
2021-05-12 15:03:30,wallstreetbets,Sold a call when you meant to sell a put. When you sell a call you want the price to stay the same or drop for it to expire worthless (which is a good thing because you get your money upfront when you sell a call or put and expiring worthless means who ever bought from you isn’t getting any of the money back). When you sell a put you want the price to stay the same or go up for it to expire worthless. Gets a bit more complicated when you sell in the money options but it’s pretty much as simple as when selling calls you want the price to go down and for puts you want the price to go up. It’s the opposite when buying
2021-05-12 11:28:04,wallstreetbets,Please work out this problem on your own.  I know you can figure it out and it'll be best if you do it yourself.
2021-05-12 11:32:10,wallstreetbets,"Yeah thats par for the course: In my experience, one buys or sells an option, and then immediately afterwards they take all your stuff and send you a bill for it."
2021-05-12 11:47:36,wallstreetbets,You did not lose 2$ per share. The option money you got was mostly intrinsic value. Add the premium and the money you got from the share together and I assume its not as bad as you think it is.
2021-05-12 11:49:35,wallstreetbets,At least it was a covered call
2021-05-12 12:59:55,wallstreetbets,Td ameritrade has online training. You can open an account and paper trade options. Paper trading is just practice so you get the hang of it. (Do not confuse this with paper silver. :))

2021-05-12 11:17:58,wallstreetbets,Absolutely! I agree but I have no clue what triggered my contract to get assigned. And what getting assigned really means. Did the buyer exercise his end?
2021-05-12 12:38:12,wallstreetbets,"I think he gave you the best explanation of what happened. 

Going forward, you almost have to think of it backwards when selling an option. You sell a call when you expect it to stay below the strike price. You buy a call when you expect it to go above the strike price."
2021-05-12 11:47:08,wallstreetbets,"LOL! HELL NO I didn’t. But yeah I’m so grateful it wasn’t worse than what it was. I expect to make mistakes and it’s not discouraging at all. In fact it inspires me to do better. But in order to do better, it’s 100% blatant that I need more time researching and listening to the guys who know what they are doing."
2021-05-12 13:36:00,wallstreetbets,"Correct! Yeah, I watched a guy on YouTube, Tech Conversations.. super helpful but I totally got the two backwards. I made $190 off the premium for the sell so I really only lost like $40. $40 is the price I have to pay to learn from a mistake? I’m good with it. Just don’t keep making them and make the right moves so I’m making more from no mistakes! Lmao"

2021-05-12 14:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, lol. It’s cool. It was a $40 mistake that I gratefully accept. And am inspired to learn more and work harder to make profit off options. I’ll happily make $40 mistakes if I can earn $1000 doing it the right way!"

2021-05-12 12:50:00,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity does that. I've been messing with options for a year now and have a good amount of liquid assets and I still only got approved for only covered calls.

But all the other app-based brokers basically just give you level 2 or 3 for asking nicely."
2021-05-12 11:23:39,wallstreetbets,You didnt even lose money. You sold a deep ITM call so you basically just broke even.
2021-05-12 12:46:47,wallstreetbets,If the option goes in the money it can be exercised before the expiration date. You got assigned hoss. Welcome to options
2021-05-12 12:29:53,wallstreetbets,"You sound like a middle aged mom. No insult, that's just my guess. 

What you could have sold was a ""put"" below the stock price. That give someone the right to SELL YOU shares at the strike price whenever they want up to expiration. No one would actually do that unless the stock drops BELOW that price. 

Sold a put for $100 and the price drops to $50? Someone is gonna sell you 100 shares at $100 each.  They make $50 more than market value and you now own 100 shares of a stock for twice its value. 
Bad

Sold a call for $100 dollars and the price goes to $50? No one wants your shares, so you will make money on the premium you got and keep your shares.
Good

Sold a call for $50 and the stock is at $100? Someone is going to buy your shares immediately and sell them to profit $50x100. Assuming you just bought the shares, you again lose $50 per share.
Bad

Basically, your goal with options is to sell them in such a way that you make a high premium, but they never get exercised. If they do, you would have been able to make more money from the stock itself, or you're just purely losing money in the case of a put because you have to buy someone's shares for more than they are worth. 

Do research, learn to LURK, and stop asking for advice on WSB. This is not a friendly community for that. Go to r/investing or r/stocks. And I would suggest you check their FAQ and scroll through old posts before asking questions. They likely have every question you can possibly ask answered there. 

You won't make friends asking questions like this on WSB. You'll piss people off"
2021-05-12 11:38:23,wallstreetbets,Your math skills aren’t there. People won’t explain the mechanics of options better than google will. You need google and a math tutor.
2021-05-12 11:33:50,wallstreetbets,"The call with the 3$ strike price will most certainly cost more than $2 dollars, or everybody would buy it and immediately exercise (American style options, not European) and then immediately sell the shares for profit at the current price of $5.

Since market makers are generally in the game to make money, this will almost never be the case. Read up on options, it's not even funny at this point.

Ps. You'd lose money even if the price of the stock went to $4 before expiry because near expiry your contract would worth 4-3~$1 and you'd have most probably paid 5-3~$2. The prices are approximate because the contract has time and uncertainty baked in the premium"
2021-05-12 11:19:56,wallstreetbets,The buyer does not have to wait. They have the right to buy shares. You have the OBLIGATION as a seller to provide. Early exercise is usually because of dividends.
2021-05-12 11:20:58,wallstreetbets,Jesus 2x
2021-05-12 11:36:41,wallstreetbets,"It's not that, some things are just more beneficial to dig through and figure out on your own.  I've been in your shoes and tried to learn about options for almost a year.  I still didn't understand it until I made my first trade, then it all clicked and started to make sense."
2021-05-12 12:45:40,wallstreetbets,It's a lot smarter to make a 'paper' account (lots of banks/brokerages offer this) where you can practice with fake money much like using fake chips to play poker. Do this for a few months until you get the hang of what buying/selling actually means.

2021-05-12 12:55:12,wallstreetbets,"Options are complex. I've been ""investing"" for about 5 months and I still haven't touched them. I get that you are trying to learn, but money is a finite resource. Burn all your money trying to learn and it'll be much harder to get that same money back.

Do low risk investments to start out. You won't make tons of money, but you shouldn't lose as much either. You learn the mechanics and can apply it to higher risk stuff.

If you are actually going to invest, you NEED to start researching. That is not an option or and opinion. You absolutely have to. And if you aren't even willing to look up how trading works, you are going to go broke and fast. Stock prices move based on a huge number of factors, typically based on the position of the company itself. If you want to make good investments you have to research the company, it's financial situation, it's position in its industry, new products, earnings, good and bad press etc etc etc

Your lazy ass not willing to look up how options work on your own is not a trend you can continue. You are right, ""everyone started where you are"" but it doesn't mean that everyone behaves the way you are."

Which is what led me to this mistake in the first place. But regardless, the mistake is made and now I’m learning from it. So I’m still effin grateful that I made the mistake. It’s not a matter of laziness.. it was a matter of misunderstanding. Behaves the way I do? LOL! What do you mean? Nobody makes a mistake and then goes to a community of people who knows what they are doing to ask them for help and what they did wrong and where to look next to learn from the errors? That’s the only way I have behaved. I haven’t touched another options deal since. And I’m still out there reading and trying to ascertain a greater amount of knowledge to move forward with my investing opportunities. Don’t act like you know what I’m doing, pimpin, lol.

But hey! Thanks for the information as well as the attempted insult! I still appreciate you and your time!"

I’m just uneducated on options and unfortunately, I have to learn by doing, lmao. Watching videos only got me so far and reading only got me so far. I’ll pay $40 for an education on trading options, lol! Especially if it makes me profits in the end!"

2021-05-12 11:57:52,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yes. This much I do know. Now I do more research and attempt to get a better understanding of how option work. Luckily a lot of friendly people helped me out with it and I feel just a bit more confident. Not enough to start another options deal... lol.. but confident enough to research more and not be too afraid to try again. I’m only human! Mistakes must be made so I can learn!"

I’ve seen people lose way more than the $40 I ultimately lost. I thought I lost more until these amazing people on this thread helped me realize that the income I earned from the premium offset my loss a bit so it wasn’t nearly as bad. But I want to make money like everyone else does and I learned real fast that if you don’t know exactly what’s going on, research more. Research it all until you think you understand and then make a move and attempt a small options trade to make sure you understand what you are doing. I hope by this time next year, I’ll be like most of these other big boys making a lot of money, using my own money. That’s my endgame. My money works for me and now my money pays my bills. Let’s go!"

2021-05-12 12:14:51,wallstreetbets,I was wondering why my ASX is 8% down ...
2021-05-12 16:23:43,wallstreetbets,"There are some big issues in Taiwan--Covid lockdowns may be a ahead which would disrupt manufacturing and the business sector at large, also their currency has dramatically strengthened in the past year (from 30 NTD =1USD to 27NTD=1USD) which makes domestic exports tougher for a heavily heavily manufacturing/agriculture based economy."
2021-05-12 11:24:16,wallstreetbets,"Lol risk taking… I been following the markets and not dumping money into stupid plays for the past couple years and watching all time highs come during a pandemic that absolutely killed the economy proved stonks only go up. No such thing as risk anymore.

If you want a chance at retiring before 90 you should be dumping all of your money into stocks - specifically the meme sector but also anything with a PE over like 100 will provide good returns. Also buy a house no matter how retarded the prices are and no mattter if you can afford it. If the market fails someone will bail you out with a shit ton of free money and probably put you back at all time highs. The most risky thing to do in the past decade would be to have any sort of risk management."

2021-05-12 13:10:02,wallstreetbets,I just bought in last week for the first time since covid. So yeah it’s prob a bad indicator.
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Next 10x Play -SWN - this is how the teslas will drive We need electricity to power those Teslas and other Evs.  We need electricity to power all of our computers (reddit access manchiens) and phones (reddit access machines and tendie makers).

Renewables are just not there yet, neither is battery tech.  The market knows this, and govt. subsidies only go so far to push it.  

Nuclear energy, even if it is ""the future"", is at least 30 years out at best.  Worst, we probably won't even see it in our lifetimes.

NG is the best compromise and is replacing coal worldwide as countries develop.

Thus, I bring to you SWN:

Trading at $5 now, was $50 in the past.  When NG prices shoot up, SWN will go INSANE.

It has no maturities until 2025 and positive free cash flow with proved reserves of 15 tcf and a total enterprise value 5.5 billion which is only about 40 cents per thousand cubic feet, which translates to $ 2.40 per barrel of oil equivalent.   It has been destroyed over the last 4 years by Wall Street shorts and all nat gas producers have been savaged by the Wall Street analysts for Morgan Stanley etc.  especially Morgan Stanley.   Nat gas has been in a bear market since 2008 but with the destruction of the space last year there has been a collapse in drilling and there isn’t even oil drilling which used to bring associated gas with it.   

Gas demand is still surging both as a power plant fuel replacing coal and export of lng to places like China where it’s been cold as shit.   NG was recently going for $30 per thousand cubic feet in China lng market while trading at 2.75 here.  Can’t go on forever.

Printing money just adds fuel to fire

Buying a producer with massive reserves is better than buying NG futures because there is no time limit.  You can hold till you’re right.   Which you have to be eventually.  ESPECIALLY WITH INFLATION."

2021-05-12 11:33:54,wallstreetbets,"Have you noticed they have used up virtually all of their cash?   
Dangerous play here."
2021-05-12 11:42:22,wallstreetbets,"You do realize that France has two nuke plants with thermal-neutron reactors that are burning nuclear waste today, right?

Natural gas will continue to replace coal in the near term as there are numerous regulatory, public relation and economic barriers to nuclear being a bigger slice of the pie.  But the technology is there and has been deployed at scale.

Not to mention that the 90+ nuclear reactors in the US today will continue to be serviced.  The barriers to new nuclear technologies make that business a monopoly in the US.  Long BWXT.

I like nat gas too but I’m not sure this is the entry point.  Supply is abundant and domestic manufacturing (power consumption) is likely to slow as inflation sets in."
2021-05-12 11:50:42,wallstreetbets,How does the political frown on fracking play into this?
2021-05-12 12:36:38,wallstreetbets,you got a good one :)
2021-05-12 13:01:57,wallstreetbets,"They have a $2B revolver they have been paying down.  No need to hold cash at 0 yield and pay interest, they paid $133M down last quarter, and had about $570M outstanding, so they have liquidity north of 1.4B.

I'm not a huge nat gas bull, but they're expected to earn close to a dollar this year and analyst estimates have been rising. Free cash flow should be positive as they don't seem to be aggressively growing production and own most of their own equipment and crews so they benefit from vertical integration.

Wish I'd spotted this two weeks ago, might enter on a pullback."
2021-05-12 11:49:29,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I know this.  I have contacts in power industry.  According to them, Nuclear takes forever to build, and the return is great on paper but in practice is much less optimistic (due to time to ROI, and unstable regulatory climate).  Nuclear is certainly viable but unlikely, due to the concerns you voiced.

Notice I didn't say Nuclear won't happen in the future.  But even optimistic people in the US know it's a brutal long road ahead if we even decide to go that direction.

Right now, Natural Gas is plentiful and cheap.  But the production is tapering.

It's a global market and demand is increasing, production is decreasing (US especially), and it's a matter of time till this spikes.  Hard."
2021-05-12 11:54:20,wallstreetbets,"the fracking revolution is what made america energy self-sufficient.  When you drill for oil, you get natural gas as a by-product.

Think of it as a ""bonus"" for drilling oil.

With fracking and oil drilling in general looking at more regulation/political pressure, that's a reduction in supply.

That means NG prices GO UP, cuz we gotta get our power and other solutions are a way away.

NG is extremely inelastic.

When that spike happens, that is when we moon, and when to sell SWN."
2021-05-12 15:06:53,wallstreetbets,you can always toss some in now and wait for the NG supply/demand spike.  Will probably not be a short term play but FAT reward.
2021-05-12 15:08:22,wallstreetbets,There is always a need for building a position in cash - the size of the cash position is what matters. Relying on a revolver is dangerous especially when the company took on a boatload of debt in 2020.
2021-05-12 16:08:03,wallstreetbets,I long RRC!!! Go nat gas companies!
2021-05-12 11:58:33,wallstreetbets,I mostly agree with your thesis on nat gas.  I’m watching for a mean reversion though.
2021-05-12 15:45:00,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, you're probably right.

Usually some seasonal weakness in late summer/fall.  Will have to see how gas prices do when oil drillers come back, and if Biden mandates them to capture the gas versus just being able to blow it off.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Macro question of the year. How much inflation is transitory and much is persistent? Some inflation was expected after the rebound of Covid shutdown.  The key question is how much is transitory (will not increase again next year) and how much is persistent.   The FED has been willing to tolerate higher inflation for several years but it hasn't shown up.  It is hard to change peoples inflation expectations, but Covid could be that catalyst to change the expectations for inflation on Main Street.  How much persists going forward is the key investment question of the year."
2021-05-12 11:01:45,wallstreetbets,"Is there such thing as transitionary inflation?

but connecting that with actual inflation might actually be easier in a COVID-free universe

the latter has turned supply demand upside down everywhere

it is totally reasonable that the current ""inflation"" and FUD is simply a result of supply chain issues around the globe and awkward demand spikes as stuff is finally opening up...like a pent up spring pushing back on the load

only time will tell but the media FUD WILL certainly scare off whatever fraction of boomers et al. still think CNBC is a useful source of DD

lots of debt investors ran out of bonds not long ago due to low rates, but very recently some will run back because rates are creeping up

It's not, years of underinvestment in infrastructure, production and operational capability for commodities has left people short during a time many governments want to spend aggressively during droughts, a pandemic and what not. Cheap rent on money is likely what will start these new ventures that fix supply shortages or provide substitutes. So when lumber prices come down, some turd will charge you less to build a chicken barn, which will cause chicken prices to fall, which will cause egg prices to fall which will cause cake prices to fall which will cause baked good prices to fall which will cause wheat prices to fall which will cause feed prices to fall which will cause cattle prices to fall which will cause manure prices to fall which will cause gas prices to fall which will cause widget prices to fall."
2021-05-12 18:17:51,wallstreetbets,There is inflation that is transitory and that's hyperinflation.
2021-05-12 11:07:36,wallstreetbets,"This inflation will continue and the longer the fed tries to hide it through low interest rates, the bigger its going to be a kick in the balls later. 

This isn't going away, we're just giving a longer time to wind up.

Hope you like singing soprano"
2021-05-12 11:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Sky high lumber prices will be transitory.   Lumber prices 3 years from now will be well below where we are now as supply and demand reach equilibrium again.  Wages, home prices and menu items tend to be very sticky and are not as transitory."
2021-05-12 11:05:51,wallstreetbets,"Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

2021-05-12 15:20:25,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Lumber is bottlenecked due to capacity constraints and production disequilibrium. That'll change. 

Food has inelastic demand, so it'll stay high. 

You don't think home prices have elastic demand, though?"
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Jim farting today morning 
2021-05-12 10:31:34,wallstreetbets,Did he silently say “fuck” when he realized how loud it was?
2021-05-12 11:07:03,wallstreetbets,Looks like he gambled and lost
2021-05-12 11:34:53,wallstreetbets,I love this post. Even how rushed the title is so he can get it on WSB first LMAO
2021-05-12 12:24:01,wallstreetbets,He apparently misjudge the volume of the guy talking and was surprise that it was not loud enough to “hedge” his fart.  This explains a lot why he talks loud and has buzzers/sirens in his show.
2021-05-12 10:54:00,wallstreetbets,That's definitely the face of a broken man who just made poopy.
2021-05-12 11:03:42,wallstreetbets,Had that look on his face like when my dog farts and scares himself.
2021-05-12 10:32:31,wallstreetbets,cramers depends might be full
2021-05-12 10:53:04,wallstreetbets,More enlightening than most of the stuff that comes out of his mouth

2021-05-12 13:09:28,wallstreetbets,Can we have Louis CK play him in a movie already?
2021-05-12 12:25:20,wallstreetbets,He said “Fuck” because he knew Reddit would have a field day if it was audible
2021-05-12 10:36:10,wallstreetbets,Jim’s such a boomer lol can’t control his farts
2021-05-12 10:53:27,wallstreetbets,Definitely time for a commercial brake after that one......haaaahaaa
2021-05-12 11:06:10,wallstreetbets,He's long on Depends.
2021-05-12 10:59:49,wallstreetbets,sounded like a chart
2021-05-12 11:20:34,wallstreetbets,My dog makes that face and smells his farts like that 🙊
2021-05-12 12:27:03,wallstreetbets,This is very good DD.
2021-05-12 10:58:27,wallstreetbets,"Rip, literally"
2021-05-12 11:23:03,wallstreetbets,"It looks like he hears the noise and says , “Farted?!??”.   After that he kinda stares into the abyss, knowing that this will be sprayed all over Reddit and that he’s now entered Unsharted territory"
2021-05-12 10:35:37,wallstreetbets,At that age… I gotta assume he shat himself and definitely smelled how terrible it was… I guess the wife is fucking her boyfriend tonight
2021-05-12 11:08:00,wallstreetbets,Jim is trying to fill his Ballon to the moon with gas 💨 Jesus this ist very funny stuff. You made my day!
2021-05-12 13:57:12,wallstreetbets,"ran the audio through my processor.  it read as an D-4.  This would indicate a very tight asshole as most human flatulence registers on the 3rd scale an octave lower.

2021-05-12 12:39:03,wallstreetbets,"He farted? I heard ""buy gme"".


Bought 1 more GME. Europoor here, sorry."
2021-05-12 11:42:24,wallstreetbets,It's all I hear when Jim speaks anyway.
2021-05-12 11:41:02,wallstreetbets,Can someone analyze and post his fart in the Fartr app? (App to visualize your fart)
2021-05-12 12:43:02,wallstreetbets,"Farts are like love.

If you force it... it’s shit."

2021-05-12 13:50:24,wallstreetbets,He must not have done his DD on that one.
2021-05-12 11:47:54,wallstreetbets,Why is he looking down AT the fart 😭😭😭😩😩😩
2021-05-12 11:53:17,wallstreetbets,Cramer just shorted his continence.

2021-05-12 12:14:17,wallstreetbets,At Jim’s age you gotta do the sniff test to know if you just shit your pants.
2021-05-12 12:28:46,wallstreetbets,Time to analyze the Scharts...
2021-05-12 12:53:52,wallstreetbets,"Tomorrow Jim will tell us all to go long on Kimberly-Clark, maker of depends.

2021-05-12 13:51:01,wallstreetbets,It’s the looking down to see if he shit himself for me 😂
2021-05-12 11:30:08,wallstreetbets,Looks like a disgruntled intern finally decided to drop some eye drops into his coffee
2021-05-12 11:29:04,wallstreetbets,"I believe that is an actual ""GUH""."
2021-05-12 12:17:11,wallstreetbets,It was a vision into how the market was gonna move today 🤣
2021-05-12 13:55:44,wallstreetbets,Are you trying to say he is full of shit?
2021-05-12 18:14:48,wallstreetbets,"I think he said “fuck, I shit”"
2021-05-12 11:27:21,wallstreetbets,"Shit... I must be getting brain wrinkles.  


How has nobody noticed this is dubbed over yet?"
2021-05-12 13:11:49,wallstreetbets,"I just can't recognize this as a fart. I mean, it has to be but it almost sounds like a guy saying ""alright""."
2021-05-12 12:19:46,wallstreetbets,Jimmy Crapper stinks like the sewer he lives in
2021-05-12 12:24:44,wallstreetbets,I bet Cramer's house smells like a diaper pail...

2021-05-12 13:50:09,wallstreetbets,"His biggest worry in that moment wasnt about what his puppetmasters will do to him, but it was whether or not he shit his pants."
2021-05-12 14:01:00,wallstreetbets,He doesn't even give a shit.

Farts are always funny."
2021-05-12 13:29:42,wallstreetbets,"For degenererad apes that dont understand

1 Fart sound breaks free.
2 Jim saying: F$#k.... thinking about the pressure he could not controll.
3 Jim thinking: i wonder if it smells, becuse if it does it will be hard to cover up.
4 Jim trying to locate the smell by traping the upcoming smell with his face where he uses the nose to inhale the stream.
What do we know about Jim?
Jim is very smart and understands that the hot air will rise.... becuse thats the facts and he knows THE SOURCE

Cheers"
2021-05-12 13:40:28,wallstreetbets,"That tiny fart tastes like fear imo.

2021-05-12 15:44:33,wallstreetbets,He shit his pant but it isn't disgust that's upsetting him. It's the fact that he just created a new competitor for his job.
2021-05-12 15:51:26,wallstreetbets,Lol he cast his eyes downward in shame
2021-05-12 17:17:16,wallstreetbets,Did he shit his pants ?
2021-05-12 17:20:59,wallstreetbets,That look of disgust on his face is everything....

2021-05-12 19:03:41,wallstreetbets,He's definitely covered his shorts after that.

2021-05-12 13:09:49,wallstreetbets,My theory is they are gonna say he's a senile old man and show all these clips to discredit him later in case anyone wants to sue later on.
2021-05-12 13:11:00,wallstreetbets,"NOT silent, but also DEADLY"

2021-05-12 18:22:22,wallstreetbets,He's probably short AMC. And he's not the only one shitting his pants.
2021-05-12 18:22:51,wallstreetbets,"IMMA LET YOU FINISH, BUT...that aint no fart.  The audio is off; look at the guy's lips on the left.  It sounds like Cramer just said ""Right?"" under his breath, and the video of his face looking down is a delayed video from when he was speaking.

DISCRAMER: Cramer still sucks."
2021-05-12 18:24:53,wallstreetbets,I think he shitted his pants :)
2021-05-12 18:25:48,wallstreetbets,That was definitely a shart. Just like his financial commentary.

2021-05-12 18:29:29,wallstreetbets,Fart was quicker than he could slap one of his sound effects.
2021-05-12 18:29:44,wallstreetbets,He is so enigmatic it annoys me. Most people try and contain that kind of emotion because it makes them  look like a bafoon. But Since Jim is a bafoon I guess it make sense.

2021-05-12 10:51:34,wallstreetbets,He's inhaling the bouquet. Apparently it didn't age well in the cellar.
2021-05-12 13:29:16,wallstreetbets,"I think he realized he did more than fart. He was looking at his legs for conformation.. That,  or he was instantly aware of the endless memes that are going to be created with this."
2021-05-12 11:12:26,wallstreetbets,No that was because he realised how wet and lumpy it was.
2021-05-12 13:08:59,wallstreetbets,Looks like he realized he *shat* himself.

Queue a couple minutes of painful awkwardness while Louis CK beats his meat and stares at you. 

Apparently he also would jerk off while on the phone with women he worked with too. And he'd randomly steer conversations to his fetishes. Extremely weird and inappropriate, but he's not a pedo.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The real reason why Academy Sports & Outdoors (ASO) will be a $50 stock in 3 months.🚀💯 My positions: 298 shares @ 32.83
3 calls July 21 @ $30
3 calls July 21 @ $35

Alright, I made a post yesterday for the real retards but today I want to speak to those that like actual reasoning. While I do have a Masters in Finance and use it daily to make a living sometimes life throws you a bone that doesn't require too much thinking and bean counting to make a life changing decision. This is one of those times.

ASO, based in Texas is LITERALLY the ALAMO of the crossover sporting goods stores. Their business is conducted primarily in the South East where guns, bullets, and sports is king. Over the past decade all of Academy Sports competitors have bailed leaving them with a totally niche market. What I mean by that is that Dicks sporting goods, Walmart, and all the other big block crossover stores that carried all thing outdoors have bailed on the hunting and fishing aspect. Bass Pro and Cabelas never entered the market, only catering to the outdoorsman, but never to the dad who needed a few bullets while buying his kid a baseball glove. So when I say ASO is literally the Alamo of all things sports related it should become obvious that as far as a brick and mortar retailer who sells everything  from  pink soccer balls all the way to AR-15 rifles this is the true one stop shop. They are solely serving a huge demographic in gods country  where mom will go when she has to buy a jock strap for son, a box of 9mm for hubby, and a pair of yoga pink yoga pants for daughter, where will she go? ASO! If she doesn't want to make the short drive but prefers online, they have a pretty nice website..if you can't see the fundamental niche here, then I can't help you.

They went public in October of 2020 after sales were all but nothing for a full year due to the pandemic having closed down all sporting events all the way down to T-ball, and the freakout of every redneck including myself had cleaned the country of every bullet and gun to be found. Now that sports are picking  back up, moms will need bag chairs, kids will need ball gloves, cleats, socks, cleats, etc. And the redneck buying guns and bullets problem hasn't slowed down one bit. The math is SIMPLE, with every family in America strapped to the hilt with fresh stimulus money ASO can not keep their shelves stocked right now. Couple that with the highest short interest in the country and their stock price is going to see gamma squeeze after gamma squeeze. If it gains the traction it should then it could see a short squeeze never to drop below $100 again. Your Welcome!

2021-05-12 11:30:42,wallstreetbets,"No? Like I said, the stock price is irrational."
2021-05-12 12:12:45,wallstreetbets,"The price rises with the IV, higher IV means higher price.

2021-05-12 12:10:25,wallstreetbets,Well it depends on more than just the price dropping but it’s certainly possible

2021-05-12 11:18:28,wallstreetbets,a crash back down to 90 is impossible because the company is obviously poised to be the biggest auto manufacturer in the world. if it went down to 300 or something i could see it being a possibility. every other ev manufacturer is at least 5 years behind tesla in technology.
2021-05-12 11:44:59,wallstreetbets,"It has a 600+ PE Ratio, its core business is not profitable, it sells vaporware, and its growth rate does not justify its stock price. This ignoring the CEO who is not constrained in any way by the board despite his arguably fraudulent practices (see SolarCity).

2021-05-12 12:09:20,wallstreetbets,Ostensibly. Consumer reports will vehemently disagree with you.
2021-05-12 13:34:06,wallstreetbets,"Something about redirecting Chinese production to sell in Europe, delivery numbers being down in China, Teslas getting pulled over by Chinese cops, no PR team saving them in the PRC, and Giga Berlin being delayed (waiting for the shoe to drop on Austin delays), tech and ARKK currently getting whacked, commodity prices rising.

Near term sentiment is negative.  Might be a good IV play, but $57 is an odd number without much liquidity.

I see two possible near term upside catalysts to catch this and hold it above $600.

1)  FSD beta 9 comes out shortly and delivers what Musk has been saying will blow your mind in terms of step change improvements.  Cue fanboi youtube videos.

2)  Releasing plans for their ""economy"" car - Tesla model 2?  that has a price point and specs that get people excited."
2021-05-12 15:25:36,wallstreetbets,"This is crazy. It's certainly not poised to be the biggest auto manufacturer in the world.  
  
-It's not the only manufacturer of electric cars  
-People in developing nations will stay on Petrol. They don't have the infra for electric cars and won't for years (with longer range you still need increased electricity capacity)  
-Oh and of course on the subject of electricity. The grid could not cope if even a slim majority of people owned an electric car.  
-Tesla is not 5 years ahead. Look at things like the renault zoe. Yes the tesla has a range of 400 miles but it has a range of 250 miles which is enough for most people. Also the only reason that the renault zoe has a smaller range is because it has a smaller battery. It's much cheaper. Most people can't afford a tesla. Most people can't even afford new cars"
2021-05-12 11:58:26,wallstreetbets,People invest in musk not the company 🤷‍♂️. Actually their operating profits is insane for the car company as they don’t spend money on marketing and dealership
2021-05-12 15:32:29,wallstreetbets,"That's not a price target or valuation, though if you're going off PE ratios look no further than AMZN circa 2016 at about 1,000. 
The core auto business posted over $5B in gross profit while building out multiple international production sites. They have higher margins than traditional auto manufacturers and have a decent cadence hitting their target production rates. Can you say depreciation? FSD is hella behind, but it's the dominant tech (say nothing of the infrastructure and engineering team they've built to develop it) in the space that will fundamentally change transportation in this country. 
+Batteries +Solar +Energy Arbitration

Old-auto stocks are essentially just bonds at this point vs a company with real disruptive growth prospects in multiple industries. I'll keep buying until a 3T valuation and hold till about 4.5/5 in 8 years. 

Hope your bones feel better after Tesla zeros out your puts yet again."
2021-05-12 14:38:29,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I'll have a read as well.
2021-05-12 12:05:29,wallstreetbets,Their cash flow doesn't justify their valuation. Neither does their CEO/Technoking.
2021-05-12 16:50:36,wallstreetbets,"Tesla's shares traded at less than $100 as early as last April. The majority of its income is coming from the sale of regulatory credits to other auto manufacturers, while its actual auto sales have been tenuous at best since 2020. It's newest luxury sedan, The Model S, is priced between $80-150K, while the sale of its regulatory credits have begun to decline along with their production due to chip shortages across the industry. Do you need more common sense arguments here? Tesla is hemorrhaging money more and more each day. Don't even get me started on their balance sheets. How much of their valuation has been speculative this whole time? 60-70%? And now the illustrious CEO thinks he can claim he has aspergers on live TV for clout. 

Sure, this company still has long-term potential, and name brand recognition may carry it a long way in the future, but EV production and adoption is still years away, even with pipelines shutting down all across the US. My catalyst? Why I decided to enter the position? Rising interest rates. Who is going to buy their product when it's too expensive and when nobody needs their regulatory credits anymore? Do you think they will still collect 100% of the premium by the end of Q2? 

So yes, my bones will feel better, especially after I break even on this trade."
2021-05-12 17:08:10,wallstreetbets,"I literally just told you that I will never have a position in TSLA because the price is irrational.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The market is giving us an absolute gift with these inflation numbers, it’s time to load up the truck, PSLV We’ve got a massive overshoot on inflation, coming in at 0.8% month over month versus 0.2% expected.

Annualized that’s a 10% inflation rate.

Year over year core CPI came in at 3%. The last time we had a yearly core CPI at 3% was 1996 and the fed funds rate was 5%, not 0%.  The last time we had monthly core CPI advancing this quickly was 1980.

So what is the reaction among gold and silver, the traditional inflation hedge plays? They are selling off and the dollar is rallying.

Why? The market is now pricing in a 100% chance of a rate hike, despite the insistence of the fed that there won’t be one.

Once they digest that rate hikes won’t happen, this is the next black swan.

Will JPow spit in the face of a market that is fully pricing in a rate hike?  Usually the fed likes to go along with market expectations rather than shock the system.

I believe they won’t raise rates or signal that rate hikes are coming soon.

We still require massive fed and fiscal support to keep the economy and market from crashing, and they will choose the economy over keeping inflation in check.

What happens to the dollar when a 100% priced in expectation doesn’t happen?  Eventually the market is going to realize rates are staying at 0% regardless of inflation.

When this sets in, gold and silver are going to uncharted heights.

Silver is essentially levered gold. Look at my profile and find the stickied SLV post, read past the part bashing SLV and you’ll see silver is the investment to dump 20% of your big boy money into to save yourself this decade.

In most decades equities will massively outperform metals. Every few decades the opposite occurs. In the last two silver bull markets silver outperformed equities by 40x and 25x respectively during their 10 year run ups.

Look at the 50-year cup and handle forming on silver, and tell me it’s not a screaming buy:

&#x200B;

Load up the truck, mortgage the house, buy PSLV

Alternatives: buy physical silver if you don’t care about liquidity (keep premiums below 20%), buy silver miners for even more leverage, buy options on miners for even more leverage. Just don’t touch the scam that is SLV.

Play it how you like, but please, if you have some ‘set it and forget’ type of money, put 20% into gold or silver through the 2020s. You can sell it at the end of the decade if you want to.  This sub has a habit of pure momentum trading, if someone suggests a ticker, every ape looks it up and if it’s already massively green they jump on the train. This is an opportunity to jump on a train before it’s running.

There is very little free floating silver in 1000oz bar form, and the [LBMA just spoofed 10% of it out of existence ](https://www.bullionstar.com/blogs/ronan-manly/lbma-misleads-silver-market-with-false-claims-about-record-silver-stocks/). Look at lumber, rhodium, palladium. That’s what happens when supply runs out and shorts are forced to continuously cover in a commodities market.  This can easily happen in silver.

If you read that article you'll realize that when WSB piled into SLV in early Feb, that actually did nothing because SLV didn't go out buy the silver.  They sold us paper lies and then their authorized participants shorted futures.  We have since learned that SLV is a scam and are buying PSLV and physical.  No more wool over the sheep's eyes.  We are coming for the metal, and taking the little silver that there is.  Banks who are massively net short can come begging later this decade at $500 an oz

Will update with a much longer DD next week!

TLDR: $PSLV on maximum margin (or not on margin, you pick)"
2021-05-12 11:45:05,wallstreetbets,I'm under the impression they can't raise rates because of our massive debt. We would end up paying off only interest without touching principle unless we taxed the crap out of everything but that would lose voters.

How is the market not fucking rattled right now? After the last collapse it took more than a decade to get to rate hikes and the market acted like it was being fucking destroyed even though they had been in a bull run (pretending they didn't make record profits and perform essentially infinite buybacks).

2021-05-12 13:27:57,wallstreetbets,"So get second mortgage on the house, borrow from friends and family, maybe a low interest credit card loan, and then put it all in PSLV, and then margin that up with more PSLV to the greatest amount allowed.  And then check back in 10 years.  Probably will up a fortune.  But......

I will say that I am strongly against margin because the market can move against us for a time, and we don't want to be blown out of our positions.  I recommend against borrowing from anyone unless completely necessary.  Margin is the mistake of inexperienced investors.  Also, I recommend not even opening a margin account (some brokerage firms you have to specifically ask for it not be marginable) because by having a margin account it enables the banksters to short those shares.  I check the short hard to borrow rate periodically on PSLV and, from what I see, there are a lot of shorts in it (which we don't want).  Or you can put in a limit sell order way above the current price, which will cause some brokerage firms to not allow those shares to be sold short.  Buy physical first, and if you have a lot to invest, then buy PSLV in a cash account.  And then sit back and relax and make a slightly less big fortune."

2021-05-12 13:29:07,wallstreetbets,"Your words from your post 1 month ago that had 24k+ upvotes and hundreds of awards:

""The silver market is and has been rigged for years. WSB was never moving into silver. The media got the story wrong.The general theme could be described as this: If banks hold the silver, the price is allowed to rise, but if you hold the silver, the price is forced to fall.""

Guess what silver prices have done for the past 300 years. THEY'VE DECREASED. People stopped using it as currency which was its main reason for having value. ""But products like EVs and smart phones still use silver!"" Yea, but not much, and people have gotten really good at strip mining entire mountains with machinery to get the raw materials they need thus decreasing the price of those raw materials. Originally people were mining silver by hand and panning for gold in rivers. Look at the production rate of silver over the past 50 years. You'll notice that supply quickly caught up with any demand.

Where am I getting all this jargon nonsense bearish silver sentiment from? [https://sdbullion.com/silver-price-history](https://sdbullion.com/silver-price-history) . Go take a look yourself. SGS-ALT inflation adjusted chart shows you all you need to know. People who have been hoarding silver for generations have gotten fucked. That's why every silver stacker I see is an old man losing his fucking hair. If there was enough demand for silver you wouldn't need to encourage people to buy it. It would just go up in price.

Also notice that anytime anyone pro-silver posts a chart of silver price over time it never shows more than 50 years of history? Also notice how its never inflation adjusted? Did you know aluminum  used to be more valuable than gold when it was first being produced? You know what I use aluminum for now? Protecting my $2 baking sheet from my $1/lb chicken breasts.

They have to apply a near perfect combination of monetary control AND messaging to make a controlled descent and avoid a market crash and or hyperinflation. 

There's also the fact that pretty much every other country in the world is in the same position, and if one market collapses it'll domino pretty quickly.

I can't see how it doesn't happen, the only question is how bad will it be."
2021-05-12 12:20:45,wallstreetbets,"One thing I'd like to point out is that the hard miss was thanks to the insanely steep percentage in used cars and trucks CPI. This can most likely be attributed to the chip shortage, which has nothing to do with inflation. Remove this from the average, and numbers look to be very close to estimates."

Next thing you nerds will say is that rare earths are money, and because they're scarce, you'll cause the self fulfilling prophecy of their price rising, and all us consumers will feel the inflation you artificially created by hoarding.

Silver is a pain in the ass because it tarnishes.  It's not money any more so than copper is, please don't hoard copper or nickle either assholes.

TL;DR: Don't be a dick, buy something productive like farmland, and keep it as farmland.  Food inflation is the biggest threat to mankind."

That leaves a shocking great tax hike and an end to deficit spending as the only option to pull money out of the system and control inflation. 

Then it is just a matter for congress to institute policies that reduce the massive debt burden and deleverage the financial sector then get rates to a sustainable level afterwards. Will they have the will to hold the course or will it be back to reckless monetary policy failure for political gain?"

2021-05-12 12:55:56,wallstreetbets,"I'm always up to opposing viewpoints so thank you. 

It's more about the significant miss than anything else. They knew it was going to be a big number over PYs deflationary time, but they didn't forecast for a 0.8% MoM and missed in YoY by a large margin. 

This can be attributed to the auto pop as another commenter said from the chip shortage, however this was a known variable to some extent and should have been reflected in expectations already. 

I am buying calls for eow as well, but overall I am bearish until August at a minimum. This market is running red hot and thus could be the sneeze that starts the leg down. 


I think if yield in the curve gets better, you will have a viable alternative to equities to some extent and then the ""stocks only place to go"" notion is challenged. I believe that has caused the market to run hot (beyond the wild liquidity)

Spy 350p 08/20 in for a bunch.

A smart play in today's dip is commodities. I am jacked beyond the tits in steel gang today. If market sentiment recovers, you're fine with steel as the prices due to demand and supply issues are there. If inflation is here to stay, then you're on a beach sipping a fucking pina colada for the rest of your days"

I've noticed for a while that the market seems completely divorced from reality as well (e.g. I see so many companies having great earnings/great news/etc and still have drops in price). It's like everyone stopped trading based on reality and people are only trading based on speculation and expectations of the future at this point, which will sooner or later end in disaster imo."

If they don’t raise rates gold rises and you make money on gold and lose some on the puts (or make money on them because the market won’t accept fed rates).

2021-05-12 15:48:03,wallstreetbets,"Which, because of the cash settlement, is a huge difference??

If JPM expects people to settle in cash constantly, they don’t have to have physical silver backing the futures. They can also spoof the price into oblivion to try to force people to settle in cash.

The last thing they want is people realizing there’s not as much physical silver as was thought, leading to a “silver run” like a bank run where everyone now demands delivery on their contracts, further straining the tight physical supply.

Once it’s out that they don’t have it... price 🌋"

Regardless of whether it has to do with Citadel or any hedge funds it is still a bad investment unless a 300 year trend line is about to change. Production far outpaces any demand even with EVs and smart phones. Ever notice how pro-silver people never show inflation adjusted prices or charts that look back further than 50 years? There is a reason to that. Silver has been on a downtrend for 300 years.

2021-05-12 14:41:08,wallstreetbets,"Bro are you serious Lolol. Yes I know it’s been declining on an inflation-adjusted basis for years, that’s the whole crux of the “silver is manipulated by banks to cover for inflation argument”. Thus, the whole point is that the paper price of silver you are quoting is wrong and not at all symbolic of the true price of physical silver on the free market.

Also you say production far outstrips demand and then show a production vs. price graph??! 

Not the same thing, industrial demand is stable around 70% of annual production.... which leaves 30% of annual production for any retail use, jewelry, investments, etc. 

Definitely not desperate as I just joined the silver movement at the start of this year, not some 60 year old bag holder.

You clearly don’t want to have your mind changed since you’re dropping misleading sources to prove unrelated statements but in case I’m wrong hit me in my DMs man."
2021-05-12 14:39:18,wallstreetbets,"That's the whole point, my man! Silver is so grossly undervalued due to manipulation in the price through the futures market. But that market is likely going to break as people demand physical silver. Its literally only this cheap because of manipulation, which means you can buy it at a HUUUUGE discount!"
2021-05-12 14:46:52,wallstreetbets,"And you're betting on a 300 year trend changing because....? Have banks been manipulating silver for 300 years? If you can give me any evidence as to why silver is suddenly more valuable and production can't keep up with demand I'm all ears.

Aluminum used to be worth more than gold when it was first produced. Now whats it worth? But demand for aluminum is everywhere! Yea it is, and often its super cheap to mass produce something when there is a lot of demand for it."
2021-05-12 14:47:51,wallstreetbets,So its been manipulated for 300 years? When was the last time you paid for anything in silver?
2021-05-12 15:40:02,wallstreetbets,"I see your point but feel differently for a few reason:

1) we didn’t have the internet throughout the history of silver like we do now (more specifically for the last 110 years or so of bank manipulation), thus the common man couldn’t communicate and collaborate as easily as now (I.e. GME squeeze wasn’t possible even 5-10 years ago as people weren’t all over on Reddit, Twitter, etc.)

2) silver production is largely a byproduct of other resource mining at this point, mostly due to the low price but also due to the fact that it’s a fringe ore that is usually found peripherally to other metals like gold, iron, aluminum, etc.

Therefore, when price skyrockets and/or demand skyrockets it’s not as simple as just “opening new mines”. There is a significant delay between exploration and development before production/release of silver. The production has recently started tapering in recent months/years as the lag between no new mines being opened in the past years and the supply effects catches up. 

In the coming years, due to inelastic industrial demand, skyrocketing inflation, and increased retail investment demand, I believe the banks paper silver game will finally be exposed (they don’t have the physical silver they pretend to, and they’re deathly afraid of getting caught with their pants down) and there will be a significant lag before silver production is able to be meaningfully increased...

Silver = 🌙

While PSLV and physical silver is the backbone of this movement, if you’re an ape that demands a riskier move in return for a possibly higher reward...

AG, SILJ, other silver miner stocks are all good...

As are options in those stocks for the highest risk/highest reward plays."
2021-05-12 17:08:11,wallstreetbets,"Well, the 300-year trend has to do with mining technology getting better. It only went ""down"" because they were able to take more of it out of the ground."
2021-05-12 16:50:50,wallstreetbets,"1. You are correct, the internet provides a faster flow of information than in previous time periods. It has sped up *both* the flow of information and misinformation.
2. Silver being a byproduct of other mining; how much silver will already be extracted as a byproduct of other new mining projects such as the increased demand for both lithium and cobalt mining for EVs?"
2021-05-12 15:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Additionally, your graph of the 300 year drop is skewed as it’s hard to measure in dollars when the government that produces them wasn’t even around until about 1781.

We don’t look at 300 year graphs for literally any other investment so why this one?

Now if you want to talk 1900 on (120+ years) that makes sense and yes I believe the banks have been manipulating them that whole time.

Happy Hawaiian actually had a fantastic post outlining how the removal of silver as money (and eventually the ending of the gold standard) are long-standing mechanisms of the 1% elite to keep building their wealth while eroding the 99%s wealth through paper inflation"
2021-05-12 17:17:23,wallstreetbets,"This is essentially my argument. Price is dictated by both supply and demand. Sure demand has gone up, especially if more silver is needed for EVs, but supply could go up just as quickly IMO."

Colonial able to resume the pipeline this evening. This negates the hedge on gas prices. Please keep a close eye on UGA if you purchased. 


I am sure everyone is aware of the pipeline situation in the East Coast. The current situation on the ground is becoming severe in certain states. Huge lines at stations. Most stations in major cities have zero gas. Data below shows the number of gas stations without gas in the southeast.

Colonial is going to have a crucial test tonight to see if the pipeline will reopen on Friday. I am sceptical.

United States Gas is a solid play today. Prices goes up the fund goes up. Call premiums at $1.15. Volume of shares traded at 115k a day. That isn't a typo. 115k. Not million.

Nobody likes to see rising gas prices. However if it is going to happen let's profit. If everything turns out fine we close position. Break even.

* Q1 Average Daily USD Volume $2.10B
* Q2 (so far) Average Daily USD Volume $2.25B (+7%)

To provide recurring updates on [my previous DD and research](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mua3vo/coinbase_the_volume_dd/), we look at Coinbase Pro's daily USD trading volume to estimate Coinbase's Q2 guidance which should be unveiled in the earnings call on Thursday.

It's previously reported that Coinbase is expected to make $1.8 billion revenue and $800 million profits for Q1. But all eyes are on Q2. We'll assume these Q1 numbers stay true. Regardless, I think this earnings call will boom or bust $COIN because listeners are more curious about Q2 and 2021 forecasts. It could bust if management underestimates Q2 (and maybe 2021) purely for risk mitigation and ""under promise, over deliver"" bullshit

So far Q2 USD trade volume has risen 7%. Running the analysis everyday, I've seen it fall -5% (vs. Q1) before the recent surge in volume. So naturally we can possibly expect Q2 revenue guidance to fall in the range of $1.71B - $1.92B (we can estimate Q2 profits will be $710 million - $920 million). We'll see how accurate this estimate is come Thursday evening.

&#x200B;

As for my 2021 forecast, it really depends on how you think volume will contract.

50 forward PE is aggressive when Paypal's is 54 forward PE. 40 forward PE is a bit more conservative if coinbases's growth opportunities aren't as substantial

Have moderately scaled my position since previous DD. My buying power is still a pinch (curse CRSP and AFRM), but I'm hoping to scale to 100 shares by Q2 end as volume continues to remain healthy

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Inovio Pharmaceuticals vaccine does NOT need cold storage and works against most variants! INOVIOs Pan-COVID-19 Vaccine Candidate (INO-4802) Induces Broad Immunity Against Major Viral Variants in Preclinical Studies 8:00 AM ET 5/12/21 | Dow Jones

 INOVIO's Pan-SARS-CoV-2 vaccine candidate INO-4802 is not matched to a single variant, unlike other variant vaccines in development; INO-4802 could potentially offer broader immune responses  
   
PLYMOUTH MEETING, Pa., May 12, 2021 /PRNewswire/ -- INOVIO (NASDAQ:INO), a biotechnology company focused on bringing to market precisely designed DNA medicines to treat and protect people from infectious diseases, cancer, and HPV-associated diseases, today announced that its next-generation Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, INO-4802, induced potent neutralizing antibodies and T cell responses against the original Wuhan strain as well as against B.1.1.7 (UK variant), B.1.351 (South African variant) and P.1. (Brazilian variant) in preclinical models. These results demonstrate the potential of INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine to induce cross-reactive immune responses against current and emerging viral variants as either a first-line vaccine, or potentially as a boost for individuals previously immunized with various Wuhan-matched vaccines.  


Dr. Laurent M. Humeau, INOVIO's Chief Scientific Officer, said, ""INOVIO is taking a dual-track approach in developing a COVID-19 vaccine because we recognize the need to support both pandemic and endemic considerations. In addition to our work on INO-4800, which we expect to enter a global Phase 3 trial this summer, we are also developing our next-generation Pan-COVID-19 variant vaccine, INO-4802, which is designed to protect against current and potentially future variants of concern. The study data we report today confirms our two-tiered development path is the best strategy for the short- and long-term fight against this virus.""  


First-generation COVID-19 vaccines were matched against the original Wuhan strain. These vaccines may have reduced efficacy against emerging COVID variants. In response, many of the next-generation vaccines under development are matched to a single variant currently circulating. INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine approach is designed to provide cross-strain protection, immune coverage, reduced susceptibility to escape mutants, and non-restricted geographical use against both known and potentially unknown variants. Preclinical data with INO-4802 in multiple models revealed both broader and increased levels of neutralizing antibodies against a panel of variants than strain-matched vaccines. Building on this initial work, INOVIO plans to conduct Phase 1/2 clinical trials this year with INO-4802.  


To create INOVIO's Pan-COVID-19 vaccine candidate, variant sequences were identified over a four-month period starting in October 2020 from multiple geographic regions (Brazil, Canada, India, Italy, Japan, Nigeria, South Africa, United Kingdom, and the United States). Mutations in the spike sequences were aggregated for each region. The sequence results from these regions were then further engineered to determine a common set of overlapping mutations from emerging variations in the COVID spike protein sequences to generate INO-4802.  


More information from this pre-clinical study can be found in the paper entitled: ""Design and immunogenicity of a Pan-SARS-CoV-2 synthetic DNA vaccine,"" which has been published as a preprint in BioRxiv prior to peer review."
2021-05-12 10:48:54,wallstreetbets,"Joseph Kim , Inovio CEO : ""Let me make this clear ino-4800 is still main priority to commercialize to market, 4802 is a better 2nd vaccine and booster… 2 Covid vaccines. 4800 is p3 ready and 4802 will be fast tracked"""

TL:DR Phase 1-3 takes up to 7 years.  Post Clinical and manufacturing inspection -another 1+ years. Post Approval -another year.  Total: up to 10 years for a drug to make it to market.  The attrition rate at each phase leaves maybe a 5% of drugs making it to market.  New cancer drug approval rates are less than 3%.  Cost: $1-1.5 Billion.  And the kicker?  Frequently a bio that appears to find a promising molecule is bought by a big pharma somewhere in the process screwing shareholders out of their big payday."

INO has a game changing Technology for saving millions of life in the future. I do not understand why at WSB nobody is really supporting a try for a short squeeze. Here is enough capital to make this come true
2021-05-12 09:12:34,wallstreetbets,"How have they missed the boat when only 9% of the entire world is vaccinated?

Probably not have anything to market until 2023, most people will be vaccinated and the production/distribution of the other vaccines will be much farther along. Even if they get something out in market by 2022 they’ll still have the massive production issue most of the other companies have already had to face. They’re so much farther behind competitors I’m not sure having a superior product will make a difference. Countries want to results NOW not in 2-3 years.

The first just completed Phase 2 and is about to enter P3 in China and in other countries. This may be commercialized and available in the market before end of year with an EUA in China or other countries. Way before the 2022 timeline that you reference. INO-4802 will be fast tracked and benefit from INO-4800 commercialization and clinical trials that prove safety and efficacy.

I have doubts that a small company out of Pennsylvania will be able to manufacture and deliver a large quantity, especially being so behind. Even if they get something to market by September which is think is unlikely they’re almost a full year behind the big players who have way more resources and capital available to them."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I analyzed 9000+ trades made by U.S Congress Members in the last two years and benchmarked it against S&P500. Here are the results. **Preamble:** The ability of Congress Members to trade stocks have been controversial from the start. The 2020 congressional [insider trading scandal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2020_congressional_insider_trading_scandal) where Congress Members used insider knowledge to trade large positions in stocks just before the coronavirus pandemic crash was just one example where they used their privileged position for gain.  While there is scope for a lot of discussion regarding the legality/ethical aspects of this, what I wanted to know is 

**Did Congress Members beat the market and can I beat the market if I follow their trades after its been made public?** 

**Where is the data from:** senatestockwatcher.com

Massive shoutout to u/rambat1994 for putting in the efforts to create this site and make the knowledge public. The website has data of Senator trading from 2019. While I could observe that all the trades may not be captured by the site, given that we have more than 9K trades to work with, I feel that we should be good from a statistical significance perspective. Also, please note that the data will contain trades done by Congress who are not currently in the senate (Either they were in Senate earlier and now in the house of representative or another position of power which forces them to disclose their trades) 

While Congress members are supposed to [report the transaction within 30 days](https://www.citizen.org/article/personal-financial-disclosure-requirements-for-public-officials/), the median delay in reporting that I observed for the trades was 28 days and the average delay was 52 days. There were some outliers that pushed the average up and are most likely due to the fact that their broker might not report the trade to them immediately. 

All the trades and my analysis are shared as a google sheet at the end. 

**Analysis:**

**Distribution of Trades**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/kh4ythn8roy61.png?width=410&format=png&auto=webp&s=c054d4e698ab159a8b4fdd3cdaa88e8a3ea2fb43)

A total of 9,676 trades were made by the Congress Members in the past two years. This analysis would be focusing on the stock purchases made the Congress. (The stock sales and the pandemic controversy can be a standalone analysis by itself). Out of the 4,911 Buy’s what I am really interested in is the 1,375 transactions which were over $15K. I decided this cutoff as I did not want small transactions (<5K) to affect the analysis. The hypothesis being that if someone is putting almost 10% of their annual salary into one trade, they should be very confident about the stock. (I know that some Congress members are millionaires and this hypothesis would not apply to them, but adding their net worth would again complicate the calculations unnecessarily)

**Results:** For all the stock purchases I calculated the stock price change across 3 periods and benchmarked it against S&P500 returns during the same period. 

a. One Month 

b. One Quarter 

c. Till Date (From the date of purchase to Today)

**Returns of Congress Members vs S&P500**

https://preview.redd.it/j5lejvpdroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=4edea1cb42cac7ecab4e9e6c5b034ace5d9ac566

At this point, it should not come as a surprise, but Congress members did beat SP500 across the different time periods. But what I am really interested in is if it's possible to follow their trades after disclosure (after a time lag of 30 days) and still beat the benchmark. 

**Returns if you followed their trades**

https://preview.redd.it/rnuw3kyhroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=84ea3a1ab53fd502a2968939891bd11e9da84c8a

If you had invested in the stocks Congress Members bought, even after adjusting for the lag of disclosure, you would beat SP500 over the long run. My theory for this is that Senators usually play the long game and invest having a time horizon of more than a year as sudden short-term gains can put a spotlight on their trades. This gives the retail investors a window of opportunity where they can follow the trades and make a significant profit. 

Now that our main question is out of the way, we can really deep dive into the data and see some interesting patterns. The next question I wanted answered was which were the best trades made by Congress Members over the last 2 years. 

**Best trades made by U.S Congress Members**  


[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0xatcb5rroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=d157bba30bcd309db66bd51ababcf36e7c76710c)

Brian Mast seems to be the frontrunner with making almost 100% gain in one month investing in lesser-known companies. Michael Garcia also seems to have made it rain with his Tesla plays. But not all the trades made by Congress Members were successful as shown below. 

**Worst trades made by U.S Congress Members**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/dfsg5lksroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=83c41517d7299e6b62cbd6dfa1bbdf42a672d750)

These are the worst trades made by Congress Members with Greg losing more than 80% of investment value within the disclosure period. Brain Mast also makes an appearance in the worst trades making him a prime candidate for some WSB loss porn.  

But even Warren Buffet can go wrong on a stock pick. So, I wanted to know was who made the most returns over all their investments in the last 2 years. I only considered Congress Members having at least $100K in investments and a minimum of 5 trades. 

**U.S Congress Members having the highest returns**  

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/7yk3wa4wroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=9ad6ae5de91e6ec8ade045378e72983dee356b0c)

John Curtis made a whopping 95% average return on his investments. All the top 10 Congress Members comfortably beat the market return of 26.4% during the same investment period. Next thing I looked is the Congress Members that had the most amount of money invested in stocks during the last 2 years.

**U.S Congress Members having the highest amount invested in stocks**

https://preview.redd.it/x4vb26xxroy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=c34019c2a724babc40a9823ec513e7a69e562aaf

The top 3 Congress Members as shown above invested more than $15MM over the last 2 years and were also able to beat the market at the same time.

Finally, this leads us to the last question of which were the most popular stocks among U.S Congress Members 

**Most popular stocks among US Congress**

[  ](https://preview.redd.it/t4vv63s1soy61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=327b56f8cbfff8465b09e797272a45ccde46429c)

As expected, big tech dominates the investments but what was surprising was the skew of investment towards Microsoft which had more money invested in it than the rest of the top 9 put together. One important thing to note here is that except for Antero, the rest all the companies have $100B+ valuation. 

**Limitations of analysis:** There are multiple limitations to the analysis.

a. The time period of analysis is 2 years on which the market experienced a significant bull run. So, the results might change in market downturn/recession 

b. The data has been sourced from senatestockwatcher.com as parsing the data from the official government site is extremely difficult. All the recorded transactions have a pdf of the disclosure linked to it (you can find it in the Google sheet). I have made my best effort to QC the data and make sure there are no false positives. But this might not contain all the transactions made by Congress Members. 

c. There is no disclosure for the exact amount of money invested by Congress Members. The disclosure is always in ranges (e.g., $100k – $200k). So, for calculating the investment amount, I have taken the average of the given range. 

**Conclusion:** 

This analysis proves that Congress Members indeed get a better return than the overall market. Whether it is due to insider trading or due to their superior stock-picking capability is something that can’t be proven from the data and is left to the reader's judgment. I intentionally left out the party affiliation of the Congress Members as I felt that it would bias the reader and was not the objective of this analysis.

Whichever side of the political spectrum you lean-to, the above analysis shows that you get to gain by following their trades!

2. calculate Sharpe ratio of the portfolio and compare to S&P500
3. calculate upside/downside capture
4. regress the portfolio against different factors to calculate alpha and exposure to different market risk factors (such as fama french -- commonly used)

2021-05-12 17:56:29,wallstreetbets,"Legally, what they did in 2020 was not insider trading.  For it to be insider trading, the information has to be nonpublic.  Anyone who listened to the This Week In Virology podcast heard about SARS-CoV-2 in January, and their first episode of February was literally titled ""2020: The Year of Coronavirus"".  As should surprise absolutely no one, those who rely on traditional media were the last to know.  And even when told, most of them told people to shut up about it and stop fearmongering.  Because most people are stupid.  That doesn't make it criminal to be informed.  What would have happened if those Senators told people COVID-19 was coming?  They would have been told to shut up because they were fearmongering.  We know that because thats exactly what happened when they told people."

2021-05-12 17:47:13,wallstreetbets,Because many employ brokers/advisors who trade on their account with discretion. Allowing the member of Congress to report upon receipt of regular monthly statements (containing the official record of transaction) is a reasonable allowance.

2021-05-12 13:50:20,wallstreetbets,"I get your hesitance, this place gets manipulated by big and small — but hear me out.

I’m a regular guy, and I’d been working on something in parallel to this for months back in the winter. The data comes from public filings that go into a system called Edgar. Congress are the closest things we have to psychic’s, that’s what this comes down to imo — I was sitting here wondering about my investments one day, stewing about some private lossporn I’d made and I wondered “who? Who knows? I’m sick of guessing”. Nobody knows, but out of all the nobodies, congress knows the most. They set the rules, they hear whispers of what company is going to get things like antitrust violations or whatever before anyone else does. In a world of guesses, “they” might be making the most educated guesses.

But when I looked, I saw so much loss porn, it was crazy. The guy who made the system above (the tracker) posted a great one a month or so ago when I first noticed his work. It was a story about someone who’d bought Tesla a few years back, then took losses for an entire year. What did he do? He doubled down like a fucking ape. Good job, right? Then he holds it for more losses and sells it a month before a yearlong bullrun on the stock. It was the most embarrassing thing I’ve ever seen.

I have no doubt there’s good data in there, and I think these guys are absolutely onto something. Hell, I’ve made a few trades based on the data I saw initially, like overall congress LOVES General Electric. When I saw that I realized they hold so much GE that they clearly aren’t going to sanction it into the ground for anything. 

The main problem I saw with this was the filing delay. We get the data too late and you’re right that we can absolutely be manipulated by this into being bag holders though. 

What I will say is that I’m going to look harder at Microsoft right now, as they seem to love it and they might know something I don’t 🤷🏻‍♂️"

While I'm sure this post took a lot of effort, its borderline worthless. There are definitely corrupt people in congress but they aren't getting rich from insider trading besides possibly a few outliers. They get rich from a lot of different revenue streams that are controversial, like closed door meetings and lobbying contributions. For example turbotax only spends about $2 million a year to prevent the IRS from just doing our taxes free and automatically. This money only ends up being a few hundred bucks to a few thousand but it works."

2021-05-12 13:05:14,wallstreetbets,Sell. Shit almost always drops right before earnings. Take your money
2021-05-12 13:07:34,wallstreetbets,Take the profits man. Don't get greedy. Take it. Not financial advice. The choice is yours.
2021-05-12 13:08:12,wallstreetbets,Sell

2021-05-12 13:12:54,wallstreetbets,If only there was some sort of object that you could use to help you make a binary decision. Maybe a sort of metal disc or something....
2021-05-12 13:24:55,wallstreetbets,sell that crap. I can't begin to tell you how sorry you will be if you don't profit take while you're ahead

2021-05-12 14:30:09,wallstreetbets,Nice bro. I would sell. Walking away with money is always a win. Earnings calls and stock have been so over the place lately I would expect it to drop (Not that I don't have confidence in Coinbase) but with the way the markets been this week I'd take the win and go.
2021-05-12 14:38:30,wallstreetbets,Please sell
2021-05-12 14:39:56,wallstreetbets,You seem to be the one and only person on WSB who has actually made a profit out of PLTR so you must be on a lucky hot streak

2021-05-12 16:39:38,wallstreetbets,Not looking at gains but that ARKF call is upsetting me a lot. 😂

2021-05-12 18:30:22,wallstreetbets,These earnings are different. Gonna be nutz. Their balance sheets are in kryptonite

2021-05-12 19:26:42,wallstreetbets,"Bro, how the fuck did you make money on a PLTR call."
2021-05-12 08:55:03,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-05-12 13:06:19,wallstreetbets,Take your trust fund money brags elsewhere. COIN was never under $250 so you bought ITM calls that were expensive.
2021-05-12 09:56:51,wallstreetbets,"Earnings will be good, I don't know if that's going to move the price up or down, but the stock is undervalued so I'm not selling regardless of what may or may not happen in the short run."
2021-05-12 10:28:55,wallstreetbets,I would scale out some shares and hold like half.

2021-05-12 10:00:34,wallstreetbets,Sage advice lol. I sold half of the 6/25 calls this morning to cover costs. Probably will sell a couple more before closing time.
2021-05-12 09:00:29,wallstreetbets,Sell 7 June calls.

2021-05-12 19:54:04,wallstreetbets,I would sell so you should probably hold
2021-05-12 14:08:47,wallstreetbets,This is solid logic right here.
2021-05-12 18:09:36,wallstreetbets,Solid advice
2021-05-12 09:15:45,wallstreetbets,You don’t know where I’ve been Lou!!!
2021-05-12 09:16:16,wallstreetbets,It’s already priced in. After earnings trade volatility is probably just due to the volatility of short term aggressive positions right before and after earnings due to people betting.
2021-05-12 11:53:47,wallstreetbets,Telltale to RBLX
2021-05-12 19:22:40,wallstreetbets,And IV dies after nothing happens to the price

2021-05-12 11:05:21,wallstreetbets,Can you cover my costs as well?
2021-05-12 18:52:43,wallstreetbets,Thats what I did pretty much. Sold 7 of them and kept 3. I’ll live dangerously through tomorrow but took out my buy in and then some.
2021-05-12 08:50:05,wallstreetbets,You just buy them and hold them till they expire
2021-05-12 09:34:53,wallstreetbets,There’s google. You should be able to learn anything in this modern age.
2021-05-12 10:14:09,wallstreetbets,If you can't google shit then don't fucking bother trading

2021-05-12 16:21:21,wallstreetbets,what do you think its real value is? how much do you think it should go up from 381?? look at how much it makes.
2021-05-12 18:13:03,wallstreetbets,How are you doing bud?
2021-05-12 14:02:14,wallstreetbets,Tell me too.

2021-05-12 14:16:29,wallstreetbets,"I have a similar issue, except it seems to be whatever I buy tanks.  I've thought about setting up a service where people venmo me cash with a ticker and I then buy the stock with the cash.  When it drops, I sell and return the remaining cash.  If it goes up I sell and return the original cash plus the gains minus 30% for taxes.  Since it always tanks you just use whichever method you want to bet against the ticker and profit."

I then proceed to hold and they usually eventually give me returns, like months later after they slowly claw their way up from the initial drop.  If I day traded it wouldn't be investing, it would be losing.  I'm just offering others to take advantage of my apparent bad karma.  I must have done something real shitty in a past life, because this one I've been pretty good."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"""But I will have proof I warned."" EDIT: Want to put this at the top:

>... requiring that you get the timing right is overreach. If the hurdle for calling a bubble is set too high, so that you must call the top precisely, you will never try. And that condemns you to ride over the cliff every cycle, along with the great majority of investors and managers.

I really wanted to explore the mechanics behind warnings and why we ignore them. This is nothing too crazy, but I feel like it couldn't hurt to remind traders and discuss how our minds can sometimes lead us into danger despite warnings.

[The Psychology of Warnings](https://www.visualexpert.com/Resources/psychwarnings.html)

>Warning signs and labels are everywhere. Many factors are conspiring to fill the world with more injunctions against our desired behavior. Daily life is increasing in complexity while technology continually invents more powerful machines, drugs and chemicals. Moreover, the cost of injury and insurance as well as accompanying litigation is spiraling upward rapidly. As a result, failures of warning compliance cause costly social and economic impact.  
>  
>Unfortunately, warnings often fail to change people's behavior. Either the warning goes unnoticed, or, as increasingly happens, the warning is seen but ignored  
>  
>...  
>  
>**Factors Affecting Compliance**  
>  
>*1. Cost of Compliance*  
>  
>Many studies have found that warning signs are more likely to be ineffective if the cost of compliance is high. Reducing compliance costs is a very effective way to increase safety, but it is necessary to understand where the viewer's costs arise. Recall that the viewer has a goal in mind when using a device or navigating an environment. The costs relate to the ability to achieve the goal as quickly and as easily as possible.

&#x200B;

>*2. Danger Perception*  
>  
>Viewer history with the product or environment strongly affects danger perception. The greater the experience with no negative outcome, the lower the level of perceived danger. This is the ""cry wolf"" or ""familiarization"" effect, where people quit paying attention to uninformative input. The effect can be both specific to a particular product (a single drug) or can generalize to all similar products (same type of drugs) or to the warnings source (""those government do-gooders are at it again!"" or ""The company is just covering itself."")  
>  
>One of the ironies of warnings is that the more experienced and skilled the viewer, the stronger the familiarization effect and the more likely that the warning will be ignored.  
>  
>...

* Stonks go up. Printers go brrr. In Powell we trust.

&#x200B;

>Warning Appearance  
>  
>Marshall McLuhan's famous aphorism, ""the medium is the message,"" applies to warning labels. The physical appearance of the warning may inadvertently communicate hazard severity. Most people have unconsciously learned the general rule that signs and signals grow in size and vividness with their importance, presumably so that they will be more readily seen. Viewers will then likely interpret warnings that are small, faint, or located peripherally as signaling lower risk.

* We want Michael Burry's tendies, but we don't actually want to be anything like Michael Burry.

&#x200B;

>*3. Decision Making*  
>  
>Risk Taking  
>  
>When the viewer ignores a warning, it could be because s/he viewed the cost of compliance as very high or because s/he underestimated the danger. However, studies show that some people engage in risky actions across a wide variety of circumstances. They likely have a high tolerance for risk rather than a tendency to underestimate danger in specific circumstances. Moreover, these risk takers were less likely to comply with warnings. In fact, the prospect of danger may decrease their compliance because the viewer's goal might involve courting danger.

&#x200B;

>Social Factors  
>  
>We live in a social context, so other people affect individual notions of norms, standards and acceptable behavior. It is not surprising, that degree of viewer behavior may be affected by whether other people are complying with the warning.

# THE WARNINGS

We've all seen [Burry's warning](https://preview.redd.it/ayle13a8wxi61.png?auto=webp&s=b6fdf9e18007a1a85311a8c634f1ea2febe92063):

>People say I didn't warn last time. I did, but no one listened. So I warn this time. And still, no one listens. But I will have proof I warned.

^(truly regarded)

[Here's](https://twitter.com/burryarchive?lang=en) an archive of some of Burry's tweets.

&#x200B;

Below are some bits from an [article](https://www.gmo.com/americas/research-library/waiting-for-the-last-dance/) by [Jeremy Grantham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeremy_Grantham) (Made $265 mil on MVIS lol so he's only sorta 🌈)

&#x200B;

>All bubbles end with near universal acceptance that the current one will not end yet…because. Because in 1929 the economy had clicked into “a permanently high plateau”; because Greenspan’s Fed in 2000 was predicting an enduring improvement in productivity and was pledging its loyalty (or moral hazard) to the stock market; because Bernanke believed in 2006 that “U.S. house prices merely reflect a strong U.S. economy” as he perpetuated the moral hazard: if you win you’re on your own, but if you lose you can count on our support. Yellen, and now Powell, maintained this approach. All three of Powell’s predecessors claimed that the asset prices they helped inflate in turn aided the economy through the wealth effect. Which effect we all admit is real. But all three avoided claiming credit for the ensuing market breaks that inevitably followed: the equity bust of 2000 and the housing bust of 2008, each replete with the accompanying anti-wealth effect that came when we least needed it, exaggerating the already guaranteed weakness in the economy. This game surely is the ultimate deal with the devil.  
>  
>Now once again the high prices this time will hold because…interest rates will be kept around nil forever, in the ultimate statement of moral hazard – the asymmetrical market risk we have come to know and depend on. The mantra of late 2020 was that engineered low rates can prevent a decline in asset prices. Forever! But of course, it was a fallacy in 2000 and it is a fallacy now. In the end, moral hazard did not stop the Tech bubble decline, with the NASDAQ falling 82%. Yes, 82%! Nor, in 2008, did it stop U.S. housing prices declining all the way back to trend and below – which in turn guaranteed first, a shocking loss of over eight trillion dollars of perceived value in housing; second, an ensuing weakness in the economy; and third, a broad rise in risk premia and a broad decline in global asset prices (see Exhibit 1). All the promises were in the end worth nothing, except for one; the Fed did what it could to pick up the pieces and help the markets get into stride for the next round of enhanced prices and ensuing decline. And here we are again, waiting for the last dance and, eventually, for the music to stop.  
>  
>...  
>  
>Either way, the market is now checking off all the touchy-feely characteristics of a major bubble. The most impressive features are the intensity and enthusiasm of bulls, the breadth of coverage of stocks and the market, and, above all, the rising hostility toward bears. In 1929, to be a bear was to risk physical attack and guarantee character assassination. For us, 1999 was the only experience we have had of clients reacting as if we were deliberately and maliciously depriving them of gains. In comparison, 2008 was nothing. But in the last few months the hostile tone has been rapidly ratcheting up. The irony for bears though is that it’s exactly what we want to hear. It’s a classic precursor of the ultimate break; together with stocks rising, not for their fundamentals, but simply because they are rising.  
>  
>...  
>  
>So, here we are again. I expect once again for my bubble call to meet my modest definition of success: at some future date, whenever that may be, it will have paid for you to have ducked from midsummer of 2020. But few professional or individual investors will have been able to have ducked. The combination of timing uncertainty and rapidly accelerating regret on the part of clients means that the career and business risk of fighting the bubble is too great for large commercial enterprises. They can never put their full weight behind bearish advice even if the P/E goes to 65x as it did in Japan. The nearest any of these giant institutions have ever come to offering fully bearish advice in a bubble was UBS in 1999, whose position was nearly identical to ours at GMO. That is to say, somewhere between brave and foolhardy. Luckily for us though, they changed their tack and converted to a fully invested growth stock recommendation at UBS Brinson and its subsidiary, Phillips & Drew, in February 2000, just before the market peak. This took out the 800-pound gorilla that would otherwise have taken most of the rewards for stubborn contrariness. So, don't wait for the Goldmans and Morgan Stanleys to become bearish: it can never happen. For them it is a horribly non-commercial bet. Perhaps it is for anyone. Profitable and risk-reducing for the clients, yes, but commercially impractical for advisors. Their best policy is clear and simple: always be extremely bullish. It is good for business and intellectually undemanding. It is appealing to most investors who much prefer optimism to realistic appraisal, as witnessed so vividly with COVID. And when it all ends, you will as a persistent bull have overwhelming company. This is why you have always had bullish advice in a bubble and always will.

&#x200B;

Of course, the million tendie question is when? My advice? Just keep hedging.

&#x200B;

positions:

UVXY 5c 5/14

SRTY 12c 8/20

SDOW 9c 9/17

SQQQ 15c 9/15

&#x200B;

TLDR: People like to ignore warnings when it's inconvenient to abide and/or due to social pressure. This is not a post to talk you into going bear - this is just a post to remind and encourage you to practice risk management and to always properly hedge."

2021-05-12 09:25:41,wallstreetbets,"Naturally you left out a major flaw in your analysis. Every bubble that you remember is based on a posthumous view of it.

How about the required return on an investment is based on comparatives. The 10 year yield in 1980 was around 12%, by 1990 at around 9%, by 2000 at around 5.5%, by 2010 around 3.5% and by 2020 around 1.5%.

This is a 40 year trend in the interest rates starting from the end of the high inflation and rising interest rates of the 1970's that followed going off the gold standard a few years earlier. So in many ways the beginning of our current economy.

If you look at the PE multiple for the SP500 since 1980 you will see it has overall gone up. In fact the PE ratio during the 1920's was never particularly high. Regardless the PE ratios should probably be higher then compared to earlier times, given long-term interest rate trends (to near zero).

If we are in a bubble, I would suggest that perhaps the market is 10-15% overvalued, which is not a big deal. Further, with higher inflation and interest rates staying low, perhaps that PE ratio is justified in going up a little more as inflation should increase the long-term cash flows.

Basically, the idea of a bubble currently is based on historical trends but ignores very real economic differences that might make the current market overall fairly valued. Of course if interest rates can get closer to or even exceed the inflation rate, perhaps we should expect money to flow from equities to bonds as the required return on stocks would then increase, but that is not the case now. If you think of investing as a perpetual series of cash flows then a lot of this makes more sense. For existing investment your cash flow is essentially locked in, for new money invested you choose between options based on future cash flows."

How can you create a vaccine against a virus that doesn't exist? How is blackberry playing god here while other cybersecurity companies don't go around making this kind of absurd claims? or is this a fraud? please help .

2021-05-12 08:29:05,wallstreetbets,"So their stuff is pretty cutting edge and I'm a customer of one of their security AI products for consumers called Cylance; It's pretty sweet. 

The TLDR is vaguely that instead of scanning everything for ALL the known threats (like traditional antivirus) it seeks to use the AI to classify malware independent of a dataset. If a new virus rolls past your normal antivirus, it likely won't recognize it because it isn't in the dataset. If a new malware goes past BB security AI, it can detect and destroy it. Other than the benefit to catch new threats, it also saves TONS of energy and processing power."
2021-05-12 11:04:24,wallstreetbets,"This is not fraud or BB playing god. Cylance (now BlackBerry) uses AI to train the algorithm that detects/prevents malware. BlackBerry Protect (the anti-malware product) uses that algorithm instead of signatures that need to be created after an initial malware sample is collected. When a new malware sample comes out, such as DarkSide, BlackBerry runs that sample against previous versions of the detection algorithm to see how far back the algorithm would have detected/prevented that piece of malware."
2021-05-12 08:09:28,wallstreetbets,You can detect cyber attacks... while preventing them
2021-05-12 08:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Security protocols can be addressed/written that will apply to numerous versions or types of attacks. Most attacks fall into a few categories, so if they created a robust enough product, it could be strong enough to prevent years worth of variations or versions."
2021-05-12 09:11:06,wallstreetbets,"Modern cyber security AI monitors in real time to see what the user & programs on the PC are doing. This way they can both block invalid users by monitoring if they use the mouse too fast, type too fast or other characteristics that the normal user would not do. It could also see if an SW acts out of line/not as expected and block it before the malware can manifest itself. So what Blackberry is most likely saying is that their old version was intelligent enough to identify the threat and neutralize it even without ever seeing that specific variant before.

Old AV programs used to look at specific malware to identify them and once that was done they'd push that signature to all AVs/PCs. Hence they'd be able to detect them but not slightly modified variants, this method is still used by the legacy AVs."

2021-05-12 08:57:29,wallstreetbets,"Blackberry has spent the last 20 years working on their software rather than producing mobile devices that are half-assed when it comes to security. Where both Apple and Android had on average a couple hundred vulnerabilities per million lines of code, Blackberry had only about 10 vulnerabilities per million lines of code. Blackberry is years  ahead of every other software developer simply because they had the foresight that cyber security would become an everyday conversation at some point. Blackberry has seated themselves as the leader in cyber security, and at this point no one understands this, making Blackberry far undervalued.

Google this if you have to. There is nothing that is unhackable. Nothing! There is no laws protecting average citizens against hacks as well. BB is going to the moon IMO, it’s just a matter of time!"

2021-05-12 11:36:05,wallstreetbets,"Note that the cost of that is reduced accuracy. The difference in approach is that traditional antivirus already knows what it’s looking for and will always find it, whereas neural-net base approaches are looking for things that malware tends to have in common and which generally isn’t part of legitimate software, but those criteria aren’t universally applicable."

2021-05-12 08:12:45,wallstreetbets,That’s my exact gripe with blackberry’s claim!! They are going around saying they prevent hacks unlike other companies that detect after the hack has happened and then they try to protect. Blackberry is essentially claiming they are preventing hack few milliseconds before the virus can even execute on computers. Wondering if that’s a fraud claim because how do you know whether a file is virus or not before it executes ?
2021-05-12 12:01:56,wallstreetbets,Yeah I think there is something fishy. If their product can’t detect and stop virus before they execute why aren’t the sales high? This cylance product is not growing in sales at all.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"AAPL EW analysis Hi, I am a 20 year old student who began studying Elliott wave principle recently in hope that it would improve my trading.

Is there anyone who could take a look at my analysis of AAPL stock? Now I do not know any of the indicators, this is purely based on my first impression on the chart employing the EW analysis I have been studying. 

Any opinion will be greatly appreciated, please help this boy out!

Please ignore the small writings, as they are basically me rambling to myself- 

 so in short, I think that the wiggly price action after wave 3 is wave 4 manifesting in a triangle, almost coming to an end, ready for a breakout to fib extension 1 of wave 1.   
I did also consider the sharp low after the wave 3 being the wave 4, but since it is too sharp in relation to the wave 2 and it took such a short time to do so, I figured it would be more reasonable to consider it wave A of a triangle, and so far the trend lines are supporting my theory. 

If it does breakout below C, then I would think that it might be the wave A of a correction, which could possibly retrace all the way back to somewhere between the extreme of wave 1 and wave 4, and that whole impulse being the wave 1 of a strong uptrend. 

This is my possible anticipation, it might sound absolutely stupid to some of you Elliotticians, as it has been only three days since I've started studying EW, and I don't know anything else about trading, this is the first point of my study. So please do give me generous criticism, how to improve! I tremendously appreciate your time, thanks for reading this long ass post.

2021-05-12 15:56:59,wallstreetbets,"The problem is a math problem. You have a 50% chance of making the right choice on the buy and 50% on the sell. Meaning to time the market requires two choices in making money. 

For those that don't follow that, you have a 75% chance of making the wrong decision by timing the market."
2021-05-12 15:57:33,wallstreetbets,Looks like every SPAC of 2021.
2021-05-12 15:59:38,wallstreetbets,"Like that time I bought AMD @85

2021-05-12 16:22:00,wallstreetbets,Don’t trade.  Long term invest in dividend paying stocks.  It’s that simple.

2021-05-12 16:51:42,wallstreetbets,I miss childhood and these types of moments.
2021-05-12 16:54:06,wallstreetbets,"I got caught up in the meme stocks and lost a few thousand trying to make a quick buck over the winter because I like to gamble as much as the next guy and I'm greedy and can be stupid too.

But as someone who understands the desire to turn my small amount of money into big money and wishes they hopped on certain trends and can relate to the futility of a 10% annual gains on a portfolio of only a few thousand dollars I still think you're better off parking money in a healthy company that you have a long term bullish outlook on and be prepared to hold for years"
2021-05-12 16:55:59,wallstreetbets,Every time I 'buy the dip'

I wasn’t in the market until July when I tried to start training for myself to recoup losses from Covid and it’s been a struggle and today it might be the last straw and I feel like it’s done me in financially and physically also mentally"
2021-05-12 18:45:16,wallstreetbets,Hahaha yeah
2021-05-12 18:59:15,wallstreetbets,"You want to bracket the stock in two ways.. when it goes up.. you want to sell immediately, and when it goes down, you want to buy as much as possible. After a few years, you will be CEO of a company losing money. Then, you want to write a golden parachute clause.. so you can fired, and walk away with $49 million."
2021-05-12 19:00:22,wallstreetbets,I see we have the same investment strategy.
2021-05-12 19:33:49,wallstreetbets,How funny I was literally just telling my brother this... anything I decided to invest in on my own has seen gains; the ONE stock I listened to him and invested in has consistently seen losses!! I’m just trying to bide my time to when it ***hopefully*** goes back up to what I spent and then I will offload. Or as close as possible.
2021-05-12 19:34:01,wallstreetbets,Should’ve bought into AMC..

2021-05-12 15:27:35,wallstreetbets,"take a look at my posts in stocksandshit, maybe youll learn something"
2021-05-12 15:47:17,wallstreetbets,Lmao! Yea srsly.
2021-05-12 17:10:57,wallstreetbets,Here I am holding TME while it's going lower because I thought I was smart buying after the Archegos masacre. I'm not just a clown but an entire circus.
2021-05-12 18:03:07,wallstreetbets,That’s basically most life
2021-05-12 19:23:52,wallstreetbets,Amen to that brotha!
2021-05-12 10:49:36,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-05-12 11:55:16,wallstreetbets,They never say which dip to buy.
2021-05-12 12:12:08,wallstreetbets,"At this point, my whole portfolio gonna be full of dips."
2021-05-12 11:54:28,wallstreetbets,"This is my observation, def not financial advice. When people say “buy the dip” you need to wait for a few of the baby dips. Look at the larger picture, take a look at similar stock movement, look into why that company vs the company your interested in is moving up or down or not at all. Is there a hold up for the whole industry? Is there lack of leadership? Lack of demand or supply? There’s about 1,000 questions you could ask to add to when is the right time to buy. 

To keep it simple, I personally look at 10yr, 5 year, 1 year, 3month, 1 month, 1 week views of the stock real quick. Get an idea how did it start off, what does it look like as whole (take into consideration anything you know correlating to the time line) look for 10% or more sudden drops. From there once you determine it’s a real dip and not a media scare or something, you could buy in whenever if you set your personal limits by asking yourself - do I want to sell at 10% drop / 20% gain or reassess? Keep doing that and eventually you could gain a confidence of when to buy low sell hi 😊 

Good luck on your journey 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Also plz correct me or summarise if I’m wrong"
2021-05-12 13:00:07,wallstreetbets,Average down! Lol
2021-05-12 13:02:15,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they meant, buy the dip, for the chips; and watch the down slide."
2021-05-12 15:14:44,wallstreetbets,If it keeps dipping keep buying. Stocks only go up.
2021-05-12 15:44:04,wallstreetbets,What are you waiting for go buy the dip.
2021-05-12 16:57:47,wallstreetbets,Hello fellow DKNG/PLTR holder
2021-05-12 18:38:31,wallstreetbets,You think you are buying but actually its some dip-sh*t

2021-05-12 12:58:26,wallstreetbets,Ikr I am never sorting by new again
2021-05-12 16:00:25,wallstreetbets,Same. I cut my losses instead of chasing it. Life lessons learned I suppose.
2021-05-12 16:07:08,wallstreetbets,Bro fuck that stock so hard
2021-05-12 16:16:09,wallstreetbets,I am holding it for life I guess! I will pass it on to my children. It will give them one more reason to hate me when they turn 18..

2021-05-12 10:35:12,wallstreetbets,"Yep. Burned on BB. LOL, it isn't going anywhere."
2021-05-12 12:01:47,wallstreetbets,"It's okay, I bought BB at the top. Sold it for -50% and used the money to buy SPY like a risk adverse boomer. Made most of my losses back tho, at least until the market started shitting."
2021-05-12 11:38:47,wallstreetbets,Curious where you would be right now if you had instead put all of those funds in a boring ETF index fund (taxable) or index mutual fund (pretax). No moon of course but always curious to see what the boring way would have gotten you.
2021-05-12 12:25:56,wallstreetbets,thanks for taking time to document your misery.  Stay away from drugs (as investment vehicles)
2021-05-12 13:37:10,wallstreetbets,Pltr & tlry i still have faith but im afraid we'll be bag holding for a little while before we see green
2021-05-12 13:39:45,wallstreetbets,"Sprinkle in some mvis, gme, amc and tsla, you get yourself a wsb ETF going."
2021-05-12 10:48:59,wallstreetbets,"my question is why do you people hold when it's currently down like that? obviously it's not going back up anytime soon. your best bet is to sell, the sooner the better, and invest in anything else that's more promising. don't feel like you need to leave it in there with hopes it goes up. seriously, get rid of that shit on your hands and clean it up with something guaranteed to do better.
seriously."
2021-05-12 10:49:33,wallstreetbets,They’ll probably turn around at least some of those just not with the current market conditions.

It then promptly went down, and hovers somewhere around a small loss forever it seems. I'll be profitable for half a day here and there.."
2021-05-12 13:24:29,wallstreetbets,One peak at the chart and general market sentiment for growth in general and the ev sector in particular was all it took 😬 I’d consider nibbling on it at $540 with a tight stop.
2021-05-12 12:46:53,wallstreetbets,"I want no part of Tesla but it was forced upon me when it got added to the S&P 500 so now I’ve got $20,000 worth 😆"
2021-05-12 13:36:04,wallstreetbets,"Don't discount selling the hype, though. I bought MindMed the day before it opened on Nasdaq and quickly sold for a $1/share profit. Planning to use that to get back in when it seems to hit bottom. There's lots of good info here, but you sure can't take it at face value."

2021-05-12 10:00:15,wallstreetbets,RIP bro. GME looks like it has the most upside for the short term so that’s the best one there imo.
2021-05-12 16:23:24,wallstreetbets,It’s a Hole account. wasn’t even a typo. A red hole.
2021-05-12 12:40:03,wallstreetbets,Hole account indeed.

2021-05-12 09:00:47,wallstreetbets,Yeah... It was a good investment until I realized 95% of profits go to non-controlling interests

2021-05-12 11:12:54,wallstreetbets,RKT surprised me though. I thought UWM was winning the fight so much hype. They were even all this time.

2021-05-12 15:38:32,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the time the problem is that people choose winners and losers roughly equally (or maybe even choose winners more often than not), but close the winners for small gains while riding the losers (or doubling and tripling down on them) all the way into the ground.

Apple has reverse split their price 5 times. 
How many times has Apple's stock split? Apple's stock has split five times since the company went public. The stock split on a 4-for-1 basis on August 28, 2020, a 7-for-1 basis on June 9, 2014, and split on a 2-for-1 basis on February 28, 2005, June 21, 2000, and June 16, 1987.

If Apple had never split its stock, shares would have been trading at $27,957.44 as of Friday's close"

Use 30% of ur tendies on your trade and 70% on the opposite trade.

This would be an increase of 10M+ people eligible for medicare. [Demographics](https://www.infoplease.com/us/census/demographic-statistics) In 2019 Medicare expense was around 800 Billion [cms data](https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/NationalHealthExpendData/NHE-Fact-Sheet#:~:text=Historical%20NHE%2C%202019%3A,16%20percent%20of%20total%20NHE), which would be around $13.000 dollars per person.

Now heres the thing: Out of a total of 61.2M people who receive Medicare [Medicare stats](https://www.ncpssm.org/our-issues/medicare/medicare-fast-facts/), only 5 percent switch plans every year, translating to around 4 million people yearly.  [REUTERS](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-medicare-advantage-complex-idUSKCN0RZ2F520151005) This shows that competing within the market for existing users is very hard. 

Now I understand this 250% increase of the fishing pool is a one-time effect, but as people are unlikely to switch plans these people are likely to be bound long-term. Therefore finding these companies that we feel can respond to such change has huge appeal to me. 

Based on the above data and assuming a lower $10.000 dollar expense to be on the safe side, the usual market for people switching plans is 40 Billion yearly. When this Medicare change is made it will be over 100 Billion. Imagine the impact on those growth companies that are ready. I feel the companies with a market cap of say 2-10 Billion could double easy. 

Now I understand I have to make a bunch of disclaimers. 

* Not financial advice
* Data is rough, I made a lot of estimates and rounded stuff up and down: do your own research
* I hold 825 shares of CLOV at 8.79 average.

Happy to hear if you know any other good companies that would be able to reap the benefits of such a change. Also happy to hear if my words make sense or if they are like a ponytail eating clouds."

2021-05-12 08:57:33,wallstreetbets,"I love that someone is actually talking about Medicare bc I live my life in the Medicare space as a broker, so I match Medicare buyers with sellers. I don’t know $clov but I’ve seen it mentioned a lot on here so I’ll have to do some research. Company wise look at Humana, United healthcare and anthem. They all carry Medicare advantage and have become very competitive in the Medicare supplement space whereas they had no interest being competitive a few years ago. If clov’s focus is outcome based, then they are in the Medicare advantage space. Most seniors, especially younger seniors want a supplement not an advantage plan. Advantage plans are great for vets, low income urban populations and older seniors who don’t travel for extended periods of time, aka not for snow birds. Just based on my business, I would say the Medicare supplement market will explode, but also prescription drug plans. In this space again you have Humana as a leader, WellCare (centene), United healthcare and Aetna/cvs. Anthem has entered the space but isn’t big yet, at least in my selling area. I don’t know how clov plays into this, but maybe I’ll do my first DD on the subject, but definitely this space will be a really big deal if we see a Medicare buy in pass. 
From my phone, I’ll edit later for corrections. Also, I own $0 stock in $CLOV or any mentioned healthcare company, I would say the speculation is already priced in if people are already talking about it, but I’m definitely going to keep an eye on it."

I’m not super worried about this. These firms are usually looking for class action based on the lack of information given by CLOV at time of the spac. Most of these show a direct relation with the Hindenburg report on CLOV. These sorts of messages are usually released right when CLOV starts moving up.

2021-05-12 08:56:19,wallstreetbets,The reason growth markets tend to drop during inflation is because the risk vs. reward of the market loses its value when future gains are worth less. So investors turn to consumer staples and less risk-based savings vehicles that generally stay consistent during an economic downturn.

Just watch the 10 year Treasury yield; if that makes a move past 1.77% (the high in the March-April yield spike), then it's going to be an open war between the Fed trying to convince everyone that inflation is only transitory and big funds dumping bonds because they think the Fed is wrong.

Yield can easily reach 2 to 2.5% in that scenario.

Today is a full risk off day, even the ""inflation hedges"" are getting dumped."

2021-05-12 10:28:58,wallstreetbets,"Yes inflation is real. It was never fake.

Yes the fed will raise rates. No they won’t do it tomorrow.

Nobody knows if inflation is transitory or not. Think about how much money could have been made in the market over the last month if big money wasn’t pissing themselves with fear of everything."
2021-05-12 10:30:26,wallstreetbets,"To all the people who think Powell won’t start tapering sooner than he says because he’s been clear that he won’t- you’re incorrect and here’s why. The dude said in mid 2018 that the fed was “a long way from accommodative.” Why? Because he assumed that’s what Wall Street was expecting. Once it was apparent Wall Street was not expecting this and he had caused a small panic he immediately did an about face and took rates lower and began the entire narrative they have now. This did not start post Covid, Covid merely gave him permission to be completely unambiguous and never divert from the no hiking policy.

However over the last weeks calls have been growing for him to explain why we need such loose monetary policy in the face of higher inflation and a booming economy. I truly believe his position is going to become more and more uncomfortable and with CPI numbers going up it’s going to get that much harder for him. I believe a statement is coming real soon that they will see what happens or react as needed- something much more reserved than what they’ve been saying.

In short J Pow does what he thinks Wall Street wants him to. This has been pretty obvious for almost three years. If you think he’s got some internal drive to keep inflation high and will do whatever he wants regardless of what the talking heads say you haven’t been paying attention."

Economy can look stagflationary if inflation gets out of control.

Only thing we have right now is the hope that supply chain normalization reduces pricing pressure.

But that's a slim hope when you see what's happening with housing markets and everything else.  Housing/used cars/chips/metals/resources... none of it looks transitory.

There's a lot more stimulus sloshing through the economy than can be absorbed.

And there's trillions in deferred consumption from past 15 months that will try to come back next 18 months.

who knew?!"
2021-05-12 12:20:35,wallstreetbets,"This is not a bear market, but we are in a sideways consolidation pattern due to inflation concerns.

Most important thing to keep in mind is that right now we're in a tug of war between Fed/bond investors over whether inflation is transitory.  Bond holders have been dumping treasuries because they think Fed isn't going to be able to control inflation (or is wrong about it being transitory).

We need to see either of these things: 1) much faster job gains over next 5-10 months (something big like several million jobs would help) that would allow investors to price in rate hikes in mid/late 2022 to prevent an inflationary spiral, or 2) signs that inflation is actually transitory (which we aren't going to see/know for some time).

Either way, the worst possible route for stocks would be slow job gains and high inflation because it really means that the Fed will have to choose how hot it lets the economy go with a lot of pressure points for consumers and job seekers.

I don't think we're going to see the bottom fall out, but the next couple of months could look bumpy; the ""easy money of 2020"" is probably in the rearview mirror, and we're going to be for a lot of brutal rotations into and out of sectors (i.e. lots of growth/value rotations) as things bump along moving mostly sideways in aggregate."

2021-05-12 06:45:49,wallstreetbets,"Futures are lower again this morning, with small caps leading the drop. Russell 2000 down almost 1%. Nasdaq down about 0.4%. Dow and S&P about 0.2% lower. The VIX is spiking, up 3% to close to 22, its highest level since March. That’s as of 0630.

This all follows a day of massive reversals. Tech was being bludgeoned yesterday morning while large caps were higher. By the close the Nasdaq was flat, while Dow finished down 1.4%, its worst day since February, and S&P was off 0.9%.

Today is all about the CPI report, due out at 0830. Economists are expecting a MoM figure of 0.2% and YoY print of 3.6%. This would be the highest level since 2011. 

You’ll be hearing a lot about that if the number meets or (God forbid) exceeds estimates. Further ramifications are discussed in the audio. Don’t feel like typing it.

He should have been made to serve his remaining years in prison and then have to work at walmart for the rest of his life. His actions are the reason why companies do accounting the way they do today, Enron was one of the biggest scams in human history the company was almost completely fraudulent and practically erased workers entire pensions because it was all tied up in enron stock

And to give you an idea enron was considered a safe investment at the time, it was the blue chip stock to be in everybody recommended it, it declaring bankruptcy was literally not even in people's minds. Scary shit

Anyways puts on whatever that fucker tries to make next, hopefully the sec watches him like a hawk and his company collpases"

2021-05-12 14:52:43,wallstreetbets,It’s funny how the analysts used to say the stimulus was already priced in and that’s why the market wouldn’t react to the stimulus packages Biden passed. But now that the tech sector has went down for like 3 to 4 months they don’t mention at all that the fed rate decision or inflation reports are priced in already. And some people on here say worse is to come? Doesn’t the market price things in before it happens?? According to CNBC pundits.

2021-05-12 11:29:04,wallstreetbets,"When the pandemic crashed the index down 30%, a lot of people declared that was the end of one market cycle and the beginning of a new one. I'm not so convinced it should be viewed that way since the pandemic was a unique event that, at least from the market's perspective, was quickly printed out of relevance by the Fed. It's not related to naturally occurring economic cycles, so a couple weeks later we were back to euphoria. I think we're still in the bull market that began in 2009, and we have the Fed printing at full speed so that all they have to do is stop, and the everything bubble will pop. The red we've seen this week is just based on the fear that maybe, someday, the Fed will be forced by inflation to pull their tits out of our mouths."

2021-05-12 16:26:24,wallstreetbets,"No, companies that have no profit and claim to have profit in the future (usually years out) will be worth less with inflation.  So a stock that claims to have profits of $300 million in 2030 with 4% inflation is worth a lot less than $300 million with 1% inflation.  That $300 million is going to lose value overtime.

Edit: Hence no profit companies getting hammered."
2021-05-12 16:24:54,wallstreetbets,It's the fear of rising interest rates. The only way to counter inflation is to increase interest rates which will decrease housing demand and ultimately lowers the cost of commodity's then. Now is the time to buy OIL!!!

With earlier this year the influx was so large that even if 80% of them left,  they still vastly out number the prior membership.  WSB culture is gone. I thought it'd be back to back to normal by now. 

Here's how you know things are ducked:
* people recommending to buy shares instead of
of options are upvoted
* people giving legit advice to noob questions
* general r/investing level comments/ advice is upvoted

Previously that type of stuff would have been downvoted. How to fix it? Idk aside from randomly delete 95% of comments / posts from new people. This will change the ratio of what is visible,  thus forcing the old culture to be seen and spread. The percent of new user deleted content can be reduced over time. The main problem with this is that new users can still vote.

Now after GME is pretty boring to follow, 90% of the DD's here ended in loses. There's so much hype people can take in loosing money. There's no excitement anymore when everything is red and retarded doesn't mean what it used to. Now it means you're just stupid for following all the DD's here.

2021-05-12 19:04:12,wallstreetbets,"Not that any of you care about what I have to say, but I'm fine with the retarded and Autist used specifically in this environment, as it's pretty clear from the get go that it's framed as a positive thing in this context. 

Like you want to be seen as hypervigilant about numbers, even though being hypervigilant about numbers has almost nothing to do with actual Autism. Hence ""Autist"" <- not even the real word, yo.

You want to be seen as ""retarded"" because you're so slow on making decisions you just are either lucky or stubborn enough to win out.  Retarded is flushed back to its original context of ""being slow"" rather than a mental handicap/differently abled. So like Handicapped =/= retarded, cool. 

""Apes"" when it first came about seemed ... really ***Racist*** when I saw it at first, and I was worried this was just another KKK/Nazi thread on the internet. When I read more posts with ""apes"" references, I realized most people who were using it meant the equivalent of ""retarded"" and like, Bloodhound Gang songs. So again, acceptable to regard/respect those opinions.

Standard other swears are standard, so like whatevs. 

But y'all fuckers who use fucking SIMP? The Lamest Inaneist most Obsequious insult of the Fucking Universe?! 

Oh, what, you're ***afraid*** to be a ***respectful human being*** and want to somehow remain a trashfire ***sexist?***

It's ***offensive*** to you to listen and acknowledge ***women are people too,*** and like you want to, oh I don't know, ***sympathize*** or ***listen*** to them or ***respect*** them in some way, and if you dare mention something akin to it, you ***damage everyone in the room's gonads? WHY ARE THEIR GONADS SO WEAK AND TOUCHY?!?***

Like you call each other ***cucks*** *affectionately* as though you're all from Austrailia, and yet you use SIMP in the same typestream to insult someone else! 

Like, you Slimemold infested Smegheads - cuckholding is specifically implying the woman has a choice. 

All of you who are ***willing to be cuckholded by your wife's boyfriend*** are ***respecting she has a choice.*** 

Using ***SIMP*** as an insult to others negates that respect, becuase if your wife has a boyfriend, ***you're a SIMP too***.

Their reviews are awful: https://www.hellopeter.com/wwwwishcom

They have -ve EPS and will continue to have -ve EPS: https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/WISH/financials?p=WISH

They are waaay overvalued and the current market is bearish. A match made in heaven.

Their customer service is bad - https://www.reddit.com/r/Wish/comments/n0zss3/customer_service_not_replying_anymore/

People literally don't feel safe ordering cutlery from Wish - https://www.reddit.com/r/Wish/comments/n4jxad/is_it_safe_to_order_cutlery_on_wish/

They will even go so far as to try and sell your child a dildo - https://www.reddit.com/r/Wish/comments/na2i44/wish_wtf/

They are posting earning in the upcoming after hours.

I was considering to sell an ATM call and buy OTM call on this. But that doesn't feel like the optimal move here. And I am going to short it just before market close. (I don't want to short during an intraday rally, yikes no. This is much, much better I think.) This play really makes sense to me right now. The more I look into WISH the more goddamn awful it looks.

What % of my account should I risk? I'm not a complete retard, so I'll risk up to a quarter.

There's also the issue that stock evaluation isn't solely based on earnings today, but what they *might* be tomorrow. Hell, look at Uber. A shit company hemorrhaging cash everywhere that's *never* made a profit. But it's still ""worth"" 46 a share when it should be 2."

Personally, I'd never put money into this, mostly because I don't believe the company should exist but also because it feels risky af. But I'd never short it either because you can't discount the fact that idiot boomers will dump money into it like they did Dot com stocks and the founders' ability to drum up silicone valley investors."

2021-05-12 15:45:15,wallstreetbets,"They're still 10M+ shares short, they gotta buy back some time. Inflation incoming so the interest is gonna make 'em TAP OUT!  And then when they buy at ever higher prices,then GME goes to Uranus

2021-05-12 14:44:14,wallstreetbets,Even 10% of that estimate still proves these guys are idiots
2021-05-12 09:08:00,wallstreetbets,Whelp you've convinced me.  Those two situations are exactly the same and now everyone who owns a single share of GME will be a millionaire.  Most won't ever have to work again because they bought 3 shares.  Amazing.  Get your hopes waaaaayyyyyy up.
2021-05-12 10:37:05,wallstreetbets,"And one single entity owned almost 50% of outstanding shares, with the US government owning another 20% or so. Moronic to compare the two scenarios"

2021-05-12 10:38:36,wallstreetbets,Haha but what's funny was 140% of the float of gme was owned a one point. Wouldn't you think something that has never happened in history might have some ripples after the intial blast?

Nonsense. You just chose the most ridiculous and extreme example you could think of and then mindlessly tried to compare the two. That's what's known as a false equivalence. It's silly and dishonest. Survival of the fittest means the fittest survive. In the case of covid, assuming he's not 85yrs old, he would be among the fittest and would survive.

Yes, one number is less than the other. lol Obviously covid is more contagious, and that's why more have been affected. However, it's still mostly old/fat/unhealthy people dying from a virus, just at a slower rate since it's not as contagious. I doubt you freak out about their deaths every year. Do you also freak out about cancer deaths, car fatalities, heart attack deaths, and stroke deaths? 

The fact is that the vast majority of covid deaths are old people(many likely obese; obesity increases risk of hospitalization/death), the same type of people that die to the flu every year.

>And the long term effects are not at all similar to the flu. You can ""survive"" and end up dealing with various symptoms the rest of your life.

You can also have lots of nasty effects from taking tylenol, but that doesn't mean it's likely. 

TL;DR Death is highly unlikely unless old(see link above). Covid is worse than the flu, but not as much as people pretend it is. It's not the bubonic plague.

P.S. At risk old/obese people should take special care to avoid others, even if they're family/friends, if they truly fear catching the virus. They know the risks."

As for COVID - we can say this is a form of decreasing unwanted genes from the gene pool, making available genes better adapted for the immediate environment. And before you blah blah blah about me not caring; I've worked 2 years in a COVID ICU. I've put more toe tags on bodies than I care to admit.

Overall fife expectancy declined the most ever recorded in the first half of 2020. 

>The fact is that the vast majority of covid deaths are old people(many likely obese; obesity increases risk of hospitalization/death), the same type of people that die to the flu every year.

The fact is far more people are dying who would otherwise not normally die during a year. 

Another fact. A young healthy person is 10-20X more likely to die from COVID than the flu.

Annualized data is coming out that shows the number of deaths in the US more than likely 750-900k. Not 500k. 

>You can also have lots of nasty effects from taking tylenol, but that doesn't mean it's likely.

Lmao. Sigh. What's the ""rate"" of permanent side effects from taking Tylenol in a normal way?

The more proper comparison would be, what are the lasting side effects of the flu vs COVID. No comparison there. The rate of lasting side effects for COVID is high. But go ahead and lick some peoples faces or whatever.

How is 10 to 20X worse than the flu ""not as much as people pretend it is""???

Everyone should be doing what they can to limit the spread for several reasons. The more it circulates the faster it can mutate. The longer it circulates the more economic and social issues there are. The more people who will suffer long term side effects even if they do survive."

2021-05-12 02:19:22,wallstreetbets,"Checked out the YouTube video and it seems you know a lot less than me and stick to the basics. As far as clicking links, I don’t click on sketchy links that feeds my data to websites."
2021-05-12 01:44:51,wallstreetbets,Id rather go by the feeling in my sack. It doesn’t seem to make a big enough difference to matter.
2021-05-12 02:11:32,wallstreetbets,"I did! Just few weeks ago you were seeking helps on trading schools. All your post are copied and news no real own work, my stuff is done from hard work and experience. I would love to you teach few things if you have time. Also check out my Twitter or stockwits for free charts you will really appreciate the work put into TA. https://stocktwits.com/life_has_options/message/328727225"
2021-05-12 02:29:34,wallstreetbets,"I never said I know more than you or less. Everyone is different, these my site with encryptions and not some scratchy stuff. I don’t have time to argue with you, whatever suits you put it on. Good luck and cheers."
2021-05-12 02:16:45,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah, I want to know more about trading schools so I can learn how to trade under a prop desk with a series 7... I can pay for a school or pay for a mentor. I don’t want to share my data with a mentor unless they teach me something more than I already know. I can post up some screen shots if you’d like.      

Also, my posts have predicted movement like a mofo. Called the bottom on oil, tlt, real estate plays, sorrento therapeutics, and quite a few more.      

You on the other hand just deleted a few posts exposing how little you know."

2021-05-12 01:15:46,wallstreetbets,UWM made a move that they can never recover from. Cant monopolize the broker\wholesale channel. Bad business decision Matt Ishbia

2021-05-12 02:56:52,wallstreetbets,"For calls there is a rule of thumb to cut loss at -50%. At that point, you have a 20% getting back to break even. I feel for you man, I have been in this situation and am currently holding a shitload of shares which are down. Maybe miracles do happen though 🌈"
2021-05-12 02:59:54,wallstreetbets,"Just don’t ever buy options and hold on to it for more than 30-50% loss, and definitely don’t go all in, and this won’t ever happen again... I learned the hard way too"

2021-05-12 11:05:33,wallstreetbets,A bunch of 1 month old accounts pushed this stock hard while constantly using as much lingo as possible from this sub.  You should have known what it was.  In fact this sub is so heavily inundated now with blatantly fake bullshit accounts and their constant spamming of rocket icons that it's essentially become a way to figure out which stocks to _avoid_.
2021-05-12 00:58:39,wallstreetbets,Guh
2021-05-12 02:17:04,wallstreetbets,At least you still have 500+ dollars.
2021-05-12 02:27:49,wallstreetbets,90% of portfolio into Options. I mean..
2021-05-12 02:48:55,wallstreetbets,You’re not out yet
2021-05-12 03:37:18,wallstreetbets,It was 90% of your portfolio.
2021-05-12 03:45:10,wallstreetbets,Dumped brah. Don’t buy the news.
2021-05-12 03:55:29,wallstreetbets,I lost a check's worth as well. You're not alone. I'm working my way back up and starting fresh once I make back my losses.

2021-05-12 06:07:43,wallstreetbets,The downside of wsb. Everyone thinks theyre a money manager and this shits easy. Credit cards tho? Another level of dumb
2021-05-12 06:34:34,wallstreetbets,Hope this is a lesson to others... don't fuck with options
2021-05-12 07:00:32,wallstreetbets,"Just remember, if everyone won all of the time, no one would work and everyone would play the market. Can't win them all. When we win big, someone else lost on the other side too. Sometimes it's us, sometimes it's them"
2021-05-12 07:21:07,wallstreetbets,You bought options that's your mistake. Should have stayed with shares.
2021-05-12 07:25:28,wallstreetbets,Not sure why you are surprised.
2021-05-12 07:51:55,wallstreetbets,I thought greed is good
2021-05-12 08:07:18,wallstreetbets,Not even sorry for you. 90% of your portfolio? Where the fuck is your risk management?
2021-05-12 08:08:47,wallstreetbets,"**Are people unaware of the fact that you can close an options position before expiration? You don't have to lose 100% of your investment. You can choose to, for example, close the position and take the loss at -70%.**

2021-05-12 09:07:33,wallstreetbets,Hey don’t feel bad the other 10% is good for now
2021-05-12 09:09:57,wallstreetbets,I always think of the people posting -89k bets and I feel better

2021-05-12 02:11:01,wallstreetbets,Sorry for your loss. Actually almost everyone got hit very hard by massive sell off. But this is not the end of life. Life is a lot more than money. I would suggest try selling it in a chunk whenever it goes up and use that money to invest in something worthy like cruise lines or outdoor sports related stocks.
2021-05-12 05:06:45,wallstreetbets,"If it makes you feel better I lost 60k holding GME to the moon then it crashed. Also Caught FOMO on BB and NOK, sold at another 10k loss. I’m a true idiot but it was a reality check."

2021-05-12 00:43:00,wallstreetbets,It’s not about money you need its is about the loss of your hard working.

2021-05-12 02:43:35,wallstreetbets,"You say that... but have anyone of us rrrrreally learned... I bet in 6 months time when he has a little bit of money in his savings account, the twitching will start... then as he reads stories of success, FOMO will kick in hard... and plooop he is back here. although, who knows he/she might hit big... I have been doing this shit for ten years. If you can’t do the things you want to do with your hard earned money then why the fuck are we living for.   The trill he got from this will not be matched, that’s why we live... to fucking feel alive.  He/she is now a retard forever. God bless you"

2021-05-12 00:05:44,wallstreetbets,CRSR is a solid buy right now. Try to stick with grabbing under $32. It does dip to $30 off and on so may want to wait for that. Should see it increase to around $40-$45 end of year
2021-05-12 07:59:38,wallstreetbets,It’s not a solid buy at all. LOGI is. CSRS can’t make money in a work at home market. Is sad. Poor management.

In the age of UFO disclosure, an air space/defense company being in possession of ufo debris/materials is where I want to invest. That’s the one that has the head start!!! 

Possession of alien craft therefore seems like material information which is required to be disclosed to shareholders. Lack of craft possession also seems like a material risk if anyone else has one. 

Are there any securities attorneys out there? Is it even worth it to ask the company for the information?

Lockheed has an investor relations page that has contact information, but I want feedback on this if they respond with “internal trade secrets” or something. Is it as simple as pivoting to - it’s a material risk to me if you don’t have one? Or you would be exposed to reputational risk if you had these materials and lied? Are there any shareholder governance methods that could work?

National security kicks in and you don't have to disclose jack-shit.  In fact, you get in trouble if you do.

You can go look at some of the case law involving patents that weren't documented because of national security... wherein some company comes up with the idea independently and gets their patent application shot down.

2021-05-12 00:46:34,wallstreetbets,"The context is long and sounds fucking insane, but the gist is the Army created a program to find intelligence officers that may have latent psychic abilities. They sent them to a special training facility out in the woods to hone those abilities. The training regimen and private company they contracted to run it still exist if you want to pay to get the same training. The goal was to be able to spy on adversaries through remote viewing or astral projection. Some of the viewers reported being able to view a location at any point in time. This report is one of a series of viewings of a specific location on Mars, in this case, one million years in the past. It corroborates some of the information from other viewers looking at the same location in the 80s. Supposedly they found large underground structures that they described as abandoned cities.

I know it basically sounds like the plot to Stranger Things, but it was a real program. The government used to deny that it existed, then lied about it being shut down while keeping it active under CIA control instead of the Army for years. Officially the program was shuttered for not providing enough actionable reliable intel. However, the program did have some noteworthy successes, like seeing and giving detailed measurements of a Soviet submarine that was nearly twice the size of what we thought their largest sub was. The report was initially ignored as completely ludicrous until we got another sighting of it from a satellite and confirmed from recon plane flyover a few months later.

The program operated under half a dozen code names over the years, and was initially several separate initiatives that were all combined in 91 under the code name Stargate Project. One of the intel officers involved was interviewed extensively for the book The Men Who Stare at Goats which was later adapted into an awful movie."

2021-05-12 03:11:26,wallstreetbets,"except this shit actually happens on occasion.

The instance I'm familiar with was an Alcatel patent for a device used in sealing undersea cable splices.  There was an unknown entity that had the patent already that didn't show up in any of their research. It was essentially a couple million dollars worth of patent application legal work down the drain.

The hypothetical Armageddon dispute was more a matter of jurisdiction.  In theory, you could build a factory in low earth orbit that IP infringed the hell out of everybody and just deliver the end product via deorbiting."

2021-05-12 01:06:55,wallstreetbets,"You think their budget is any smaller now, and consequently that the wild shit they spend it on is any less out there?

The combined NIP/MIP budget for 2020 is roughly 33% higher than it was in 2007. Takes a lot of billions annually to make scared apes feel safe in a dangerous world."

2021-05-12 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"No, at least not according to the test the Army used to find the intelligence officers that could be trained in remote viewing. Those testing procedures are also in the 13 million pages of declassified material in the CIA reading room if you want to find out which of your friends will be the most fun to drop acid with.

Fun side tangent, when the military decided that remote viewing was bullshit they started looking for precognition instead. The test is pretty simple. You show the test subject a series of images most of which are fairly mundane. Some of them are quite shocking or jarring though. You closely monitor pupil dilation throughout the test as there's a fairly obvious dilation response to the shocking images, but what they're looking for are those that consistently show that dilation response a few seconds before being shown the image. Supposedly they've found subjects that consistently respond around 3-5 seconds in advance of the stimulus. If you google military and ""spidey sense"" you'll find some news articles about it and this research isn't ancient history. The Navy funded a five year study into it in 2014."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"South Park Investment Theory Has anyone ever noticed that once a company is mentioned in Southpark it is bound for liftoff? 

A most recent example:

\-**Build A Bear ($BBW)**: When the Pandemic Special aired on September 30th, 2021 the stock was at $3.23. Today on May 11th, 2021 the stock is now at $8.90. This can obviously be seen as a standard rebound play. 

Previous Examples:

\-**Amazon ($AMZN)**: Stock was at $1,775 on May 30th, 2019. Today it is at $3,223.91.

\-**Tesla ($TSLA):** Stock was at $31 on October 9th, 2013. Today it is at $617.

Historically, companies that have been highlighted in Southpark have beat the market in the short term and the long term. Many of us know that South Park is extremely relevant in hindsight and we constantly see examples of South Park's content being ahead of its time. 

This investment theory is based upon trusting the masterminds behind South Park and their constant ability to see future trends. Just like following a Bill Ackman play. I recommend investing in a company once they are mentioned in South Park.

I will be putting together a graph comparing stock performances to the S&P and how one would have performed if they executed this investment theory. And yes I will include the losers..."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"91% profit accrues to RXT stockholders this quarter - DD Let me explain a counter intuitive result to you, by which we profit at the expense of the debt holders. 

I should first note, for the speculatively minded out there, that obviously debt costs are fixed (the debt holders have a cap on their claim, in return for senior claims on profits). Yet the growth affects the entire company.   

Also, our debt has been refinanced to 3.5%, from memory (this means debt holders have further accepted a lower claim than their initial one).  

Quarterly filing:

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1810019/000181001921000082/rxt-20210331.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1810019/000181001921000082/rxt-20210331.htm)

Assume that 90% of the company market cap is fixed debt claims. Each “10% block” of the company has grown at double digits, yet the fixed claims cost only 3.5% annually (say 1% per quarter). The “leftover profit” differential between growth in profit and costs goes to the stockholders. Say the profit differential is 9%, and there are 9 blocks of them.   

Conference call transcript:

[https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/rackspace-technology-inc-rxt-q1-2021-earnings-call/](https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2021/05/11/rackspace-technology-inc-rxt-q1-2021-earnings-call/)

Our real benefit as stockholders (to the detriment of the bond holders) from the growth is 9%\*9+ 10%, is something like 91% profit gain in this quarter."
2021-05-11 22:28:13,wallstreetbets,Can we run rkt to 24$
2021-05-11 22:59:22,wallstreetbets,"Screw DD, do you see that 20% drop today? I’m buying short calls and riding the bounce back to 91%"
2021-05-11 23:45:08,wallstreetbets,"Used to play this stock and haven't in awhile. I remember last fall there were rumors about a deal  with AMZN, but i'll throw some shares at this again."

2021-05-12 01:39:09,wallstreetbets,This is for RKT right? Cuz speaking about any other ticker is no bueno
2021-05-12 08:43:46,wallstreetbets,"Typo on RKT, but everyone here knows what you mean"
2021-05-11 22:29:54,wallstreetbets,Wrong ticker
2021-05-11 23:44:37,wallstreetbets,"Yes I see it too.

My point is that they have made a mistake in dropping the price; They are now offering us 25% more stock per dollar.

we now have a 91% profit over and above the usual price. The market cap should be worth way more"
2021-05-11 23:53:00,wallstreetbets,"Great point, I had not considered the buyout aspect.

Have done the same, now own 1,999 shares. If it drops 30% will double down.

AMZN buyout would be another strong contributing factor to growth."

2021-05-11 23:54:49,wallstreetbets,I’ll search for the articles but I don’t think it was a buyout. I believe it was a deal to incorporate RXT infrastructure for AWS.

2021-05-11 23:32:15,wallstreetbets,The reason people bother to publish DD is that they want their options to print or need the upvotes. So either it’s for financial gain or they have narcissistic tendencies.

2021-05-12 07:15:03,wallstreetbets,There has been good DD on WSB though. Not so much since the GME saga but still. Hell GME itself is the best example. There was also a ton of DD posted on steel in Jan but it was overshadowed by the memes. The gist was basically buy June/Sept calls and it turned out exactly like the guy said. Anyone who went deep in steel would be up huge right now.

I am a Bachelor student in media studies from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands and currently do digital ethnography research on r/wallstreetbets. As I am a big fan of this community, this project means a lot for me and it would be really great to chat with members of WSB or even have video-call interviews. Please contact me if you would be willing to be interviewed (via chat or video-call). I am generally interested in how participants perceive WSB and what they do with information that they get here. Apart from that, why do you guys come to the community here? If you are interested and want to know more about me or the project I am doing, don’t hesitate to contact me!

it has a little bit more to go usually

and then everyone talks about the memes and the money before going through the various stages of loss and depression

finally settling for the fact that their portfolios are 50% gone"

2021-05-12 05:21:37,wallstreetbets,"Due diligence. You should always do your own research and analysis of a stock’s fundamentals, but sometimes people post their analysis (with varying degrees of thoroughness) to WSB and other forums. If you catch these posts early enough and can verify the info independently you can sometimes get lucky and buy a stock that will rise in price, but often (especially with the influx of users and the attention the sub is getting) if you get to a DD post a couple of days late you can get caught holding a bag"

I take it as a compliment. I rarely put full effort into writing on such pages as Reddit, so I don't want to boast too much, but once I was on a summer school and there were several people from the US, and they've asked if I study in English or have some family in England etc., or maybe we have it as an official language. I was kinda shocked and said: uhm, I use it mostly for games in my daily life. But thanks to my mom, I've been learning English for quite some time, and I wasn't ever afraid to use it. However, as of now, I use it at work a lot."

You don't want to avoid timing investments, that's what we call ""playing with fire"". Take the guess work out of investing and it's way more lucrative."

Not saying PLTR can’t be the next Google, but hoping it will somehow create AGI and take over the world is pretty naive. At least Google or Facebook grew exponentially with a core product that was functional. PLTR fanboys are hoping they invent a completely new product.

2021-05-12 12:29:24,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has two main products: 1. Gotham, which Is, I assume, a graph based database that connects stuff like social media, drone footage, facial recognition, etc to help government surveillance. This is the one that hypes everybody up because it looks cool, they market it a ton, and because the military uses it to some degree.

The second product, Foundry, is an enterprise software platform that helps data scientists and data engineers streamline model building and is pretty much the same thing as other products like DataRobot, Alteryx, and Amazon Sagemaker. Basically machine learning in a box; however, as a data scientist, you still need skilled data scientists to actually use these tools. The vision of having a marketing manager that can barely use Excel pivot tables making his own AI on Sagemaker or Foundry to execute ad buys based off of YouTube comments is completely bogus. Adoption will continue to be limited by the lack of talented analytics professionals that can actually use the tool properly. 

What people hype Palantir up to be is the next generation leader in AI and a hope that Palantir will invent some sort of Artificial General Intelligence that can plug and play into all sorts of different situations like self flying drones that deliver medicine or an automated drive thru teller. 

They can’t explain why Palantir is any closer to this than Google, Microsoft, Baidu, Uber, MIT, or elsewhere other than that Palantir is backed by Peter Thiel, works with the CIA, has fancy marketing, and is hard to get a job at. By the way, I don’t think we will see AGI in the next 30 years, partially because we focus on comparing the brain and intelligence to computers, when in fact the brain is not a computer.

They are just hoping PLTR becomes the next Google b/c AI."

I understand that people speculate and hope that Palantir will create ""THE"" AI, but as you said, what makes people think they will be the one to create it, especially when their 2 mains things they do you mentioned aren't really related to creating the ultimate AI. 


Why don't people hope for companies who are working on quantum computers to make an AI first? 


I honestly believe the only things who could utilize quantum computers to their full potential would be AI's and in the same sense, I believe an super AI would require quantum technology to work well. 


Google is worth so much because it revolutionized the world, so Idk it seems sketchy to bet on a company to create a world changing product when they haven't even said they would eventually make it.


There is a huge difference between making AI who does specific things like everyone else is making, and making and AI who can ACTUALLY think or be able to compute so many things that it ""feels"" like it thinks."

2021-05-12 12:51:44,wallstreetbets,"Look, obviously there are companies that go parabolic and have potential to eat the world. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple, Facebook, etc.

When they were founded, a lot of people were skeptical of how big they could grow.

Here’s the thing, they all grew through already created products, but people underestimated the power of those products.

In Palantir’s case, it’s not a belief that Foundry or Gotham have massive growth potential, it’s a belief that Palantir will somehow create *the* AI to rule them all in the future. Obviously, if they did, then it would be incredibly profitable and the stock would go parabolic.

 But the optimism isn’t based on their current product, just a hope that they invent a new product in the future. That’s fine, there are plenty of speculative companies out there like biotech or fission energy, that if they succeed will produce a lot of value.

But at least be real and acknowledge you are investing based on the speculation that they invent a new algorithm/AI/product."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$OPEN - Opendoor A sleeping giant after their earnings? Investor Presentation: [https://investor.opendoor.com/static-files/e3df73ec-4145-41e2-ab32-7093b36cb296](https://investor.opendoor.com/static-files/e3df73ec-4145-41e2-ab32-7093b36cb296)

Revenue for the quarter came in at **$747.27 million versus** the **consensus estimate of $620.18** million which is **200% revenue growth from Q4 2020**

Q1 EPS of ($0.48), in-line with the analyst estimate of ($0.48

By end of the year, # of markets will be doubled from last year

For the second quarter of 2021, revenue is expected to be between **$1.025 billion and $1.075 billion,** which represents **41% sequential growth over 1Q21** at the midpoint of the expected range. Adjusted EBITDA1  is expected to be between ($5) million and $5 million, which represents breakeven margin at the midpoint of the expected range

AND, Opendoor has about $**2 billion in cash.** If you follow the industry, you know that M&A is a real winner which will give them to expand even faster to additional markets.

I can't really think of many stocks that are better than Opendoor. Lots of potential here and it's at the price it jumped to on DA. It is more than 50%+ off of its highs and I think it represents a great buying opportunity as of right now.

What are your thoughts on the quarter and what do you think its price target is for the coming year and long term?"

2021-05-11 23:13:12,wallstreetbets,"I’m no professional but from my D.D. I believe that both companies OPEN especially is a trillion dollar company in the making. They are going to be the Amazon of the housing market. They will have to scale like crazy over the next 2-3 years but I see 15-20x from today’s price in 5 years.

PLTR I’m a little more conservative on, but if corporate use picks up on a global scale, this could be a 8-10x 3-5 year play. I’m not too worried about Stock Base Compensation either. There’s plenty of mouths to feed and public awareness continues to grow.

Bottom line I probably won’t sell these for a long time."
2021-05-11 23:52:44,wallstreetbets,Hmmm I guess I need to actually do more research on this than just knowing the RDFN app is better and around here it’s about even market share between them (for direct buys and neither one has anything remotely approaching more than a rounding error of market share).

2021-05-11 23:27:59,wallstreetbets,For the record. I’m a real estate agent. The business is broken and OPEN is the only plausible fix. IBuying is the future so I think long term that’s a great move for ya!
2021-05-11 23:28:43,wallstreetbets,"OPEN is definitely a 10xer. Remember it went public at 4 billion. Even Zillow which is not as good as Opendoor is at 30 billion. Opendoor I think by 2022 is at least 50-60 which is more than triple from here.

Palantir is an amazing play. It'll be a steady but great growth company. Maybe won't be 20x but can definitely 10x over 5 years. It'll be a massive company for sure."
2021-05-12 08:18:21,wallstreetbets,What would happen in the event of a housing market crash? Would there be any way for $OPEN to benefit from that?
2021-05-12 08:43:53,wallstreetbets,"I think a housing crash like that of 2008 is way less likely these days. However a 20% drop is definitely feasible for any number of reasons. I don’t think that would benefit them with current inventory, but acquisition wise they could scoop up tons of quality units in a vulnerable market. I think if they scale to the size they are aspiring too, they’re market diversity will protect them, especially if they go international."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME DD Since a few asked.

TL;DR: Slow deaths are so painful to witness.

Looking at what is dominating price movements:

https://preview.redd.it/9szig8rshly61.jpg?width=1099&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=51dc7ed4fe0a9dbc81080bb4363c7cb5b5c25eb0

Honestly - nothing, the options themselves are controlling the price. How?

https://preview.redd.it/0pt4jg58ily61.jpg?width=469&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=380f65467ff47d71acfaf48687a0faa2f5fb385f

This is volatility mapped against time. The characteristic 'pattern' of vol decrease is characteristics of what I call 'consumer dead stocks'. CCL performed like this for awhile post-2020 dipsies. Back when time's were simplier and tendies frolicked freely.

Anyways - volatility is decreasing and its the dominant force in the stock's price. What's that mean? Depends on where the options are:

https://preview.redd.it/vm7qid4jily61.jpg?width=1132&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e71d03985fd2ff0019e89273a4e461c190f3faf

Oh look - the only real position is 200,000 PUTS at 1$. What do these options do when volatility decreases in an environment where volatility is the dominant force? They cause hedge-selling. This is made worse when you look at how the option's deltas are changing with price decreases as well - they are delta hedged also by selling. So on both fronts: decreasing volatility and decreasing price are causing selling. Both of which are occurring. But not in a way that is significant for a downward squeeze - but a slow, menacing squeeze like the time you chaffed your wife's bf.

Is there threat of an upsqueeze? Lol. There are 187,581 calls compared to 905,192 puts. People can't even sell calls it seems - so I would say minimal.

TL;DR the TL;DR : GME is sinking into the abyss being held up only by whoever keeps mouth-to-mouthing it with their wendy's check.

This forum didn't always used to be like this. Their only argument is that you made an account yesterday. Yet you are a human who has existed off reddit with an unknown background for several decades and may have lurked here for a while. As the volume drops off, the price will too.

Hindenburg has been shorting $CLOV since FEBRUARY 4, 2021, and then a law suit against $CLOV appeared by Robbins LLP (lawyers), and guess who hired them: Hindenburg Hedge Fund [Hindenburg Robbins LLP](https://www.google.com/search?q=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&hl=en&biw=1280&bih=698&ei=bDCbYK36Dt-90PEP5quV8A8&oq=hindenburg+robbins+LLP&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAM6BwgAEEcQsAM6CggAEJECEEYQ-QE6CwguEMcBEK8BEJECOggILhDHARCjAjoCCAA6BAgAEEM6BQgAEJECOgQILhBDOgIILjoGCAAQFhAeOgUIIRCgAToICCEQoAEQiwM6BQghEKsCOgcIIRAKEKABUMZTWLmtAWCvsAFoBHACeACAAZwBiAHPE5IBBDE2LjmYAQCgAQGqAQdnd3Mtd2l6sAEAyAEIuAECwAEB&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwit4P78_8LwAhXfHjQIHeZVBf4Q4dUDCA4&uact=5)

Since then they have been bombarding with press releases of $CLOV being under investigation (misleading title as if the FBI or SEC is investigating).

If you read about the lawsuit, it's all about the SPAC merger, because as far as it comes to CLOV, there are no problems. 

The fundamentals are strong with CLOV still growing in the hundreds of millions per quarter (not $500,000 like MVIS) and the technicals show that it can't get any lower.

Hindenburg taking a large stance against spacs, had made them overlook $CLOV  as an actual success, and they are spending a lot of money to try and cover their shorts,

CLOV is the real deal when in comes to a squeeze because it actually has value. If there is no unity behind this, it means that the whole movement stopped with GME and AMC and that is all for stonks (at least for me). 

I myself am invested with 1200 shares at  an average of $9.20  and it is currently at $7.95, so i am feeling the shit, but we shall see on this Monday's earning call who actually won?"

2021-05-12 04:12:51,wallstreetbets,The upside potential vs downside is immense. This could very well decline further but I doubt with the growth they will be receiving under current circumstances
2021-05-12 07:15:32,wallstreetbets,"Hindenburg isn't even a hedge fund.... it's a private research firm that is hired by hedge funds to do research/short reports... It's been linked to a shady office and the whole DOJ investigation is likely a scam....but you're likely going to contribute to people losing a lot of money...

To anyone who is going all in on CLOV - go for it. But please please please, buy shares - and if you're going to bet your life's savings that the stock will go up.... at least buy some puts to hedge yourself against the worst."

2021-05-12 02:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I'm fine even if it doesn't squeeze, this will likely be a 5-10 bagger in the long term, but you gotta be patient since most of the largest profit improvements will happen several years out as they improve the health of their population with their care.

I'm hoping we do see an incredible squeeze after their earnings report but even if we don't I'm fine with holding for 5+ years to see this through. This is like TSLA at $25. Short sellers constantly shitting on them and coming up with bullshit."
2021-05-12 08:07:30,wallstreetbets,"The lawsuit is BS too. Everyday the news sites keep pushing it from rando law firms. Anyway with you shoulder to shoulder @8000 shares @ $8.17

2021-05-12 02:37:28,wallstreetbets,"Hmm according to the disclosure in Hindenburg's short report, they mentioned they have no position in $CLOV though; do you have any evidence that Hindenburg is currently shorting $CLOV?"
2021-05-12 08:42:28,wallstreetbets,Sounds legit. I’m in.
2021-05-11 23:17:54,wallstreetbets,im expecting the stock to drop on earnings. im long on this though so ill be buying some more
2021-05-12 00:36:35,wallstreetbets,"Even if Hindenburg is right, it's ripe for a ass gaping squeeze. Learned this the hard way buying Puts on HLF back in 2014. I still think it's a pyramid scheme and Bill Spacman was right... But Goddamn frauds can last a long ass fucking time. It's basically a legitimate business model if you do it right."
2021-05-12 02:48:13,wallstreetbets,"A lot of the negative comments are related to the SPAC history and I am all ears, but what about $CLOV itself?  

Even though I am a bag holder, I prefer liquidating my position if I am convinced that I  was fooled, but I still can'r help believing in it. 

To one of the comments below: I do believe that they will do good for our elderly. Just check their team,

I am still biased towards it being a hit, but i encourage everyone to do their own DD, and if possible to post here. I myself might change my position based on the comments. 

I believe in probabilities and in probabilities the majority rules."
2021-05-12 04:30:18,wallstreetbets,"Also long on CLOV. Bought in at what right now is something like an $9.40ish cost basis? Spread out over a series of buys. Would have loved more at $7.60 but was busy at the DMV with car registration. 

&#x200B;

I'm taking Hindenburg's report with a grain of salt. I think they have a future ahead of them. If there is an ongoing investigation and it clears CLOV then I think we'll be in good territory. Till then I think they will exist in a weird state of limbo."
2021-05-12 06:46:32,wallstreetbets,I’ve got an order for another 500 ready in the queue.

$CLOV is also a genomics company. Which is huge both from a treatment perspective and also a cost savings perspective. From a financial perspective CLOV could be leveraged to test new treatments or transition in to the role of a pharmaceuticals company.

whole interview is worth a watch. This thing will go past 100 eventually and likely will go through a short squeeze."
2021-05-12 01:58:43,wallstreetbets,Did you actually read that report? How could you support clov after looking into the accusations? They are literally defrauding people out of money and making the healthcare system worse. Why do you hate old people? Why do you hate a company that is trying to get assholes out of the system? Hindenburg is doing us all a favor here
2021-05-11 22:37:53,wallstreetbets,Stop promoting this fucking SPAC you fucking cunt.
2021-05-12 02:06:44,wallstreetbets,Fundamentals are strong with CLOV?  A company that has only 90 millions of liquidity? Good luck
2021-05-12 04:19:31,wallstreetbets,"Hindenburg likely. did not hire the law firm.  These are class action lawyers that race to the courthouse for any and every reason— Robbins has sued many companies — Root etc - that had nothing to do with Hindenburg.  These class action lawyers wait for negative reports — short sellers, analysts and just file lawsuits — they are paid on contingency on behalf of class that lost money.  A successful short seller who made money would have no standing to sue."
2021-05-12 09:05:07,wallstreetbets,Looks like Hindenburg & Robbins went after all the damn EV companies.

And yeah alot of them I can see why because frankly they are bullshit companies like Ebang and Nikola.  But they listed something about journalistic credibility or some verbiage as why they dont have a position to shorting clover.  Then their next fucking report on Lordstown lo and behold they disclose shorting it.

You can go read the report its the same shit claims you could levy at any insurance provider the difference being Clover got funded by Chicken Masala or whatever his name is."

I actually read that all of the big insurers have an  average of 7 million  medicare members while CLOV has only 50,000 members, and that apparently CLOV had actually disrupted the way Medicaid is handled. However I am all open ears and I am not against  a negative position on CLOV. It is a bet though, and I have to make a decision soon."
2021-05-12 07:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Lol yeah all the other providers have exactly no history oncesoever of medicare or Medicaid fraud.  The entire fucking business is modeled on overbilling the government its all scumbags from the top down. 

You want the moralist investment go put your money into one of those fake EV companies that are going to change the planet."
2021-05-12 13:32:03,wallstreetbets,LOL that report sounded like a child telling someone how flames on their bike make it go faster. They have no clue how the health payer system works
2021-05-11 23:03:48,wallstreetbets,"It's a good play if their earnings are good.

Given what happened to other insurer claim rates last quarter, it should be easy for them to improve their earnings if their software and leadership are halfway decent.

Options are dirt cheap, and the stock has already been beaten down, so it's a pretty low risk play at this point."

2021-05-12 13:30:25,wallstreetbets,The collusion between Hindenburg and the lawsuits certainly suggest they have some sort of interest in the stock going down. More likely they were paid to write the report by someone else. They called that report in though. It is pitiful
2021-05-12 12:27:13,wallstreetbets,"Yea the healthcare system is crap.  Friend has ACA Fidelis just keeps it as doctors take it.  Garipalli ran private for profit hospitals into the ground dealing with  a lot of private insurances — and minimal updating to equipment and all — and these hospitals were in some decent areas — not like Camden and only having Medicaid patients.

Clover is for the founders and execs to make more money — not for value for policy holders, not shareholders — they are a means to the end.  

Medicare is more rigid and regulated but they pay steadily.  But why get a mediocre plan for policy holder?

CLOV calls themselves as innovative technology company which is a joke— it is a crappy health insurance company with a program"

For example, last week I swing traded some amc $7 calls. Sure, they were like $200 a piece. But the chance that it would drop below $7 and not pop back up by may 28 was pretty low. Now I'm just kicking myself for selling them at a small profit instead now that they are worth atleast $100 more per contract now lol.

i only gamble with otm calls if they can be gotten for like $0.10 or so. And I don't hold until expiration. I try to ditch them on someone else the Wednesday before. Plus I'm just buying a handful, not yoloing my entire portfolio"

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"SDC DD For you my man u/truth2252

I'm actually kicking myself slightly - SDC popped up on my radar a few weeks ago but I was too lazy to follow up. 

SDC experienced quite a price drop, probably mitigated by two main forces that are seen quite often: a seemingly strategic interplay between short coverings and option hedging.

Let's take a look at the past to see the future:

https://preview.redd.it/qc9b2o139ly61.jpg?width=1110&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a701def051c9dfd922571a8010df1b5e777fbf9b

https://preview.redd.it/lrm5w4j79ly61.jpg?width=1118&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e265cd292a0f24f7f687f770b234cd2867ffec0a

Notice anything? The price was steadily dropping since \~mid January during which time a short squeeze was produced. The price drop was also good for covering the shorts that were produced then:

https://preview.redd.it/v0d0yh3l9ly61.jpg?width=1115&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=be525cbbba60d90014afaa7ef1c4180db4bc5060

This was a stable-decline it seems as volatility was decreasing as well with a peaceful glide down. Until April when volatility started to rise. Did the shorts become difficult to cover due to stalling in price-action? Did the increase in shorting cause volatility to rise? Did someone ask to speak to the manager? Who knows. 

A clue is the large chunk of options that are placed at $10. Typically a stock that is shorted with relatively 'decent' amounts, and has a large chunk of options at a particular strike further down the slide will glide towards that price-point (In this case $10). Having over-shorted and ITM long calls is a dangerous combo but if the stock can glide down past $10, while keeping volatility low - the hedges get covered and the ITM calls become OTM. All's well in the option's universe. 

This was disrupted it seems sometime mid-april when volatility started to rise: causing those ITM calls to have to be hedged via purchasing. Not ideal. In any case moves were moved, decisions made, deals with the devil made, and the price snapped back below $10 (opportunistic hedging lumped into one mass play? Who knows I'm not fucking nostradomus). May (the) 4th (be) with (you) saw a huge price drop (\~20%) and almost complete resolution of liquidity issues (IV plummeted). 

Now, volatility is nice and minimal, option placements indicate healthy environment. So I would expect a steady increase back up to at least $10. But that $10 wall (\~200,000 calls) may keep things mellow for the the being.

TL;DR: 20210521C8"

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TRQ - Turquoise Hill - Undervalued Copper Mine Play PE: 10.49 Pretty low for a copper, since copper just hit an all time high.

 One of the largest copper mines in the world and it's still trading stupid low. I posted about this one here a month or 2 ago and it has went up quite a bit since, but were hitting critical mass here. 

There is some mild drama between the govt. Of Mongolia and Rio tinto (the largest shareholder of this stock) but this company is cranking copper. Many think the drama has to do with political posturing, since Mongolia elections are in June. 

The upside of this stock is insane IMO. It has a ton of copper in the ground and it sits just a few miles from the China border. There are no big copper mines in this P.E. range. Copper is the new gold (electric vehicles etc). 

This is a lotto ticket, but it has a high probability of hitting. 10x very easy short term."

My thesis is consistent with yours.  

How I'm playing it however is a leveraged play through Entree Resources (ETG:TO).  Current share price = $0.82 CAD.

What makes this play interesting is their JV interest in the large copper/gold development in Mongolia. The mining license is majority held by Turquoise Resources / Mongolia govt.  Rio Tinto is also involved.

To make things more interesting, Entree has large insider ownership between Sandstorm Gold (22%) Turquoise Hill (8%) and Rio Tinto (9%), as of February.  A bunch more insider buying has occurred and these numbers are higher (Sandstorm for sure).  Big leverage."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"$WELL $WLYYF | WELL Health TA Follow Up - Record Earnings Reported Hey guys, after my last post got some great feedback and people seemed to be getting value out of it I decided to do a follow up today as the company posted record earnings today. 

Beyond the obvious, that is significant to me for 3 core reasons. 

1. It's a direct sign that the companies aggressive M&A Activity is paying off
2. Building a strong support on the 200day sma.
3. Morning action shook out weak hands & Traders 

We saw a typical sell the news event this morning as the bears won the morning session but that didn't last long as the bulls came in strong and took the final victory closing near the HOD. 

Diving into the charts, I still believe we are in a very similar area to March of 2020 for 2 main reasons. 

1. The company started announcing aggressive M&A activity at that time which they are doing again at scale now. 
2. The technicals are lining up to be nearly identical after this consolidation in the $7-$8 range. 

Again, zooming out here I am seeing a few interesting things immediately. I still believe WELL is forming a large flag and potentially an ascending triangle after the long consolidation and 2 most recent closes. The RSI forming a double bottom followed by a higher low + volume increase would further suggest that it could be close to a major breakout out of this range. It needs to now build support above the 50 day sma just below $8 to finally breakout above this range. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/x8sltapc2ly61.png?width=2856&format=png&auto=webp&s=dd9ba06283c65f608408fb4fe97e5048041f0f74

Prior to March 2020 the company saw a major consolidation period followed by a slight downturn with the rest of the market which led to a run from $2- $4 - $6 - $8 and beyond. Again we are saying a major consolidation period followed by a slight downturn in the market with a huge increase in M&A activity which ultimately led to the last huge breakout which would put us at $7 - $14 - $21 - $28 respectively. 

Not to mention, the RSI has not been this low since that date and we are now seeing it coil up again further signalling a potential breakout coming. Especially with the short interest on it. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/a53d8npi2ly61.png?width=2708&format=png&auto=webp&s=8c92d0a2744627155ffcc001ee2dffd406c1d27f

Zooming in slightly, we see the 04/23 low set the bottom but also saw it closing on the 200day SMA. Since that day, WELL has made higher lows and has again closed above the 200day SMA when tested with it. Confluences in the RSI as well as we saw the double bottom followed by a higher low.  I think we have a strong support at this level and are making a strong base for the next major move up. 

&#x200B;

Now let's get into what you degens really care about - short term price action. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/34mg6m5r2ly61.png?width=2418&format=png&auto=webp&s=6d0fb84fd7afc703c36c55f23d13a97ec0e9981e

Since 04/23 WELL has been forming a large bull flag that it looks ready to break out of. As the market took a turn it naturally followed and was unable to break above the 200sma on any day until yesterday when it closed strong above it.

 Like I said, this morning seemed like a typical sell the news event but that only makes me more bullish, look how strong it wicked at the 50 day SMA after being pushed below the 20day- The selling pressure was gone in 30 minutes and the bulls controlled the rest of the session putting it again above the 20 & 200day SMA for a strong close and base for a potentially great week. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/4rd4c7b23ly61.png?width=2612&format=png&auto=webp&s=392757dff50970cdac9d7495a7511fdb07c8fd31

I have a feeling some shorts were pissed! WELL was closing near the HOD before someone decided to sell off into the bid to show a red close. I laugh at these attempts, I think the shorts just do it so they can sleep better at night because even they must know it does nothing besides help us tomorrow. Especially since it put us right on the 20day SMA. STRONG CLOSE. 

Now to look for similarities... 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/qld255qd3ly61.png?width=2596&format=png&auto=webp&s=0398301d004ba47bc17b53a60ed9919e2acdddbe

Zooming back out, we see confluences on the daily as the 200day SMA turned into strong support with the 20 & 50 day sma left to hit. If that trend line extended it would be 7.4 and that 50day SMA sits around 7.6 - This is where I think the next support will be. 

I believe that with todays strong price action after a relatively weak morning, and the bullish divergence in the RSI which is still below 50% but heading in the right direction that WELL is going to turn this short term resistance into support and finally break out of this $8 range once and for all. 

https://preview.redd.it/bbwcq3ay1ly61.png?width=2188&format=png&auto=webp&s=e9653123b713956fbce097fc9d3eb2edad465fde

Once that $7.6-7.8 level becomes support (50daySMA) I think it's going to be a quick break through $8 as it did when the stock broke through $2 for the first time. 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/0e9tq2064ly61.png?width=2594&format=png&auto=webp&s=012bf6ab79db458ef53db8083da51efba2766b66

Aside from all the other reasons I believe the stock is in a similar position to March 2020 it is also having its first green week in what was mostly red which was the clear turnaround (1st green week) that took WELL from under $2 to just under $4 in a few months. 

I'm no genius but I do spend a damn long time looking at charts and coming up with these ideas and hope that it inspires others to do the same regardless if i'm right or wrong. 

Just about everything here is telling me that WELL is about to see that $2-$4-$6-$8 + style move but this time from $7-$14-$21-$28 and beyond... Which I admit sounds a bit crazy but as one of the people on my last post mentioned, the ceo has publicly stated that he thinks this will be a $50bn company so that would be a double from those levels lol. 

I WILL BE DCA INTO THIS OVER THE WEEK\*\*\*\*"

""

 United Wholesale CEO: Our hardball tactic against Dan Gilbert firm a big success \[Detroit Free Press\]

BY Tribune Content Agency 05/11/2021

United Wholesale Mortgage CEO Mat Ishbia said Tuesday that his controversial ultimatum that forced mortgage brokers to pick between his firm or Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies has been a big success for UWM.

""I couldn’t have imagined it going so well,"" Ishbia, 41, said during an earnings call with Wall Street analysts. ""Obviously my competitors, they don’t like the decision, but our business is not designed to make them like us.""

Ishbia's ultimatum required brokers by March 15 to stop working with Detroit-based Rocket and a Wisconsin-based competitor, Fairway Independent Mortgage Corp., if they wished to continue working with UWM.

The ultimatum was a threat to Rocket because even though Quicken Loans is highly profitable and the nation's No. 1 mortgage lender by overall business, it trails UWM in the key segment of underwriting loans for independent mortgage brokers. UWM is the leader in that segment, known as wholesale mortgage lending.

UWM said that of the roughly 12,000 brokers that it did business with before the ultimatum, about 600 refused to sign the pledge and 1,000 didn't respond. Many mortgage industry observers called the tactic an ultimatum, although Ishbia refers to it as UWM's ""all-in"" initiative.

One measure of the tactic's success is that in April, the remaining brokers submitted 17,000 more loan applications to UWM than it received from brokers in February, according to Ishbia, ""so massive, massive adoption.""

Overall, UWM reported a first quarter net income, or profit, of $860 million compared with $20.3 million during the same quarter a year ago and $1.37 billion in the fourth quarter of 2020. About 75% of UWM's first quarter mortgages were home purchase loans, versus 25% mortgage refinancings.

UWM went public Jan. 22 on the New York Stock Exchange through a special-purpose acquisition company. Despite its profits, UWM's stock price has slumped and was at $6.68 as of early Tuesday afternoon.

'Do the right thing'

Ishbia hasn't accused Rocket or Fairway of any illegal behavior. He told analysts Tuesday that his ultimatum was a response to how ""those two other lenders are actually trying to hurt the broker channel. ... So we decided to do the right thing and make this decision.”

More: Dan Gilbert's Rocket Companies sees $2.7B first quarter profit

Brokers who didn't stop working with Rocket were to pay ""damages"" of $50,000 or possibly more if they still wished to work with UWM.

Rocket didn't immediately respond Tuesday to a request for comment on Ishbia's latest remarks. The company previously denounced Ishbia's ultimatum as anticompetitive and reducing choices available to consumers.

The ultimatum prompted a Florida mortgage broker last month to sue UWM and Ishbia in federal court, for a potential class-action lawsuit, accusing them of antitrust violations.

The lawsuit called Ishbia's tactic ""a desperate attempt to stifle competition"" and claimed that since UWM went public UWM's competitors in wholesale lending, including Rocket and Fairway Mortgage, had grown their market share by offering better pricing and lower rates to mortgage brokers, ""which in turn led to lower rates for consumers/prospective borrowers.""

The lawsuit seeks class-action status and was brought by Florida broker Daniel Okavage of The Okavage Group, which didn't sign on to UWM's ultimatum and therefore had its business relationship with UWM terminated.

UWM has declined comment on the pending litigation.

Refinancing activity amid historically low interest rates pushed the U.S. mortgage industry to a near record year in 2020.

However, the industry is forecast to contract 14% this year as interest rates rise slightly higher, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association.

Rocket Companies ( [RKT](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=RKT) ) last week reported a nearly $2.8 billion profit in the first quarter, or slightly below its fourth quarter 2020 earnings.

2021-05-12 02:22:01,wallstreetbets,Okay for anyone who hasn’t applied for a mortgage recently or don’t have friends who are MLO’s here is the problem with rocket that Mat is pointing out. If you as a customer get a price for rocket through a broker. Rocket will then send a mailer to you directing you to apply on their website. Essentially allowing rocket to pocket the commissions even after all this Bullshit. Their rates are not the best whatsoever. UWMC new america and another company all had better rates than rocket meanwhile their profit margins are slimmer. My theory is rocket has significantly higher overhead cost. UWMC ended up being my go to due to the ease of closing and the best rate even got cash back as opposed to paying points... As a customer I would choose UWMC again any day and thats why UWMC will win. Rocket’s high overhead undercutting brokers and poor customer service will ultimately take them out from #1

2021-05-11 21:28:56,wallstreetbets,GME has been the worst thing to happen around here because everyone thinks a stock is going to squeeze just because there is short interest. Some companies straight up deserve to be shorted.
2021-05-12 09:22:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks
2021-05-12 08:59:51,wallstreetbets,Thanks. for your reassurance. That is one school; another is buy high and sell higher; third school is never double up on a losing position. At this point me confused ( sitting on a big paper loss in RKT).
2021-05-12 13:08:54,wallstreetbets,The interest to borrow shares is almost 26 percent for uwmc rn and yet only 5000 shares are available mate. This is with a share buyback authorized for basically half the float.
2021-05-11 22:08:48,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Some do. Not UWMC though. Company put up strong numbers, and the buyback is specifically targeted to put pressure on shorting. 

It’s not a meme stock like GME or AMC."
2021-05-12 09:24:13,wallstreetbets,I don’t even like rocket but their price is almost at a point I would buy in.
2021-05-11 22:19:23,wallstreetbets,CEO sounds like an idiot publicly stating he is asking for payments from brokers who deal with RKT and other mortgage companies if they want to continue business with United.
2021-05-11 22:31:12,wallstreetbets,"I don't know about how much pressure it will put on shorts.  Since they went public via Spac their stock has dropped like a rock. High was $14.38 and they are under $7 right now.

Rkt already tried to squeeze shorts with a special dividend and it work for about 2 days. Today they hit their all time low and I sure hope it pops back up to $20 or the calls I bought in June are toast."

I don’t care about personality beefs between rich CEOs. I’m here to make money on stocks."
2021-05-11 23:10:48,wallstreetbets,"Well, if it squeezes, you gotta sell before it comes back down of course. Then buy low again if you want. 

We’ll see what happens. UWMC was green today and AH. Buybacks probably start tomorrow. 

I’m fine to ride the stock for a while because I think it’s too low. But if it squeezes, I’ll try to sell at the top (or close to it). I just think the opportunity is there when looking at the heavy shorting plus buyback plan plus tons of price targets that range from 9-14, all above the current price."
2021-05-11 22:44:10,wallstreetbets,I agree with you.  I just wanna make money.  I just don’t think it will work out well legally.  We will see what happens!
2021-05-11 23:06:52,wallstreetbets,"Yep. I can’t tell the future, and I could always be wrong. I just think the stocks been beaten down too far, and the buyback is a bullish sign."
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Cleveland Cliffs CLF commodity super cycle play. Hello boys and girls since my last post CLF has raised it's price tag by a large margin. To those who bought in on my previous post congratulations! For those of you who have yet to buy in let me give you some more Information as to why you should. My position is 237 shares and 20 call options spread throughout the year.

Ill point you to the same chart I did last time [https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel](https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel) as you can see it still shows 0 sign of slowing down anytime soon. But aside from this chart lets talk about some recent events to prove why this chart is true.

&#x200B;

**Berkshire hathaway share holder meeting**

Warren Buffet himself talked about how they keep seeing raising commodity prices. He talked about how steel prices kept going up everyday. He used the example that general motors has to keep paying more for steel everyday. He said the economy is red hot!

**China steel rebate officially drops to 0%**

[https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate](https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/042821-china-removes-vat-rebate-on-steel-exports-cuts-tax-on-raw-material-imports-to-zero) previously I spoke about how China was just talking about this being a possibility of this happening. However this has now happened. It being so recent it has yet to really have a massive effect on steel trade. However as the last of many companies steel reserves go empty they are going to have to eventually purchase more from China. This will not only increase China's export profitability since many countries were trying to compete with China's steel prices they will no longer have to and be able to keep marking prices up as the super cycle continues through the year. No more price competition on steel will simply drive prices further through the roof since ""cheap steel"" no longer exists.

**Steel demand continually on the rise while supply cannot keep up with demand.**

[https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand](https://www.hellenicshippingnews.com/worldsteel-raises-2021-steel-demand-growth-forecast-to-5-8/) Another very recent article talking about how steel demand is affecting multiple sectors in the industry. Covid-19 put a large halt on steel demand now that the great reopening is happening across many countries demand is revving up as steel mills have to ramp up production to the nines because they did not produce as heavily in a low demand market.

**Summer construction season.**

Many roads and bridges as we all know are worked on exclusively in the summer months. Not many companies have large reserves of rebar just lying around. As time goes on the prices are only going to go higher. These companies will have no choice other than to pay these ridiculous prices. Creating stronger demand as we go into these summer months.

**CLF beat Q1 earnings expectations**

Just a little icing on the cake [https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland](https://www.bizjournals.com/cleveland/news/2021/04/22/cleveland-cliffs.html) they beat expected earnings by 2 cents EPS. Next quarter is expected to be even higher please stay tuned!"
2021-05-11 20:49:28,wallstreetbets,"So what you are saying is even though I just put my 2 weeks in at CLF cause my boss is a bitch, I should yolo 100% into CLF cause I’m about to be jobless and blowing dudes behind Wendy’s to pay the mortgage."
2021-05-11 21:11:07,wallstreetbets,Could say the same about Nucor. That's my favorite steel company right now. Made 150% on calls last week! Another poster turned $890 into something like 9k last week.

2021-05-11 22:48:08,wallstreetbets,Glad to see this now that I work for Cleveland Cliffs. They purchased my steel plant that was formerly Arcelor/Mittal. So far it has been a good experience.
2021-05-11 21:22:31,wallstreetbets,On my watch list for weeks. Always think about buying when it dips a little. Unfortunately share price says no. I know it will dip when I buy it. Guess that is the way.
2021-05-11 21:36:09,wallstreetbets,Hey man. I bought in with your fist one. Thanks!!!
2021-05-12 19:53:31,wallstreetbets,"Out of interest, any reason you single out $CLF compare to say $X or $NUE?"

2021-05-11 23:19:06,wallstreetbets,Still time for CLF? I’m always worried I’m too late.
2021-05-11 21:41:31,wallstreetbets,"Yah 
Well. I very new to this. A month in with chump change. 1k. 
Saw your post bought clf and bought a few as one of my first purchases. Made a couple dollars got excited. Sold all then bought fubo and rocket blasted tofay. Think I’m going to sell all that in the am then and go back into clf to casually keep growing till I see something else that will blast off. 
I need to slow my ass down and form a strategy."
2021-05-12 09:36:07,wallstreetbets,"What a bullshit tactic, I don't like companies that pull that move. Demand severance from those jamokes!"

2021-05-11 23:21:55,wallstreetbets,I'm buying more tomorrow
2021-05-11 22:33:21,wallstreetbets,You should or one of these isn't going to work out for you.
2021-05-12 09:38:34,wallstreetbets,New job will just let me start earlier now so nbd!
2021-05-12 09:40:21,wallstreetbets,✊ that's what's up. Good for you and good luck on your next endeavor 👍
2021-05-12 09:40:49,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, thank you!!"
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"TSLA DD You guys couldn't suck Elon harder if he gave you a bottle of poppers while centrifuging you in some lab somewhere. 

In which case - you might as well know how he's been bamboozaling you. I'ma give you a peek at the full picture that is $TSLA

Looking at the dominating factors that are driving price action:

https://preview.redd.it/j7hzfv77xky61.jpg?width=1068&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=713fabe75a667f7e2ba165f3af95d0d0a36a5684

Now you might well pause and go ""wow Mr. HG um it sure looks like when your purple (best color) is predictive of price"" and you'd be correct. How is it predictive? Squiggles = squiggles obviously mind your business (or send me a message and we can talk about option nerd shit).

In any case as it is now, the stock price is being dominant by options' gamma. This is particularly concerning given its current state, more on that below.

Looking at the expected moves recently:

https://preview.redd.it/8ukyrc0sxky61.jpg?width=1100&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0290c477d1d9bcd21fa8450d4c4e0e266d44826a

Here we see its been doing any and everything possible via hedging to just break even at the bottom band that is associated with expected daily market moves by the option's dealers. Go below that band and things get c R a Z Y .  Its been dipping below that band huh?

But that isn't even the fun part about this stock - no. Not in the least. But baby steps. Then we look at the options landscape:

https://preview.redd.it/mpf2j2b1yky61.jpg?width=1128&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9a044161fc0b38dd28adf258daa47e67d6267538

What a weird activity it must be for some, buying or selling 250,000 1$ puts on a $600 stock. 

TSLA has never really been a shorted stock recently so no use looking at that data its pretty benign. 

But let's tie it all together with this statistic: APPROXIMATELY 10% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER LONG. What does that mean? It means APPROXIMATELY 90% OF ALL OTM CALLS ARE DEALER SHORT. 

Why is that an issue?

Ya'll love gamma squeezes. Currently TSLA has arppox. the following:

https://preview.redd.it/t53whiyiyky61.jpg?width=1011&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2c84a5a079337ff0b53605b9b2e755f97e53fc36

This equates to: for every 1 point decrease in price, 1.5 Million shares have to be sold. I'll repeat that so you slow fucking dunces can get it in your heads. Y'ALL BOUGHT SO MANY CALLS THAT IT IS NOW NEGATIVE GAMMA EXPOSED TO THE ORDER OF 1.5 MILLION SHARES PER POINT. 

The issue being that with positive price days (like today) there had to be 27million shares purchased to hedge the options - but the liquidity isn't, and has never really, been there for this.(Also - if 27million shares had to be purchased just from gamma, how much of today was *really* investor confidence?). This caused volatility to rise. What happens when volatility rises? Oh the options have to be hedged again with 3.5million shares of selling. Thus any upside is hindered, and downside propagated.

That might explain why volatility has recently sky-rocketed (it is not normal to have \~+10% vol in 3days, kids). Has it entered the doom-spiral? Hard to say. The only benefit is with decreases in volatility, approximately 3.5million options have to be hedged via  purchasing; this occurs lately when the price drops. This does provide a bit of cushion for the stock. 

But right now TSLA is in a precarious position. 

TL;DR: THE DIP AINT HERE YET AMIGOS"
2021-05-11 20:43:58,wallstreetbets,There is nothing about TSLA stock that makes sense. The cult following makes it impossible to predict price action at this point.

2021-05-11 21:08:47,wallstreetbets,"I don’t treat Tesla as a car maker. Otherwise it would be $50 max. It’s the future of energy and wall street is treating it this way. Between batteries, million miles story , rooftops etc, etc. 
more exciting is the amount of data collection they have for self driving cars, gas or electric. No company in the world has their data and they can leverage that over their sales. Options with Tesla is dumb. I lost money and made some too. The key is the stock itself. Only time will tell but I am buying the stock."

Tesla investor since 2010 here.

Please point out in your FUD spewing that 

\- your mention of large positions of $1 puts is not unusual for TSLA, happens all the time 

\- your mention of the $1 puts is out of context, the $1 put position is for 6/18, not this weeks expiry

Bought TSLA on the covid dip near the bottom at $400, sold earlier this year at $800.  It’s nowhere near some of you GME millionaires but it was a 10xer and I’ll take that every time.  I’ll buy the dip again when it feels time to jump."
2021-05-11 20:17:51,wallstreetbets,I don’t think the dip is here yet. IMO tesla is gonna go to close to $400 a share. And if it does I’m risking everything on it. There will be a margin call unlike the world has never seen before

Its verified against multiple sources of authority of different aspects throughout the calculation to ensure efficacy."
2021-05-12 00:03:38,wallstreetbets,"So in instances wherein you have an over-all increase in volatility, not only are the long-theta options most sensitive, that sensitivity becomes compounded. Furthermore, since the quantity of that pool of options is so large, it ends up having a larger-than-anticipated effect on price movement.

So in instances wherein you have an over-all increase in sensitivity to volatility (not the same as just a general increase *in* volatility), not only are the long-theta options most sensitive, that sensitivity becomes compounded. Furthermore, since the quantity of that pool of options is so large, it ends up having a larger-than-anticipated effect on price movement.

So in this case, with IV increasing on an already high IV stock, and with negative gamma occurring the long-theta, long-delta puts provide increase downwards pressure.

I'm well aware of negative gamma squeeze! But I appreciate the suggestion."
2021-05-11 22:03:40,wallstreetbets,Nice ! That’s awesome. Good job finding great entry and exit points. That’s always the hardest
2021-05-11 20:35:04,wallstreetbets,The problem is there is no real indication for how much the downside might be! The only thing I can say is I have seen the *large* quantities of $1 puts on other *suspect* stocks before and it doesn't tend to bold well.
2021-05-11 20:54:25,wallstreetbets,Ha no idea man. I’ve no idea how real people do stocks.
2021-05-11 20:53:16,wallstreetbets,Not terrible but volatility is so unpredictable with TSLA!

2021-05-11 20:43:20,wallstreetbets,"You clearly did this in R so my guess is you downloaded historical options data and looked at price relative to bid and ask for trades, then looked to see how many of those orders were closed via the opposite order side by the end of the day, and you probably tweak the final estimates by regressing the estimates on OI change and IV change at the end of the day. But I hope you know that as long as you want to keep your secrets, none of us here can trust anything you're saying."
2021-05-11 22:11:36,wallstreetbets,"Entry point was gut alone. It felt like the market, given that it had lost around 30% at that point, was ripe for people to be like “Ok time to shop while there’s a sale” I had cash ready and loaded up on more individual stocks than I typically have.  The exit point was a begrudgingly placed stop loss. It obvious wasn’t worth $800-900 especially after the split but once it broke that $800 AGAIN I sold enough to make 100% on my initial investment.  Then I put the stop in and let it ride. One day soon after I got a notification from Fidelity that my TSLA had sold. Simultaneously bummed that the rocket ride was over and happy for the mound of cash that I did next to nothing for lol."

2021-05-11 21:49:05,wallstreetbets,"Tesla is already priced like it’s achieved all the things you’ve claimed. 650 fucking billion. Here’s a secret: Bill Hwang, who seeded Cathie Woods, squeezed the fuck out of Tsla shorts, leading to its ridiculous price. Well, Hwang is dead and gone and Tsla and Arkk will soon follow. 📉"
2021-05-11 20:32:17,wallstreetbets,"So basically, options dealers buy/sell options and make money in doing so. They supply us normies with options. 

TSLA is currently in a position where if you take all the options that have been bought/sold on it, it shows signs that when the price drops, large quantities of stock have to be sold. 

This is an issue: if the price is dropping and that causes more stock to be sold, then the price drops more. 

TSLA is basically the anti-GME at this point: in stead of squeezing up, its squeezing down."

2021-05-11 20:52:23,wallstreetbets,"Mmm not quite. Although I'll store your suggestion in my back pocket as a contingency.

There are two main ways you can look to see if an option is long or short: 1 is to purchase the daily-tape, cross-verify the placements of the options with the open interest per option throughout the day which will give you the long/short ratios. and 2 is to circumvent that process and find someone who does it for you. 

I do number 2 in part: I find the person who takes the tape, parses through it and produces a value. However this value is directionless and reduced by 1 dimension. Its like saying ""On Tuesday I bought 3 apples and Wednesday I sold 5"" versus ""I have -2 apple"". The latter statement is useful but it is reduced and cannot be unpacked.

That is unless you do some, can I say it if I created it?, creative mathematics. In doing so, I can produce the ratios of long/short itm/otm options and then match them against several sources. From there I can find the distribution that most closely matches an aggregate of two sources based off of several associated values. It is computationally quite expensive but worth it as the raw data is expensive (tens of thousands a month) and bulky. And that is just the foundation of the process: once you've established the ratios that most closely match (I only accept values that are <10 %-different, with the mean around 3% with my current methodology - but this can be improved upon if you want to spend more computing time) you can start having a lot of fun."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"PLTR DD PART 2 Suppers ready

Good news for some of you on the PLTR earnings report. I suppose you'll be interested in knowing what happened to the stock.

https://preview.redd.it/qwsurb22tky61.jpg?width=1057&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=093e0d476e651e4bcece86ae9f8b96238e4a374a

Here we see some squiggles. It shows that the stock's underlying price movement is becoming less influenced by Gamma and more by \*insert hand waves\* other factors. What other factors? Wouldn't you like to know. But typically gamma is healthy so I wonder if the other factors are less so.

So then we look at the short interest volume. With such a large price jump - did people increase short selling or decrease? Were these shorts a part of options dealings? Were they MM shorting in the dark market? Who knows.

https://preview.redd.it/u9vivncftky61.jpg?width=1069&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da7488cc42dde49754c6ba599ac23cb6c33dcf11

Slight increase but I wouldn't say uber substantial. But it definitely isn't a decrease.

Looking at the options:

https://preview.redd.it/pk3sz1mqtky61.jpg?width=1049&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b44948c90a0f58bd3122e7f15d1f45cfef5fe27c

With a larger-than-expected increase in price, lots of options switched hands, mainly at the $20 at which \~150,000 calls became ITM and \~200,000 puts became OTM. Oof to those bag holders.

But the real interest is in how the options landscape changed. Yesterday's options:/

https://preview.redd.it/hbdu3y31uky61.jpg?width=1047&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=ccca5e3d569161e72bccbc00112a259a570487d2

 Todays:

https://preview.redd.it/7wd5k0d6uky61.jpg?width=981&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ba558de8d8847a3e71482faedf7e27595ea7311

Accounting for the switching of ITM/OTM you'll see a decent increase in calls (\~160k) and puts (\~118k). Since overall delta exposure doubled towards zero it can be said that the majority of those were dealer long and customer short. This is healthy behavior. Considering volatility dropped as well, this suggests continued upside. 

It seems as though the healthy earnings report re-vitalized the stock. There is still rocky ground, however, there may be resistance at $20 but with increased liquidity and stabilizing gamma, there is an argument to be made that it should go beyond. 

The caveat is that if there is downside if it starts causing liquidity issues again the stock may continue its previous trajectory until the options landscape changes more drastically. With okayish accuracy, you can see with increase in volatility, 1.6mil options will have to be hedged via purchasing underlying with 1.8mil via selling. So back to the 1.6:1.8 as before. (For those wondering, did the decrease in volatility today help the stock rise with 1.6million options needing hedging via purchasing with decrease in vol? or was it the prospect of tendies. Lemme know).

TL;DR: You deserve your tendies today but dont let them get cold."

2021-05-11 20:21:39,wallstreetbets,"Me too. I think a lot of the selling over the last few weeks was short playing the lack of PLTR product awareness. It was labeled hard to borrow yesterday and I suspect some shorts covered today. But there are probably lots more that will play the volatility for awhile longer. Crap like the top post on this thread is part of it. Folks playing on folks’ fear to keep them from buying the dips on a solid tech company so they can wash, rinse and repeat. Best thing to do, if you believe in this company is to buy the shares (not options) and hold. 

Note, This ain’t financial advice and I ain’t no financial expert. Just my opinion."

2021-05-12 01:34:46,wallstreetbets,This is the way
2021-05-11 20:24:37,wallstreetbets,"Not quite ! You can calculate an options hedging and it’s effects on price points. You’d be surprised how much market-wide movements are caused by options. 
You have to keep in mind options are hedges but when those hedges are invoked, certain behavior patterns follow that ensure the hedging is successful. So it’s not quite as simple as just saving “options hedge and are reactive to underlying”."

2021-05-11 21:38:09,wallstreetbets,"True. For your consideration, if you want PLTR for your core positions, you could buy a few leap call contracts - for example, the Jan 23, $20 strike calls were selling for $6 and change, and then sell weekly covered calls to decrease your effective cost. The weekly,5-10% OTM don’t produce much premium but if you keep the ladder going you can reduce your effective cost by about $0.50 per week at current values and prices."

2021-05-11 22:09:42,wallstreetbets,I only use the leaps to keep me in the game even if the price spikes and my core shares get called on the weeklys. I do it cause I like the stock. I would follow the exercised calls by selling puts to get the stock back or pocket the premium. I have used the palanteer product and know what it can do... so I want to stay on this one until I need the proceeds to buy a ski condo.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Stocks tumble as surging prices rattle the market 
2021-05-12 05:32:15,wallstreetbets,"As long as prices don’t transfer into salaries, inflation will be contained. 

To me, the issue is that, checks and payments in the US are rising the cost opportunities of finding a job for the low salaries. The same issue is happening in Canada, where restaurants are encountering problems with a lack of demand on their offers. 
When you consider the amount of new jobs offers answered on US job market, you see that there’s also a lack of demand on low-wages. 

To put it simply, if checks are to be prolonged, the cost opportunity will lead toward a rise on low-wages thus unflattening the Philips’ curve. This could very well start a new cycle of inflation between prices and salaries. 

The FED is able to manage such an inflation with a decrease on QE or a rise of interest rates. But it will most certainly lead to severe market correction, since there’s huge leverages across the market and high exposure with borrowed money, explained by a relative cheap money. 

The only way to avoid that would be the government to stop rather rapidly the checks or atleast diminish amounts and/or eligibility, in order to lower the cost opportunity for low-wages workers."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"IMPORTANT LINK BETWEEN ATLANTIS AND TECH STOCKS **PLEASE READ OR ELSE** 
TLDR: The lost city of Atlantis is conspiring to sink all of Big Tech down into the ocean so that they can build an un-submarine and take over the land. This is bearish, and unavoidable, so in order for us to profit off of it I recommend selling all long tech positions and transitioning into puts on FAANG stocks, because of recent underwater activity and mermaid emotions. **PLEASE READ, THIS POST IS ALL I HAVE.**

——————————————————————————————————————-

This is my millionth time posting on this subreddit. I hope that this post is welcomed with open arms, and not shit on at all, as I am very sensitive. This is a rather long post, but a very important one not only for this subreddit, but for all land dwellers in general. Absolutely one of the most important issues of our time.

As we all know, humans have absolutely ravaged the environment, overproducing plastics and overfishing the ocean, and also allowing space debris to land in the ocean and acting like everything is perfectly fine because “There’s no people there so idgaf”

The Atlantans, however, are done taking this. One of the foremost experts on Atlantis, Milo James Thatch (famous linguist and cartographer) has been reaching out to me in my dreams to warn me that the mer-people and King Poseidon are very unhappy about how we’ve been treating the ocean, starting with us sinking the titanic and just leaving it there, and leading up to this current situation with us overfishing and allowing too much plastic to enter fish diets.

They, however, have a plan. As you may have noticed recently, tech stocks are *Drilling Down Into The Earth*- or so we thought. By the end of this post, I believe it will be painfully obvious that the stocks are not drilling, but rather, sinking. I’m sure you remember the [Short Escalator Omega Overflow Attacks](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lc2dpx/the_anatomy_of_a_short_escalator_omega_overflow/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) that plagued us bulls in late January- at the time, there was literally no other possible reason for a stock people like to ever go down.

Well, I’m here to warn you that the Atlantans have developed a new kind of attack- The Poke Holes At The Bottom Of The Boat Attack, and with this DEVIOUS and absolutely unethical strategy, are planning to drive tech stocks so low that they will be literally at the bottom of the ocean and the companies will then have to create Un-Submarines in order to bring the stocks back up. The Atlantans plan to stow away on these special ships, and use them to rise to the surface. Once they have, they’ll use their special Land-Scuba suits to invade our countries, and take over the world.

This is bad, y’all. Really bad. This is shit your pants and cry yourself to sleep bad, and it’s going to happen. It’s entirely unavoidable. They’re going to take advantage of the chip shortage and use their seaweed chips to create mega super computers, and then they’re going to turn humans into batteries. But, do not fear. There’s a way to get rich while this happens. That’s right, you can be the wealthiest bitch in the Matrix, and all you have to do is *Buy Tech Puts Expiring After This Summer* in companies like $AAPL, $AMZN, $TSLA- Because the Atlantans will poke the biggest holes in the summer months, and the stock boats will no longer be able to float.

Recommended positions:

AMD Puts, Expiry October, Strike Price $60

AAPL Puts, Expiry October, Strike Price $110

TSLA Puts, Expiry October, Strike Price $500

FB Puts, Expiry October, Strike Price $280

Basically, any tech company is going to be targeted by them, and your way to make money is by riding them down. I will be taking questions in the comments."
2021-05-12 08:12:55,wallstreetbets,"Atlantis is real, I've done my YouTube research and looked at some sea elevation maps and the area around the Azores islands is a prime spot to be Atlantis. The story goes like this, we were still in an ice age some 12,900 years ago and the Northern hemisphere was covered in glaciers. A cosmic impact occurred over the glaciers causing them to melt and caused mass extinctions throughout the world. That's what caused horses to go extinct in the Americas before they were later reintroduced. We are headed on a different cosmic journey this time, to the moon and beyond towards the Sun. We opening a black hole. There won't be an extinction like last time. All the chips being used to move our banking systems to a T+0 system. We will be the cosmic impact this time around!"

2021-05-11 21:09:27,wallstreetbets,Damnit.  I’ve gotta do some research.  How many live cattle will I own if I hold futures contract to expiration. This is a genius inflation play.  Love cattle should be ATH.  Thanks for the inspiration!

I just priced out some air conditioners and and went grocery shopping this weekend (my nanny usually does this for me);  fucking sticker shocked on all accounts and I’m 100% on board with the inflation narrative and see that as a major catalyst to send protein prices higher.  Beef is headed to the 🌝; the biggest question now is to trade live cattle vs feeder cattle futures.  With Input costs going up for ranchers across the board, output costs will naturally rise as well.  Beef could do what /LM futures have done over the past 6 months 👍"
2021-05-12 07:07:36,wallstreetbets,Corn at the highs again. Wild run. Seasonally gets exhausted in june-july.

2021-05-11 22:28:37,wallstreetbets,I feed cattle too tho so it's been awful. I'm glad I have plenty of grain on hand.
2021-05-11 22:43:50,wallstreetbets,My wing Wednesday place stopped doing traditional wings because of the price difference. Did not see that coming. The effects of high grain prices are seen in the smaller animals first. Have heard of some pork cuts being in low supply but that is mostly because of Chinese demand. Beef boxes have gone from $200-300 in a short amount of time. Things are wild in the meat space. There isn't enough capacity to process and distribute fast enough to meet the demand of restocking everything at once.
2021-05-12 07:26:41,wallstreetbets,Where are you paying 40$ for choice filet

2021-05-11 20:04:08,wallstreetbets,"Lol, if you can find somebody to slice and dice these bad boys, I'm your huckleberry. Butcher shops are backed up for 1-2 years in some places. Meat packing plants are short staffed. That's most of the reason for the suppressed price as of late."
2021-05-12 07:01:33,wallstreetbets,"I was always told feeders are a manipulated contract like pork bellies used to be. It doesn't mean it can't be traded but should be with caution. Everyone watches ""the index"" of calf auction sale prices which can have significant swings week to week."
2021-05-12 11:02:31,wallstreetbets,"Lol I’m expecting lower production due to labor shortage.  Then again, not sure if the farm workers qualify..."
2021-05-11 23:10:20,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding it is lack of workforce at the processor's.  They seem to be an industry hit by the unemployeement bug.  

Something like that, makes the steak hard to gauge by touch.  I don't know if it's actually extra fatty or just feels that way."
2021-05-12 17:34:22,wallstreetbets,"Maybe we get prime, but I know I heard 40 or more a pound,  and it's gone up in price over the last several weeks. 🤷‍♂️"
2021-05-11 23:23:47,wallstreetbets,Do you have to provide a delivery location prior to purchasing the contract? I mean you’d really have to pay attention to what you’re doing trading this or it can literally go tits up.
2021-05-12 12:38:43,wallstreetbets,Ahh ok.  Well you are doing well on the live cattle today.  Good for you man!
2021-05-12 11:20:44,wallstreetbets,I don't think that will have any effect
2021-05-11 23:47:26,wallstreetbets,"I've heard that as well but still hard to believe. I know they've been giving big bonuses out, but I don't think they want to set any high wage precedent so they're not goosing this thing like they should. 

That's interesting. We had an old chef in town who said everyone's steak got the ""thumb test"" but I never thought how something like this could throw that off."
2021-05-12 17:36:03,wallstreetbets,Prime for sure. I’ve been tracking some of these prices for awhile and I think we’re going to see a rocket take off soon.
2021-05-11 23:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's not like that. Nothing is settled until an intent to deliver is made and you get called to take delivery which it takes some irresponsibility or some balls to stick around that long. There's ways of getting out of it if you get picked up early."
2021-05-12 17:50:01,wallstreetbets,"I don't doubt that one bit.  I cam remember when Salinas, CA had that outbreak of ecoli last year and Romaine hearts were like $60 dollars a case.  Iceburg lettuce had made a run earlier this year close to $30 a case, but thankfully it pulled back."
2021-05-11 23:35:56,wallstreetbets,Shoot me a PM if you want to lease any land to shoot ducks and geese on. I’m in East Texas and hunt Oklahoma and Kansas regularly. Lol. Always looking for new places.
2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Negative Real Rates will go into uncharted territory tomorrow. New highs for Gold and Silver imminent!!! Real Rates are the number one driver for precious metals. (DD) \-Tomorrow morning the BLS will release the monthly inflation numbers for April, Annual CPI is currently at 2.6%. The consensus is that Annual CPI will go up to 3.6% tomorrow morning. I think that the number is going to be closer to 4% . Even with a 10 year yield going up to 2% that gives a negative real rate of -2, which we haven't seen in a very long time. Here are some graphs illustrating what I am saying.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/wfrpq3hi6ky61.png?width=3329&format=png&auto=webp&s=41849dac1a1cd6d5e22e6ce046ee13e8fefb74e4

&#x200B;

**Here is the monthly inflation numbers, as of tomorrow that -0.7 comes off of the board and it takes CPI up to 3.3% . I would expect the April number to be higher than the March number of .6, Inflation is heating up, so I am not sure why they would expect a lower number in the consensus, that would then add onto to the 3.3% and give us a CPI of 4%. As you can see this is going to build on itself into the year.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/upk8qo9j6ky61.png?width=2341&format=png&auto=webp&s=8a3672552cc1233e7151b7d8b8f9c209f8012df0

&#x200B;

**As you can see in the chart above , every time the real rates touch zero or go below that line, historically that has been a bullish time for precious metals. 2011 was a great run for the metals and as you can see rates went below that line. 2016 was another good run for the metals as it touched the breakeven line. And of course there is last year where we went all the way down to negative -1, which is where we are now.**

\-Yields are going to want to rise on this inflation news tomorrow, and I expect the markets to tank pretty quickly, but as you can see with the new inflation numbers that the real rates will be much lower. The metals should in theory explode in the coming weeks.

\-This is where the fed might implement yield curve control or choose let the economy collapse. I guess we will find out soon

Let me know what you think in the comments."

2021-05-12 02:13:31,wallstreetbets,"The only problem is that gold prices have been rather pitiful the last half year due to the same folks who rail about PMs buying into that other new thing that isn't allowed here. Despite all the printing and inflation it's down over the last 6 months, though it did jump a little this month as that other asset has sort of slowed it's price growth.

PM might do ok anyway, but that's just another question mark as to whether you'll get the sort of incredible they saw in the 70s.

It's also still a real question as to whether this inflation is transitory, a lot of this will probably depend on whether people start demanding wage increases as the price of everything goes up. If those wage increases occur then the inflation will be much more likely to become permanent. I suspect some wage increases will occur, because companies are having trouble getting people to come back because unemployment payments have been pretty good and sometimes better than old wages. Inflation is sort of self-sustaining in that inflation drives more inflation. I think that's why Powell keeps insisting that it's going to be temporary. You need everyone to believe that it's temporary so it stays that way."
2021-05-12 02:17:12,wallstreetbets,"How ironic is it that the ""real"" rate is determined by using the fake CPI number.  
  
Inflation has been around 10% these past few years, see shadowstats.com or chapwoodindex.org. And  is likely to get a big pop in 2021.  
  
The actual real rate has been around -8% and is now likely to go a lot higher."

2021-05-12 08:36:35,wallstreetbets,I am highly confident they will lie directly to our faces again and say “there is no inflation” and that “inflation is actually negative for the month” to keep real rates from going negative.

On top of that, more and more people are becoming aware that ETF's such as SLV and GLD have very little to do with fundamentals or gold and silver, and everything to do with fleecing investors and precious metals price suppression.

One of the most well known for silver is Wheaton Precious Metals (WPM), but there are probably even better choices.

Or, you could go after junior miners with an ETF like SILJ.  Since there are not a lot of silver miners, you could probably do enough research pretty quickly to find good individual choices.  One resource there is SilverChartist.com, who has a free newsletter that talks about silver and other commodity metal stocks.  I've been following him for a few months on YouTube and find his recommendations to have been pretty good so far and his knowledge of the silver market pretty comprehensive."

For those of you who are not in the know, $CLOV is a disruptor in the Health Insurance industry.They use Artificial Intelligence to leverage the Big Data that can only be acquired as a health insurer to help offer the best medicare plans for seniors & combine that with better care thanks to their Clover Assistant app designed for doctors that combines patient history for AI based clinical recommendations that end up reducing costs & liabilities for their overall model.

""The tech-enabled health insurer differentiates itself from incumbents by collecting and analyzing health and behavioral data to lower costs and improve medical outcomes for its members. It’s part of a new cohort of heavily funded insurtech startups"". [https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/29/alphabet-backed-medicare-advantage-startup-clover-health-raises-500m/)

What gives them an edge over the others in this space like OSCR, WELL, UNH, HUM, etc. are the people on board & invested - The President Andrew Toy is a former Google Engineer + Google itself has backed and partnered with Clover Health.  Thats a great silicon valley backing, but what else?  Well they have powerful political connections as well...  Chelsea Clinton is a big investor and is on the board of directors.  They also have the former head of Medicare on the board of directors...  these are powerful and important people for a new 'insurance tech' startup like clover.

This stock is a great long term hold on fundamentals alone and has its price target set between $15 - $19 (a great and easy 2x upside from today's price) by the end of the year is besides the point of this post, we also know that certain insiders like the CEO (who owns over 80m shares) cannot even sell their shares until the price has been 30$ for 90 consecutive days...  hmm.

Oh yeah before we dive into the Gamma Squeeze DD - take a look at this beautiful Data Sheet!

&#x200B;

[there are your big numbers, fellow apes!](https://preview.redd.it/a7mcnrqgbly61.png?width=754&format=png&auto=webp&s=1589ef5251a8526eb294f27d8b3496425bda00b0)

**So How does a Gamma Squeeze Work?**  

As you all know by now, gamma squeezes are triggered as option sellers are forced to buy the underlying when there is a good chance that the options they sold will be ITM at expiry. Here is the current open interest (contracts for which the sellers would have to buy shares as the price action approaches the strike) for the May 21 expiry :

&#x200B;

[64,000 OI on the 10$ call, 58,000 OI on the 15$ call and a nice 80,000 or so OI on 17-30$ calls..  WOWZA.   and short interest is at 40&#37; ...  ](https://preview.redd.it/qveym8t0yjy61.png?width=1606&format=png&auto=webp&s=0f0fa80dfb7ac99724d16538903643c88d4e6acc)

Anybody else see a nice lift-off ramp? I sure do.

Now also take this into account.  They announced last week that they will report earnings on 5/17 - this is about 1 month SOONER than originally planned.  They also chose to do the earnings on a MONDAY pre-market...  so note how recently, rocket companies did theirs on a THURSDAY after hours..  a company only reports monday pre-markets if they have good news.

What good news/catalysts???  We know they havent even publicly announced that they added 10 new states and got new government contracting...  so the market will eat that up since it isnt priced in yet + the future potential by Biden to reduce medicare age eligibility.  They could also address the hindenburg report & say that the DOJ investigation is cleared up publicly (it is cleared up, but I dont believe they have made this big public info yet)

And interestingly 5/17 is the week of OpEx (options expiration for the whole market) this is the monday of the week this entire option chain expires .. this usually signifies that volatility will up there.  Any good numbers or Good Guidance reported that day 5/17 could cause a gamma squeeze if the price shoots over 14$ heading into expiration - and a short squeeze could see MVIS-like movement that week.

&#x200B;

[hmm. that could be one hell of a week in terms of volatility.](https://preview.redd.it/3i1ljwzzzjy61.png?width=1125&format=png&auto=webp&s=ab159cac733ff1393287e9991c362174812a0320)

As an added cherry on top, the stock has been severely suppressed by short sellers in the 2 months and SI is hovering over 40% now so shorts may have to cover if any type of volume & momentum come into play next week based on their report since retail and insiders now own more than half the float.

Obligatory **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** **🚀** and this is not financial advice

Positions :  3000 shares for long term holding +

150x 15$ calls 5/21

200x 30$ calls 5/21

&#x200B;

[I wont sell my shares till it hits 30$ when insiders can sell - im in at 9$](https://preview.redd.it/ovmer8gh0ky61.jpg?width=1125&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0cd8e6d1d303e43f57b0e49995ada27c86779c3b)

2021-05-12 15:04:04,wallstreetbets,"AI is kind of a nebulous blanket.

I know a major multi-state blue cross group started collecting detailed clinical data, like lab results on all it's subscribers a couple years ago.   The collection project alone was tens of millions, I can't imagine they weren't looking to do something with that data.   

Remember Watson from Jeopardy?   He's working in health care for hire. Has been for years.  Just feed him what you got and he'll tell you what you want to hear.

Every insurer has had diagnosis, procedure and demographics since god was a baby.  You can bet your sweet bippy they're all looking for ways to not pay, i.e. make profit.  They've been doing that forever, pinching that procedure because that diagnosis didn't qualify.  It's what they do.  

If there's anyone I want to keep my health data from, it's insurance companies.  I remember when pre-existing conditions weren't covered.

There was supposed to be health exchanges.  We were promised health exchanges.   Everybody had to roll everything up into a new format, and then your record would be in the cloud, and any provider could look.   Cloud part didn't happen.  Alphabet had one, but like they do, they abandoned it.  Looks like it's going to the payers instead.  That's just wrong.  If you can opt out of it as a patient, do that.

That makes CLOVs not seem particularly unique, at least to someone tangentially involved in the industry.  

Buying CLOV seems to be betting that the DOJ is not finding anything.  But what's the DOJ looking for?   Why were they looking?

Insurance, and health insurance in particular is about the sleaziest low down business that could be.  

Is this another VLX?   They had a revolutionary plan too, but it wasn't a good one.   Could be sometimes the shorts are right.   VLX was an extortion racket ""pay us or die"" was literally what they were telling people, on top of financial type shenanigans.  

GME was funny, because it didn't matter.   There's an ethical concern here, because it's healthcare and insurance."

2021-05-11 20:18:17,wallstreetbets,"Fundamentally, a 30$ target is nothing.  I believe it is currently worth around 15$ a share based on market cap data & While the number is Years out, 100$ is absolutely attainable by a health insurer, especially with one that is using AI to disrupt an industry.

Compare the price to UNH, HUM, TDOC, OSCR, ..  and tell me where you see the deepest value :)

2021-05-11 20:33:50,wallstreetbets,"Lol no, the short interest is around 42% and we saw what covering only 2% of that does to the stock price - 2$ moves.  Hmmm.

And thanks for explaining gamma squeezes to me, you’re right.  But GameStop has an incredible wall of strikes to climb in order to ever squeeze again...  the 800 strikes were created by market makers to keep the price down..  

CLOV only has strikes up to 30$ and that means a gamma squeeze is 10x more likely here.  So yeah the open interest actually means everything, it tells us exactly how many shares MM’s would fuck up the float with.  

All we need is to get past 12$ for a gamma squeeze.  There’s not enough float for shorts to cover here actually compared to how much open interest there is on the call chain.

Literally all this needs is Volume.  That’s the only ‘other price movements’ we need to activate a gamma squeeze."

Right now we are incentivized to clear up anything on the problem list and add them to our notes as they help medicare reimbursement for the HMO’s. Clover was cute but then reality struck. Why would anyone sign up with an insurer that doesn’t insure you in most major hospitals?"

CLNE does have a chance (his other DD), and depending on how you read the landscape one might be more likely than the other. There is a lot of emotion (read: bags) tied to CLOV. Do your DD though!

FWIW, every time CLOV hits a certain price level, I buy puts about 3-4 weeks out and then sell them in a week or 2. I have not lost once on that play.

2021-05-11 22:59:40,wallstreetbets,Don’t worry about it I’m not a professional at this at all either. Pretty new myself. Dabbled here and there in a few investments over the years but never got deep into it until this year. Just a fan of gambling. I would say the reason is two fold. One is that nobody is in the market to buy it at $16 call yet while there is interest for it for the $15 call another reason is just ones own risk tolerance. But I just said fuck it and went for the $16 call because as you pointed out the price difference softens the blow by a lot. I get double the contracts for the same price as I did with the $15 call. So I said fuck it and went with your plan. There wasn’t necessarily a hard reason as to why I was gonna go with $15 other then again the risk tolerance and people already willing to buy it. But I like company and I think it’ll increase and with that people will be interested in the $16 call. So I do appreciate you pointing it out to me
2021-05-11 20:02:42,wallstreetbets,Ok. Done.

2021-05-12 15:07:20,wallstreetbets,"You could call it one I guess. The funds basically buy stocks based on on some defined financial criteria and buy amount that computer says to buy. Rebalance accounts on fixed dates to adjust for changes in market cap, rinse, repeat. It is very much the opposite of what hedge fund do and most brokerages did traditionally. They have some active managed funds, but that is the minority. They are basically the definition of playing the market as whole as the funds just track market performance (subsection of market).

Institutional investors have increased, this may be the sign that some investing firms are betting AMC’s passionate retail investor are becoming increasingly  loyal consumers.  One could argue that they may be buying these stocks to lend them as shorts, however I believe that may hold a significant percentage. They realize what is happening is in fact without exaggeration: 
Historic.

Even without a squeeze it is increasingly becoming apparent that AMC will generate revenue at increasing rates. In fact the passion of retail investors who for the first time ever own the majority of AMC, love this Company. 

Whoever tells you cinemas are dead does not understand that for the entirety of its history the cinema industry made more Ticket sales in this day and age then ever before . Take a look at the past 10 years of box office hits, they are record breaking compared to to its previous 100 years of history. 

It’s hard to bet against what is currently happening. In fact it’s never been done in the history of AMC or the stock market. 
- congress acknowledged 
- new fans around the world 
- social media and the power of the internet 
- planes, billboard, receipts, celebrities, word of mouth, news, and it continues growing. 


The rest is history."
2021-05-12 10:38:40,wallstreetbets,Man -- i just spent the last 17 months of 2020 in my on fucking house. There isn't much that's going to keep me inside it -- no movie on my own fucking TV for sure. I'm getting the fuck out. I'm going to the movies to enjoy a huge screen and huge sound.
2021-05-12 00:07:35,wallstreetbets,"Is it just me or have most movies been terrible the past couple years, even since before COVID? I feel like TV series have been getting better and movies have been getting worse for years now, and for the past couple years I’ve been thinking that the best TV series are better than the best movies. Many TV series even seem to be matching the production quality of big budget movies these days. I wonder if that’s not a bigger threat to AMC than COVID or movies being available to stream on the same day as theater release."
2021-05-11 20:53:15,wallstreetbets,It’s like you guys don’t understand that you would all rather stream shit from home with cheap booze or weed than the go out to some modern Hollywood sanctimonious piece of shit cash grab.
2021-05-12 14:08:38,wallstreetbets,Movie theaters were dead before the pandemic started because the model is obsolete. Next gen is all about direct to streaming and PPV. They belong at $0 and for that reason I'M OUT.
2021-05-11 21:43:01,wallstreetbets,"Unless people start paying 100$ a ticket, and every theater is sold out, every night, this crap is going to eventually settle to 2$ if not go tits up fully. Anyone who says otherwise is a bagholder or litteral moron."
2021-05-11 21:06:51,wallstreetbets,Can’t smoke my loud pack at the theaters so that’s gonna be a no for me dawg 🤝
2021-05-11 22:29:18,wallstreetbets,fuck off
2021-05-12 07:07:58,wallstreetbets,Bagholder says what?
2021-05-11 21:40:44,wallstreetbets,"Hint:thats not their reasoning, so they are not right or wrong"
2021-05-12 02:04:29,wallstreetbets,"There’s lots of great analysis in the comments below which I generally agree with.  Anecdotally, I went to one of their premium locations (Hollywood, Sunset blvd) the other day for a very unsuccessful date (taking a date to the cinema is always a terrible idea unless you’ve been together for 10 years and you just need some peace and quiet for 2 hours) at this ‘premium’ location we watched the whole movie with a big rip down the middle of the screen with like 8 other people in the theater total.  I think the cinema is a dying platform for viewing new movies and will only be revived if there’s some serious investment in something like VR movies where the barrier to entry $ are too high/complex to the overwhelming majority of the general public. The reason the cinema became popular is because it used to offer an experience you couldn’t recreate at home, that is clearly no longer the case."
2021-05-12 04:13:37,wallstreetbets,Um sorry to burst your bubble but box office hits are getting their revenue from the asian market...if you wanna invest in the asian cinema business it seems to be doing quite well
2021-05-12 04:30:56,wallstreetbets,Btw why would you go in on amc if you rly think theaters will fully recover and do well when you could go in on cinemark? The latter hasnt fully recovered but doesn't have as much debt and is not owned by foreign funds.
2021-05-12 15:54:00,wallstreetbets,"Same. I'm gonna see that new Saw movie this weekend just to get out of the house.   


And I fucking hate Saw lol."

2021-05-12 04:57:44,wallstreetbets,AGREED 100%. Valuations will start to be more important as this MKT consolidates. There's is high on a fundamental basis.
2021-05-12 00:25:39,wallstreetbets,"eh, commercial real estate is fucked, so they should be able to bring those leases down at least. What WSB is really missing though is that hollywood is in love with theaters. Your favorite actors/directors 100% do not want amc to die, they brought it up in the oscars, they promote it on twittter/every form social media all the time; That means more than folks might think imo."

2021-05-11 23:12:34,wallstreetbets,Love it. I did the same - couldn’t believe my luck being able to watch the original Beverly Hills Cop on the big screen
2021-05-12 01:00:14,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree with you. Two hours usually isn’t enough time to tell a meaningful story with three dimensional characters. I’ll take a show that stretches over four or five years any day, especially when movie themes seem to be consolidating to one of about half a dozen themes and series continue to diversify and transcend/reimagine genres

Ironically if a theatre by me started showing my favorite Sunday night drama and I could watch it every week on the big screen I’d seriously reconsider my complete apathy to going to the theatre at all"
2021-05-12 15:57:13,wallstreetbets,"I hear ya, for sure 2 hours isn't enough to hash out compelling characters and back stories and shit.   


But man, sometimes I prefer that. I don't need to know every fucking characters life story. We only needed to know that Bruce Willis was getting a divorce and was an ex-cop for Die Hard lol."
2021-05-12 00:10:48,wallstreetbets,"Sure but sometimes trilogies are epic. Sequels and prequels. 

Tv shows are great but for those who don’t watch much TV, they may want to go see a movie, a date or just something different to do. 

And in terms of new movie, you are right I’d like for great epic memorable movies to be made."
2021-05-12 15:58:14,wallstreetbets,"Without Covid, there is absolutely no way movie studios would put their properties on streaming services the same day as theatres."
2021-05-12 16:01:10,wallstreetbets,"Movie studios make way more money with theatrical releases, at least for their larger properties. No way End Game makes a billion dollars if it was released on Disney+ for 30 bucks lol."
2021-05-12 15:59:24,wallstreetbets,"If one uses the phrase ""literal moron"" to describe a stock, I assume they're a retarded 13 year old girl."

2021-05-12 00:02:09,wallstreetbets,Lots of money to be made on the downside lately. But you can continue believing in conspiracy theories if that helps your confirmation bias.
2021-05-12 00:53:20,wallstreetbets,"The idea of individuals spending money at the company they hold stock in to help the price is like pouring your glass of water into the ocean to ensure you don’t go thirsty in the future.

I don’t doubt people are doing it but it’s an absurd strategy."
2021-05-12 04:15:51,wallstreetbets,Yeah but everyone HATES those preachy actors/directors
2021-05-12 15:45:01,wallstreetbets,"I also work in commercial real estate. The landlords of the movie theatres absolutely do NOT want AMC (or movie theatres in general) to go under.   


Finding a new user for all those locations would be hell. Massive losses and improvement expenditures to get them converted to something even remotely useful for potential tenants."
2021-05-12 13:46:59,wallstreetbets,"But if they don’t own the theaters, why wouldn’t their brand die and a new brand comes to lease the theaters?"
2021-05-12 04:19:45,wallstreetbets,Dungeons and dragons. Going to a nat. park. Any board game. Any video game. Hell id say going to church at this point with the crap hollywood is making
2021-05-11 23:42:42,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I need that $100 to blow on options."
2021-05-11 21:12:26,wallstreetbets,"I haven't been to a theater in years. Don't get me wrong, if a great movie comes out (which is rare these days considering the utter garbage coming out of Hollywood), I'll go watch it. Typically during the last couple days of the showing, so I can have most of the theater to to myself. I despise sitting among a crowd of loud obnoxious people."
2021-05-11 23:07:38,wallstreetbets,No matter how big your TV screen it is not even going to get close to a 1500” IMAX screen and any movie worth watching is worth watching in IMAX
2021-05-12 00:14:46,wallstreetbets,"I actually love going to theaters, but I have been having trouble finding movies I want to see. It doesn’t help that I’m completely burnt out of comic book / superhero movies, which seems like about 50% of well reviewed movies these days."
2021-05-12 16:52:38,wallstreetbets,"This is correct but the REAL emphasis is on merchandise, contracts, and advertisers. Whether they like it or not, they MUST embrace a more distant world and offer products faster than pirates to remain competitive."
2021-05-12 16:04:58,wallstreetbets,"See above reply. I cant wait until all the long term loss porn from any idiot who thinks amc is going ""to the moon"". The only people making money were in sub $5, and/or have been selling cc's to aforementioned dipsticks

But, go ahead and and call out a minor spelling error in the age of phone keyboards like it was due to lack of intelligence while avoiding the truth in what my statement was. 

I think your smoke break is over, get back to working the drive through"
2021-05-11 23:16:36,wallstreetbets,Sorry about your heavy bags
2021-05-12 00:02:34,wallstreetbets,This is the place to do it. But last time I checked having a 80%-200% borrow rate would make most people bullish as all hell.
2021-05-12 15:53:08,wallstreetbets,"Movie studios do not want to release their shit to streaming. When  there was 0 movie theatres open, they may have done so. But at a much lower profit margin (or at a loss) than they would usually expect in a theatrical release.   


I think there is a lot of pent up demand for going to the movies, and movie studios may be more willing to negotiate with AMC (and others) on revenue sharing on the ticket sales (or less cost to the theatre to show the movie).   


Additionally, their landlords will probably be begrudgingly willing to relieve some of their lease costs. Converting empty movie theatre properties to something else commercially useful would be a major cost."
2021-05-11 23:08:14,wallstreetbets,There hasn’t been a movie you consider great that’s been released in years?
2021-05-12 01:03:38,wallstreetbets,People are done w movies. Celebrities live on tik tok. utube and twitch. I bought into this bullshit months ago and had to sell at a loss. I can catch Ant man 57 or ghostbusters 8 while drunk on a flight overseas.
2021-05-12 16:18:49,wallstreetbets,"It's not the spelling error I'm pointing out.   


It's the use of literal inappropriately. Retarded 13 year old girl type stuff. I half expect a line of Fire emojis at the end of your response."
2021-05-12 00:23:43,wallstreetbets,"Not too heavy at $12 avg. I rest them on the empty recliner next to me every time I go to AMC 1/21/22 $2, $3, $5 Calls also offsetting a lot of the unrealized losses"
2021-05-12 17:47:34,wallstreetbets,"-3 but fucking crickets, nobody has anything to say about the squeeze, they just keep bashing its finances like it’s any other stock being reasonably shorted"
2021-05-12 16:24:50,wallstreetbets,pent up demand is the new word. ppl will go 17x more to the movies this time due to pent up demand huh?
2021-05-11 23:08:59,wallstreetbets,Not enough for me to want to see it in a theater.
2021-05-12 16:21:17,wallstreetbets,Thats a strange outlook...how was it inappropriate? Im genuinely asking (am i allowed to use genuinely?)
2021-05-12 17:49:21,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
2021-05-12 17:28:17,wallstreetbets,Dumb. That's not how one should use the market cap valuation lol.
2021-05-11 23:22:35,wallstreetbets,"It’s pretty easy to get a private screening rn, either by paying for the whole theater or checking the seats sold beforehand. I’ve been a bunch of times since last September and almost always 8 or less people there, including us"
2021-05-12 17:39:22,wallstreetbets,"The phrase ""a literal moron"" would be used to distinguish from ""a figurative moron"".   


For instance, the phrase ""That guy is literally on fire!"" should be used to describe a guy that is on fire and needs a fire extinguisher. The phrase should not be used for a guy who has made 6 shots in a row in basketball, as he is figuratively on fire.   


Moron does not have different meanings for literal vs figurative. Hence why only teenage morons misuse the word (and act confused when called out on this easily verifiable fact).   


TL;DR?: Quit being dumb"
2021-05-12 18:04:47,wallstreetbets,"bruh, I’ll be there, I’m saying nobody has shit to say about the squeeze because there’s nothing bearish to say about it. they keep trying to frame it as business as usual and duck every opportunity to directly address the borrow rate or share availability. AMC’s business model could be jerking off into an old gym-sock and it’d still moon"

You know, it's possible to believe that a company will grow, while also believing it's overvalued.

They're not the only EV player in town, and they're certainly not producing batteries at any scale to call it any more than an EV company.

I think you bought at the peak my dude. Sell now and buy when it's at a sensible price (Which is $100)"

2021-05-11 21:00:07,wallstreetbets,"If you mean by all of last year I’d agree. Inflation with the help of the fed is priced in. This dip is what happens when the rates are so low with the value of the dollar slipping and the fed is calling it “transitory.” You can’t say “look at all the jobs created” unless you can fill said jobs. What appears to be is people are not excited about reentering the workforce. So what can the FED do? We’ll they said they’d keep printing to get people back to work, but it looks like people don’t want or cannot go back to work because of health and security issues, or loss of skill which the latter is worse of an issue."

10:30 pm, overcast


A lone butterfly flits through the air, carelessly searching for sustenance and sweet nectar. Thinking not of earthly desires, It knows only perpetual frolic and peace.

Probiscus tingling, it senses the enticing aroma of a sugary snack in the distance. It changes course towards the siren song calling its name, not out of conscious decision but out of simple innate behavior. 

""Such a strange looking flower"" it thinks. ""But ne'er a scent have I encountered as sweet as this.""

It descends on its prize, like a sacrificial lamb being led to slaughter on the proverbial stone table. Never realizing that it was all smoke in mirrors. A simple parlor trick. 

""This isn't a flower at all! It's a sugar coated.... PENIS!""

As soon as I talked to her in person I was reassured that she was odd. Oh well I was in college and tryna find my way into some strange.

Ended up making her mad somehow while we were about to fuck. Didn’t say a thing? Maybe my small dick? Idk, not important really. 

Then, while crying she shoves a pot brownie in her mouth that she brought and ran out of my room. I followed her because I thought she was going to steal something. 

At this point I’m just wanting the chick to leave so I try and get her to stop crying. I’m able to, and she says she feels sorry and she wants to at least blow me for putting up with that. 

I’m like no way is this bipolar chick about to put my dick in her mouth so I tell her I have to pee and I’m not in the mood.

Stay hydrated - whisky is best here, but if before noon where you are, consider a healthier clear spirit like vodka or pure grain alcohol.

Eat a nutritious and balanced breakfast - make sure to include all five major crayon colours, and plenty of tendies for protein. Bananas are acceptable.

Perform one act of kindness - make your wife’s boyfriend a cup of coffee to start his day right - he’s probably very tired.

Do some mindfulness mantras - chanting a mantra over and over again can be very helpful in keeping the mind calm. A few suggestions include; ‘Holy Moly’, ‘I like the stock’, or ‘To the moon’.

Take some time away from your computer screen - in this day and age, sitting for too long in front of your computer can be very taxing. Be good to yourself, and occasionally switch to staring at your phone screen instead.

Good luck out there today, retards."

Then this morning happens. The reddest fucking open I have seen in a long time. Plug at one point was down to $17.50 or something premarket and Apple was as low as $123.00.

**SPY 6/18 $320** calls are at the last price of **94.29** which gives us a total value of:

Does you’re stock benefit from seasonal trading or Q3/4 earnings? All my positions are down but they could just as easily be up in 2,3,4 months. Hell even next week. 

Tin foil hat time but it seems like the Market is trying to shake out the extra retail traders as well as fuck over Cathie Wood. I have no opinion on cathie and don’t pick stocks based off of her. I own no Ark stock but do have some similar positions. It does seem like there’s an extra vendetta against her and the rest of us. Highly mentioned stocks here nose bomb at the drop of a hat at an alarming rate. At rates retail investors could not do on their own. Hedges are annoyed that retail traders are stronger in numbers since January, and more aggressive than their boomer parents. Also short term inflation is coming so if you’re holding stock be prepared for volatility. If you’re playing options than you’re a stronger retard than me."

75F Sunny, Clear skies

As /u/Some-other-guy-1
 speaks of what which I do fully know of, he knows not of his true potential. He instead blithely recites his banal haths and hath nots, not understanding those great minds who put their writing in stone for the ages. These pillories reserve their stocks for the ones such as him, his insouciance plain upon his unremarkable, dullard eyes.

For he has attacked his master, and he shall be laid bare upon the trodden stonework from which the Doctor hewn his name. Luminaries abound, yet he neither acknowledges nor recognizes. He perhaps shall be one who will have died, never recognizing fine cuisine, nor the true allure of women, never uttering a witticism nor a foolish remark. But my lord, forgive him, for he knows not what he does."

Tuesday 6:35PM

80F Sunny, Clear skies

Tendies are for the bears, Tears for the bulls

Memes for the retard, cunning at losing it all

""Good!"" Said the Doctor, sitting in his hall

But gold - solid gold - is the master of them all

So he made rebellion, 'gainst /u/bawse1 his liege

Camped before his citadel and summoned it to siege

""Nay!"" said /u/fannypackphantom camped upon her wall

But gold, solid gold shall be master of you all

Woe for the Doctor and his knight u/Memetron9000 so strong

When the cruel bannings laid 'em all along;

He was taken prisoner, he was cast in thrall

And gold, solid gold was mater of it all!

Yet his King spoke kindly, ah how kind a lord

What if I release thee now and give thee back thy mod?

Nay! said the Doctor, mock not at my fall,

For gold, solid gold, is master of men all.

Tears are for u/sloptart69 prayers are for u/angrysc0tsman12

Stop losses for the fragile mind that cannot keep a crown.

As my loss is large, So my hope is small

For gold - solid gold - must be master of them all!

Yet his king made answer; few such kings there be!

Here is your FD and here is your TSLA - sit and trade with me.

Win and Lose in DFV's name, the whiles I do recall

How Gold -- Solid gold - can be master of autists all

u/slugk0 took the FD and blessed it. He blessed and brake the shorts

With his own hands he served them, and presently he said:

See! These hands they pierced with vines, outside my palace wall,

Show gold - solid gold to be master of men all"

Sike, jk, too many words on first glance

But his name is u/HellzAngelz? Oof strike two

I missed exiting the position when it broke resistance bc it shot up fast and I didn’t want to believe it, for some reason I was sure it was a bull trap, by the time I accepted that the whole market was mooning it was too late I had blown past my stop loss. With the inflation report coming out tomorrow I decided to swing the position overnight in case there is a miracle reversal in premarket big enough to get me back close to the money enough to at least break even. what are my odds here?

2021-05-11 20:53:04,wallstreetbets,"So for those who don't understand what this deal means:

&#x200B;

* These ports in California are mandating everything be carbon neutral, which means no more diesel trucks in them (mostly affecting the long haul 18 wheelers).  Which means no more diesel trucks anywhere, because as California does, so does the rest of the country
* Since electric freight is light years from being ready for prime time, this means RNG
* $CVX will be filling THEIR RNG in Clean Energy fueling stations around these ports; $CLNE will manage the stations and take a cut (probably 50 cents a gallon or something).  This is a win for $CVX because they don't have the supply chain in place to move their RNG all over the place - plus they don't make much of it.
* $CVX, most importantly, will be subsidizing the cost of truckers to convert their 18 wheelers to RNG from diesel (which just requires a simple conversion kit, not buying a whole new vehicle like an electric).  Once those vehicles are RNG converted, that's what they have to use - no more diesel.  As anyone who's ever converted a propane grill to nat gas can tell you, this is in general a one-way trip
* These truckers will be conditioned to know that they have to find a Clean Energy station to refuel because, well...nobody else really sells the stuff.
* Which means that all the refueling they do NOT do at these 2 ports will be at $CLNE owned stations with Clean Energy RNG.  And because $CVX paid for them to convert their engines, and nobody else really sells this stuff, these trucks will become captive consumers of $CLNE for all but one refueling stop along their journey.  As will every converted truck thereafter.  Which will then give them leverage to negotiate favorable deals with Love, Travelcenters of America, etc. for fueling station placement in their truck stops, further eroding the footprint of diesel."

2021-05-12 06:31:54,wallstreetbets,"There are vanishingly few visits to the container ports in California
by actual long haul truckers. The overwhelming majority of truck visits
are short hauls to and from distribution centers and container storage facilities near, but not in (and thus outside the regulatory reach of) the ports. These drivers usually make multiple trips to and from the ports every day. The cargo may ultimately be picked up by long haul truckers outside the ports, but as I say, the ports have no control over what kind of fuel those truckers use.

These clean air mandates will have little to no effect on trucking outside of California, and little to no effect on trucking within California that
doesn't involve a truck entering the gate of a shipping terminal. 

This is not to downplay the effect it *could* have, if successful, on the fleets of port trucking companies near LA/LB and Oakland. There are thousands of mostly dirty trucks entering and leaving these ports every day. But this is not going to make huge nationwide ripples any time soon. 

(Source: at my job I see exactly what kind of truckers deliver and pick up cargo/empty containers at the ports, and it's often the same guys picking up multiple loads during a shift)"

My track record - I called the vaccine being very effective and the subsequent rotation into cyclicals/value before it was cool and made a ton of money off that (see my post history)

&#x200B;

**SVC**

* Pre-covid was at $25, currently at $10.90...over 125% upside from here as domestic travel returns
* Domestic hotel REIT *trading at basically the same price it was at the day after the vaccine was announced in November!*
* Reported 51% occupancy in April, an increase of over 50% from February, and management says it expects a huge acceleration starting in H2
* Finished transitioning most of its hotels to Sonesta, *which it owns 34% of!* Think of how awesome this is - not only are you buying a hotel landlord, you're also buying part of a hotel company itself
* Sonesta will soon be one of the largest hotel operators in the country after its acquisition of another hotel company completes
* Compared to its peers, SVC has underperformed 40-50% since the vaccine was announced - one positive piece of news and this thing skyrockets
* Trading at under 5x next year's FFO. Compare that to its peers, it's insanely cheap
* I'm putting my money where my mouth is - I've accumulated a $4.5 million position in this and wont sell till 25

FUBO was caught in the Archegos drama and has had their SP literally crushed in the past few weeks.

Before the HwangBang there was a reporting error that sent the SP dropping into Gulag. The previous report didnt factor in GAAP and also did not take into account dilution, resulting in a dramatically high EPS miss. Even with massive sub growth larger than ROKU and NFLX they got their shit kicked in.

Now, the company has been in a ""quiet period"" for weeks, meaning they cannot comment on anything regarding acquisitions or any material information until the period is over per SEC rules.

That period ends in 45 mins.

FUBO is the number 1 sports streaming platform, and is rolling out sports betting in Q4, and has the most impressive sub growth of all streaming services % wise. Theyre introducing original content to offer alongside Live TV.

ALL analysts covering the stock are projecting $40-$60 and institutional buying is the highest ive ever seen in the last 2 months on any stock.

&#x200B;

Theyre presenting at the Annual Needham Virtual Growth Conference on 5/17. Theyre edge over DKNG is that they can legally share all analytics they collect via their betting platform, which DKNG cannot do via privacy laws since theyre technically a 3rd party, whereas FUBO does it in house.

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"#1 Stock to benefit from the major shift to EV We are seeing a major shift in the electrification of vehicles. General Motors seeks to go all electric by 2035, Ford is doubling its EV investment from $11b billion to $22 billion through 2025, Volkswagen plans to spend $19 billion through 2025, Stellantis from the merger of Fiat Chrysler and PSA Groupe, plans to have EV or hybrid versions of all its vehicles in Europe by 2025. And the list can go on and on with Tesla, Fisker, Workhouse Group, XPeng, and Lucid Motors...... 

This is great news for ON as it’s one of the world’s largest automobile semiconductor manufacturers. And EVs require a lot more semiconductor content than internal combustion engine (ICE) cars. ON can sell about $100 of semiconductor content into ICE cars. But it sells about $500 of semiconductors into EVs.

ON is also increasing margins quickly… Last year, its EBITDA margin was 20.5%. By the end of 2023, analysts expect it should rise to 30.6%. ON is extremely undervalued at these prices."
2021-05-11 22:27:07,wallstreetbets,I also think volkswagen vwagy can go nuts they put a lot of cash in transition to ev and good earnings maybe the buggest rival of tesla in the future

I am a Bachelor student in media studies from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands and currently do digital ethnography research on r/wallstreetbets. As I am a big fan of this community, this project means a lot for me and it would be really great to chat with members of WSB or even have video-call interviews. Please contact me if you would be willing to be interviewed (via chat or video-call). I am generally interested in how participants perceive WSB and what they do with information that they get here. Apart from that, why do you guys come to the community here? If you are interested and want to know more about me or the project I am doing, don’t hesitate to contact me!

2021-05-12 02:03:58,wallstreetbets,"Fortnite copied into that with their own Creative mode. The stuff being made there seems similarly impressive but Fortnite players have not been keen on adopting it as much as playing the main battle royale, dicking around fighting with friends on an empty map, or playing a different game

I've checked out some of the stuff on Fortnite Creative but not Roblox, but I feel like I understand it based on your comment. All the tools are available to create, say, an Among Us ripoff, or a maze, or roleplaying town, or whatever

Cool. Wish I bought some but that's a bit high for my taste in risk. If they SPACd in at $10 I'd have been on board for sure. Even though SPACs these days .... Are rough"
2021-05-11 21:10:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Then it hung out at about $73, dropped, went back up on Nancy buying into it, dropped. I’m not surprised by current price. I wouldn’t get too excited, it’s still within its normal trading ranges."

They didn't start this business a year ago, you're buying into a product with significant adoption already. You are literally a bag holder from day one. If it doesn't get bigger it will only get smaller and the people who profit are the original investors that not only made profits but will also sell their shares to finish off getting the last of their ROI."

2021-05-11 22:40:19,wallstreetbets,"As a kid, roblox is one of my most played games and I can assure you this is true.  I knew the platform was growing so I actually bought shares when they went public, was not happy with its performance initially.  I'm in the green now though with roblox, as with the stocks I didn't expect to make money on, like $TMUS, $GM, $KO, and $PPL.

Back to the dating thing, yes kids are busy gaming.  However, yes I was asked out on roblox, and yes I may or may not have seen it as a miracle and may or may not have accepted, and had a 6 month long relationship which I was eventually cheated on, with a girl I met on fucking roblox.

Tough times do call for desperate measures, but I'm just stupid.

*Yes I have learned not to be so stupid.*"

The people who develop roblox games are stinky rich too.  If you have younger kids you've probably heard of the game adopt me, which is the most played game on the platform at this time (or was, I don't keep track).  The devs are millionaires because a ton of 8 year olds asked for their parents credit card to buy the new pets or whatever they buy.  Roblox takes a cut of this and *they* get rich too.  Eventually the kids have moved on from adopt me to the next big game and the cycle repeats."
2021-05-11 21:02:48,wallstreetbets,What app should I use to Invest in this?
2021-05-12 03:42:47,wallstreetbets,"Yea the roblox developing scene is miles ahead of fortnite. The developers code there games with pages on pages of lua script, build models , effects etc pretty much a full gameand get stinking rich."

2021-05-11 20:35:10,wallstreetbets,"You're right, that's probably the case. I'm pretty young, and I know how many excellent games there is, so it's hard to understand why people would play a game with terrible graphics, clunky gameplay and nothing that other game offers. 


Like I saw Car Racing Roblox games, why not play a real Racing game?


I saw a shooting roblox game, why not play COD, or Battlefield or csgo or siege, or any shooters that fit your bill. 


You want a lifelike open world? GTA5 just to name one. 


You wanna build stuff and let your imagination run wild? Minecraft, Terraria, Sims, wtv there's tons of building games. 


There is nothing in Roblox that's not already out there and Roblox doesn't make any of those things better else than regrouping them all in the same place. 


""Young generation kid shit"" isn't exactly a compelling argument as to why this game is so successful. 


Maybe i'm entirely missing what makes the game great and i'm open to understand what's the charm of the game that attracts so many people :)"
2021-05-11 22:58:55,wallstreetbets,Likely even longer. Basically the amount of time it takes for my 10 year old son to develop rheumatoid arthritis in his 80s.

They’re in kindergarten."
2021-05-11 23:53:20,wallstreetbets,"Can I ask what disappoints you? I also played a lot as a kid, and I'm actually really impressed by its current state. It initially looks like app store p2w garbage but there's some really fleshed-out and polished (relative to the past) games to be found. 

Just look at this [doom eternal clone](https://youtu.be/KRik4I8w9Y8)."
2021-05-12 01:23:43,wallstreetbets,"All my kids play, it's the main way they stayed connected with friends during pandemic. My 10yr old literally phished me to hack into my PayPal account and bought $200 worth of robux so she could get a flyable ridable unicorn.

Her friend's dad and I both bought stock after that and now it's up 15%."
2021-05-11 20:48:53,wallstreetbets,"Man, you guys are really going to make me FOMO a few grand on fucking roblox aren't you?"
2021-05-12 11:49:42,wallstreetbets,"How much bigger did people expect Facebook or Google to get? Those were also already mature at IPO

Roblox is unity, steam, Minecraft, Zynga, and kids Twitter all in one.  They  can definitely fail, but the upside potential is massive and they really have to drop the ball.  I’m more concerned for a general market downturn than RBLX under performance.

The platform is already relatively futureproof compared to older predecessors like RuneScape, flash sites, Second Life, etc. and their user base is its own source of innovation - as long as roblox continues to enable its creators, the growth potential is great."
2021-05-11 20:50:52,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps.  I thought roblox was some video game currency.  I haven't paid attention, am I way off lol?"

2021-05-11 20:10:03,wallstreetbets,Options that were worth a penny each this morning and are now worth a few dollars each. So if you bought calls this morning you’d have made 200-300x whatever you had put in
2021-05-11 21:47:07,wallstreetbets,"This was also helpful, thank you"
2021-05-11 20:49:59,wallstreetbets,Either. I’ve tried reading it and am only more confused
2021-05-12 07:49:35,wallstreetbets,"Given that the lowest underlying point was the EOD, and looking at webull chart, the option chain has no 1 cent increment-

Your own comment makes no sense. “When the stock dropped to low point of 64.70” was when it was closing time. And at that point no today’s ITM calls were worth less than 5c per share. (I’m guessing you thought it was 1c because of the mark price). 

I dug deeper than it’s needed but anyways - TLDR, options never dipped to any amount that would even come close to you’re 300x figure. 

In fact, by virtue of the EOD being the lowest point, the 400% gain would be the biggest you could make buying option son Roblox yesterday or today."
2021-05-11 23:44:02,wallstreetbets,"This was a rollercoaster. I'm picturing you as 12 years old which makes this whole scene hilarious.

2021-05-11 21:53:25,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, that was an extremely bad call at any time since they came to market. You’re paying high markups for volatility on something you have no idea what will do. Actually, there was a good chance it would dip for some time."
2021-05-11 21:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Why would you buy a call when it's at $70 to break even at $100 like wtf is wrong with you?

You could have bought 30+ shares straight up and instead just gave the money away ""holding"" hahahaha"
2021-05-12 01:46:50,wallstreetbets,WHOA! You have bigger nuts than me! I cut my losses at 30 to 50% especially on wild crazy shit like this There isn’t any reason to let one thing blow up your whole account!
2021-05-11 20:27:40,wallstreetbets,"Is that expiry after the next earnings report?
If so keep it $RBLX is up big after an earning report 100% since listing on the stock exchange 😆
Do your own dd"
2021-05-11 21:19:46,wallstreetbets,I’ve only just discovered roblox and it looks like a good investment punt both as a company and a developer.
2021-05-11 23:58:58,wallstreetbets,Same. I got one share @ $75to teach my kids about stocks. Finally in the money.
2021-05-11 23:15:55,wallstreetbets,Same here I spend an embarrassing amount of money on robux for my daughter
2021-05-11 20:53:27,wallstreetbets,Virtually anything else is a worse FOMO RBLX is solid
2021-05-12 00:16:00,wallstreetbets,"If you're buying shares, at least wait until shares drop again before you go full retard"
2021-05-11 21:38:04,wallstreetbets,It's kid crack
2021-05-11 20:09:16,wallstreetbets,Roblox is pretty big fr.
2021-05-12 13:56:14,wallstreetbets,"FB was founded in 2004, went public in 2012. When it was still barely anything. It only opened to everyone in 2006. In 2006 they had 12 million users.

Rblx was founded in 2006, went IPO in 2021, already extremely popular. It has 200 million users.

Do you believe rblx will gain adoption from another 2.4 billion users now? Why? What's different?"
2021-05-11 20:51:50,wallstreetbets,"No, you are close, robux is the name of the currency, Roblox is the game that it's in"
2021-05-12 02:51:38,wallstreetbets,Yeah you need to lose everything on an options play at least once to be able to trade options. Its like a right of passage.
2021-05-11 22:25:13,wallstreetbets,AYYYY YEHH AYYYY EHH!!
2021-05-11 21:24:40,wallstreetbets,Well I’m glad I’m not alone lol
2021-05-11 20:57:32,wallstreetbets,"Oh okay, yeah maybe. Quick question: When the fuck do earnings ever make the price go up??"
2021-05-11 20:11:34,wallstreetbets,"What? How would 300x your return on $500 be $1500? He was right, it’d be $150k. Check your math again lol"
2021-05-11 20:43:13,wallstreetbets,Yeah options always sound awesome when you hear shit like this. But it doesn't actually go that way.
2021-05-11 21:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Some of them are lotto tickets, some of them are insurance. Some are overpriced and some are underpriced. Do a bunch of research and simulation trading before you gamble any real amount of money. Learn the greeks, do your due diligence, dont gamble with money you need to pay rent or eat with. Once you are confident you know what you are doing, yolo your entire life savings on one far out of the money once in a lifetime seismic market shift option that expires in one day to escape wage slavery. Rinse and repeat."
2021-05-11 21:09:59,wallstreetbets,"It’s part of option trading. A Call option is basically a bet that a stock will go up. You pay a premium for the right to buy 100 or more shares at a strike price, and you’re able actually buy them by a certain date. 

Ex: Say a share of Apple is $100. I think it’ll go up to $110 sometime soon. So I buy Apple calls for $0.60/share (100x0.6=60, so I’d pay $60), that $0.60 is the premium. The strike price I choose is $105. The expiration date can be whenever you choose. So if I see apple going up, I can exercise my call option whenever I want before the expiration date, which actually buys the shares. So now I own 100 apple shares (that I brought for $105 each + the premium I paid), and I can sell them for their actual price. You don’t have to exercise the call option if you don’t want too. The risk is losing that $60, and Apple never going up. Or you exercising the call and not making a profit. 

A put option is the exact opposite, a bet a stock will go down.

Edit: added in the strike price"
2021-05-12 09:38:58,wallstreetbets,"The May 14, $75 strike calls are showing a one-cent low point from the morning.

And there's no way 400% gain is the ""biggest you could make"" considering I literally saw the options at 50 cents in real time at one point and it ended the day at $3.80 which is far bigger than 400%.

That 400% figure is misleading because it only takes into account day to day percentages and no intra-day lows.

I think you're confusing my statement, thinking I meant less than 10 cents on May 10, but I meant yesterday, May 11."
2021-05-11 23:46:04,wallstreetbets,"I'm 15, I'll be 16 in a few weeks.  This all happened when I was 14 so a bit ago but not that long ago."
2021-05-11 20:01:43,wallstreetbets,He may not know where to put it on at. At least with 3 of them he’s hedging his position
2021-05-11 21:21:53,wallstreetbets,"Hey, no kink shame here."
2021-05-11 21:34:17,wallstreetbets,You just gotta spend a second rents worth of money on the boosts. Sucks and takes forever but hey
2021-05-11 21:37:08,wallstreetbets,"They were all good in the beginning, thats part of the business to gradually make it shittier and shittier and more dependent on paying the subscription fees."
2021-05-11 22:55:39,wallstreetbets,"You used to live with your cousin, eh?"
2021-05-11 20:19:18,wallstreetbets,Thas racis!!
2021-05-12 03:08:03,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but who even remembers how to do normal things still? A lot of kids are just not going to go back to running laps at soccer practice. They will continue staring at a monitor. 

It’s pretty easy to fall out of “sports” especially when video games are as good as they are.

Regardless, gaming sure as hell isn’t going anywhere. Too addicting. Kids will still play if they have to wait until after they get home from school."
2021-05-11 21:10:56,wallstreetbets,oh sorry for the ignorance. I looked at the chart wrong. dumb me
2021-05-11 20:10:56,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I saw that, what dyou think of it? Would love to own some 😂"
2021-05-11 21:39:33,wallstreetbets,"Good points you are bringing.


However their revenue isn't falling from the sky, they are making billions so people playing must end up spending more money on cosmetics(or wtv you spend money for in roblox) than if they had bought a game. 


Another point, correct me if I'm wrong, but I read that a lot of game on roblox are so laggy on mobile and low end computers that they're almost unplayable with a decent FPS because the game isn't optimized for what people are creating, essentially limiting the creativity of users."
2021-05-11 23:31:46,wallstreetbets,"I should have heard from at least some people in my environment that their kids aren't playing other popular games anymore, but are completely into Roblox. Since that hasn't happened, the numbers are likely fake.

I really think everyone invested is going to lose at least 80% of their money in three years."
2021-05-11 21:52:43,wallstreetbets,"Well I have stories to tell about my exciting forays in to options. Some smart, some not so much...

But at least I am not doing it on robinhood, fuck those guys."
2021-05-11 22:48:50,wallstreetbets,Yeah I jumped on it the 1st day options were availible that was dumb.  At least if it's over 80 I can exercise the option and get some discounted regular shares and hold them indefinitely.
2021-05-12 01:48:30,wallstreetbets,I completely agree with you! New IPOs are always overvalued for the most part. The first few months anyways!
2021-05-11 21:36:27,wallstreetbets,Did you forget what sub you're on?
2021-05-11 22:49:42,wallstreetbets,"I also did but a bunch of regular shares on the IPO day.

For the option, I jumped on it the 1st day options were availible that was dumb. At least if it's over 80 I can exercise the option and get some discounted regular shares and hold them indefinitely."

2021-05-11 22:47:20,wallstreetbets,"7/16 is in two months, that doesn't seem like it would be after the next one."
2021-05-12 00:42:24,wallstreetbets,"Agree on both fronts. As a gamer, meh. But kids fucking love it and there is huge potential for Devs to earn via in game currency and huge upside for investors via a giant dedicated user base with their parents CCs."
2021-05-12 10:01:42,wallstreetbets,It just never ends does it?
2021-05-11 21:09:05,wallstreetbets,"I don't even know what roblox is, but if you guys are so bullish on it maybe I'll wait for a dip, buy at least 100 shares to then sell weekly OTM calls."
2021-05-11 22:05:08,wallstreetbets,Yup you can sit on RBLX for 2 years and it will likely go up a nice amount. No way is this touching anywhere close 50
2021-05-12 00:37:35,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I have that [covered.](https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/na55rn/rblx_holders/gxsu7ve/)"

50% of your comment was wrong dude, at least put some slight effort into it."
2021-05-12 15:58:51,wallstreetbets,"Quick question - what is your experience with Roblox? Have you only checked out a couple of games on it, or have you experienced the whole scene between the creators, influencers, etc involved in it?

I look at Minecraft’s peak and expect roblox to surpass that.  If its current value on the market is 30B with 200m users and 1B revenue then when it has 1B users and improved monetization rate then it’s not going to be a small potato gain."
2021-05-11 20:56:06,wallstreetbets,Amazing to see that.
2021-05-11 22:40:35,wallstreetbets,My first two years of trading option premiums saw more crashes than all the folding tables at an early fall Sunday morning tailgate in the mudlot.

2021-05-11 23:30:50,wallstreetbets,"Robinhood shows that the May 14 $75 calls increased 400%, meaning it was a 5 bagger. Where are you getting 300x?"
2021-05-11 20:34:12,wallstreetbets,"The math on this still isn’t making sense to me. Are you saying 500 dollars or 500 shares, if you bought and it was 12% up....I’m just maybe an asshole that’s missing something."
2021-05-11 20:14:14,wallstreetbets,"let's walk this through.

100 dollars. 10% of it is 10$, 20% of it 20$...100% of it 100$, 200% of it 200$  
500 dollars . 10% of it is 50$, 20% of it 100$...100% of it 500$, 200% of it 1000$

so 500 + 1000 (returns) = 1500"

Is it luck to find at that price? Do people set alerts for all the options or go thru all the options when market opens?
2021-05-11 20:41:09,wallstreetbets,"I think you still have a chance profit from rblx. See what happen at pre-market tomorrow.

I don't know if the earnings change things but looking at the chart history the price drops at least $5 within 30days. I would like it to push pass 82 and trade $73~$77 but Tech stock took a hit today because people had inflation concerns. I think the fed will talk tomorrow or Wednesday. So I wonder how people would react."

2021-05-12 17:08:02,wallstreetbets,As a general rule a call option should never be worth less than its intrinsic value. Your 80 calls would have an intrinsic value of 5 (in the above assumption that it’s at 85) and then there would be some time value on top of that. Especially with upward momentum you should be able to get a lot more for those calls than $5. Personally I would generally just sell options rather than exercise them if there’s still some time left. Hope it works out for ya!

2021-05-11 22:19:04,wallstreetbets,"That’s what I was wondering too, it would be impossible to get 500 options at 0.01.

I know a lot of people add orders with 0.01 in thinkorswim app just so they can track the graph of that option, and maybe one of them actually got lucky with 1 option at that price."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"IFF Earnings May 10 2021, what happened? Hi everyone! I was curious if anyone had any insight regarding IFF earnings. The company 's announcement was great! reflecting both earnings and revenue beat, with surprise. However,  the stock didn't outpace the Y/Y expectations. 

After the announcement,  after market trading went flat. (I've never seen a stock with so much volatility going into earnings go completely still in after market trading. ) Today, the stock is five points down, even before their morning conference call.

I realize the Dow is very bearish today. However,  often an earnings announcement seems somewhat immune to entire market and the underlying stock will move regardless despite what might be happening in the stock market as a whole. 

Any thoughts anyone? I'm missing something key regarding the market's psychology and how investors responded to IFF today. 

Thanks,
Gideon 😁"

2021-05-11 22:22:40,wallstreetbets,"You actually have to buy them deep OTM and a lot of them if you want to make real gains on a real rally. VEGA GAMMA and DELTA to price ratio all are in your favor if your right on the trade. A DEEP ITM OPTION Takes DELTA from 80 to 95 at best and a DEEP OTM option goes fro 7 delta to 95 delta at best. For every DEEP ITM OPTION you can buy a larger qty OTM OPTIONS for the same price and it will get your more Delta, Vega, and Gamm exposure in exchange for slightly more theta exposure which is bad but I believe the increase in the other Greek positions is in my favor when I choose OTM over ITM. What’s your reasoning behind DEEP ITM Vs. OTM?"
2021-05-12 09:26:19,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and then a couple of days after the drop it’s market cap went up 20 billion later going up 35% above all time highs after they kicked him off 🥸

2021-05-12 09:36:38,wallstreetbets,"the stock has gone up because it is a tech stock in the greatest bull market in recorded history, not because of improvements within the company. you can throw darts at the Dow 30 and make the same return, but by all means, go on patting yourself on the back. 

I did not short Twitter, but withdrew my investment shortly before trump was removed (purely lucky on my timing) as I sensed management did not understand their business model revolves around drama and engagements. They have clearly idealized their roles, and it is evident in the absolute **beatdown** on their earnings this morning. Decelerating revenues and lackluster user growth are symptoms of management issues.

2021-05-11 20:25:57,wallstreetbets,"You know I started off using rocket last month, but went with someone local as the originator just because the realtor had a relationship with them and handled a lot of the paperwork. All communication with the finance people was over email and DocuSign or something similar. The only time I met my loan officer was at closing, never had to call her.

I'm sure if I'd gone with a local CU the process could've been more complicated because my CU kinda sucks at technology, but only person I talked to on the phone was my agent, and that was only to discuss the negotiation with the seller agent. I maybe spent 30 minutes on the phone, with anyone, during the whole process.

You gotta remember, Millennials have adult jobs now, like realtor and loan officer, and they don't like phone calls, either.

I've got RKT, too, I think it's a great product with strong brand recognition, but they aren't the only game in town. Word of mouth is still huge in this space."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why ASO is going to fly like Maverick in Top Gun.🚀💯🌔 DISCLAIMER - I AM NOT A FINANCIAL Advisor and this information which I have worked hard on should not be used to gamble irresponsibly on stocks.

Academy Sports is a big time big sporting goods store. They sale stuff for playing sports and catching deers and trapping fish. 

If you walk down the golf isle you will see that they have lots of options for golf ball bats. One very special package caught my eyes. It was a type of ball called a top flight. This is critical, ASO is trying to tell all of us retarded gorillas that they are going to fly high. But because of restriction placed on them by the SEC otherwise known as the South Eastern Conference which delegates all schools with good football teams and business they can't just come right out and say that!! It is against the rules! So they created and are selling golfing balls that are sending us messages. The other ball was a Titleist. What is a Titleist you ask!? It is someone who finishes in 1st place and holds a title, just like ASO is planning to do, become the top flighted Titleist of the world.

Seconds, as I was walking out of the store with my top flights I saw a good looking lady gorilla walking in who had on a see through dress. Now as all of us know, gorillas who like catching deers and stuff also like seeing lady gorillas who wear see through dresses so me and a few other gorillas turned around and walked right back into the store. I followed around the lady Ape for a while and was putting stuff in my buggie so she wouldn't think I was a creeper gorilla and since I had the stuff I had to buy it. I spent 684.56 on some soccer socks and waffle ball bats and balls that I don't even need along with a few sweat bands and and a pair of knee high rubber boots🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️.

I have gone back everyday for the past two weeks looking for other lady Apes and have had some success but I noticed a bunch of other gorillas doing the same. I think that ASO is sending woman gorillas in there to attract man gorillas to buy stuff, I can not provide this as true but it makes too much sense to not be fact.

For these reason I highly like ASO and hope you do too💯🚀🌔🌔🌔"

2021-05-11 22:44:10,wallstreetbets,What do you think the short float is?
2021-05-12 00:01:31,wallstreetbets,"No idea wtf a ‘short float’ is. 20%+ of the overall float is shorted. The float is 99% owned by insiders and institutions, which means there is 1% of the float available to cover said 20% short position. This means boom 💥 pow 💥 motherfucker. Moon shot. I should note that the institutional ownership also includes the shorted shares, so basically this will be a pissing match between some large HF’s until one can close their shorts. While retail rides the wave."

If not I will give you a quick synopsis. He lists credentials ,of bringing a company back from the brink ,in the past. He explains what new share offerings would be used for. Putting to rest any fear that it would undervalue or dilute the stock. Such shares would only be used for the purpose of expansion and generating more income. A great explanation, of why one of AMC's, biggest shareholders liquidated stock. He gave candid answers . These answers put to rest most fears many of us have. From these answers. I am convinced now more than ever. AMC is undervalued and worth holding. He openly said. Does not expect profit levels of 2019,Until 2023. At that point and Beyond he expects the company to grow.

2021-05-12 10:54:27,wallstreetbets,"Lower fees. Because they don’t make investing decisions and just track an index, they don’t have as many costs and therefore they can charge a lower fee to the customer. So instead of charging you 1% to manage your money they can charge you .5% because they aren’t actively making investment decisions.

2021-05-12 10:26:30,wallstreetbets,"Lol black rock holds so many assets. I wouldn’t look into that too much if I was you. But if you did the math you’d probably reach a logical conclusion... how many shares have amc issued over the last year? Any idea? I’ll update you. September 2020 they had 110 million shares outstanding. As of may 2021 the company has 460m shares outstanding (so essentially a 3-fold increase). Black rock, largely, is a passive fund manager. For them to maintain the same % shareholding as they did prior to share issuance, they would have to purchase tens of millions of shares... so yea I’m not surprised."
2021-05-12 10:30:07,wallstreetbets,"So for example, if black rock owned about 8% of outstanding float in September (around 8 million shares), they would have to purchase 24 million shares to maintain their level of ownership. If amc is part of an index/sector fund that black rock owns, they would try to at least maintain that % ownership unless of course amc valuation plummeted, then they would likely sell shares. Black rock tries to match the index or sector they are tracking (not the case for all of their investments but for the passive funds this is definitely true)."

This is now a person that they can account for, when charging advertising Revenue. And maybe just maybe that person doesn't go to the movie at all that month."
2021-05-12 10:40:36,wallstreetbets,"Yes equity will become worthless. As I stated If you read my post, “I don’t know when that will happen.. but it will definitely happen.” I expect it will happen in the next 2 years and likely sooner. Just cause people are buying more shares right now does not mean the shares can’t become worthless. The company is strapped for cash. What do you think happens to the share price if amc announce that they are filing for bankruptcy? Amc will be fine through the rest of the year.

2021-05-12 03:30:05,wallstreetbets,"You're the worst type of person - you're an egotist, patronising and pretty dumb.

When you're valuing a company, you don't look at market cap and think ""Oh well there it is! This is the true value of the company, the efficient market has done it again! They've correctly valued the company!"", there'd be no point investing/trading any stock as they'd all be correctly valued.

A valuation metric determines what the value of a company should be, the price of the company (i.e. market cap) is not a valuation metric as it's literally the price of the company. If I went to the beach and sold you sand for $10,000 a kg, is that a valuation metric? Or is the fact that there's 1000s of kg of sand behind me you can get for free a better way to assess the actual value of what I'm selling you?

Thank you also for regurgitating stuff you've read or heard in a finance 101 class like EPV. I'm glad someone is wasting their time trying to calculate accurate WACCs...

You're pedantic even for things when you're wrong. It's absolutely crazy, I guess most people hate you in real life so you come here to be yourself in the hope that some day someone will show you some appreciation for how smart you think you are, it's just a bit sad for you that that'll never happen."
2021-05-12 10:45:31,wallstreetbets,GME is completely different to AMC. GME actually has a decent financial position. Even though they need to change their mode or they are dead. Whereas with AMC they have unserviceable debt levels. Yea they paid off debt by issuing more shares. And guess what... the debt has gone back up to where it was prior to paying off the debt. So within 6 months they’ve taken on more debt.
2021-05-12 10:48:05,wallstreetbets,"That’s not how passive funds work... they don’t make investment decisions. They track a sector or an index. If amc is 10% of the movie theatre or entertainment sector then black rock will own enough amc to represent 10% of the fund... so when amcs valuation goes up because retail are buying, black rock has to increase their holding so it matches the sector. Likewise if amc issues more shares, and black rock gets diluted, they buy more shares to match the initial fund split."
2021-05-12 10:50:19,wallstreetbets,"They don’t say, “oh this company is struggling we better make a decision to sell.” You also have to consider that even if amc went bankrupt it would still only represent a small portion of the fund so again, they don’t make those decisions. The only decision they make is to track the sector or index as close as possible."
2021-05-12 03:48:41,wallstreetbets,"😂 you’re so upset. Haha it’s not finance 101 and I’m glad you googled EPV to see that the term “WACC” is also associated 😆 . A valuation metric has nothing to do with “What the price should be”. You are just digging this hole deeper and deeper and I love it. It’s just that... a metric! Lol.... No one can truly calculate the exact real valuation/price of a company by doing/using some price to book calculation. Market cap is the truest valuation metric of a company whether you like it or not. Don’t get upset. I can LITERALLY go into my brokerage account and buy a company for the price on the screen and whether you like it or not, it is a valuation metric. It’s literally what the market is willing to sell it’s shares to me on any given day (a valuation metric that is tied to actual buyers and sellers). Please go back to finance 101 if you’re struggling with this concept. Please don’t reference efficient markets because you’re barking up the wrong tree.... And please, use a resource other than investopedia.. maybe read a book?"
2021-05-12 04:06:50,wallstreetbets,"If I said to you, “I want to buy this company outright today! What do you think the valuation is?” Yes, I agree, I might reference different valuation techniques to determine an intrinsic value or an asset value or an earnings power value... but I would still get back to the point that the valuation today is what market says it is. I might not agree with that valuation and maybe the market is absolutely nuts... but it’s still a metric and one which I would have to consider, if I were to purchase fractional ownership in that company today."
2021-05-12 04:16:30,wallstreetbets,"Now if I asked, “what SHOULD BE the valuation of this company 12 months from now?” Then market cap might not be a great metric, but it would still be a metric. It’s a metric against which I would judge all my other valuation techniques. But yes, there would likely be better metrics. And for some companies, the market cap would be the best valuation metric.. if the market is behaving as it should. Since it sounds as though you like ‘Value investing’, I’ll leave you with this: “In the short run the market is a voting machine but in the long run it is a weighing machine.” The trouble is deciphering whether or not the market is behaving rationally (IE behaving as a weighing machine)."

2021-05-12 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Blue Hydrogen - Where all that clean energy money will be at in the next 5 years So I was listening into APDs conference call just the other day. I'll be honest, I've always been a fan of the prospects of hydrogen. I don't think many people even know blue hydrogen exists, so for those of you in that boat, I've given an idea of what blue hydrogen is, and I'll also outline the future uses for hydrogen (And no, I'm not talking about car transport).

##** What is Blue Hydrogen? 

Blue hydrogen is hydrogen produced using natural gas, with the CO2 emissions generated during the process captured and stored. This CO2 can be captured and potentially sold on for even more profit on top of those made from hydrogen production. It is one of the most effective, environmentally friendly ways of producing hydrogen, and APD plans to be the leaders of this, according to their most recent conference call

##**The Facts:

Hydrogen production costs have fallen 40% since 2015,and are expected to fall by a further 40% through 2025. Economists think $2/kg is a potential tipping point that will make hydrogen competitive in multiple sectors, including power generation and long-range shipping. Green hydrogen is a long way from there, currently at $2.50-6.80 per kg. Blue Hydrogen however, ranges from $1.40-2.40 per kg.

Key factors driving the hydrogen generation market growth include rising demand for petroleum coke in the steel industry, development in the cement and power generation industries, growth in the supply of heavy oils globally and favourable government initiatives regarding the sustainable and green environment. Rising oil prices encourage oil companies to extract poorer source material, such as oil sands and oil shale in a process called hydrocracking. [Source](grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/hydrogen-generation-market)

##**Potential Uses for Hydrogen

There are quite a few potential uses for hydrogen in the future. If governments push hard for a change to green energy, maritime and air transport will be left with 2 options, convert to hydrogen, or convert to nuclear power. I'm not going to make the bet on which way it goes, but there are not many options for these types of transport.

TL;DR

Blue Hydrogen is the most cost-efficient future for hydrogen, and has a competitive price with fossil fuels, and can dominate in markets where electricity/solar/etc aren't powerful enough. There's already a huge market there, with no signs of any slowing in growth. Will prosper a lot as long as fossil fuels are around, and being used for fuel, already does prosper."
2021-05-12 03:21:10,wallstreetbets,"I guess the issue Green Hydrogen vs Blue Hydrogen is mostly political:

\- center right parties, which are more careful on costs of new techs for the economy (corporations and individuals) mostly favor blue hydrogen. It costs less, it can fasten the adoption of hydrogen in multiple sectors and will be linked to Carbon Capture, which is indeed what oil & gas companies love

\- center left parties want green hydrogen at all costs, it does not matter that there is not enough green electricity supply in excesso or that the grid is not there to stand huge amounts of new electricity for green hydrogen production...

&#x200B;

Looking at the EU landscape, if green party does not win much in germany but it is going to rule with the FDP we will see a compromise in this sense. Carbon Capture facilities in exhausted natural gas fields in the north sea are being seriously considered and this political scenario will favor that

As investment plays I recommend:

\- $GTLS Chart Industries, which manufactures CO2 tanks, LNG tanks, Hydrogen tanks and all related infrastructure (maybe fully priced now, better to wait for a pull back)

\- Xebec, Canadian Company into blue hydrogen purification (you need to purify hydrogen if you want it to be good for PEM fuel cells) and carbon capture

\- Aker Carbon Capture, small direct play part of the Norwegian Aker Group"
2021-05-12 04:30:33,wallstreetbets,"All projects involving carbon storage will fail to become economically viable is a very, very solid rule of thumb. 
Regarding hydrogen production, I would look with extreme doubt at any long term play involving production from natural gas. Electrolysis gear is getting cheaper per capacity quite quickly, and with both France and Russia gearing up to use electrolysers to level demand (the marginal cost of running a reactor full throttle as opposed to 60% at 3 am is *negative* - Keeping it running full blast instead of swing producing is gentler on the machinery) , that is potentially one heck of a lot of clean supply of hydrogen."
2021-05-12 09:54:31,wallstreetbets,"Many people see this as betting on a sector to succeed, but there will not be any other way. Other technologies need more time to develop, and most countries will start to act in the next 19 years. Hydrogen will be competitive much faster due to CO2 prices getting higher globally and Hydrogen Tech getting pushed heavily by some states. This will not be a big deal in cars, most scientists (and Elon Musk) agree on this.

I will jump back into the Global Clean Energy ETF soon and buy some single stocks like NEL ASA, they all just went through a heavy correction. This is a long term thing."
2021-05-11 20:39:38,wallstreetbets,"I agree 100% steam reformation is the next step in US energy, carbon capture on a large scale is almost there. South Korea just made a functional large scale H2 power plant, hydrogen production is the bottleneck there and natural gas is the solution. Green hydrogen uses too much filtered water to be super-viable on a large scale the way that steam reformation from gas is."
2021-05-11 22:19:19,wallstreetbets,"I'll add it to the M1 long-term portfolio, sure why not. I think the industry will continue to slow grow, the dividend is attractive, and the potential for blue hydrogen sending this higher is an added bonus."
2021-05-12 09:01:29,wallstreetbets,"And how does carbon emissions from co2 tanks help the environment? 
On a small scale storage is feasible. But on the scale where this becomes a money maker, co2 storage will get expensive to the point where it would become bad for business. Then it goes in the environment. Right? What am I missing here?

This tech ain't going no where."

2021-05-12 01:03:25,wallstreetbets,"Energy density is a thing.  Moving a lot of weight long distances means storing a lot of energy.  Batteries do not lend themselves to that.  The best lithium-ion batteries today have an energy density of about 1 MJ/kg.  Diesel fuel comes in around 40 MJ/kh.  Hydrogen is north of 120 MJ/kg.  In other words it takes 120-lbs of batteries to store the same energy that's stored in 1-lb of hydrogen gas.  

That's why we won't be seeing battery powered airplanes, ships, or even long-haul semi trucks any time in the near future.

As for hydrogen powered cars - you can buy one now if you live in a city with hydrogen fueling stations.  As the OP stated, that's not where the primary use of hydrogen will be - at least not in developed countries with the infrastructure required to charge batteries.  But hydrogen defiantly will be a significant source of energy in the transportation sector outside of domestic passenger cars."
2021-05-12 09:37:40,wallstreetbets,"This…. Mostly.   

As renewables become more prevalent, electrolysis and hydrogen storage will be used to soak up excess demand and to store energy for commercial transportation.

However, I don’t fully agree on the carbon capture statement in the near-term.  We have a tendency of subsidizing dumb things when lobbiest have their way.  O&G companies stand to benefit the most from carbon capture and they have historically bought their way into subsidies."

Those that don't think the government is competent enough to keep a secret this big in the first place will see it as a smoke screen to hide something else. AI controlled drones or something. Basically, 90% of the population won't even hear about or read the report. The 10% who do will just use it to confirm whatever bias they already have. Ain't nobody changing their behavior over one government report.

2021-05-12 07:09:30,wallstreetbets,"Everything you see in the sky is of human origin. It is not backwards engineered alien technology. It is technology bases on Unified Field theorem. Knowledge of the true physics of our reality that has been in certain human hands since before recorded history. This knowledge is purposely kept from the general public as it unifies all science and religions. It proves absolutely the existence of an immortal human soul, as well as anti-gravity, free enegry, and superluminal technology. As you can clearly see, if this knowledge was allowed to become widely known, it would instantly destroy the entire world economy. All Governments would collapse under the weight of the truth they have been hiding. It will never be allowed to happen. Aliens are the true ""Big Lie"", and simply a cover story they will use to inslave humanity further. I am not saying that Aliens do not exist... ""As above, so below"". However, they want nothing to do with us until this truth is known by all. They are waiting for us to... Settle our own affairs. If there is some kind of disclosure, remember these words, because I can prove them true empirically. Unified Field theorem is a mathematical expression, not an equation, as Nature does not do math, Nature only knows how to express itself. That expression is 1/(1.618^-3). Which is the basis for the Pythagorean Pentagram. It is a two dimensional representation of a physical three dimensional process. Three interlocking triangles whose angles equal 108°,36°,36°. This is also the basis of Platonic Monastic Metaphysics, and Sacred Geometry. The Fibonacci sequence is also included in this understanding. This is why the ""elite"" (little e) for some unknown reason seem to be so intrigued by the occult (secret). They are Oculists, and that is why the ""All Seeing Eye"" is on the U.S. Dollar. This is also why the Pentagram is on many ancient gold coins as well. Our health, our minds, every aspect of life is constantly manipulated by disinformation. Modern physics and medicine has no clue what it is doing. It is all based on false assumptions, and kept that way purposefully. Believe me or not at your own peril. Just don't be the first ones to enter any of their ships. If we want to have a conversation with real aliens, we must raise ourselves to the capability of meeting them on their own level. We are not ants! All life is connected, all consciousness is collective."

Sure, there will be technological developments in the future, but usually theory change, not laws. Remember, even gravity is a theory. 

Additionally, as others have said, if they have technology to travel interstellarly (Is that a word?) any current weapons we have, would be like our Military fighting a group of kids with sticks and stones. I get the thought of budget to invest in new weapons, but the result would be: We don't need the weapons as the aliens are helping us or they are hostile and won't wait to raid our planet for resources. Either way, if this goes down, money won't matter. 

Now let's talk about the station underground on MARS. Are you going to act like we don't have all kinds of telescopes on this planet. How are they sneaking launches off and sending people to Mars without anyone seeing it. With this knowledge and need, wouldn't have been easier to continue funding NASA and a shuttle program rather than contracting Elon and his Rockets at Space X?

* 1) He fell for the old “Haim Eshed” conspiracy - despite his many public objections to the contrary, anyone with any familiarity with Israel (former IDF officer here) knows that he doesn’t actually exist & if he did, he’d spell his name Chaim.

* 2) Investing in Defense Stocks is entirely the wrong move to arbitrage the eventual revelation of Alien activity. 

For one thing, everyone already knows that our government has been infiltrated by the lizard people (*& Mark Zuckerberg is one of their non-political leaders, just as a random aside*) & second, anyone who has knows anything about intergalactic federations knows that it requires technology so far ahead of ours that our most advanced weapons would be like throwing clumps of mud at an aircraft carrier.

I mean seriously, how many F22s is the government going to order once their current ones prove less threatening than biting flies.

Now, if you want to invest in industries that will benefit from the unveiling of alien life, I’ll give you three solid tips:

* 1) Adult diapers - there is going to be anywhere from 5 to 7 billions pairs of pants shat when these revelations go public & not just once, chances are they’ll be repeatedly shat for at least 4-6 weeks while people get their brains around the news.

Not to mention, if what I’ve been seeing on Reddit advertisement for OnlyFans, there are going to be an ever increasing supply of distended anuses which will need to be mitigated.

* 2) Canned Cat food - everyone knows that shit is like crack to both the Aliens & the Lizard people so again you’ve got two distinct & complementary growth markets.

* 3) Tin foil - Sure at first it will be awesome to have a three tittied alien “girl”friend who can anticipate your every whim & desire but eventually you’re going to want to have at least a few thoughts to yourself so you’re going to need plenty of tinfoil. 

Besides that, it’s going to be really awkward when they find out that the customary greeting ritual of our species doesn’t usually involve sticking out genitals in each other’s mouths."

2021-05-12 07:22:44,wallstreetbets,"Everything you see in the sky is of human origin. It is not backwards engineered alien technology. It is technology bases on Unified Field theorem. Knowledge of the true physics of our reality that has been in certain human hands since before recorded history. This knowledge is purposely kept from the general public as it unifies all science and religions. It proves absolutely the existence of an immortal human soul, as well as anti-gravity, free enegry, and superluminal technology. As you can clearly see, if this knowledge was allowed to become widely known, it would instantly destroy the entire world economy. All Governments would collapse under the weight of the truth they have been hiding. It will never be allowed to happen. Aliens are the true ""Big Lie"", and simply a cover story they will use to inslave humanity further. I am not saying that Aliens do not exist... ""As above, so below"". However, they want nothing to do with us until this truth is known by all. They are waiting for us to... Settle our own affairs. If there is some kind of disclosure, remember these words, because I can prove them true empirically. Unified Field theorem is a mathematical expression, not an equation, as Nature does not do math, Nature only knows how to express itself. That expression is 1/(1.618^-3). Which is the basis for the Pythagorean Pentagram. It is a two dimensional representation of a physical three dimensional process. Three interlocking triangles whose angles equal 108°,36°,36°. This is also the basis of Platonic Monastic Metaphysics, and Sacred Geometry. The Fibonacci sequence is also included in this understanding. This is why the ""elite"" (little e) for some unknown reason seem to be so intrigued by the occult (secret). They are Oculists, and that is why the ""All Seeing Eye"" is on the U.S. Dollar. This is also why the Pentagram is on many ancient gold coins as well. Our health, our minds, every aspect of life is constantly manipulated by disinformation. Modern physics and medicine has no clue what it is doing. It is all based on false assumptions, and kept that way purposefully. Believe me or not at your own peril. Just don't be the first ones to enter any of their ships. If we want to have a conversation with real aliens, we must raise ourselves to the capability of meeting them on their own level. We are not ants! All life is connected, all consciousness is collective."

Well you see that is the thing, they have recovered materials and crafts that defense contractors for oh about 80 years or so have been trying reverse engineer this technology; during that process biproducts are discovered that helped create the stealth bomber tech, fiber optics, night vision, and of course anti gravity.

So we have secret mesmerizing human made anti gravity technology that will be acknowledged  as a potential solution to the UFO problem, made by defense contractors and private institutions, such as Battelle Memorial Institute, RAND.

This acknowledgment of secret tech will be a catalyst for future profits in the trillion dollar space econonomy.

It’s the plasma bubble that is able to seem unaffected by standard aerodynamics and do things a normal airplane wouldn’t be able to do like rapid acceleration, high g maneuvers by rapidly changing direction, etc. 

An airplane can’t do that due to aerodynamic resistance. But if the airplane is inside a bubble of plasma it’s constantly generating

2021-05-11 23:33:34,wallstreetbets,I've had many sleepless nights thinking about this. It is absolutely normal and is necessary to come to term with this reality. Good news is that they are most likely benevolent. If they've been here for a while they would of already taken over. What? Are they going to wait until we are fully aware of them and then attempt to defend ourselves?
2021-05-12 00:40:51,wallstreetbets,I would of but I'm only wanted to present confirmed evidence by high-ranking officials that happened recently. Maybe I could make a second post and add that to it

2021-05-12 09:29:17,wallstreetbets,"Assuming that each star system has 4 planets each, they would need 100 BILLION+ units to scan these multiple planets.... and that's assuming they all run perfectly and never need to be repaired nor run out of fuel. That seems like a rather impossible number of units to achieve

Putting it into perspective, from 1999 to 2016, the *world* only managed to build ~900,000,000 cars over 18 years. Thats 0.9% of how many units would be needed to be built to scan the galaxy simultaneously as you suggested, And mind you, these cars were sold for profit and these funds were used to continue building and selling more cars. These aliens wouldn't even be making any profit since these units are only scanning for intelligent life. So how could they possibly fund/have the resources to build 100 billion units?

Not only that, but let's assume that if it takes 20 years to build 1% (100 million cars), this would imply that it *could* take the aliens up to ***2,000*** years to build these units if they built them at the same scale as humans build cars

Your suggestion seems highly improbable"

2021-05-12 13:30:55,wallstreetbets,But maybe that only applies under our morality and our civilizations. Maybe they become more and more efficient and we present inefficiency. I'm scared.
2021-05-12 09:48:05,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, so if we run out of resources on earth to build 100,000,000,000 cars, we should just go to Jupiter and build cars out of gases? Or should we go to Venus and just burn to death from the extreme heat? Maybe if we're lucky, Uranus can supply us with the *super duper special gasses* that we could use to build metal units

2021-05-12 06:54:37,wallstreetbets,"AMD is slightly below 10x revenue at 50%+ growth forecast for this year, 20% CAGR for next 5 years (historically CAGR guidance is very conservative, will almost certainly be higher)"

2021-05-12 08:32:32,wallstreetbets,Yeah..and those $800M in options vest over the next 10 years. It’s disingenuous to say they paid him $1B as if that compensation could’ve been used for anything else. It’s stock awards agreed upon prior to the company going public. This is like executive compensation 101.

Ceo announced buyback and insinuated that he intends to start buying as early as tomorrow... still millions of short shares outstanding that havnt covered. Interest on short shares went from 3.6 last week to 14.5 today. High OI on May calls. 9c, 10c and 12.5c being the highest.

Small float about to get smaller... high OI... millions of shares still shorted.... cheap stock that moves with little volume. This stock can be pushed around. There is money to be made with this recipe if there is enough buying pressure.

You don't have to like it to make money."

2021-05-12 19:07:50,wallstreetbets,"> there are basically no moral companies

""Moral"" is ambiguous, despite your preconceived notions. 

Look around you. We're in a casino throwing our paltry sums at equities most of us don't understand in an effort to strike it rich. Most of us will lose our shirt, some of us will make fortunes. 

Tell me, where is the morality in all of that?"
2021-05-12 08:11:58,wallstreetbets,"The buyout is the real play ultimately. 

It got attention here cause of the short float.

2021-05-12 19:46:41,wallstreetbets,It means that the point is no longer to improve humanity. That part of our history is done. Now we’re fighting for scraps in a dying world. We just don’t see it yet.

2021-05-11 20:49:19,wallstreetbets,"Dont you guys get it,

On margin on purpose. When youre on margin, your shares can be lent out to shorts aka sell into open and then bought back when it crashes for a healthy profit

Thats why you’re seeing that big spike at open. Its shorts covering for yesterday 

A retail trader does not know this so he buys thinking its a rally but its not.

Its just shorts covering and then when retail buys in they short again"

I am a Bachelor student in media studies from the University of Groningen, the Netherlands and currently do digital ethnography research on r/wallstreetbets. As I am a big fan of this community, this project means a lot for me and it would be really great to chat with members of WSB or even have video-call interviews. Please contact me if you would be willing to be interviewed (via chat or video-call). I am generally interested in how participants perceive WSB and what they do with information that they get here. Apart from that, why do you guys come to the community here? If you are interested and want to know more about me or the project I am doing, don’t hesitate to contact me!

2021-05-11 22:37:37,wallstreetbets,I noticed on Schwab 104% of shares are owned by institutions. Is that why ppl think this will squeeze again? Bc I know the short interest is a fraction of what it was.

2021-05-11 22:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Yes. They shorted well over the float, and people are not convinced  they covered. Even moreso, it seems plausible that HFs have been shorting even more to try to tank the price to get people to panic sell. Short percent is self-reported, so it is in the best interest of the HFs to say they have covered."

2021-05-11 21:09:52,wallstreetbets,This is the laziest answer ever.
2021-05-12 05:53:45,wallstreetbets,"Well, Bloomberg terminal shows short interest around 21%. Not sure where this short squeeze is coming from. Schwab shows institutions own 104% of gme shares. What the hell does that mean?"
2021-05-12 15:27:17,wallstreetbets,"Buying stocks with cash means only buying what you can afford.  Price goes up, you make money.  Price goes down, you lose money.  You cannot end up below $0, so risk is limited.

Buying on margin is buying with borrowed money... but you usually have to have collateral.  For example: I put in $100 and my brokerage (trading platform) gives me access to $100 margin.  I can now buy $200 worth of stock instead of $100.  If the price goes up, I make twice as much... but if the price goes to $0, I now owe $100.

Unless I'm mistaken, that's the general way it works.

As has been pointed out in other comments, this person may have bought with cash rather than on margin, but just seeing it there gave me the heebie jeebies."
2021-05-12 15:28:23,wallstreetbets,I think others commented that having an account listed as margin doesn't mean the whole thing is margin... but just seeing the word there spooked me sufficiently!
2021-05-11 21:07:23,wallstreetbets,"100% margin means that it is not marginable, in other words he bought this in cash...you can’t use securities as collateral for shit that isn’t marginable lol

The most highly upvoted comment in this thread is someone not knowing the difference between buying something in a margin account and buying something on margin, and the comment below that one is someone who doesn’t even understand how margin requirements work. This shit takes like, what? 15-20 minutes of reading to understand?

Y’all are literally retards, and not the good/funny kind. Please stop talking out of your asses."
2021-05-12 01:34:45,wallstreetbets,It’s that happening because the sheer number of shares is high enough to round the stock cost*shares to the nearest dollar?
2021-05-11 22:53:05,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg terminal shows the amount of short interest. Which is well below fifty percent
2021-05-11 20:42:23,wallstreetbets,Especially with that spelling
2021-05-11 22:18:01,wallstreetbets,I don't know why but that just seems like bullshit to me for big players. What if you gain 100k for the year but also have 200k in losses. So you would have to pay massive capital gains on the 100k trade but can only deduct 3k off the major loss lmao
2021-05-11 21:55:26,wallstreetbets,"That 3k offset is against regular income. If you have future capital gains, they can all be offset by a loss carry forward."
2021-05-11 22:04:44,wallstreetbets,They won't let him sell or buy because he's on margin. On margin they can basically do what they want with your account
2021-05-12 05:52:06,wallstreetbets,"Well, Bloomberg terminal shows short interest around 21%. Not sure where this short squeeze is coming from. Schwab shows institutions own 104% of gme shares. What the hell does that mean??"
2021-05-12 15:38:00,wallstreetbets,Got it. Thanks for this explanation.  So being margin-called is when you lose on your trade to the point that a broker sells your assets to force cover their loan?
2021-05-11 20:41:09,wallstreetbets,"LOL you belong here, retard."
2021-05-11 21:14:32,wallstreetbets,"Margin-able securities can increase the available margin in your account, and can be used to purchase GME. You should probably delete your comment and chill the fuck out."
2021-05-12 01:59:35,wallstreetbets,I’m surprised no one else realized this
2021-05-11 22:19:11,wallstreetbets,No I should have explained better the 200k losses would wipe out the 100k profit and the remaining 100k in losses would be limited to 3k
2021-05-12 10:35:22,wallstreetbets,Is this the way to WSB heaven? I'm new.

2021-05-11 22:55:25,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
2021-05-12 00:16:16,wallstreetbets,"I thought this too, but figured these smooth brains know better."
2021-05-11 22:10:04,wallstreetbets,I don't see how this isn't common knowledge
2021-05-12 15:42:19,wallstreetbets,"Exactly - the idea is that the entity on the hook if your bet goes bad is monitoring your ability to pay it back... and if they conclude that you've reach a limit, they will margin call you - at which point you typically have a limited period of time during which to either pay back and get out of debt or raise more capital to cover the debt (if, for example, you're just sure it will come back up).

In the current hubbub with GME, if Citadel gets margin called, they have billions upon billions of assets, but a new rule went into effect (or is on the verge of being put into effect) that means if they are margin called, they have all of 1 hour to find more capital... after which their overseeing entity could step in and just begin liquidating (selling) everything they have in order to buy back shorted GameStop shares.  The computers that do that literally don't care about the price - they are just trying to balance the books.

That's why it can go so big... but in the meantime, buying on margin can be risky with a volatile stock!"
2021-05-11 21:26:32,wallstreetbets,"No, marginable securities can not be used as collateral for GME (a non-marginable security). Non-marginable means you can’t buy it on margin — you CAN’T use other securities as collateral to borrow the cash from your broker. Anybody that has been trading for more than two days knows this. You have to have the cash in your account, the only difference a margin account makes in this instance is that it doesn’t matter whether the cash is settled or not.

The conviction you have while talking completely out of your ass is unsettling. Educate yourself.

2021-05-11 21:58:23,wallstreetbets,Now that’s math!
2021-05-11 20:19:20,wallstreetbets,That actually happened to me I ended up using 60% over my portfolio amount in cash covered puts. I just kept selling puts and taking the premiums because I thought they were good stocks and worst case would be the stocks went down just a little and I'd get him out of discount and I thought the premium had me pretty well covered. But I really didn't mean to go that deep into margin. It's when everything went down 25% it was like I got hit 40%.
2021-05-11 22:27:14,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying
2021-05-11 20:20:35,wallstreetbets,I'm in the NW part of the US (Washington) and 1.5 million will get a decently nice house in the nicer part of the state.
2021-05-11 21:24:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, 1.5 mil isn’t enough for even retirement. Hell, the houses around me are worth that much and I’m not even in a rich area, merely upper middle (northern Virginia). My county’s average household income is over $140k, and making just that would put you in the red lol"
2021-05-11 21:55:57,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's true. 100M isn't enough to buy the most amazing house you can think of, the most amazing car you can think of, the most amazing boat you can think of, and still have enough left over to live on and pay for all of that shit you just bought. 1000M is enough to do that though. A billion dollars is almost unlimited money. I'm not sure how I could spend it unless I bought dozens and dozens of the most expensive properties I can find."
2021-05-11 23:30:45,wallstreetbets,"I went to McDonald’s, said, “bankrupt” after I ordered and they angrily gave me all my food."

2021-05-11 22:16:38,wallstreetbets,Because Robinhood just does it all for you without telling you. Fidelity you have to apply for margin
2021-05-12 16:34:11,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!!  

Now can you explain to me what Calls and Puts are?  Which ones do you purchase to moon?
Please keep in mind that I'm here for a Frosty, but I don't want that until after we're done talking, so it doesn't melt."
2021-05-11 21:27:10,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my broker.
2021-05-11 23:37:56,wallstreetbets,"That’s not exactly fucking off and having fun. That’s deliberately working to own the absolutely most expensive stuff in the world. I’m pretty sure a person with a 1-off Bugatti Noire that cost 20 million isn’t *actually* having more fun than a guy with a measily 3M Bugatti Chiron. 

Obviously a guy with 1000M can buy 10x more stuff than a guy with a 100M. And a guy with 5000M can buy more than the billionaire. But that doesn’t mean they’re having more fun, unless we’re just defining fun by the sheer price tag of their toys."
2021-05-11 22:32:50,wallstreetbets,"Generally you only get about 2x your collateral on overnight positions. 4x for  day trades only.

So if you put in 25k you can buy additional 25k-100k on margin. Not a milly."
2021-05-11 22:54:13,wallstreetbets,Now do school big all on credit cards... graduate bankruptcy and live in cash 7 years until credit and it's all free

2021-05-11 22:20:31,wallstreetbets,Makes sense I just transferred to fidelity today didn't know that. Thought all brokers use margin by default

2021-05-11 21:30:18,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, you’re one of many new traders trading on margin that doesn’t know how it works. Good luck."
2021-05-12 09:11:15,wallstreetbets,"You are talking growth. Not living on an amount. And again as mentionned below any amount could become multigenerational as long as you beat inflation and are expose to risk you'll get there with lots of time. 

4% is an average for living substainabily on an certain amount not growing it to reach that requiered amount. Money today is no money tomorrow so the 1,5M is not substanaible it could be with growth just as a 100K or 1K could with Lots of time"
2021-05-12 08:27:34,wallstreetbets,"Yes with time value of money even 100K if you don't touch it for generations could become a mountain. 

100 000 x 1,085^100 = 349 M$

As long as you beat inflation and you are exposed to risk any amount could become substainable with LOTS of time. But money in 100 years is no money today."

You could have an account with marginable securities and buy gme even if you have a debit cash balance but you still aren’t buying gme on margin, you’re just increasing the amount of margin your other marginable securities are using.

This isn’t meant to be a gotcha, it’s an important distinction, and saying you can buy gme on margin in fidelity is just objectively wrong. Have a good night as well."

To this day there hasn't been an EV launched against Tesla that is competitive in the specs that consumers car about - how far, how fast, how much?

There is a perception that ""real"" automakers can just start building great EVs whenever they want, but reality is showing that Tesla's first-mover advantage isn't just the brand. They have over a decade of experience optimizing their electric drive trains and software and it shows.

There may well be a future where a ""good enough"" EV competes with Tesla the way Android was good enough to take on iOS, but that future appears to still be very far off, and if Tesla ends up being the Apple of the auto industry, investors aren't going to be disappointed."

How can you ignore build quality and comfort? Legacy automakers still seems to be doing better at that at least for the luxury segments.  
  
I'm not going to deny that Tesla still has a lead in efficiency/power, but to say that is all consumers care about is pretty short sighted. If I had to buy a car today I would choose a model 3, but 5 years down the road my feeling is that is not a clear cut decision based on releases from Hyundai and others."
2021-05-11 22:56:19,wallstreetbets,To avg down his trade so he could get out at breakeven instead of holding negative waiting for it to rebound.
2021-05-12 14:02:38,wallstreetbets,"Those aren't the only things consumers care about, but I believe they're the top 3. How badly would a Tesla have to score in comfort & build to lose a potential customer to a slower, more expensive, worse range vehicle? I would argue it would have to be awful. But Teslas are comfortable to sit and ride in, and they're well-built cars. So these factors just aren't going to be deal-breakers for most people.

Safety is also at the top of many people's lists and Teslas are arguably the safest cars in the world. (This is more evidence that the build quality is fine, btw, if they're acing all these crash tests...)

In any case, 5 years is a long time and I don't have a crystal ball, but I personally need to see some kind of paradigm shift from Tesla's competitors before I'll believe that any of them are likely to catch up. They're very far behind and so far Tesla's lead appears to be widening rather than narrowing, which is why I believe TSLA is a great value at today's price."

Largely due to the growth of the gas industry, even though that in 2020, the fall was also due to the coronavirus pandemic.

2021-05-12 07:44:11,wallstreetbets,"I got in yesterday at 5.70, thanks for the DD!"
2021-05-12 09:11:09,wallstreetbets,"Good analysis, though I feel like you're missing some things (also I'm a dumbass, so my analysis is likely wrong too).

The biggest question here is if coal prices will go up, leading to an increase in BTU's price since their profits arise from coal mining. Thankfully, governmental factors are seeming too slow to implement to impact this sector in a manner that would drastically affect BTU's price. So we can ignore that (for now).  

1. Recent 10-K has them extending near-term debt maturities to Dec 2024. Given how the company is continually losing money (negative EPS past 3 years data, overall decreasing stock price), it seems like they are \*really\* banking on coal prices increasing in the coming years. If they don't have a strategy to compensate for these factors, it may be bad news (or in this case, good news) bears for BTU. Not saying they'll go bankrupt again (they might, never know) but the impact will certainly be felt. 
2. Seaborne mining operations are trending down in revenues \[42% 2020\] but up in sales volume \[19%\] according to 10-K (might be reading this wrong), with the opposite case in their domestic mining operations (increasing revenue \[58% 2020\], decreasing sales volume \[81% 2020\]). The way I am seeing this is their Asian purchases have been decreasing. This doesn't help that: 
3. The adjusted EBITDA Margin-Per-Ton for their Seaborne Metallurgical is \*worse\* than it was pre-pandemic (citing most recent 10-Q). Seeing as how a large part of your thesis is banking on coal increasing in price partly due to increases in infrastructure spending, and how a majority of that Seaborne Metallurgical is exported to Asia (which has decreasing revenue despite an increase in sales volume, this is a problem.

All this to say it still looks like a shit stock to me. You are banking on a single macroeconomic event (coal price increase), that needs to happen to a high enough level to make some of their operations profitable so they can pay off debt they just pushed off. Coal has consistently increased from $34/ton in March 20200 $88/ton at time of writing, so either coal needs to increase \*further\* (unforeseen consequences there, since it would be the highest ever in 11 years from the data I'm looking at), or their operations need to get cheaper. I think this is solely just a result of inflation chipping away a good company's revenue with high priced equipment (or equipment partnerships) to the point where the enterprise is no longer viable since the price of coal has a generalized ceiling (like gas) save for a massive spike. I'd buy puts if I wasn't so poor."

polygon.io does a 'trial' where you can sign up and get all the data you want through their API and then cancel after 7 days free of charge"
2021-05-12 16:12:25,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no - my algorithm doesn’t specify strat per se and as such there isn’t much to backtest . What I’ve designed it more so to do is to identify stocks that are off-sides or in threat of being off sides in ways that the outcome is predictable. This increase probability of unhealth behavior from options dealers greed increases the probability of playing to anticipated downside. It isn’t unusual for a stock to quickly become over exposed to options delta hedging for a day or two - and in these brief sparks you can capitalize on and realize some gains.  

So there is statistical significance in my algorithms identification of stocks that have higher risk and future price action. So I’m that regard, yes."
2021-05-12 16:28:55,wallstreetbets,But I presume you have back-tested the outliers spotted by the algorithm vs their price action (against a control sample) over the next few days over a large data set?
2021-05-12 17:24:40,wallstreetbets,Yes! That has been done. If a stock pops its head up on my metric it is likely to move beyond the markets expectation.

2021-05-11 20:21:46,wallstreetbets,"A good rule of thumb to see if shorts are being covered, especially during large price drops, is to look at volatility. If customer sell-off is matched with covering calls then volatility typically decreases. If customer sell off is unmatched with purchasing than volatility typically rises. 
It even gives a good estimate for when a stocks shorts are finished being covered."
2021-05-11 20:28:54,wallstreetbets,Can you elaborate further please…
2021-05-12 04:49:46,wallstreetbets,"Thanks - a dumb question: how do you assess the volatility in a very short term to check whether shorts covered? For example, today, if we focus on pltr, it has been stable at 20 (prob bc ARK and others were buying), rather than fighting around 17-20. Would you say this is a sign of low volatility for intra day signals?"

2021-05-12 08:21:54,wallstreetbets,90% of retail investors lose money because they're dumb enough to buy stocks like AMC here at $10.  Or Tesla for $700.  Or Zoom Video or Coinbase for $400.  And so on.  When they end up losing making these obviously retarded bets - while calling themselves retarded for doing it - a vocal minority of them go on to blame anyone but themselves.
2021-05-11 23:20:21,wallstreetbets,Realistically what could it get to? I mean there is literally 10 times as many shares as GameStop so I seem like it would be much harder to repeat what happen with gme?
2021-05-12 10:55:04,wallstreetbets,"Well I’m sorry we couldn’t buy companies pre ipo or go back in time when Tesla was $10 or when amc was 5… also, ironic how u mention Tesla and amc considering they both where shorted to hell. Btw idk why wsb do that whole retard thing, I wasn’t there before gme and it ain’t a great thing and I do think it would be wise to stop but I don’t give two shits about wsb. 

Also, when these companies get to such high valuations what are supposed to do not buy? I mean Tesla did hit 800 and when u have people like cathy saying they’re a 3000$ company how can u say retail is dumb? U got companies with some of the smartest people analyzing stocks and putting crazy valuations on them and u think retail is dumb? Get outta here with that shit. It’s all a scam and u are just as brainwashed as people buying amc at 10$"

I think people are dying to get out of the house and go to movies. I doubt they are going I to bankruptcy any time soon."
2021-05-12 12:22:53,wallstreetbets,They have no more shares to issue. Once this issuance is done that's it. They tried to get the shareholders to approve 500 mil more but had to pull the proposal (probably because it wouldn't get approved). Thing is we don't know how long it's gonna be before movie theaters will operate at full capacity and full occupancy again. All depends on vaccinesnand possible new variants. If any of that goes against them they are gonna be screwed.
2021-05-12 19:28:51,wallstreetbets,"They will get approval from the shareholders in due time. They postponed the vote until next year, I believe.

2021-05-11 21:32:57,wallstreetbets,"> 3.7b debt, so their debt is equaivalent to the market cap of the stock

What??? Do you literally just not know anything? AMC is a 4.3b market cap stock....

Your numbers are just wrong. Seriously where are you getting this info?

> Gme is only 27 percent shorted of the float, and the float is only 60 percent of the float.

ok, that is currently and GME isn't squuezing.... so....? And I’m assuming this part means the free float is 60% of the overall float? You just said float 3 time and didn’t say free float anywhere.

But then there’s this:

> So amc is 220 percent more shorted than gme

So you’re comparing the short-to-total float ratio for GME with the incorrect short-to-free float ratio you have for AMC here. That’s how you got 220%, right?

If AMC did have 37% of free float, and GME had 27%, that’s not even a 150% higher, let alone 220%.

Where are you getting 37% short interest for AMC? The tweet literally says 23.75 lol. And 

If you believe in the stock that’s fine, but why are you just lying about the numbers? I don’t get it. Did you find some random 3rd party source that had numbers you liked more or something?

And where is the 100x??? What is 100x’ing? None of your numbers make any sense"
2021-05-11 20:27:19,wallstreetbets,"> amc is short 37% of float

Are you just completely ignoring the tweet? It literally says 23.75% of free float. Where are you getting this information?

> also what is this about a stock needing to be shorted 80% to squeeze

Uh... kinda does lol.

The BTX thing is a biopharma company. A different biopharma company pumps every day. They’re not shorted super hard ever, they’re always pump and dumps."

2021-05-12 04:50:23,wallstreetbets,"The Texas storm proved the need for micro grids, not sure what your point about solar is. Solar panels actually work better in the cold. 

Actively tries to kill you? Ok calm down drama pants."
2021-05-12 09:48:32,wallstreetbets,"1) $BE is microgrids.  $TSLA is storage.

2) as Texas proved, solar panels don't work when covered in snow

3) do you own a Tesla with FSD? No? Then you don't know how dangerous that feature is"
2021-05-12 09:59:09,wallstreetbets,"Everyone already knew solar wasn’t great in stormy weather.  That is baked in to grid design even in Texas.

What wasn’t baked in was natural gas power plants freezing up right when they were supposed to be the ones covering for the cloudy weather."
2021-05-12 10:02:46,wallstreetbets,"I don’t know why I’m even arguing when I don’t own Tesla stock, but:

1. Microgrids don’t work without sector coupling or energy storage. That’s the whole idea of microgrids. The Texas storm broke down for so long because a centralized energy provider had multiple sectors and generators blow up. That’s what a microgrid should avoid, so you should have energy storage or energy conversion in your household to prevent that (a diesel generator, Tesla battery whatever). 

2. Yes true. But which one is easier for a family, fixing grid connections and generators or scraping snow off a solar panel? Or to prevent the problem altogether, go buy a household diesel generator. 

3. I think you have a different definition for actively. Might as well say the sun is actively trying to kill you, and nitrogen in the air is actively killing you."

2021-05-12 11:24:35,wallstreetbets,Maybe don’t pretend to have accolades like this when you posted your resume one year ago saying you were soon to be graduating with a BS in Mechanical Engineering and needed help with your resume.
2021-05-12 10:19:35,wallstreetbets,"I suggest getting a refund.

Oh, free piece of advice? When you lead with the walls of academia instead of actual accomplishments, you've lost.  Matter of fact, when a candidate leads with their education or that's the first well they go to, they're automatically removed as a candidate, and that's becoming a growing trend.  It's a policy I implemented 4 years ago.

But what do I know about anything, right?

Perhaps you can use that to teach Texas how to brush off the panels when the roads are inaccessible."
2021-05-12 10:22:52,wallstreetbets,"I have a degree in economics but work in construction... degrees aren’t some be all end all. It’s a little piece of paper that says you have a few wrinkles and can actually be trusted to do a job and use a bit of critical thinking skill.

For what it’s worth, I started as a field laborer and now I’ve worked with coworkers with masters in construction project management, PM certifications, etc. and they tend to make the biggest fucking mistakes on site that I’ve ever had the misfortune of being called to correct. I trust the opinion of my field guys over that of management - every single time."
2021-05-12 10:43:08,wallstreetbets,"Just saying, I have my MBA and have learned a lot more outside of the classroom, specifically about stocks and finances, than I had ever learned in the classroom. Not saying you don’t know your stuff, but degrees prove you can regurgitate what your professors tell you to.  Not that you have a full grasp of your industry."
2021-05-12 14:33:59,wallstreetbets,"as someone who lived thru the Texas snowmageddon, I would also point out that most solar panels are on roofs  - which makes it impractical for most people to scrape off. And the storm and snow persisted for many days - so any  storage battery would have quickly run out of juice.

I often think there is a significant  market for   BE technology based household generators running on natural gas without CO emissions and quiet so it can be kept in the garage (outside generators were being stolen during the storm)."

2021-05-12 03:31:54,wallstreetbets,"I have been bullish on Pipeline operators since January. The White House decision to halt the keystone pipeline was a non event that most of the Medias reported as the end of the oil industry.

personally, the declaration of Kerry ""let them build solar panels"" reminded me of the attributed quote to Marie Antoinette, Queen of France, ""Let them eat cake""

We should not forget that 7 out of the 50 dem senators are actually coming from Oil & gas states. Dems cannot afford to lose majority and to affect the economies of these states. Dems in the House performed already badly in the last elections, they spent millions in House seats campaign without winning a seat. Evidently the keystone stop was the only thing biden could do to please the Green part of the Dems

Biden 2020 kind of reminds Obama 2008. Obama in 2008 could not push extensively for green policies because Congress support was thin (and he had 60 senators at the time!). today consensus on green policies is stronger, but dem majority is weaker

Lastly, we should not forget that most of the developing world relies on biomass and coal for energy generation, that will be substituted by propane (natural gas liquids) and eventually natural gas too

2021-05-12 05:02:44,wallstreetbets,The broker is supposed to cover any trades the hedge funds can't so even if the hedge funds declare bankruptcy the brokers will have to pay the rest unless the broker does some bs and deletes trades and say they never happened. If the broker goes under another broker can buy their assets and if no one buys their assets then the DTCC will have to pay for it. But i expect it won't come to the DTCC because i believe they will somehow limit how high the squeeze will go to avoid that. They won't block the squeeze though because international investors have a big stake in this too and they will get mad and pull out of USA market if they believe our stock market is untrustworthy.
2021-05-12 09:11:02,wallstreetbets,"The broker is the one who owns the shares the trader borrowed from guy, short traders do not borrow stock from you. There is no 3rd party the broker needs to give the stock back too, its THEIR stock. If the short trader or hedgefund can't return its brokers stock their broker settles in cash with them. And the short trader typically declares bankruptcy to settle the total cash amount down lower."
2021-05-12 13:03:00,wallstreetbets,"I just asked my broker what happens if a hedge fund who shorts a stock goes bankrupt and their losses exceed their worth. They said they will get a margin call before they go bankrupt and they will sell them out and if they end up in the negative the broker uses their own funds to pay the sellers of the shares and then they send that account to a collections agency to try and get back the funds they spent covering them. From what i can find online when you short a stock you borrow the share from the broker but you don't know where they get it from. They can take it from another trader who has a margin account, use their own inventory, or they will get it from another broker. If i remember correctly there was an option on Webull and possibly other brokers to opt out of share lending so your shares can't be used to short. The broker does the borrowing so they are the ones liable even if the person who they borrowed for is no longer around."
2021-05-12 13:07:04,wallstreetbets,"So you see how with that answer that even shorting more than 100% of the float will never lead to perpetual money and a permenantly exploding stock price. It will drive it up sure, from 3 bucks to like $450.

But the idea that ""more shares than exist have been borrowed"" is false, and the idea that those shares ""have"" to be returned is also false. Bankruptcy settles in cash, not stock."
2021-05-12 14:30:48,wallstreetbets,"Naked shorting is real and illegal but the SEC is corrupt and usually doesn't enforce it. I asked my broker again about that stocks that are shorted over 100%. He said if it's shorted 120% then 120% will have to be covered and how that happens is that a share is only supposed to be borrowed once. The broker borrows the share from whoever has the share and gives it to the shorter. But then another broker or the hedge fund lends the share from the 1st shorter to a 2nd shorter. If they are forced to cover then the second shorter has to sell and pay the 1st shorter then they have to sell and return it to the original owner. So the price won't infinitely squeeze but will keep rising. But for the price it will go to that depends on when the squeeze starts. According to the DTCC they never margin called any of the hedge funds when GME was running up to $500 so that wasn't the big squeeze. 

As for bankruptcy being settled in cash they have to get margin called before they declare for bankruptcy. They will have to sell their stocks and start covering before they can say we are out of business. When Lehman Brothers went bankrupt the DTCC said they closed out 500 billion in trading contracts that needed to be done before the bankruptcy could be complete."
2021-05-12 14:33:07,wallstreetbets,"Naked shorting is real, i am not saying it isnt. But it will never bind someone to buying 1000 shares of a 900,000 dollar a share stock. At best you will bankrupt the player and get a settlement value worth less than what the stock 'would of been worth'"
2021-05-12 15:59:05,wallstreetbets,"If they get margin called and have to start covering they will be forced to payback in X amount of time. So they will start buying shares at whatever the market price is until they can no longer afford to do so and go bankrupt. As for settling the remaining trades i believe once the transaction was started the broker is required to finish it so they would have cover the trades at the current price unless it was their own share.

For example if the broker borrowed the share from another broker or another trader and now it's time to return it. The shares on the market are worth 1000, they can't be like the guy i gave it to went broke and could only afford 100 so here is a share worth 100. They are liable for the remaining 900 since they were in charge of the transaction. If it was their own share that they lent then i could see them settling since they don't owe anyone else and can't find someone else who is liable to cover the costs. 

I don't think this will go as high as people think but it should go past VW squeeze because that squeeze happened unexpectedly when Porsche bought up a bunch of shares and triggered the squeeze. GME and AMC have a lot of people watching them waiting for a squeeze so i believe once it starts bigger investors will join in at the start and drive the price up higher."
2021-05-12 16:01:35,wallstreetbets,So do you see where the bankruptcy part puts a ceiling on just how high a short squeeze can send stocks?
2021-05-12 16:22:28,wallstreetbets,Yes but how much it affects the ceiling depends on how many of the shorted shares that belong to the brokers are still not covered when the hedge fund goes under. If most of them have been covered first and they leave behind mostly trades with other brokers or traders then the price should continue to rise up as that broker has to cover. The real limit i believe will be the people who sell too much too early. Opposing hedge funds could sell a big chunk early for profit and stop or slow the price raise and then retail traders might think this is the peak and start selling off and cause a domino effect.
2021-05-12 08:27:01,wallstreetbets,"The game Cyberpunk itself was an epic fail, we are on the same page there. And this is definitely on the management.

Would you give me the source for the employees leaving? From what I've come across two people leaving was in the news. One was a guy balancing quests, items etc and one was a toxic lead director. So not really what I would call crucial to the Witcher success.

The CD Project allocated money for the lawsuits. And until there is an outcome, it doesn't make sense to speculate over it."
2021-05-12 08:27:56,wallstreetbets,Guess you played on a computer?\^\^
2021-05-12 08:31:12,wallstreetbets,How was CD Project so successful when they didn't monetize the fuck outta Witcher?
2021-05-12 08:29:47,wallstreetbets,Did you have some success there? :)
2021-05-12 08:12:44,wallstreetbets,"They were underpaid because they were in Poland. Just adding that the cost of living is also a lot lower there.

And of course, if you participated in the Witcher your resumee is awesome.

Some employees leave of course, that is part of general business. I haven't heard of a mass movement of devs.

Why they should stick around? CD Project is by far the biggest publisher in Poland. The company itself is safe, financials again. If they leave for better pay, they also leave their family. Not a thing for everyone.

I don't think the change in staff is impairing the company."
2021-05-12 10:43:29,wallstreetbets,Yup haha
2021-05-12 08:34:32,wallstreetbets,That's the thing. Even with how badly they fucked it up it is still financially a success.

2021-05-12 13:59:55,wallstreetbets,"biotech stocks are by far the hardest to hit the jackpot on. just because it sounds good and looks promising doesn’t mean it’ll work.

and just because you’re a doctor who previously ran clinical trials doesn’t mean you’re good at picking biotech stocks. a biochemist is a hundred times more reputable than you and i wouldn’t just take their word for it. should’ve been pretty fucking obvious if you’re a doctor."
2021-05-12 03:53:29,wallstreetbets,I think the idea is to over-express these antigens by forcing muscle/injected tissues to produce them and force autoimmunity against cancer cells by simultaneously using a systemic PD-1 inhibitor. OP read too much into the brain scans since radiation which was also given to the patients will also produce nice results at that image resolution. The key caveat imo is that this would require specific typing of GBM just like how breast cancer is genotyped now as such this is a slightly different pt sample than past studies and im not well read enough on GBM to speak to how common these 3 antigens are for GBM or the severity of disease that correlate with those markers. As far as money goes ino isnt a cheap pharma stock that's in trials rdy to take off. It looks like there's already some decent speculation happening with it.

2021-05-12 10:06:58,wallstreetbets,"You won't be able to cover all road infrastructure with 5G.   I mean 5G towers only reach about 1,000' at the moment.  The state I live in the majority of customers don't even have true 4G lte.  It covers the majority of our population, but only about 8% of our state.  Its just concentrated in the cities.

You also won't need crazy speeds for vehicles to communicate with one another either!  This is a huge misconception!  You'll just need a solid connection.  Starlink will fill this gap pretty good!"
2021-05-12 12:14:56,wallstreetbets,"Starlink? What about when people don't drive under the sky? I feel like it would be a long while until you can get consistent connection with that. What happens if one of the satellites gets hit with a piece of junk? That explodes causing a domino effect, taking down the whole system. Plus you need a satellite dish with that. Also you really do have to have fast speeds for vehicles to communicate with each other to not cause accidents. Plus even the entire Iot needs to be connected to, not just vehicles.

Verizon going heavy into 5g is a gamble, but I think there is a lot more upside to 5g then people think. Laptops could begin running off 5g as well. 5g could replace wifi potentially. Smart glasses, watches, etc. These all could become huge source of demand for 5g. Not in close near term, probably a lot sooner then Starlink my opinion."

2021-05-12 05:24:10,wallstreetbets,">the ceo of blackberry is a moron and not doing anything about manipulation

Who are you looking for? John McAfee?

The companies that John Chen is angling for behind the scenes (you and I are not privy) are not looking for a meme lord with a coke habit, they are looking for a company with strong, dependable products & the reserved, polite unassuming personality of the CEO is a definite plus when selling security. 

He has an unrivalled contact book for China which is a second big plus seen in the amount of Chinese auto signing up. Solarwinds/Darkside etc underscores how important it is to be secure above all else, hence Ford still use QNX as the underlying OS for their new auto lines & run Android as an infotainment layer in a hypervisor guest.

BlackBerry are on the job of both sales & marketing, be assured. Maybe one bad quarter left, two at most. Pull off Colonial Pipeline and c-ya!
