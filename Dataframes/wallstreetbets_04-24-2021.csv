2021-04-24 17:45:46,wallstreetbets,"Those sold 100Cs 😂

Well played on NIO"
2021-04-24 19:16:32,wallstreetbets,Thanks guys!! Started entire position with 20k back in dec 2019. Was selling calls during 2020. From collected proceeds exercised 110 $7 calls. Now waiting to exercise remaining 72calls by the end of the year.

2021-04-24 17:51:29,wallstreetbets,1/23 $50 C. Thoughts?
2021-04-24 19:19:42,wallstreetbets,Can I piggy back off you?   Congrats
2021-04-24 18:05:56,wallstreetbets,Whoa.
2021-04-24 18:54:40,wallstreetbets,Jesus too rich for me to look at
2021-04-24 18:08:12,wallstreetbets,Free money
2021-04-24 15:14:45,wallstreetbets,Let's go MVIs!!! Also still holding GME waiting for my tendies...and Cramer can hold my testies
2021-04-24 15:17:02,wallstreetbets,"Woo! Bring out the foam, it’s a party! 🥂"
2021-04-24 15:22:18,wallstreetbets,Let’s do this
2021-04-24 18:34:01,wallstreetbets,I'll see y'all in vegas
2021-04-24 15:17:37,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, he loves the smell of my seat"
2021-04-24 16:17:21,wallstreetbets,Daddy went out for cigarettes yesterday but actually came back this time
2021-04-24 15:37:29,wallstreetbets,Impeccable sir. Been following since the Clne DD. Let's get this bread 🍞🍞🍞
2021-04-24 16:56:03,wallstreetbets,"I was lucky to grab 1,000 shares of CLNE @ $10.07 during the ""flash crash"" last Thursday.

That ""mom"" from the Cefaly Dual commercial is ..."
2021-04-24 17:19:43,wallstreetbets,Best DD on this sub. Shame it won't get to the very top like it deserves.
2021-04-24 17:15:49,wallstreetbets,"So there *are* people here who know what they're doing. I heard rumours, didn't think it was true."
2021-04-24 17:13:24,wallstreetbets,How do I turn on alerts for your DDs?!
2021-04-24 19:22:43,wallstreetbets,Finally got out of my abusive SNDL relationship thanks to your DD. Thanks u/nrdrage
2021-04-24 17:19:07,wallstreetbets,"Just wanted to say Thank You Nrd. Your Cruise Ship DD pulled me out of a hole I got myself in thanks to a couple penny stock plays, bad option plays & just plain dumb shit. I held back from CLNE but it ended up taking a nose dive, so come Monday I’m going to buy in at what still looks like a good entry point. At the very least you deserve a shrine sir 💪🏾🙏🏾🙌🏾"
2021-04-24 16:32:04,wallstreetbets,I upvoted this just for the second sentence in the post title. These zoomers don’t know real harmony if it smacked them in their auto tuned mumble rap loving faces
2021-04-24 19:11:50,wallstreetbets,"""If you read between the lines"". You don't know your audience my friend."
2021-04-24 15:19:09,wallstreetbets,"Awesome. I'd be very interested in your thoughts on the current market, and how you see the next couple of months playing out. SPY rallied up on next to no volume the last two weeks, with the only big volume days big selling days. Feels like the big boys are leaving the market, but keen to hear what you think."
2021-04-24 16:28:23,wallstreetbets,A literary masterpiece that deserves to be on the NYT bestseller list.
2021-04-24 17:08:51,wallstreetbets,"Glad I'm not alone on $CLNE. I got in at $13.30, everything seemed like it should be solid but it shit the bed instead. Was really considering doubling down as it's so cheap, there's no serious competition for them and contracts are lining up but was worried I'd missed something.

Market activity for the last year has been irrational, trying to ignore these fluctuations and focus on the DD but it really helps to have other people see what I see."
2021-04-24 15:52:22,wallstreetbets,Great work man. Really appreciate the follow-up.
2021-04-24 15:12:34,wallstreetbets,Are these posts being deleted automatically?
2021-04-24 19:27:50,wallstreetbets,"I am really hoping the CLNE play pays out. It's very reassuring that you're still super confident in the trade. Though, I started seeing some reports on class action lawsuits on it, any thoughts about those?  As you've said before, there's a lot of institutional investment, the FUD's just getting to me. I've averaged down to 86 cents per June $13 calls. But I'm still down a bit overall on the trade because I held some June $11 calls through Manipulation Monday."
2021-04-24 16:10:20,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck do you have time to do all this. I barely have time to read it all, but I’m also retarded. Glad I did"
2021-04-24 15:33:12,wallstreetbets,"Very thorough sir.  Little ape 🐵 here, giving you what little award I have 🏆"
2021-04-24 16:34:31,wallstreetbets,I gotta go get my free reward for you simply based on the Mortimer Bros. $1 bet
2021-04-24 16:23:08,wallstreetbets,Of course the only one I bought in was RYCEY wahh
2021-04-24 17:39:45,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD & Update! Rarely seen and mucho appreciated 🖍
2021-04-24 18:06:39,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the awesome DD!
2021-04-24 18:37:55,wallstreetbets,RYCEYYYYYY I'm glad that one got a mention
2021-04-24 16:27:39,wallstreetbets,"For $NVTA, do you still plan to exit before their upcoming earnings and reenter? Or if it stays as beat up as it currently is would you hold and expect earnings to only be able to be a positive catalyst at these prices?"
2021-04-24 18:13:30,wallstreetbets,Best DD on the sub! I might be too retarded to understand it but my wife’s boyfriend loves it!
2021-04-24 16:59:42,wallstreetbets,"I had bought 100 of CLNE on your suggestion at $12.  Though I didnt sell on the spike, I did sell a May covered call for $129.  Thanks!  Will just keep selling a covered call till I get called out.
- Little Ape 🐵"
2021-04-24 16:08:25,wallstreetbets,"Ok I’ve been following your posts for a while great reads lots of info. One question, I don’t do options but the NEE play April 9 started high 77’s topped out about 80 that paid good? Like you can make good money off a $3 rise in a $80 stock? I played the shares made a little money but the way I read it sounds as if it paid off big?"
2021-04-24 16:50:10,wallstreetbets,"Keep up the great work, Nrd. Much obliged! 👊🏽"
2021-04-24 17:06:39,wallstreetbets,How do people determine what the exact value of a stock will be?
2021-04-24 17:07:52,wallstreetbets,There you go 🤪🤪🤪
2021-04-24 18:31:23,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the advice for us retards. Will ignore everything and report back with my loss porn.
2021-04-24 16:42:21,wallstreetbets,"Why are these posts being deleted by mods when they don't even mention the taboo ""GME""?"
2021-04-24 19:10:17,wallstreetbets,Agreed. But I do like this hidden gem.
2021-04-24 19:11:04,wallstreetbets,I use free app called “alerts for Reddit” and it works well.
2021-04-24 19:16:31,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-24 17:14:45,wallstreetbets,"When it fell below 10, I was buying as much as I could find.  My current position is over a million shares just because I couldn't believe how on sale it was."
2021-04-24 17:11:45,wallstreetbets,"Go read my Wednesday post on the OG's sub.  It explains everything that's happened to it lately - and has the receipts to prove it.  Fucking infuriating, but at least it looks like most of that money has moved on to go artificially fuck with something else."
2021-04-24 16:11:52,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the automod has gotten pretty aggressive. I remember a few weeks ago one got deleted for mentioning a political nickname given to Biden by Trump."
2021-04-24 19:04:34,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I got reprimanded just for JOKING about mods deleting. The hall monitors here are no joke. [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxqn2b/nrdrages\_friday\_ddon\_a\_saturday\_market\_is\_as/gvqxbm9?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mxqn2b/nrdrages_friday_ddon_a_saturday_market_is_as/gvqxbm9?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)"
2021-04-24 16:38:39,wallstreetbets,Being a literal billionaire probably helps.
2021-04-24 17:12:39,wallstreetbets,"I only ever hold to expiration if:  


A)  I need to hold that long to try and break even or

B)  There's no way I'll be able to unload my position  in the amount of time I have left after reaching my exit point, so I understand I'll be exercising a thousand options of something."
2021-04-24 16:24:19,wallstreetbets,"If you bought the 5/21 80c around the DD, it was $1.50. It dropped as low as $1.00 and it maxed out at $2.75 last friday. So was a 2 bagger in under 2 weeks."
2021-04-24 16:18:29,wallstreetbets,"As the purchasing accelerated, the volatility went up.  Volatility goes up, premium goes up.  So that little 5% (it was more like 6.2, but whatever) move resulted in a significant adjustment in option premium value.  Purchasing decelerated, volatility went down, premiums went down."
2021-04-24 16:15:20,wallstreetbets,Curious. Why don't you try playing options? They're risky but if you're following a DD it shouldn't matter as much.
2021-04-24 17:44:19,wallstreetbets,Mods aren't deleting it. I literally manually approved it. Kindly stfu with the baseless accusations.
2021-04-24 19:34:26,wallstreetbets,to have such powder...cheers
2021-04-24 16:45:02,wallstreetbets,Xi-Den?
2021-04-24 19:57:41,wallstreetbets,"That's because there are about a thousand other comments just like yours constantly being posted, but completely sincerely. You gotta layer on the sarcasm a bit more or something, expectations for the intelligence of the average WSB user is waaaay down."
2021-04-24 19:17:37,wallstreetbets,"I always thought the opposite. People who have Chad’s kind of money are usually busy making more money. His time is incredibly valuable, and yet he seems to spend a couple of hours a week humoring us with his insight. I’m not complaining, obviously, but what he does for this sub should be considered a humanitarian effort."
2021-04-24 17:42:20,wallstreetbets,"Right I didn't mean holding all the way to expiration, just through earnings specifically since it's coming up pretty soon."
2021-04-24 16:29:42,wallstreetbets,Ah thank you.
2021-04-24 17:51:05,wallstreetbets,"Does that mean you timed the selling by looking at the IV?

(I only sold $NEE because I wanted to free the money for $CLNE calls on the day it dropped to 9.XX. I guess fortune favors fools, but obviously I don't want to rely on that forever.)

Thx for the great DD's by the way! Learning a lot from them."
2021-04-24 16:18:04,wallstreetbets,Haven’t really put in the time to understand them. Read a few articles but seems like a very easy way to lose money if you don’t understand them completely. Which I don’t.
2021-04-24 18:27:37,wallstreetbets,"You have no sense of humor. Did you not notice my comment was a play on someone else's comment or that I was being sarcastic? (Unless you think I actually believe comments are auto-deleted for merely mentioning ""GME""). Try not to take this forum QUITE so seriously. It scares off the funny autists and makes the rest of us lose interest."
2021-04-24 18:52:25,wallstreetbets,"Since we are covering baseless accusations, someone just called me a ""true autist retard and an ape"". My actual diagnosis is ""severe mental handicap due to Microcephaly"". So, just because I act retarded and look like a monkey does not mean I am an autist OR an ape. Where can I make a report of the baseless accusation/microagression? It made me cry."
2021-04-24 16:47:05,wallstreetbets,No. The name of the narcoleptic dwarf in Sleeping Beauty.
2021-04-24 16:52:14,wallstreetbets,Keep watching us lose money. I love to practice.
2021-04-24 16:29:13,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough. Paper trading will be a nice way to see how much you would have made with calls. I used ThinkOrSwim when I paper traded a few years ago.

That's what I did until I built up enough confidence to begin trading anyway."
2021-04-24 18:18:02,wallstreetbets,Paper trading helped me learn the most about options and how to play them smarter

2021-04-24 18:57:54,wallstreetbets,Everyday I learn just how much I DON’T know about stocks here. Thanks guys
2021-04-24 15:08:10,wallstreetbets,You should’ve included the snippet from the usatoday article mentioning FDA approves all vaccines over a 50% rate from fighting the disease and preventing severe sides... looking good for OCGN 🔥🔥
2021-04-24 17:28:46,wallstreetbets,"The big market and urgency right now has to do with India and other heavily impoverished nations, they have no vaccine and are gettin hit really hard rn by COVID. Worthy investment"
2021-04-24 17:08:58,wallstreetbets,"As someone who got 80 OCGN @11.80 a few minutes before it tanked, hopefully it rockets this week. It reached 11.06 in the AH."
2021-04-24 17:52:40,wallstreetbets,"Got in at $6.40, rode that bad boy up to $13 then took my money while it was still there. I’m hoping it dips back to about $9 cause I’m going back in for another run 😎"
2021-04-24 18:29:03,wallstreetbets,Sheeeeeaaaat. I made so much money from this stock and now it hit Wallstreet bets and is about to get effed. Got in at $6 and sold it at $18 within a few days. Got back in at $5ish and sold it again at $10ish.
2021-04-24 15:52:20,wallstreetbets,yee sold 5/2 covered calls at $7.50 like a fking dum dum
2021-04-24 15:26:02,wallstreetbets,They are planning to sell 100m doses in usa this year. So that brings revenue around 2 billion dollars
2021-04-24 19:28:00,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget the fact this Vaccine also protects from the mutated variations
2021-04-24 16:08:45,wallstreetbets,"USA is currently drowning in vaccines and fear that a lot of these vaccines will go to waste, due to the fact that millions of Americans do not want to get vaccinated. I would be cautious with their projected sales."
2021-04-24 17:48:27,wallstreetbets,Don’t forget that this stock is primed for a short squeeze. This stock could rise quickly Monday afternoon if everyone holds and sets limits high... could be epic ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|dizzy_face)
2021-04-24 15:35:19,wallstreetbets,is it too late to jump on this?

2021-04-24 18:26:05,wallstreetbets,"There is no way covaxin receives approval in the US without a complete US trial. Just ask Novavax, they have incredible phase 3 results and a US trial and still no EUA. Looks like covaxin is doing a great job stopping covid in India...."
2021-04-24 18:31:38,wallstreetbets,Everyone who wanted the vaccine has already got the vaccine. The rest don't even want it
2021-04-24 19:14:24,wallstreetbets,"I like OCGN and was holding for a while, but why does US need a covid vaccine at the end of 2021 from OCGN? They won't they have 5 domestic pharma's that fill their needs. Their main market is india at this point."
2021-04-24 17:25:47,wallstreetbets,"The USA wants to use American vaccines. As usual home grown patriotic bs but I don’t think this will pass FDA without further tests.
Dong forget other companies too will be adapting their existing vaccines.
I’m still holding long term but the more DD I’ve done the less convinced I’ve been."
2021-04-24 16:13:46,wallstreetbets,You can get the vaccine for free + a bag of weed in DC... puts.
2021-04-24 19:23:48,wallstreetbets,"But they arnt though, both vaccines equate the same percentage J&J does with 1"
2021-04-24 17:28:10,wallstreetbets,Isn’t the utilization rate @ 100%? This is good unless people start selling
2021-04-24 15:12:34,wallstreetbets,And healthcare institutions just placed a 100 million dollar bet on the shares being worth more than $10
2021-04-24 17:42:43,wallstreetbets,"Lol bro, you’re fine, I’ve got shares at $17"
2021-04-24 19:06:06,wallstreetbets,"Don’t feel bad, I went in on $20 calls when it was at $13 on Friday. 30 mins later it went to $11, an hour after than the offering happened. Lost 2k in two hours. Still holding though."
2021-04-24 19:23:29,wallstreetbets,Bought at 6 rode to 13 back in at 9.40
2021-04-24 19:30:45,wallstreetbets,Same
2021-04-24 16:39:14,wallstreetbets,A wrinkle has been smoothed. There will be a next time.
2021-04-24 18:50:57,wallstreetbets,Buy $5 calls and convert it to a spread.
2021-04-24 16:37:06,wallstreetbets,What the USA really needs is a medicine to cure active infections. The company to produce a very efficient widely distributable effective treatment for it will be loaded
2021-04-24 15:44:51,wallstreetbets,"Been following OCGN for six months. After the share offering yesterday it tanked hard. It ended AH at 11. Maybe see what happens Monday morning. If it dips down to 9 again, it could be a good buy. Even at 11, I don’t think it is too late since the catalysts of EUA and FDA approval look good. But it is a bet on where those get approved. If EUA needs US based trials I am sure it will go down. Go with your gut"
2021-04-24 15:45:22,wallstreetbets,Not if they get FDA approval
2021-04-24 17:29:53,wallstreetbets,Bullish price target at near its ATH of $15
2021-04-24 15:38:11,wallstreetbets,I need to know this as well.
2021-04-24 16:00:17,wallstreetbets,You could always buy like a 7.50 call and just exercise it for those shares at 7.50 to lower your average. Premiums be a bitch right now tho lol. I mean good for me since I have 7.5s all the way up until next January lol
2021-04-24 15:46:07,wallstreetbets,"In my view, no. I have calls that expire in ~~June~~ May that I will exercise after the submission run. Then I will purchase more for October. 

At the moment, Bharat, after agreement with India, can manufacture 700m doses a year (as in that's their capacity). However, the US won't allow exports of the raw materials necessary. So it looks like they need a US based partner to manufacture the doses initially. 

On top of that, they've at least intimated by they want to expand the deal to all or NA. My guess is this thing has a lot of run in it over the next 6 months."
2021-04-24 15:58:35,wallstreetbets,No we expect to see 30+ easy
2021-04-24 16:55:26,wallstreetbets,India is prohibiting vaccine exportation.  They have one billion sick people there.
2021-04-24 19:35:09,wallstreetbets,Sounds like they might try anyway but I agree it's a risk. As far as India goes they've only administered [130 million doses](https://covid19.who.int/region/searo/country/in) out of 1.3 billion people so the spike really has nothing to do with vaccines. I do think though it will be nearly impossible for bharat to export doses to the US if they get EUA. I haven't been able to find any evidence they are close to a deal with a manufacturer in the US so definitely some short term headwinds.
2021-04-24 16:37:37,wallstreetbets,Someone still has to pay for it the companies dont make it for free you lemon
2021-04-24 16:30:52,wallstreetbets,"This has to be a joke post, there’s no way you just said that and aren’t joking"
2021-04-24 17:43:39,wallstreetbets,Nothing is free...someone always has to pay

2021-04-24 15:13:57,wallstreetbets,And then there’s that 😈
2021-04-24 17:43:56,wallstreetbets,you bought on Feb 8th?
2021-04-24 19:46:28,wallstreetbets,You lucky summa bitch 💪🏾💪🏾 Happy Gains to ya
2021-04-24 19:45:56,wallstreetbets,"First stop was the moon...next stop

Jupiter"
2021-04-24 18:16:05,wallstreetbets,Yeah. The US hates preventive medicine. But are all about fixing well after the fact. Probably has something to do with decades of privatized healthcare making making going to the doctor financially ineffective.
2021-04-24 17:19:59,wallstreetbets,Hoping this doesn’t just skyrocket in PM like it did in early Feb after that offering.
2021-04-24 15:50:52,wallstreetbets,I would kill for this to drop down to sub 9
2021-04-24 16:01:16,wallstreetbets,Glad to see more people planning to exercise their calls. That will help push the price up also. I plan on exercising half of my 40 contracts at least
2021-04-24 17:44:55,wallstreetbets,Sounds about the right timeframe
2021-04-24 18:09:27,wallstreetbets,Shorts will fight to drop it on open. I got out before the dip yesterday and will buy in the morning if it dips
2021-04-24 16:24:47,wallstreetbets,I would kill for $9.
2021-04-24 18:30:33,wallstreetbets,Same stop loss triggered for a nice 20%
2021-04-24 18:41:18,wallstreetbets,You got two hands. You know what to do
2021-04-24 18:45:04,wallstreetbets,Jerk off two dicks at once?
2021-04-24 14:43:04,wallstreetbets,Been holding a few shares in $NCLH & $CCL for about a month now & the gettings been good. I’m just waiting for the CDC clearance then it’s to the moon we sail 💪🏾💪🏾
2021-04-24 14:42:11,wallstreetbets,#pray we don't see lockdown ver 2.0
2021-04-24 17:11:37,wallstreetbets,"I've been hanging onto 6000 shares since March 18 2020, clearing 80k profit ATM, will keep holding until end of year."
2021-04-24 14:01:00,wallstreetbets,It’s an after corona play but a good one
2021-04-24 15:20:42,wallstreetbets,"This is bound to go much higher ($30s) this summer to due mass vaccinations, loosening travel restrictions, etc. 

If this drops (below $25) due to another lockdown and vaccine effectiveness, take advantage and buy because this us bound to rebound due to the vaccinations. Ex: Moderna is currently doing trials on a booster shot that is effective against known stronger C19 variants.

2021-04-24 18:45:13,wallstreetbets,"I really enjoy my FUBO app. I use it on my phone And ROKU TV. The best thing about it, you can change your zip code as many times as you want and therefore pretty much watch any sporting event. I’ve been able to watch 90% of games that traditional cable and many streamers won’t allow."
2021-04-24 16:29:32,wallstreetbets,"I love seeing the comments from people who are so uninformed about Fubo saying it’s a terrible company. Fubo doesn’t get enough credit for the market share they’ve been able to obtain the past couple years. You can say they can’t keep up with big names but going from 1 to 5% market share while spending relatively nothing on advertising is very impressive. While every other live streaming service tries to gain the attention from everybody, Fubo will focus on sports fans and will continue to be successful. 

I have the product and it’s fine. I literally have no issues with it and the app genuinely surprised me, the quality on matches was way better than I expected. Anybody that’s had issues always complains about buffering but doesn’t realize that it has nothing to do with Fubo and everything to do with the channel you’re on. Every live streaming service has that same issue. The only bear argument that actually has some merit is the fact that they are losing money right now, but profitability will come as their advertising revenue grows rapidly."

2021-04-24 15:01:50,wallstreetbets,"Listen to this guy.  A few years ago we cut the cord, and I didn't want to lose most of my sports coverage, so Fubo made sense.  It was focused more on sports and was pretty cheap.  Over the past few years they've added more and more (and more) channels, so now it's super bloated, and the price has gone up I think by 60%.  We're paying *almost* what we paid for cable before, but with fewer channels.   We've also had issues with it hanging and giving its own version of a spinning wheel of death.  It's not our internet connection, everything else will be working fine.  Their customer service is also trash.  I wrote about the last price increase (something like 30%) to see if I was reading it correctly.  I didn't hear back, I wrote again, didn't hear back.  I wrote again, didn't hear back.  2 months later they sent me a survey to ask how the rep that handled my case performed. I don't know which one they meant, since none got a reply.  My experience is not unique among users."
2021-04-24 14:07:53,wallstreetbets,Have you tried FuboTV? I tried it a few years ago and didn’t like it. Too much lag and it was not my internet.

2021-04-24 17:38:25,wallstreetbets,I have had zero lag using FuboTV. I use it on my phone..tv and iPad.  I pay for the service only during football season.  I travel a lot for work..so it’s great to have while on the move.  I can go month to month and cut it anytime.
2021-04-24 14:41:51,wallstreetbets,"I tried the their free trial a few months back, it's basically cable on a smaller scale, you're still paying too much for a bunch of crap channels you'll never watch.  It's decent if you are in it for the sports, but it doesn't have a wide appeal"

I know one story that came from his leaks was DB getting yelled at by someone at the fed for having crappy records. Otherwise I am unfamiliar with what he's released - if it's under investigation maybe no one outside the FBI knows.


I'll say he fits the classic whistleblower trope: former drug addict, manic behavior, generally an unreliable narrator. Seems like everyone who works with him know this but are still intrigued by the data he has. 


Given that, I could both of these outcomes being equally plausible:


1) He has information that put him in danger and people had him killed 


2) He went on a manic bender and self destructed



Time will tell, I guess. Anyone know what other stories broke from his leaks?"

2021-04-24 14:41:34,wallstreetbets,No point in stealing a car with the keys in it. Defeats the purpose & takes away from the thrill..
2021-04-24 15:13:01,wallstreetbets,The Trump loan agreements with co signers might be on Ebay next week. Russian oligarchs tend to send messages that can't be misinterpreted.

2021-04-24 14:12:03,wallstreetbets,"Whoever killed him probably left his car thinking it'd be easy for it to get stolen. It might not erase evidence but it helps muddy the waters. 

My guess is folks in the area thought it was a bait car or something, and steered clear of it."
2021-04-24 15:59:33,wallstreetbets,Professional's abducted him probably at another location but one drove the car to a high theft area ....assuming the car would be taken quickly by amateurs for a joy ride or taken to a chop shop (depending on value of car) either or it would make it look like a carjacking or robbery to cover the true intent of the crime and placing blame and redirection to the inner city community.
2021-04-24 14:10:29,wallstreetbets,Someone probably saw something.
2021-04-24 15:03:36,wallstreetbets,Would look suspiciously like a bait car placed by the cops as part of sting operations.
2021-04-24 14:53:29,wallstreetbets,Because people know a bait car these days.
2021-04-24 16:09:16,wallstreetbets,"Bruh. Imagine a car sitting there with the door wide open, turned on with the keys in the ignition. 

Bruh, thats fuckin bait."

2021-04-24 17:22:08,wallstreetbets,BAIT CAR; POOP DOLLAH
2021-04-24 17:20:36,wallstreetbets,"Depends where it was in South Central. For example if it was West of Western Ave there are a lot of family-oriented neighborhoods with lawns, as opposed to the area closer to the 110. North and South in South Central also matter. I assume it would have been dropped in a rough area, but in that case I would expect it to get stolen. There are strung out people in certain areas that wouldn’t worry about it being a bait car."
2021-04-24 14:58:02,wallstreetbets,Maybe it did get stolen and dumped there
2021-04-24 16:47:55,wallstreetbets,This is why the elite don't get fucked with very often. They know people
2021-04-24 17:37:46,wallstreetbets,As someone who grew up and works in the area. Those neighborhoods are like a giant community so people probably just minded their business or people thought it was a set up car .
2021-04-24 18:45:22,wallstreetbets,He probably shot himself twice in the back of the head
2021-04-24 14:32:23,wallstreetbets,Exactly. I lived there b4. U leave a car not running with no keys its gone. But a running car in south central LA. Shes lying her ass off. And i know cops dont believe that BS.
2021-04-24 18:38:54,wallstreetbets,Them SC LA Boys are connected. They probably knew it before it was dropped off.
2021-04-24 18:49:07,wallstreetbets,Cops leave cars like this and locals know its bait. This trap doesnt work much anymore
2021-04-24 19:27:02,wallstreetbets,Multiple LE agencies have used the same tactic on bait cars for nearly a decade now. Most actual thieves would stay away from it.

2021-04-24 16:37:18,wallstreetbets,">Is there ever gonna be a point where a corporation is charged with a crime in connection to murders like this? (assuming something shady happened).

Depends on when politicians are held accountable for this first, because they're going to be the ones that will have to crack down on corporations. If you can't even trust the politicians then what's the point?

>Also can we do a better job protecting whistleblowers please?

Once again, you're asking people who are always negatively effected by whistle blowers. Politicians in bed with these criminals don't want the whistle blowers either.

The difference is the corporation don't have power if they can't buy off politicians, but here we are with frequently corrupt politicians from either side of the American political coin

Case and point. Former California Democrat state senator of district 8, Leland yee. This fine gentlemen was spearheading the anti gun legislation in the state. One of the more outspoken advocates for gun control in the entire state.

Low and behold, he was gun running, guilty of laundering money, public corruption, bribery, racketeering, etc... and is now out of prison after only 5 years. He was sentenced in 2016.

The guy actively trying to jail people for what he eventually did, was barely effected by his own legislation

Politicians are on a whole different plane of existence compared to normies than even corporate big wigs"

The owner may have trouble getting their insurance to pay out. Some policies have clauses against negligence, like leaving your keys in the ignition."
2021-04-24 17:24:58,wallstreetbets,It's illegal to leave your keys in the car. So if the cops do it you can argue that they broke a law to catch you. That's usually enough to get off.

Let’s start with Montenegro, the Mordor-Esque ‘black mountain’, and the incumbent Milo Đukanović who is described as ‘having strong links to the Montenegro mafia’. From Montenegro we can reach the British Baron Rothschild heir, Nathaniel, who bizarrely has dual citizenship with Montenegro and Canada.

It's Wordpress.

Its basically Wix but worse. It allows you to easily build a website / blog that looks pretty decent with themes and such.

The issue is that people who don't have much IT background often make these wordpress sites. They will sometimes neglect to change the path to the admin login page (usually <site.com>/wp_admin) and on top of that they'll often do dumb shit like making their login something like admin//password.

If they didn't do one of those two things then they probably don't regularly update Wordpress, which has a vast history of issues.

More public vulnerabilities if the site uses one of the many vulnerable Wordpress plugins.

You, unlike me, most likely believe conspiracies on one side but not the other... Another indication that you either get your news from social media, or you work for Russia.  Ask yourself -- do you also believe the conspiracies about Trump of which he has not been convicted?  Neither do I... One of us is much less emotional and much more rational than the other."

2021-04-24 14:35:52,wallstreetbets,"I started accumulating huya and doyu half a month ago but i have a big problem with it and my problem is im unable to figure out bear thesis to explain current valuation, i understood the merger part where there is a gap between the 2 companies and the risk of delisting, but it seems im still lacking info to explain current valuation pls feel free to enlighten me, i dont like investing into something without understanding the opposit point of view so i need help on this one.

Also i also get that bots in china come in huge numbers and could be boosting those numbers but the cash being moved in streams is also huge and cash numbers dont lie at least to my understanding.

Im going in either way bcause i wanted to own a few shares of douyu and huya even before i played the stock market but seeing it at current price with current valuations in market i cant avoid overthinking and its fucking with my mind. 

Too good to be true there must be some skeletons in the closet or something to explain this and im unable to figure them."

2021-04-24 13:46:26,wallstreetbets,This is gold man. I have been tracking huya for 2 months and the whole of last  week. Doing my research. The technicals look super bulish for a reversal rn. Im a bit new with in depth research like you. But the financials and the value man. In my eyes they are a goldmine and just as sound as apple. Even without the merger i see upside in this. If they compete with doyu i see them winning and if they merge. They have a monopoly and would only be second to twich in this world.

2021-04-24 13:22:35,wallstreetbets,"I don't think it's a bearish short, just merger arbitrage on the DouYu potential merger.  

Fantastic balance sheet, it's traded down enough now that it presents a compelling value imo.

I'm long because of their earnings ramp profile, exposure to a growing space, and their undermonetization of advertising.   Engagement has been rising, and advertising was up 40+% YoY, but still represents less than 6% of revenues.

If they earn $1 next year, this is worth at least $27.  Consensus EPS is $1.14."

2021-04-24 14:40:28,wallstreetbets,"I think there are a few things: 1) Chinese companies don't trade as highly with whatever western comps there might be because of past fraud in China. This will eventually go away in time, I believe, as China asserts itself as the biggest economy etc. 2) Regulatory pressures. 3) Fiscal tightening in China as their economy is absolutely booming so higher growth stocks just like in the USA gets hit first. 4) Uncertainty surrounding the merger and potential terms of the merger if it gets renegotiated by the government.

It is weird how cheaply it is trading though. I have been trying to find a bear case other than those and I can't find anything."

Please let me know if you find something different from your research and i'll reconsider
2021-04-24 13:23:24,wallstreetbets,Definitely not a bearish short. It’s a highly bullish short. They are just trying to get the .75 DOYU share conversion spring loaded. Check my first DD
2021-04-24 14:58:48,wallstreetbets,"It is bullish because of the merger. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will become .75 HUYA shares. So people are buying DOYU and shorting HUYA.

If they win the ruling they would remove the conservatorship and be allowed to profit as a company. Dividends would follow. I’m counting on a very red supreme court to do the right thing.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"DD on HYPRO (HydrogenPro) hydrogen company. Massive growth opportunities. Here is some DD on HYPRO. I hope to hear your thoughts on this, in my opinion, very bullish company.

1. HYPRO specialises in large-scale hydrogen production (100MW). They are in the midst of demonstrating their new patented technology which takes the efficiency of hydrogen production up to 94% compared to the rest of the hydrogen industry that is lagging behind at 80%. This technology is expected to be ready for the markets in 2022. They will have the best technology in the hydrogen sector. Massive. The EU is funding companies that are able to demonstrate efficient hydrogen production in the scale of 100MW production plants. HYPRO has applied for this funding and decisions concerning the funding will come this June. HYPROs technology will take the dollar price of producing a kilogram of hydrogen to 1,2dollars compared to EUs goal of finding someone who can produce it for 2,5€/kg of hydrogen. Almost hard to believe..
2. In Q4 of 2020 HYPRO made an operating profit, which is pretty unheard of in the hydrogen industry. Everyone else is taking losses.
3. HYPRO has no debt.
4. HYPRO just signed a deal with Hynion about supplying hydrogen to 30 hydrogen fueling stations that will be built in Scandinavia in the coming years. Hundreds of trucks delivering goods will be charged in these stations. HYPRO and Hynion in collaboration are the only ones providing hydrogen fueling stations in the near future and will have an advantage on everyone else.
5. HYPRO is in a huge dip and hasn´t soared 1000% like some other companies like PLUG.
6. They are helping energy giant Repsol to achieve carbon-neutrality by 2050. They are working on a 100MW hydrogen plant in Spain and many more projects may follow. 3 other plants are being constructed, 2 of which are in the US and 1 in France.

&#x200B;

Here is their most recent report on their website where most of my claims are from: [https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf](https://hydrogen-pro.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/HydrogenPro-Q4-2020-Report-and-Company-update-22FEB21.pdf)

Positions: 

1049 shares with an average of 46,76NOK

Do your now research and let me know what you think! It's still a small company but to me that means a lot of growth potential. Weather you think hydrogen is the future or not, the EU has lots of plans in the hydrogen sector and the price of it is coming down fast. Up to 6GWs of hydrogen plants are to be built by 2024. HYPRO could take a good portion of that. The steel industry will also want to get rid of emissions when the price of pollution becomes greater than the price of switching to hydrogen."
2021-04-24 10:57:49,wallstreetbets,TIL nokia was a currency
2021-04-24 11:11:46,wallstreetbets,"I get a gut feeling that Hydrogen is the HD DVD’s in HDDVD versus blu-Ray, and right before streaming services came out to further hurt the market. 

I think Hydrogen is amazing but the competition from the gas industry (cheap and available) and eventual energy storage momentum shift, is too much limiting the ceiling for long term bag holders, like me. 

Then again, I bought OCGN at 0.25 and held after it peaked at $18+ so, I’m a different kind of idiot...."
2021-04-24 12:25:54,wallstreetbets,"As you mentioned the cost of green hydrogen is coming down, however in terms of efficiency, at present, it still takes signifcant energy input to cause hydrolysis. How does HYPRO solve the energy input problem in hydrolysis to lead to future cost lowering as they improve their process?

I like green energy, I like the idea of green hydrogen. Its just from a purely chemistry perspective it is massively inefficient to produce with current techniques. Something like nuclear on the other hand is more efficient than even fossil fuel, but with obvious safety and waste storage concerns."
2021-04-24 13:06:50,wallstreetbets,H is peanuts compared to who cracks fusion. Who do you got that is working on mini fusion plants that's publicly traded?
2021-04-24 11:41:38,wallstreetbets,How does hydrogen become carbon neutral ever? Especially at an efficiency rate of 94%. Takes energy to separate H out and that means waste which means carbon?
2021-04-24 12:23:28,wallstreetbets,"Hello.

I found these two stickers [HydrogenPro AS Ordinary Shares (R6Z) Quote - XBER | Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/stocks/xber/r6z/quote)  and [HYPRO Stock Price | HydrogenPro A/S Stock Quote (Norway: Oslo) | MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/hypro?countrycode=no&mod=mw_quote_tab) .

2021-04-24 11:23:16,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, am currency trader

1 GME will get you a few NOK"
2021-04-24 11:18:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I have a bit of the same feeling. There are some innovations that make the future of hydrogen somewhat uncertain. However, as said, the price of green hydrogen is coming down because of better efficiency and lower costs of renewable energy. The trend is your friend. The biggest trend of all is that fossil fuels like natural gas, coil and oil are a thing of the past and alternatives need to be found to avert the climate crisis. Hydrogen will surely play a part, it remains a mystery how big that part will be. Renewable energy can’t phase out fossils fuels alone, it needs a way to store energy and that’s where hydrogen (or some other way of storing energy) comes in. A promising factor is that the EU seems really dedicated to building hydrogen infrastructure and they have included hydrogen in their strategy to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050."
2021-04-24 13:50:28,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, so HYPROs technology raises the efficiency of the energy input to hydrogen to 94%, which is pretty good. Only 6% of the energy is lost. The efficiency issue is rather in the hydrogen to energy end of the process where numbers can be a bit uglier sometimes."
2021-04-24 13:51:28,wallstreetbets,Yeah I agree. I tried to look it up a while ago and couldn’t find anyone that is publicly traded.
2021-04-24 18:09:54,wallstreetbets,"In order to use that energy, I think you might have to wait quite a moment."
2021-04-24 11:47:38,wallstreetbets,"The technology is called electrolysis of water. The efficiency rate of 94% means that out of the energy that you use to perform the electrolysis, 94% will be left in the form of hydrogen gas. If the energy that you use for this comes from renewable sources, as HYPRO is doing, you can consider it as carbon neutral as it gets. The waste you are talking about is more like an energy loss of 6%, no carbon.
Also, when burning hydrogen the only emission is water vapor."
2021-04-24 13:17:19,wallstreetbets,I believe that Nordnet can be used pretty broadly. I use that myself as a Finn. Other than that I don’t know.
2021-04-24 13:58:21,wallstreetbets,"Do you know how their hydrolysis efficiency compares to say $FCEL, $PLUG, or $BE?"
2021-04-24 12:09:17,wallstreetbets,"Thanks. It looks like they are seeking to be carbon neutral by 2050. Which by most estimates is 20 years late (but conforms with everyone else’s goal). I guess this is a bet on what technology energy storage will lean towards in the future. Batteries or H, or something else yet to be scaled up."

2021-04-24 13:34:55,wallstreetbets,"MViS been saying for months new lidar package drops in April 2021, this is not news at all really. It's going to be be so much better then LAZR's tech that it will increase pressure on one if the giants to close the deal on a buyout, be it MSFT, Apple, Uber, TSLA, VW etc. I know Musk thinks he can do FSD with just camera's and that regular Lidar is too bulky for cars. But this drop is going to be small, sleek, and sexy as well as best in class. MVIS really is the best fit for Tesla if Musk would just accept that camera's are not perfect and they will not achieve level 4 FSD without radar/lidar sensors. It's a perfect match for both companies. Tesla gets a small, non mechanical top tier lidar package in their cars to augment their Camera data, and MVIS gets bought out at their asking price which is peanuts for TSLA. If MVIS fully developed and promoted their product it will only cost TSLA billions more down the road to catch up, for a company so far ahead of the field on tech it's a no-brainer, it adds to their technical lead massively while getting  severely undervalued cutting edge tech relatively cheaply. If it isn't TSLA whoever acquires MVIS is going to have an advantage on developing a FSD system. I'd be dumping LAZR stock as fast as I could right now if I owned any, that's how good MVIS' product is gonna be comparativly."

2021-04-24 11:38:25,wallstreetbets,"It will go further up, to the moon!!!"
2021-04-24 11:40:09,wallstreetbets,You will be fine after next week brother.
2021-04-24 13:58:23,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell ?
2021-04-24 14:54:10,wallstreetbets,"Buy high,  sell low? I've been doing it wrong all this time"

2021-04-24 12:36:28,wallstreetbets,Should have gone to AMC....
2021-04-24 19:38:11,wallstreetbets,I'm a scary ass bitch. But the fomo gets me every time. Cc premium.isnt worth it now
2021-04-24 14:57:10,wallstreetbets,Ooh I was going to guess gas company or lineman but you’re probably right.
2021-04-24 14:25:54,wallstreetbets,"No it’s a new strategy. Buy high, sell, buy higher."

2021-04-24 15:34:53,wallstreetbets,facts
2021-04-24 10:07:40,wallstreetbets,Next Fridays a long time. I need that dopamine rush instantaneously.
2021-04-24 10:09:59,wallstreetbets,Risch ish.... still farding and shidding about the situation. Keep in mind I'm a huge pussy and if I see 5k you know what's gunna happen.
2021-04-24 16:28:38,wallstreetbets,"‘My portfolio will be gone Monday’ def has me confused. If these were FDs it might make sense but wtf bro, you have shares why are you flipping shit?"
2021-04-24 12:55:30,wallstreetbets,Gotdamn I feel bad for the guy though. Invested right at the top of the mountain
2021-04-24 17:03:00,wallstreetbets,I was able to get in at $10.83 for 1400! Plan on adding 1900 more on dip Monday !
2021-04-24 13:18:23,wallstreetbets,"Not made up, buyout is the endgame, hopefully we get news by the 29th"
2021-04-24 11:32:16,wallstreetbets,Not a stretch but you’d be better putting your money where your mouth is by buying calls
2021-04-24 13:35:24,wallstreetbets,My expectation is a dip at open on monday followed by continued runup till earnings. If $MSFT or $F or $GOOGL say anything that could be a hint at greater demand for MVIS product or anything that fuels buyout speculation that rise could be very significant. That's pure speculation based only on how this stock responds to news.
2021-04-24 13:12:06,wallstreetbets,Go run and vape 💨 it’s enough dopamine to get through a slow week
2021-04-24 10:21:17,wallstreetbets,Good thing you’re sticking to shares then
2021-04-24 13:35:44,wallstreetbets,It will most likely dip in the morning at open so be prepared. IF you do decide to sell on the dip. I will gladly help out and take those shares off your hands 😉
2021-04-24 14:01:12,wallstreetbets,Could make a shit pile of money selling $25-$30 CCs
2021-04-24 15:19:15,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with an exit strategy bro.
2021-04-24 12:59:43,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I get that, used to hate people who got in at $1 telling me to chill. Tbf I initially got in at $22 and averaged it down over 2 of the most harrowing months of my life 🤣😭"
2021-04-24 19:06:17,wallstreetbets,There's 0 chance a buyout is announced on the 29th. Let's just hope they have the A sample ready.
2021-04-24 11:35:15,wallstreetbets,Nope . Shares only . I got paper hands with calls
2021-04-24 18:10:40,wallstreetbets,I have 65 7/16 $22c
2021-04-24 14:31:17,wallstreetbets,"This is what I was thinking.
That red is hard to deal with, but I'm spending the weekend preparing."
2021-04-24 15:47:36,wallstreetbets,One things stabilize a bit this is where I’ll be. Only monthlies makes it difficult to swing cc’s with this IV.
2021-04-24 15:32:23,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely, its all about your risk tolerance! Good luck 🤞"
2021-04-24 13:02:10,wallstreetbets,Yeah they do have it easy coming it when it was a penny stock 😂. 20 dollars? You must have come on to this stock at around early 2021 and have been lowering it slowly till now?
2021-04-24 19:25:46,wallstreetbets,I don't think they would have moved up the date of the A sample demo if they didn't have it ready. All signs look bullish af to me
2021-04-24 15:36:20,wallstreetbets,That's one intelligent investor. Knows his weakness. Rock on brotha!
2021-04-24 14:53:32,wallstreetbets,"Been in MVIS for over a year now. I know how that feels like on those days when its red, I just forget about it and come back after while and get a pleasant surprise. I sometimes read the research that the people on the MVIS reddit community did, to make myself feel better on those red days. I believe this company is seriously doing amazing things and will very soon, show its real value, and its definitely worth more than 30 per share imho. FYI i hold 7830 shares on my rh account and 20k shares on my fidelity account so I might be little biased. Im just a random guy on the internet! Good luck! 🤞"
2021-04-24 17:58:22,wallstreetbets,"Bought puts anticipating this. If it falls to 14 or less, I’ll buy calls lol. Let’s see if I’m a retard or not"

2021-04-24 13:24:19,wallstreetbets,As long as you don't plan on holding overnight. You know if they beat earnings that shit's gonna plummet.

2021-04-24 14:05:15,wallstreetbets,"Sell before earnings. It’s going down there is no good news. Everyone already knows where they stand. Spent a bunch of money acquiring xilinx. Only guidance they can give is that they will be limited by chip shortage for a while to come.

Edit:willing to be a good sum this is a bit or he’s selling covered calls on AMD"
2021-04-24 14:42:40,wallstreetbets,Just buy 1 call and 1 put to balance out.

2021-04-24 10:59:04,wallstreetbets,"So far it’s dropped on earning beats for Netflix and Intel, Netflix subscriber count didn’t impress and Intel lost on data centre revenue. Could be a bit of a leading indicator for how the market will react to other earnings as results don’t live up to the feverish COVID boom driven expectations.

Either ways it’s going to be a volatile week, so we’ll see how it shakes out. I’m pretty heavy in tech, and have long calls on AMD and Apple, so I’m crossing my fingers that you’re right."
2021-04-24 12:56:12,wallstreetbets,Have you noticed many good earnings have led to the price drop in the stock.  The recover and more is priced into stocks. Volume is sucking air as we do not have many buyers at these nosebleed levels and the SPY just repeated the same candle pattern and RSI stick that it did before the last move lower with Covid hitting.  SPY upside potential 3% .. Downside potential 15% ..  I am net short. Only long I have is ASO because if it clears $33 on a daily close it has no resistance above it. Every owner of the stock will be in the green
2021-04-24 14:35:00,wallstreetbets,But Zoom is probably going to languish lol.

2021-04-24 10:43:50,wallstreetbets,"I bought like 200 more shares last week around 78. I been long since they where 20. Don't think they will go to the moon yet. But i cant see how they are not gonna double at least in the next few years, even in the worst bear scenario."

2021-04-24 16:43:05,wallstreetbets,Reckon it’ll do well on earnings?
2021-04-24 16:04:01,wallstreetbets,"It did get bumped up, so maybe missing it was an oversight. Regardless everyone knows about it! Is it Monday yet?"

2021-04-24 13:54:27,wallstreetbets,Looks to be at 50-50. Either its going way up or way down. Been consolidating for too long
2021-04-24 09:45:55,wallstreetbets,That is correct. The only thing that they cant analyze is guidance. If someone comes out and says we are tracking x and y for rest of year. Imo all the big guys reporting never surprise since they get insane amount of attention from analysts and they know how to price their movement. The little guys are the ones that can move up / down higher.

2021-04-24 12:43:29,wallstreetbets,Not for sure.
2021-04-24 14:05:39,wallstreetbets,Nothing is for certain i suppose. The CEO has been hyping this demo in April for months though so it’d be very odd to not follow up considering it’s the end of the month
2021-04-24 14:35:55,wallstreetbets,"They just said April and we're running out of April.

The stock went up to 19 in the Microsoft Hololens contract and they're was no mention of $MVIS. If the demo meets or exceed their expectation or there are even a hint of a buyout expect the stock to moon."
2021-04-24 14:25:30,wallstreetbets,So Microsoft got the 22B contract with DOD... is there any idea how big MVIS role in that is yet? Or is that revealed on the earnings release?
2021-04-24 16:37:42,wallstreetbets,"Not demo results. CEO said that the Lidar A-sample should be complete in April. If he confirms, the sp will  have a most likely have a nice pop."

2021-04-24 14:14:40,wallstreetbets,It's mentioned in like every other comment on this post and all anyone was talking about in the daily thread yesterday.
2021-04-24 14:33:07,wallstreetbets,"At this point, all this hype is already priced in so unless MVIS shows some ground breaking stuff in the demo, this might be one of those ""buy the rumor sell the news"" events."
2021-04-24 14:26:43,wallstreetbets,I believe Microsoft’s deal with MVIS was already in place. I don’t think the 22B deal affected that except for the future when the current deal runs out.
2021-04-24 18:06:22,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't right now
2021-04-24 12:12:21,wallstreetbets,"I don't think ER is fully-priced in, so I'll be holding too with possible good news in May."
2021-04-24 14:44:20,wallstreetbets,lol 100% those hedge funds will pick this up with their social media algos and start shorting
2021-04-24 14:38:05,wallstreetbets,they hype is definitely not priced in. If the Lidar is as good as MVIS says they should be 4x as valuable on their lidar alone if you compare it with other lidar companies.
2021-04-24 14:30:12,wallstreetbets,Thanks for clarifying
2021-04-24 18:07:12,wallstreetbets,Okay thanks.. So on the 29th u will be selling?

It's because by the time everyone and their grandmother have heard about it on here, it's completely priced in and it's almost always at the top or just before it.

No HF conspiracy required, just good old fashioned FOMO."
2021-04-24 14:56:19,wallstreetbets,"The major red flag for me is if their tech is so good, why don't they just produce and sell the products themselves as a stand alone company? Why is the CEO so eager to sell his company instead? And he's been talking about wanting to sell the company for years. If their tech is that great, why haven't they been bought out when their share price was way lower?"
2021-04-24 18:10:03,wallstreetbets,Most likely
2021-04-24 12:16:19,wallstreetbets,You as well.
2021-04-24 16:26:45,wallstreetbets,How has he been talking about selling for years when he's only been CEO for slightly longer than a single year?
2021-04-24 15:41:04,wallstreetbets,"They lack the capabilities to mass produce their stuff. 

The CEO got the position in Feb '20 and he became the CEO with the goal to find partners or a buyout.

They've got the tech, the brains, but lack the people to scale the production that why a buyout is the goal.

Idk, maybe MVIS wasn't happy with the offer?"
2021-04-24 18:14:00,wallstreetbets,Alright that was helpful thank you
2021-04-24 19:09:21,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure how that response was helpful.  He just told you to stay away from a stock that’s going to run up for 4 straight trading days going in to the EC.  Expect a dip first thing Monday morning and it’ll gain nicely right up through Thursday.    
I look forward to revisiting this thread in 5 days.   I’ll be right"
2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,MVIS LAZR YOLO! LET's GO LIDAR! 
2021-04-24 14:43:33,wallstreetbets,I got 40 shares @14.70 on Thursday. Holding through earnings.🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-24 12:31:20,wallstreetbets,"Well done! And lidar is just one thing they do! Their tech is also in Hololens, and of course in the IVAS army deal Microsoft just did. Next week should be beautiful if you ask me!"
2021-04-24 07:26:29,wallstreetbets,"Damn, a solid company with a good product and LAZR"
2021-04-24 12:06:54,wallstreetbets,"Make $$$$ boys, I missed the boat on this one.. I'll buy if it pulls back.. if not, I'll just miss another one!!"
2021-04-24 07:14:12,wallstreetbets,Just wait for the rally next week!!🚀
2021-04-24 11:37:01,wallstreetbets,"Good shit, if it hits 50 we are all gonna be rich"
2021-04-24 14:38:49,wallstreetbets,Is mvis still going to run more next week ? What calls have highest roi ?
2021-04-24 12:16:24,wallstreetbets,I’m a MVIS girl 🤓🚀💎💰
2021-04-24 09:11:27,wallstreetbets,How the fuk did you find this months ago?
2021-04-24 05:52:33,wallstreetbets,NICE
2021-04-24 13:42:07,wallstreetbets,Mvis better technology than lazr
2021-04-24 05:44:22,wallstreetbets,🌚 🚀
2021-04-24 16:16:38,wallstreetbets,"This company has some serious next-level tech, how are they only worth 2B?"
2021-04-24 09:49:30,wallstreetbets,Pew pew!
2021-04-24 12:28:58,wallstreetbets,Buy calls pussy and become mega rich!
2021-04-24 16:36:38,wallstreetbets,"What is it that yall are looking for in terms of the buy out or in other words how do yall know when to sell? 
I'm still learning how to spot these signs in the market and I'd appreciate any pointers."
2021-04-24 18:17:16,wallstreetbets,Beginning of Friday I bought $6k in LAZR $24c expiring 4/30
2021-04-24 18:26:08,wallstreetbets,I have a ton of $12 options in MVIS performing well.  Good through 5/21. Sell now and 5x my money or roll the dice that it keeps going up?
2021-04-24 12:45:59,wallstreetbets,Got a 1000 shares of Microvision as well OP. Let’s go!
2021-04-24 16:21:20,wallstreetbets,Good job taking both of em. Apple's gonna choose between them
2021-04-24 13:24:47,wallstreetbets,What is the best price to go in now or just get market rate once its open?
2021-04-24 13:08:52,wallstreetbets,"Hey guys
 Nubie retard here
Bought MVIS last. Week. My second stock buy ever.  For now I will leave the puts and calls and the DT's. To the veteran apes.  How soon will the hedges have to cover theirshorts?"
2021-04-24 12:37:23,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I'm big into LIDAR too. Been holding both since last year, and loaded up a bunch more during their pull backs. Congrats on not investing in VLDR. Sell some covered calls on the MVIS options before earnings."
2021-04-24 13:10:35,wallstreetbets,"Got in early , this guy has alot of info on them . Let's enjoy the ride !


https://youtube.com/c/TradeModeJames"
2021-04-24 17:39:19,wallstreetbets,Is it too late to jump in?
2021-04-24 13:09:25,wallstreetbets,"I love watching retards brag about buying the top. Can't wait to see your loss porn 😂

Edit: 6 $15p 5/21 @2.14 & 3 $11p 5/21 @0.73"
2021-04-24 14:58:57,wallstreetbets,LAZR is the real deal. Not sure what micro penis actually does
2021-04-24 16:17:25,wallstreetbets,$18 was the time to get out. You will be holding bags soon
2021-04-24 19:24:00,wallstreetbets,I have a few LAZR options. Lost my add the last few weeks. Any idea what I should do on Monday. New to investing. Looking for help.
2021-04-24 11:36:12,wallstreetbets,Don't do it
2021-04-24 06:21:43,wallstreetbets,Average?
2021-04-24 14:20:27,wallstreetbets,What's the solid company?
2021-04-24 15:42:23,wallstreetbets,This is exactly what I said when GME hit 8 dollars ..... I regret that.
2021-04-24 17:27:58,wallstreetbets,You aren’t to late. A lot room left on this moon mission!
2021-04-24 13:05:46,wallstreetbets,ANOTHA ONE
2021-04-24 14:33:32,wallstreetbets,For sure it’ll pull back early next week. I’m waiting to buy more calls then.
2021-04-24 19:08:09,wallstreetbets,You won’t be missing out on MVIS.
2021-04-24 18:28:33,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I had 300 shares ( TD was not allowing me to do calls at the time) 
But I had a trailing-stop and shit sold 😞

Profits!!! 

But now it’s already up! And the weekend won’t let me get in!"
2021-04-24 08:08:55,wallstreetbets,why next week?
2021-04-24 12:17:39,wallstreetbets,Oof this comment is a week late
2021-04-24 10:22:41,wallstreetbets,"I think MVIS is a P&D but if you MUST hold, sell before earnings not after.  Studies show highly hyped stocks tend to fall after earnings whereas stocks doing shitty before earnings tend to be way too pessimistic about the news coming out."
2021-04-24 15:37:06,wallstreetbets,I bought 1 contract for August 20 35C for $98 and it's now worth $315.
2021-04-24 16:29:44,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn’t get in on MVIS at this price and I bought puts. It has repeatedly spiked to 19 and fallen all the way back down. If you do buy in, I’d wait to see that it will break that resistance at 19"
2021-04-24 12:27:33,wallstreetbets,Welcome on board sister......I'm all in yesterday ... good luck to all of us
2021-04-24 12:39:06,wallstreetbets,"hol’ up, u a girl? 😏"
2021-04-24 10:15:13,wallstreetbets,I  got on last thursday!
2021-04-24 12:41:32,wallstreetbets,Understanding the value of LIDAR and doing some research for publicly traded companies. I got LAZR back on the December dip and MVIS in Early JAN.
2021-04-24 15:49:58,wallstreetbets,I found it on a stock screener in February.
2021-04-24 19:14:08,wallstreetbets,Roll to Friday
2021-04-24 17:20:10,wallstreetbets,Same ! Let's goooo
2021-04-24 15:17:39,wallstreetbets,Yes.
2021-04-24 14:09:41,wallstreetbets,"The simplest way I can explain is that it depends on the price they shorted the stock at, how much equity they have in their accounts, and what their margin percentages are. 

Which could be different for anyone who shorted it."
2021-04-24 13:37:53,wallstreetbets,"Me who's been holding VLDR...
At least I have some Mvis"
2021-04-24 17:03:45,wallstreetbets,Any thoughts on aeva?
2021-04-24 13:22:39,wallstreetbets,".well just a small wagerat the wall street casino.  I bought at10.88.  Sits at 17.93 today.  I'd be very happy, and very surprised if it were to hit 50."
2021-04-24 16:32:44,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I went for puts too. Will be cashing out early next week when it’s back to $11"
2021-04-24 11:04:49,wallstreetbets,it's right there. Cost / Quantity. MIVS $16.49 LAZR $20.17
2021-04-24 14:27:31,wallstreetbets,MVIS 😎
2021-04-24 08:29:27,wallstreetbets,Company upped their earnings to Thursday. Big news incoming likely.
2021-04-24 11:15:00,wallstreetbets,"Some history from last mvis ER:

The price jumped 140% last year between April 30th (earnings date announcement) to May 7th (earnings). It jumped 270% from April 30th to May 5th."
2021-04-24 10:49:45,wallstreetbets,"This isn't a hyped stock you clown. Do some dd around their tech. It's undervalued and it will go up , I don't know why reddit is running with this stock but I'm all for it as a long term holder."
2021-04-24 14:05:12,wallstreetbets,"Again, I agree with you."
2021-04-24 12:34:57,wallstreetbets,Probably shouldn’t make sweeping statements on something you know nothing about.  There’s a compiled DD on the mvis subreddit if you would like to educate yourself on the company.
2021-04-24 13:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Hold up, you’re a dude?"
2021-04-24 12:00:33,wallstreetbets,I got in back in November! Let's go
2021-04-24 10:15:41,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands let's gooo
2021-04-24 14:14:13,wallstreetbets,El mucho gracias
2021-04-24 16:50:57,wallstreetbets,"d....diamond hands, right?"
2021-04-24 18:21:19,wallstreetbets,"Haven't looked into them at all to be honest. I was checking out mvis, LAZR, and VLDR and decided on the first two. VLDR seemed much less solid of the three."
2021-04-24 14:43:17,wallstreetbets,"Hey, are you being sarcastic too?"
2021-04-24 13:31:45,wallstreetbets,"I think it's probably not likely that there is big news. An earnings report wouldn't really be the place to announce some of the stuff you guys are suggesting, either.

Most likely, they just want to get this done while the market's already in a rally. This could be to take advantage of positive PR to help boost their numbers more than normal, or it could even be to offset an earnings miss that otherwise might push their numbers below their typical support. It could be that most big tech companies report this week or last week and they didn't want to miss out. Or it could be absolutely nothing at all.

I have some MVIS positions just for the lotto ticket of a crazy announcement, but 99% of the time this stuff doesn't mean what the QAnon-adjacent groups insist it does."
2021-04-24 09:58:46,wallstreetbets,Lazr or Mvis?
2021-04-24 10:22:04,wallstreetbets,Everyone is saying big news incoming.  Are you an insider?  How do you know big things are coming.
2021-04-24 11:19:29,wallstreetbets,"You're talking about stock movement, not the underlying company.

What do you expect earnings to be for 1Q, 2Q, 3Q, and 4Q this year?"
2021-04-24 12:14:29,wallstreetbets,This isnt a hyped stock.... Lol you are a retard...
2021-04-24 10:54:35,wallstreetbets,"If you're long-term you got nothing to worry about, what happens short-term shouldn't matter, especially if you bought when it was very cheap and hoping for a massive pay-out way down the line."
2021-04-24 14:13:51,wallstreetbets,Not a hyped stock...? lol
2021-04-24 12:38:15,wallstreetbets,"0 revenue, 0 product, and 0 inventory.  Just some royalties and licenses at this point.

Sketchy CEO making big promises and track record of not delivering.

LiDAR they are newcomers just getting started in a crowded and competitive field.  Not to mention LiDAR's primary application is SDC's a speculative tech with no viable product likely decades away."
2021-04-24 15:05:46,wallstreetbets,Hold up you’re non-binary?
2021-04-24 15:10:55,wallstreetbets,"Gonna eat your short on thursday. Don’t forget to post the loss porn on Friday, thanks!"
2021-04-24 16:27:25,wallstreetbets,Don’t say we didn’t tell you when you see us on 🌝
2021-04-24 15:13:49,wallstreetbets,They did say something about their sample and plans on the 2020 earnings last month. So it isn‘t that unlikely that they say something about their progress
2021-04-24 14:16:06,wallstreetbets,Very much appreciate the response keeping us grounded. I think the hype carries us into earnings and we'll see what happens.
2021-04-24 14:04:24,wallstreetbets,Your comment is honest and intelligent - no wonder it's being down-voted.
2021-04-24 10:59:37,wallstreetbets,Mvis is next Thursday. https://microvision.gcs-web.com/financial-information/quarterly-results
2021-04-24 12:22:41,wallstreetbets,im all in MVIS
2021-04-24 14:00:56,wallstreetbets,Ofc MVIS
2021-04-24 11:31:01,wallstreetbets,"By doing due diligence. Understanding the company, milestones, analyzing recent sec filings, and other M&A activity that has taken place in the last couple months. DDD"
2021-04-24 19:16:50,wallstreetbets,Just look at what positions they are hiring for and look at SS new CEO contract.... This is so easy even ape can buy stonk if he like  🍌.
2021-04-24 12:03:08,wallstreetbets,"I ask not sure, but their in the IVAS for the army and the $20b contract, so it should be better than previous, but it's speculation.

The LiDAR pr will come out before earnings IIRC. Puts right here are risky, 0 short shares available."
2021-04-24 15:18:27,wallstreetbets,Their royalties from MSFT aren’t revenue? lol
2021-04-24 13:02:25,wallstreetbets,Feels like im reading that investorplace article again
2021-04-24 15:16:35,wallstreetbets,"Hold up, you’re?"
2021-04-24 11:43:19,wallstreetbets,Sounds very vague and speculative.  Do you have anything more concrete?
2021-04-24 14:12:18,wallstreetbets,"""Do your DD!"" is all anyone ever has to say. There is nothing solid regarding MVIS - it's all speculation and hype."
2021-04-24 12:08:16,wallstreetbets,"Also LiDAR thus far they are newcomers in an already competitive and crowded field.

Its main application is SDC's a tech that isn't even a viable product yet and likely decades away."
2021-04-24 12:07:11,wallstreetbets,MVIS has a $20b contract?  Since when.
2021-04-24 15:31:13,wallstreetbets,How much are we talking about here?  Do you have dollar figures.  Right now they have revenues of 300k a year.
2021-04-24 14:03:06,wallstreetbets,They have nothing. This has been done before with this stock.
2021-04-24 16:24:25,wallstreetbets,Which is why I bought puts when it hit $18. I’ll ride this baby down just like I rode RKT
2021-04-24 12:31:34,wallstreetbets,"They've been r&d for 10 years, there is no competition. Look for yourself."
2021-04-24 12:19:43,wallstreetbets,Microsofts IVAS is powered by Microvisions chips. They're not the directly getting all 20b.
2021-04-24 15:39:10,wallstreetbets,"I’ll get what you want to say so let’s skip the whole discussion whether the royalties are enough and that MS isn’t officially the customer. 

You **don‘t** invest in MVIS for the numbers. You invest in RnD. Think of MVIS like a Biotech firm. Most of them aren’t making any revenue as well and trade with P/E even higher. 

MVIS does have a track record with LIDAR, they got a B2C LIDAR and have all necessary patents secured. 

On top of that their CEO changed in February 2020, replacing the old, underdelivering CEO. I won’t say that MVIS is guaranteed money but this is WallStreetBETS after all. If you want to go short MVIS, go ahead. But don’t go short because financials don’t matter in this market (looking @ you, Tesla & Nikola) but because you think they can’t deliver on Thursday."
2021-04-24 12:35:38,wallstreetbets,Source?  I'm not talking about the whole company just LiDAR.  It is a competitive and crowded field.  They are newcomers to it.
2021-04-24 12:20:46,wallstreetbets,"How much would you estimate?  Do you have a source on numbers to back up how many they sell for, at what price, etc."
2021-04-24 15:43:48,wallstreetbets,"* They are new to LiDAR compared to competitors, in an already crowded field, billions have been poured into this industry.
* The primary application of LiDAR is SDC's a technology with currently zero viability, likely tech not maturing to be profitable for decades."
2021-04-24 12:30:08,wallstreetbets,"I didn't downvote you but it shouldn't be hard to find, but I'm not going to do that for you because you need to go down the rabbit hole and find that you'll ever up loving mavis."
2021-04-24 15:46:16,wallstreetbets,"Damn, gonna say Google that Waymo was a bad investment. lol"
2021-04-24 12:36:30,wallstreetbets,"I haven't been able to find anything reliable about how much MVIS is going to get from MSFT.

Do they have a solid deal in place already?"
2021-04-24 15:47:53,wallstreetbets,"Waymo is the leader in this area and even the CEO has said that full  autonomy may not even become viable in our lifetime.

Turns out humans are pretty fucking smart.  When we see a bike attached to the back of a car we know that it's not a moving bike."
2021-04-24 14:08:50,wallstreetbets,They have nothing.
2021-04-24 14:21:14,wallstreetbets,Just got to the MVIS page on Reddit. Not that hard to find all your answers. You guys are all clueless about this stock lol
2021-04-24 12:57:38,wallstreetbets,He meant to say “I have no idea”
2021-04-24 15:53:45,wallstreetbets,">	Waymo is the leader in this area and even the CEO has said that full autonomy may not even become viable in our lifetime

Source?"
2021-04-24 14:21:44,wallstreetbets,"Check MVIS Reddit page , you’ll change your mind buddy 😘"
2021-04-24 15:32:18,wallstreetbets,"I agree, 0 revenue, 0 inventory, 0 product.  Lots of big promises but sketchy track record."
2021-04-24 15:31:41,wallstreetbets,How much revenue / earnings do you expect from MVIS in the coming 6 quarters each?
2021-04-24 16:05:25,wallstreetbets,Everyone who follows the space fucking knows Waymo is the leader.
2021-04-24 16:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Oh you mean full autonomy

https://www.wired.com/story/ford-taps-brakes-arrival-self-driving-cars/

>In November, Waymo CEO John Krafcik said “autonomy always will have some constraints,” and suggested that a self-driving car that could truly go anywhere might never materialize. Though Waymo’s limited self-driving service in suburban Phoenix is slowly expanding locally, the company still puts operators behind the wheel, for safety. “Driverless” is a stretch. The chief technology head at Nissan’s Silicon Valley development center now publicly pooh-poohs the concept of completely driverless vehicles, insisting last month that “an autonomous system without a human in the loop” is “a useless system.” (Former CEO Ghosn has been arrested again by Japanese authorities.)"
2021-04-24 15:17:27,wallstreetbets,He has a short position and tries to spread FUD
2021-04-24 16:06:28,wallstreetbets,I’ve meant the last bit. That we won’t see autonomous driving in our life time.
2021-04-24 16:09:25,wallstreetbets,"See my other reply to you.  The thing is, all we have is some VERY geofenced, nice weather autonomy, situations / areas that have been very well-mapped.

Getting from holding a car's hand in ""easy"" conditions to human decision making is a really fucking hard problem."
2021-04-24 16:11:30,wallstreetbets,"Autonomy as a money-making concept is a cute fantasy in super niche scenarios.

Airport shuttles, package delivery of repetitive and simple routes, etc.

Mass adoption by consumers, without a quantum and massively disruptive leap in existing computing / AI,  just isn't going to happen."
2021-04-24 16:12:15,wallstreetbets,"Thanks! I’ll agree with you. However, I don’t get why this won’t mean that driving in cities and public transport wouldn’t be possible in the not so distant future as soon as the sensors get better."
2021-04-24 16:16:15,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not just about sensors which still has issues with weather.  

LiDAR degrades heavily in performance under rain.  It's like... umm most of the world has rain and snow?!! to deal with.

The main problem is still recognition and decision making.  When I see a kid on the corner make eye contact with me, I know he's not going to chase a rubber ball that he dropped and can proceed safely.  Computers don't ""understand"" or make inferences, right now even the best AI is based upon recognition, they still have to look at things and figure out what it is.  Is it solid?  Is that bag plastic?  They have to look at EVERYTHING, we know what matters and what doesn't.  We don't have to process so much data in our head.

When a car in front of me is swerving or to the side of me I see a woman looking down at her phone, I know to slow down and create distance.  There's all this little shit computers can't do.

We have an extraordinarily complex way of processing and making sense of our environment which allows us to make really good decisions compared to machines."
2021-04-24 16:18:51,wallstreetbets,"Alright, gotcha. Thanks for the discussion man, really appreciate it! This won’t change my view on MVIS being an investment but it has reality checked me in my expectations for fully autonomous driving in the near future :("
2021-04-24 16:55:01,wallstreetbets,Sure no problem.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"short india ($INDA, $INDY, $EPI) First, condolences to all Indian WSBers, their families, and their countrymen.

I know most of WSB is in US, where covid is old news. But you guys should read up on what's happening in India. Look at their covid cases graph, it's going parabolic

https://preview.redd.it/q4igen4um2v61.png?width=656&format=png&auto=webp&s=9f0ecc6d7d4857f483af5184cceef96775a06795

[Hospitals are running out oxygen,](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-56851265) and the government is considering diverting industrial oxygen supplies to hospitals. What does this mean? It means that all industries that uses oxygen will be shut down. What industries uses oxygen?

\- it's used for cutting and welding, so all things like automotive, manufacturing, etc

\-it's used for combustion processes in metal production, so that will interrupt raw material productions (India's major metals productions are Iron and Steel)

&#x200B;

Basically a huge death wave will be coming, and a lot of the industry will be shutdown not just due to lockdowns, but also shortage of oxygen. Meanwhile India ETFs like $INDA are pretty much near all time highs.

You might think vaccines will be the saving grace, but unfortunately the population of india and lack of resources will make vaccinating the indian population a huge task that can't be done quickly. US has 3 of the 4 major vaccines and got 200m doses in \~100 days. India has 1.4 B people, even if they can vaccinate at the US rate, it will take 700 days to get 1 dose on everyone."
2021-04-24 04:31:30,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it seems no brainer to short these tickers, but we all know market has no logic and it will go in opposite direction for sure"

2021-04-24 15:29:11,wallstreetbets,"The sad thing is (and this will sound heartless) is covid killing elderly in india may actually help their economy long term. Short term it will hurt them, but long term they will have a younger population and a lower dependency ratio

India also has a growing educated population, decent geography, one of the youngest populations in the world, and lots of room to grow"

Whats your position op?

$APD has a joint venture in India that manufactures oxygen amongst other things, I doubt this Oxygen shortage(*which is really a transport problem and doesn't seem too wide spread*) will move the stock but it could get a little uptick if its not priced in by now. Probably better odds than trying to short all of India."
2021-04-24 03:33:43,wallstreetbets,"Ur estimates  are wayyyy off considering  the vast majority of those 200 million vaccines where in the latter part of those 100 days and assuming that they don't plan to ramp up production and assuming that no other company will provide vaccines.

2021-04-24 14:56:54,wallstreetbets,"While the situation that India is facing right now is dire, I think it's just temporary. They have strong vaccine production capabilities, and a shit ton of their people are getting infected by the day right now. Either way, they're gonna reach herd immunity (vaccination or mass infections) soon. 

It sucks that many of their people will die in the coming weeks, but I guess this is the path their government has chosen. I'm guessing that within maybe two months tops, this issue in India will blow over, just like how Italy and US are no longer facing big issues now compared to last year."
2021-04-24 17:08:52,wallstreetbets,My very rudimentary thought on things but with China on  the nose with many nations isn't India in the box seat to pick up bigger contracts for mass produced items?

2021-04-24 05:23:02,wallstreetbets,"Pandemic will be over. 

Maybe later for India as compared to countried which have made better vaccination progress. 

Fundamentals would remain now and for a very long time.

India has a younger population, tech savvy, few good economic reforms too, poor implentation- meaning at some point of time those reforms would start to headstart growth/ productivity engines though they appear to be mot benefiting now. 

India has also gone out and helped other nations in vaccinations. And has lowest per capital carbon footprint. Poor execution can delay the growth cant kill it. 

Dont bet against economics. Change put to call options."

2021-04-24 10:17:52,wallstreetbets,"Bro, the US did far worse in terms of cases of COVID than India. India has 4x the population and half the cases. So to be clear, the US did 8x worse, without factoring in things like distribution of people. I'm not going to guess on what the market should do there.

I would wish you the best of luck on your short, but that means people are in for hardship."
2021-04-24 12:04:44,wallstreetbets,I think the fact that we in the USA consider covid old news is what may drive a crazier wave in the summer when everyone goes all out on going out hope for the best but I really doubt its over

If life expectancy is 80, then one out of 80 people will die in a given year.  Did we deviate greatly? No.

From 7th to today, only her mum and she are unaffected by it. 5 people have contacted it, one of them is dead (she was 51), God rest her soul, and for another member we're on a search for Tocilizumab injection as I'm typing this.

The rationalisation as it's not bagholding because it's not just hyped up and has a high short interest, while hyping it up multiple times in a relatively short span of time, also does not inspire confidence either."

2. On positions: So your position on the stock has changed from an obvious long since the first post, which was only a month ago, to neutral/short? Is this, again, consistent will the ""technical analyses"" and bullish posts just from recent days with the downward trend in the stock price?

I wouldn't think a post from only *a month* ago is irrelevant at all, let a lone it being ""long ago"". If people are to read, digest and take actions based upon your posts, I think they deserve to know your recommendations/takes on other stocks as well. I ""cherry picked"" out the exact sentence that triggered the alarm in my head. Plenty of people post on only one or two stocks, but they're not dogmatic to the point as to attempt to convince others that this is ""not bagholding"".

2021-04-24 14:19:43,wallstreetbets,"My opinion has always been it's not a bagholding stock unless people bought on the day of the spike. I have posts detailing the fundamentals and outlook of the company. There were lots of people complaining that RKT was shit, and I was trying to provide my reasons why I think it's undervalued, since I did some research before investing before the spike. Is there anything wrong with that?

I did think there should have been a second melt up but I was proven wrong so far. I was holding for the long term and still will be, I just sold any short dated calls on the earlier spike and happy with that. Position can mean position on a matter, not just stock position. I haven't sold my shares if that's what you're asking.

So you're saying you can just whip up any conclusion, and as long as there aren't evidence against (there is, you just didnt read my post before jumping to that conclusion), you are justified?

To illustrate how ridiculous this is: Then I think you are a pedophile and happy to be proven otherwise, but there really isn't any evidence to show my suspicion is unjustified."

But this is not what you said. You said: 

"" The people who jump in at elevated valuations bag hold because the stock falls back to it's equilibrium valuation, and the bagholders have to wait years for the valuation catch up to their entry price. On the other hand, if the price action is driven by shorts, the spring gets loaded and most of the time there will be another spike"".

This may be semantics, but since the price dropped another 11% since the first post a month ago and has been hovering around there , it does seem to fit into your definition here. I'm not gonna go into the long/short squeeze price action because in most cases that's literally just people attempting to convince themselves (and others) that they're not holding the bag.

Making a statement alone saying ""you're bagholding"" would be ludicrous, but I've come with the data to back up my point since it doesn't looks like your recommendations are panning out too well. Given how much you've pushed back, I'm willing to give you the benefit of the doubt  but to say I'm making baseless accusations is a bit of a stretch."

2021-04-24 12:00:16,wallstreetbets,Great point! Now you have me feeling guilty for buying options instead of shares
2021-04-24 13:41:54,wallstreetbets,"What do you mean ""optimize for outcomes?"" That's all great and well for non-medical professionals, but it's a lot of hand waving and euphemisms at the end of the day. 

At the core of health insurance game is: insurers generate revenue by taking premium from policy holders. In the case of medicare advantage insurance providers, they also get a capitated payment (lump sum per person) from the govt. 

from that pool, they then have to turn a profit by spending less on paying for the medical services that policy holders undergo. There is nothing in their shitty app or ""technology"" that prevents people from getting sick. For that matter, no other insurance company has discovered that magic bullet either, because it's a medical/science issue, not a business or programming issue. 

Successful insurance providers do this by risk pooling, controlling costs/negotiating reimbursement rates, and denying services.

Traditional insurers have a huge moat because they:

1) risk pool millions of policy holders, essentially stealing premium from heathy people to pay for sick people's care. The heathy people are net positive revenue, the sick people are net-negative revenue. 

2) negotiating down payments to hospitals and providers. When you have millions of policy-holders you can pay a hospital 900 versus 1000 dollars for an admission or whatever. 

3) negotiating down the cost of medicines with pharmaceutical companies. Same principle applies.

4) Denying services by making it fucking impossible for people to get the care they need. Taking a cue from HMOs, you can require policy holders to only see doctors in your network or make them get crazy/onerous pre-approvals or referrals before you agree to pay for an expensive service like scans or surgeries.

All of these tactics require economies of scale - ie millions of policy holders. Clover has less than 100,000. It's got a shitload of hurdles:

1) cost of acquiring many many many more policy holders.

2) negotiating reimbursement with hospitals and providers. As of recently, they were actually paying doctors to use their app/ be part of their network. Good tactic but ultimately unsustainable and potentially illegal/unethical to use inducements to influence physician decision making. 

3) Creating a network of physicians your policy holders actually want to see. Unfortunately there is an alarming increase in providers who just wont see medicare patients, let alone jump through to the ridiculous added circus hoop of an app from Clover. At the end of the day, if you've only got one or two shitty specialist doctors in your network that take months to see, you're gonna get dropped by customers pretty quick.

The existing insurers have HUGE MOATS. Even regular medicare from the government has a huge moat because it defacto covers all americans over 65. So like 60-100m people and its revenue is guaranteed by the tax payers and its ability to negotiate is essentially completely one sided and enforced by law. Doctors and hospitals take what medicare gives or they don't and that's that. 

So, no offense to OP or any of the other believers, but being an insider in healthcare, this company does not have solid fundamentals in any way. Their apps and code are not the hammer that are gonna solve the essential problems of preventing people from using medica services.

Anyhoo, short term this may be a good momentum/meme play, but long term this company is gabrage. I'm going to open up long dated put and bear spreads on this shitspac as soon as FAANG earnings report and I can free up more capital."

2021-04-24 18:52:49,wallstreetbets,"I respect and appreciate this but I believe being an insider in the healthcare industry makes you completely biased towards the disruptive innovation clover health brings - are any other companies trying to disrupt Medicare in the same way as clover?  

I believe the Market cares more about what a company Can do, as long as they are doing it, rather than the hurdles they have to face to get there (obviously in a case like Nikola, the hurdle was just having any product at all..  but clover actually has a product and is disrupting the whole space they are in) 

it’s definitely not garbage long term if they can do more with the software side of the company, and as long as they are growing that’s all that matters to investors - are they not growing?  They are.  Investors want growth.  

And under Biden there’s a lot of growth for a health insurance company like clover that wants to bring disruptive innovation to a really honestly old and extremely outdated system

It’s both a deep value and growth play IMO, but ok open up puts and a bear spread, makes you just sound like the system you currently are familiar with has made you jaded.  Maybe clover would fix that in the future."

Just laying out my opinion for whoever cares to discuss. Confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance always makes it painful to hear dissenting opinions."
2021-04-24 19:13:50,wallstreetbets,"To accuse me of bias while not refuting any of the specific points I made is a little disingenuous. However, I'll let that slide for what it is and actually answer your one legitimate question: are there any other disruptors? Yes, CVS and United Health Care have actually partnered with private equity backed firms like Bouy - a medtech/AI company - to streamline and guide patient decision making to seek the appropriate level of care. This company is essentially making an AI driven chat bot to help patients determine if a cold symptom = ER visit, urgent care visit, or doctors office visit, etc. Helping patients pick the appropriate level of care goes towards my point of denying/reducing payments and reducing policyholder resource utilization. 

So that said, can you pinpoint exactly what Clover does that is disruptive or innovative? FYI - an insurance company trying to improve patient health outcomes is nothing new. That's what the Kaiser/HMO model is. For 40+ years, they been trying to improve outcomes and coincidentally it makes their healthcare services relatively decent at reducing costs.

Also your comment about growth: the Market Cap of Clover is 3-4B for 100,000 customers at most. I don't think one customer is paying even close to 40,000 in premiums a year. The average cost of medicare advantage premiums is about 6-7k a year. Let's be generous, call it 8k. Even with forward looking view, I don't see these guys are worth 5x their current revenue not withstanding a generous overlooking of their actual cost of business operations and costs of acquiring growth, which I addressed before. Furthermore, the major healthcare insurers currently own about 90% of the medicare advantage market, which isnt even the most lucrative market as old people tend to have less disposable income/employer sponsored health insurance, and have relatively far greater health resource utilization. Finally, you could say these guys are disruptive like Tesla and fighting for market share with a cool, new, innovative product, but at the end of the day they aren't. Grandpa just wants to pay his premiums and go see his doctor about his enlarging prostate or get his skin cancer whacked off. 

So, if you are going to accuse me of bias because of my specialized knowledge of an industry, please feel free to refute these individual points with logical and specific points. 🔥🔥🔥"

2021-04-24 15:49:57,wallstreetbets,"How many shares are there really???

I keep thinking about this. 
If we hold 88% of the free float then that is approximately 380 million. 
Now I know our community is pretty big. 
Say there’s 5 million people worldwide holding amc stocks that would average approximately 75 shares a piece. 
Now I know that isn’t the true amount but just wanted to give some prospective. 
I personally have 300 shares and I know that isn’t a lot. There’s people who have a few thousand and some with less than 100. 
But still you have more and more institutional investors buying all the time. 
There’s no way that the hedge funds have as many stocks as they keep shorting. 
This is going to come to a point where it literally blows up. 
So my fellow Apes keep holding and buying when you can. Even if it’s 1 share at a time. 
We will change the how trading is done forever."

Was.
Awesome.

Totally awesome way to start the weekend!

Loved the Easter eggs—-Musk and dogue at the end——great ending to the sequence.

I also liked that there’s no overt violence—-like you could’ve gone with exploding the Melvin/Shitadel building to smithereens and killing Vlad in the blast (love his title, btw!)—-but instead depicted that we’re not out there to hurt anyone...we just want to have an awesome ride on our way to the moon.

Great job, and finally, regarding your “embarrassing” time it took to make—-I don’t think Coppola, Scorsese or Spielberg would call their production times “embarrassingly long”."

2021-04-24 09:08:19,wallstreetbets,"Posts get deleted, but has anyone started observing potential GME competitors’ stock prices? It honestly looks like this chart is 20 years in the making, and other big box chains have been artificially dropping prices by naked shorting, and inflating their own with the proceeds. 

Please see Archegos, and how they have stake in Amazon, Facebook, and Netflix. Who’s to say Best Buy and others haven’t started these hedge funds to tank their competitors? Would explain why the Dow seems to have gone stupid high since derivatives trading started. Companies can literally print free money, AND THEN INVEST IT RIGHT BACK INTO THEIR OWN CORPORATION. They are also the only ones confident and motivated enough to short a stock right to 0"

2021-04-24 07:02:27,wallstreetbets," 

After a long days work of beating up bad guys, SpiderMa’am visits her boyfriend, Marty James, for some nice relaxing evening of cunnilingus.

She pulls her costume pants down (while leaving on everything else including the mask) and Marty James gets straight to work.

She like 'oooh, ohhh yeah, that hits the spot' when she notices two sets of slurping noises. She looks down and see's the Cock Goblin sucking Marty James' cock!

She's like 'The Cock Goblin! My mortal enemy!'.

Cock Goblin: 'That's right SpiderMa’am , and this cock is MINE'.

And the CockGoblin shoots SpiderMa’am's hands with this glue stuff that glues her hands to the couch so she can't move. Then takes Marty James onto her hoverboard thing. 'I'd love to stay SpiderMa’am but it looks you're a little stuck at the moment!'

And SpiderMa’am says 'it's ok, I'm just experiencing some vaginal DISCHARGE' and SpiderMa’am shoots spider web from her vagina, tying up Cock Golbin and releasing Marty James.

Cock Goblin: 'Dam you SpiderMa’am. I'll get Marty's cock one day!'.

Spiderwoman is like 'Did it ever occur to you that maybe...just maybe...if you found your own cocks, you wouldn't have to STEAL other women's cocks?'"

2021-04-24 03:25:14,wallstreetbets,Maybe a reference to the flying volga in the movie black lightning. Turns a poor kid into a hero. Oh and it flies.

“WE SET THE PRICE. 10 million is not a meme! Do not sell! The margin calls are coming soon!!” 

Like Jesus Christ shut the fuck upppppppp it’s a cult now. GameStop is not the first or last stock to make these types of gains. It happens every year."

2021-04-24 08:30:44,wallstreetbets,"It has a free version, yes. But it's a tool mostly used by industrial designers. People who design machines and robots for example.

Blender, 3Dsmax (Autodesk) , Maya and Cinema4D are a few examples of 3D software packages that is used by people in the movie and game industry.

Blender is the one which is free in all cases, no mather what you do with it. This is leading people to think that it's the reason why it's not as good as the others. Well.., that indeed used to be. But the gap of missing fearures campared to the others is getting smaller with every update.

Ubisoft even announced that their team who is responsible for the CG trailers has switched to Blender. Just to give one example."

Later when i switched to game design we had to install a student version from both 3DsMax and Maya. After only a few weeks the teachers made us switch to Blender for a couple of reasons.
 
- Graduated students complained that it became very difficult if they started for themselves after graduating. To keep things legal they taught Blender to themselves. I mean, it's only to make models which are being exported to an engine. Nothing of that is worth the price of $2000.

- Apple users could not even install the software unless they used a windows bootcamp.

- The heads of the college complained how expensive the game design study had become for the college and even changed the 4 year study into 3 years as a form of an austerity measure."

2021-04-23 23:58:43,wallstreetbets,"For example Quoting article below for Jan 2020. 

Exxon holds interests in about a third of the world’s CCS capacity and captured 6.9 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide for sequestration – the process of separating the gas from the atmosphere – in 2015.

In 2019, it announced plans to develop carbon capture fuel cell technology, which produces power and captures and concentrates CO2 for storage – resulting in potential cost reductions.

Article is pretty dated, but as other companies pay out to third parties to offset their co2 XOM will be making the money

Exxon signaling that they plan to develop its carbon capture tech, and they want the US Federal Govt to pay for it. They will try to do business as usual until they die. Based on the culture that I’ve seen at that company, I would not expect them to be a major player in renewables."

Also go learn some basics before buying any options.

2021-04-23 22:01:35,wallstreetbets,You DO NOT try to learn on TSLA. Those are expensive lessons. And Tesla is so volatile and wonky. It will just make you more confused. Watch some YouTube videos or check out investopia to start learning and understanding options before you dive right in. If you just end up following other peoples plays without understanding what they’re doing you will be in for a rude awakening
2021-04-24 04:04:13,wallstreetbets,Start learning with puts ; if you read “call” on wsb buy “put” as a general rule of thumb

2021-04-23 20:50:14,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-23 21:01:39,wallstreetbets,You can sell them at anytime. I picked some really high strike price so that the leverage is higher. The money printer will go brrrrrr 🤑
2021-04-23 21:18:03,wallstreetbets,"People can play this multiple ways. 
I think usually your premium is gone when you buy the option. You can wait for it to expire in the money but a better way is to cash it out long before. If you buy a call way above the current price it will be cheap. If the price gets closer it will go up in value. So if it goes up you can make money by just selling. 

You just have to have it go up quickly. Every day the value of the call goes down in value, eventually to zero  if you are out of the money. 

Many professional traders never wait until expiration."
2021-04-24 12:16:39,wallstreetbets,"You’ve already paid the premium. 
A long call is Delta positive (worth more when stock moves up), theta negative (worth less as time passes), and Vega positive (worth more as implied volatility of the option increases.. which typically happens when the underlying price is moving, particularly moving quickly, higher toward or above the strike price).  So when you buy a call option, you are hoping that the underlying moves up, that the option’s IV increases, and that it does these two things quickly (in less time)."
2021-04-23 21:05:18,wallstreetbets,"Playing with strikes way over the underlying price is like playing catch with a hand grenade with the pin already pulled.  It will explode at some point and you are hoping there is another fool than will buy those calls from you.

To break even at expiration you have to be at the strike plus the premium you spent on the call. So a $880C probably needs to be mid $900s to break even.

Spend more and getting fewer options. A Sept $750 to maybe $800 seems reasonable and would still pay well. 

He is down about half on most those calls."
2021-04-23 22:09:00,wallstreetbets,"Why is it though? Is there any reason not to let it expire worthless other than ""saving"" a bit of the premium ? I mean all I see is you're quitting your bet."
2021-04-24 15:44:42,wallstreetbets,That is exactly what this fellow ape 🦍 (me) is doing.
2021-04-24 07:03:36,wallstreetbets,"Buy call on $STOCK (stock is currently $100), 

you paid $0.50 ($50) for call

STOCK goes up to $150

You sell call for more than what you bought it for = profit

If STOCK goes down to $90, your call will sell for less than what you bought it for (example: $0.40 instead of $0.50)

This is as super simple as I can make it without going into greater detail

Ready to Yolo?"
2021-04-24 07:32:07,wallstreetbets,"Thanks but I was wondering about the logic. If the stock goes to 90$ in your example and you close your bet for  0.40$, isn't that some basic paper ✋ right there ? I'd guess there is a link with theta decay for this to make some sense."
2021-04-24 08:56:57,wallstreetbets,"Difference is your investment versus the possible returns. 

I know a guy that only scalps the SPY. He will buy up to 100 calls ITM for $2 ($200) each when he sees it start to build momentum. Now this is expensive at about $20,000. If SPY move up $0.50 the strike will go up about $0.40. —it normally moves about $4-5 a day. 
So now the calls are worth $2.40 and he has made $4,000k in about 2 minutes on 20k. 

If he would have done the same with stocks on the SPY he would have needed $400/share * 100 contracts * 100 shares per contract or $4,000,000 to make that trade. Instead he only need $20k."
2021-04-24 08:40:47,wallstreetbets,"Essentially yes. You can sell at a loss or choose to hold in hopes the stock goes back up, in which your contract value goes up too. I learned a lot about options from watching ***In The Money*** a YouTube channel that does simple options breakdowns on Robinhood."
2021-04-24 10:08:23,wallstreetbets,This sure explains why using options instead of stocks. Your example made me realize one thing though: that's why the call it rolling your options. You keep pushing it until it hits your strike so it actually isn't a paper ✋ trade.
2021-04-24 10:57:09,wallstreetbets,"Sure but you can still be in trouble if it moves far away from you. You can end up just pushing your strike back week after week, tying up your money that could be better used making money somewhere else. 

Personally, this is why I have started selling cash secure puts on stocks I don’t mind owning. That way I actually make money if they never hit the price. Plus if they hit and I end up owning the stock I can sell a covered call. —basically this is called the Wheel strategy."

2021-04-23 21:51:56,wallstreetbets,"A call is a contract to purchase stock at a price set by the contract writer. You purchase that contract with the hopes that the stock will increase to a level beyond the amount set in your contract.

You buy a contract for $1000 to buy 100 shares of Stock X @100 in one week(Friday expiration day on all calls). 

Stock X is currently trading at $50

Friday at close comes and you’re shitting your ape pants because the stock price soared to $150. You now exercise your call and purchase 100 shares at the contracted amount of $100. The current stock price being at $150 means you just purchased $15,000 worth of Stock X for $10,000.

Alternatively, if you don’t have the cash on hand to purchase the shares, you can then sell that contract back to the MM for realized gains instead of taking ownership of stock X.

I explained it in the simplest way that I understand it. I can’t purchase call in my account but I have been utilizing Covered Calls a lot."
2021-04-23 22:08:20,wallstreetbets,"Long a call - right to buy

Long a put - right to sell

Short a put - obligation to buy

Short a call - obligation to sell"
2021-04-24 10:17:55,wallstreetbets,So does OP.
2021-04-24 17:05:49,wallstreetbets,"Options are simple. Basically if you believe the price will change dramatically up or down soon: buy options. If you wanna own a piece of the company for the long haul, buy stocks. Options can make or break you and are a gamble. Buying stocks is more of an investment. Now that you know WHY you would buy an option, study HOW to buy options."

And that’s only one vertical of many."

During the January run of GameStop, I was buying $40, $60, $150, $200 OTM weekly calls that were true FDs, mostly when they were first offered.

2021-04-23 20:23:10,wallstreetbets,"A buyout could happen any day. It's not a horrible play. Maybe the amount of calls is questionable, but the CEO has confirmed they're in discussions with *multiple* tier one OEMs and this company should sell for more than $6.5B or ~$35 PPS."

2021-04-24 02:14:03,wallstreetbets,"When you say realized gains... you mean $150today price - $100contract price ?


Why is it realized gain  even though the Contract was not employed to buy actual stock"
2021-04-24 19:30:07,wallstreetbets,Stock X is US steel an excellent choice I would buy that contract
2021-04-23 23:05:27,wallstreetbets,"Hey thanks for the explanation, bear with me my brain is smooth and I’m still trying to figure all this out...
Didn’t you actually purchase 15k for 11k since the contract costs 1k?

Also what I don’t get is if you had just purchased the 5k @50 when it goes to 150 you have 15k - so by purchasing shares instead of calls you made 10k instead of four.  What am I missing here?

Do the ratios change or something the further away the call price is?  Thanks 🙏🏽"
2021-04-24 08:38:29,wallstreetbets,"I see, thanks for the explanations."
2021-04-23 20:18:02,wallstreetbets,Just helping you out - an FD is a weekly. You’re bound to be told 1k times tonight. Lol

2021-04-23 20:07:40,wallstreetbets,"I'm glad it came back, it was up around the 40% mark along with MVIS today."

2021-04-24 15:05:03,wallstreetbets,Yeah I lost 300 in that and I sold them all as soon as I saw the offerings news
2021-04-23 21:26:55,wallstreetbets,They're just trying to make some monies
2021-04-24 01:47:55,wallstreetbets,"Fair, I love the stories I have heard of GME doing for people."
2021-04-24 07:49:43,wallstreetbets,And I guess now you want to loose it on the MVIS dump that is in the works and that is why many people are promoting it?
2021-04-23 22:56:39,wallstreetbets,"Remember iborrow only shows Interactive Brokers data, and not all brokerages."
2021-04-24 17:24:04,wallstreetbets,Smart - we're in it to make money after all. Good luck!
2021-04-23 22:14:42,wallstreetbets,Your contract is worthless. You loose the entire amount you spent picking it up. Or if you see the writing on the wall you can try to sell a call to close prior to the expiration to recoup some of your investment. But you still lost money.
2021-04-24 10:11:28,wallstreetbets,"Because the contract itself become more valuable depending on what the stock price does. If a call strike price is above the stock price that is called being out of the money(OTM) if it is at the stock price that’s being at the money(ATM) and if it’s under the stock price it’s in the money (ITM). This is reversed for put contracts. 

A call contract gains value the closer it is for being ITM and the deeper ITM it goes as the stock value rises. So if you bought one at a certain point in time and the value of the stock rose, you contract is now worth more and if you sell it instead of exercising you have now made a profit of that and it is now realized gains."
2021-04-23 23:55:20,wallstreetbets,"So let’s say that when he set up the contract the set price of the stock is $10, and since you have to ""purchase” 100 shares per contract, so 1 contract of 100 shares @$10 =$1000, if he had purchase 2 contracts $2000 down for 200 shares @$10. Now there is a expiration on the contract so the stonk has to go up🚀so lets say the stonk goes to $50 3 weeks  before expiration date my ape brother will be sitting at $5000 worth of stock, but since stonks only go up and a day before expiration the price is $100 he will exercise and take home $10000."
2021-04-24 02:11:41,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, you are correct about the cost basis. The profit in that scenario is $4k on a $1k initial investment. If you bought shares, you'd have to spend more money up front to make comparable gains. if you only had $1000 to start out with, calls would have a higher return"
2021-04-23 20:20:27,wallstreetbets,They need to open weeklies on this stock and I'll delightfully oblige.
2021-04-23 21:09:50,wallstreetbets,"Your source doesn't, though..."
2021-04-24 00:06:41,wallstreetbets,"There’s no universe in which the ceo accepts a buyout offer for less than 35$ a share, that’s ludicrously low and he knows the shareholders would not approve that amount."
2021-04-23 21:50:18,wallstreetbets,10B or $60 buyout minimum imo
2021-04-24 14:29:42,wallstreetbets,Link to what?
2021-04-24 00:10:47,wallstreetbets,Buying at the top works that way.
2021-04-24 12:52:00,wallstreetbets,Just because it's being talked about and isn't GME doesn't mean it's a PD.
2021-04-23 23:16:43,wallstreetbets,Ahh thank you for the reminder. I did forget.
2021-04-24 10:19:11,wallstreetbets,Does anyone provide an aggregate?
2021-04-24 18:37:26,wallstreetbets,Thanks man you as well
2021-04-23 22:18:40,wallstreetbets,So in this case you would be out ten grand?
2021-04-23 23:10:50,wallstreetbets,Just because it didnt hit your strike price doesn’t mean the contract is worthless. And I believe the majority of contracts aren’t exercised
2021-04-24 06:30:02,wallstreetbets,"Got it, thanks!"
2021-04-23 20:21:37,wallstreetbets,FDs aren’t necessarily a good thing - definitely read the post. I’m saying you just wouldn’t *say* it’s an FD. You’d just say *calls* in this case.
2021-04-24 07:54:15,wallstreetbets,"Did you read it correctly? It definitely stands for an F word, but not THE f word, which the author states..."
2021-04-24 08:59:48,wallstreetbets,Based on?
2021-04-23 22:24:10,wallstreetbets,"You would be out $1,000 as that was the price you paid for the contract. Which is now worthless in this scenario."
2021-04-23 23:42:08,wallstreetbets,"If your option expires out of the money it is worth exactly $0. It’s completely worthless, hell after expiration it doesn’t even exist."
2021-04-24 10:15:52,wallstreetbets,Tell that to my AAL puts that I ended up dumping for $1 because the stock went up even though they announced losses on earnings.  Options can put you in the palace or the poorhouse at the blink of an eye and that fact should be heavily emphasized.
2021-04-24 03:33:23,wallstreetbets,really tho i came lookin for the 120k in 0dte shit what is this a belmont casino all fancy an planed out...

2021-04-24 12:51:50,wallstreetbets,"There’s tons of DD about it. If we are producing the best Lidar the world has ever seen or will see for years, in addition to the various other verticals and hundreds of technology patents, we are going to get an offer for at least what inferior Lidar companies market cap is. Whoever owns M4vis is going to have the leading edge best in class product for autonomous vehicles for the next few years at least, and that sector is about to explode"
2021-04-24 12:00:34,wallstreetbets,You might be able to get $10-$50 still close to expiration.  Enough for some tendies and a handjob by the dumpster at a Wendy's.
2021-04-24 14:29:06,wallstreetbets,"Most will buy a call for a premium and if they 2-3 bag it they sell it back on the market.  U spent 1000 and sold the contract back for 3000.  Never touched a stock.

Edit: I’m really really stupid.  I should clarify that I have no idea what I’m talking about."
2021-04-24 01:39:11,wallstreetbets,No fucking shit. The dudes question was “what if the stock price doesn’t hit 100”. That doesn’t make your contract worthless.
2021-04-24 13:55:24,wallstreetbets,The fact it’s a race against time and if your outlook changes on your bet you just have to hope to find someone to unload it before it’s worthless.
2021-04-24 07:55:13,wallstreetbets,There's a casino in Belmont? Which Belmont?
2021-04-24 11:23:59,wallstreetbets,What do you think it stands for?
2021-04-24 08:19:27,wallstreetbets,"And it was within the context of expiration based on the previous post. 

Of course OTM contracts have a value attached to them, how the fuck else did you pay money to buy it?"
2021-04-24 14:16:47,wallstreetbets,Ask the retard the asked the question that. Just because its obvious to us doesn’t mean its obvious to them. Its alittle misleading implying we buy these contracts to exercise them at expiration.
2021-04-24 15:18:43,wallstreetbets,"The “retard” that asked only asked what happens if the strike price isn’t hit at expiration. You’re the one that hopped in saying they still have value because you can’t follow the context of a conversation. 

No one in this comment thread said anything about exercising options as being mandatory, so I have no clue where you’re picking up that “misleading” information. The person that you originally replied to literally stated that you don’t have to exercise the options. Basically you’ve added nothing to the conversation and for some reason are trying to call other people stupid when your the one that can’t follow a conversation and are trying to clarify things that have never been said."
2021-04-24 17:56:12,wallstreetbets,"They didnt say AT expiration did they. All they said was “if the stock price doesnt hit 100”.  And I was trying to imply, don’t take advice from another retard about options who doesn’t even trade them. You don’t need to be so angry."
2021-04-24 18:23:17,wallstreetbets,"Again, learn to read the context of a conversation. Pretty obvious to everyone but you that the question was directly in relation to the post above it talking about the value of a contract at expiration when it’s in the money.

Weird that you’d try to imply that being that no one was giving advise, they were only explaining the mechanics of options. Nevermind the fact that the guy explaining it in the first place literally said they trade options."
2021-04-24 19:07:37,wallstreetbets,"Really, the guy that said “im not approved for buying options”. He said he sells CC’s on stock he owns. Kinda different than being a contract buyer. And no it obviously wasn’t obvious. Explaining what it means to exercise options is more advanced than knowing the basics of option pricing. And IMO pretty pointless when someone is learning about options trading in the beginning. Saying a contract is worthless because it didnt hit the strike is different than saying a contract is worthless at expiration when OTM"

2021-04-23 22:24:12,wallstreetbets,"yes in the short term at least. With the early earnings call on April 29, and buyout rumours, there’s a lot of upside still!"
2021-04-24 09:12:12,wallstreetbets,I think the new bottom will be 22-24 if any positive news breaks this week. + News is possible. CEO says April lidar demo and hasn’t updated yet and this is the first ER since the 21B Microsoft/Army contract. Maybe he’ll drop a hint about either of the two topics. If you look at the chart highs seem to become the new lows all the way back since the $1-2 ranges. 9 was the last high and became the bottom. So 24 should be the new low right? Idk I’m dumb. LAZR (lidar ONLY company) is 20 moneys. Mvis at 18 moneys with lidar and pico/mems tech (AR smart glasses tech). So 24 plus moneys sounds like retarded math to me.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Will HUYA print tendies? HUYA has been popping up on WSB over the past few months and I haven't seen a complete or compelling DD yet. This is my excuse to dodge parenthood & stuff so I better make it a long one.

1. Fundamentals: Check out the following excerpt from Y Charts.

https://preview.redd.it/547fpac260v61.png?width=1517&format=png&auto=webp&s=0cd1f5786cc903cc5ce10560f963459f7e73c0c9

I generally use PS Ratio for growth tech stocks. Definition: PS Ratio = Price / Revenue Per Share (Note: YCharts uses the Trailing Twelve Months (TTM) Revenue Per Share in the denominator). Most growth tech companies are as low as 10 on the low side up to 30. Generally I try to catch companies I'm bullish on around 10; 2.7 is stupid low. This is the biggest streaming company in China and is avidly sought after by Tencent. Massive market and massive growth industry. Their PS is crazy low. The Price to Book Value is also fucking awesome for a growth tech company. Value investors look for companies less than 3 and this fits that parameter. This company is also jacked to the gills with cash. Check out their balance sheet. As of Q4 2020 their total assets are 12.4B and their total liabilities are 2.6B. They have 3.2B in pure cash. Year over year this company is putting out blow out numbers but their Q4 contracted a bit vs their Q3 of last year. But seriously: 3.2B in cash and the market cap is just over 4B. What kind of absurd mismatch is this especially when it is a money printing business too.

2) Technical/Price-Action/Analyst stuff:

https://preview.redd.it/fd1rs2zc80v61.png?width=2084&format=png&auto=webp&s=282dd7d2b5b9fa97c54d1e208b0ea8408c560c08

6 Analysts projections: upper-bound is $29 and the median price target is $25.66. The stock jumped today a bit on news that the stock just got a buy rating: HUYA shares are trading higher after 86 Research upgraded the stock from Hold to Buy and announced a price target of $22 per share. We all know analysts are a bunch of pencil pushing idiots so take that with a grain of salt. Currently the price is $18.5 AH and it hasn't traded this low since July of 2020. The price was north of $35 as recent as a couple months ago. It has been consolidating at the $18 level waiting for news which brings us to the meat and potatoes of this post.

3: Proposed merger and Arbitrage strategy: The two biggest streaming companies in China are HUYA and DOYU. The King Maker aka Tencent is trying to merge these companies as they will dominate and have 80% market share if the merger is successful. Tencent has a major stake in both companies and a huge vested interest strategically as they are a video game company (among other things) and this would have vertical integration characteristics. If the merger goes through each DOYU share will be converted to .75 HUYA shares. The arbitrage strategy here is going long shares on DOYU and people shorting the hell out of HUYA. The amount of short interest on HUYA shows that the market is confident the merger will go through. If it DOESN'T go through then HUYA will no longer be shorted and the stock will sky rocket. If the merger DOES go through then you'll have a stake in the biggest streaming company in the biggest streaming market on planet earth.

4) Headwinds: China used BABA to send a message to monopolistic behavior. This was great news for the HUYA/DOYU merger because the uncertainty surrounding Beijeng's agenda was lifted a bit. Major companies, including Tencent, came out publicly to say they will make concessions where necessary. I expect this will hasten the negotiations between Tencent and Beijeng to get this through. The current time table for this merger to happen is the first half of 2021, which we are well on our way to the 2nd half. It is possible for this to happen in the 2nd half if negotiations stall. The other slight headwind is that DOYU is embroiled in some online gambling concerns but this is completely short run shit that gives me a better discount.

5) Institutional ownership: 52.4% of outstanding shares are owned by institutions. The two biggest players are ARK and Morgan Stanley. Fintel shows Morgan Stanley increasing their HUYA stake by 169% in the most recent filing to 22,095,743 shares (32% of the comany). Ark has the next most with 11,600,993 shares for 13.99%.

https://preview.redd.it/oba7mkdff0v61.png?width=1495&format=png&auto=webp&s=d4f7d12c4b41a9fb120152c75d58360a23ef1af3

6) Short Interest: Check the massive SI on this ticker.

https://preview.redd.it/il8yghtuf0v61.png?width=1365&format=png&auto=webp&s=87cb84ae2a02fbc539db22278e83f03293229f14

34.4% of the float is shorted and 52.4% of the outstanding shares are owned by institutions. That leaves a fairly small left-over float size to publicly trade.

Mama CWood loves the stock. Massive institutional ownership with Morgan Stanley just making a huge investment. Pending merger. Artificially suppressed aka arbitrage short. I LIKE THE STOCK. I am playing the HUYA side with long calls and shares. It is a win win if the merger does or does not go through.

Edit: I just bought 1500 shares so you fuckers don't beat me to it like everything else

2021-04-23 20:19:47,wallstreetbets,Tencent has a ton of connections to the CCP. This merger WILL go through. The revisions “requested” for the merger are an elaborate display for the West more than anything. Monopoly can never truly be an actual monopoly with Winnie the Pooh’s all encompassing presence. I’m bullish with PT of 30 by July.
2021-04-23 20:06:13,wallstreetbets,Where's the proof of your shares? This seems suspicious.

2021-04-24 19:30:27,wallstreetbets,The MS 13G is likely a SWAP position.
2021-04-23 20:20:58,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I've been thinking about going long on DOYU too but haven't pulled the trigger yet. Esp b/c .75 share and this HUYA resistance at 18 is strong. DOYU should rise to be 18\*.75 at least

2021-04-24 09:12:30,wallstreetbets,Can you link me or post what you found? My understanding is it’s just short selling plus high institutional ownership. It’s part of the arbitrage strategy. The other component is how slowly the data gets updated on brokerages
2021-04-24 13:41:16,wallstreetbets,Yea dude. I’m super stoked about it. Seems like the best opportunity around

2021-04-24 11:11:44,wallstreetbets,"Yea I use TD too and saw this. From my research it is just a factor of intense shorting, lots of institutional ownership, and then a lot of change in institutional ownership vs when brokerages update those numbers which is periodically rather than live. Check out Fintel for HUYA institutional ownership"
2021-04-24 11:43:48,wallstreetbets,I’m going to create a second post today and get into the numbers. Great questions. This looks crazy. Only just over 80 million shares are available for the public to trade. That’s why institutions owning just over 100 million makes it around 120% of float owned my institutions. 34.4 % of the 80 million is shorted. I really don’t even know how much is left over outside of institutional ownership. This is going to be interesting

What do you make of the "" MindMed Announces Filing of Preliminary Base Shelf Prospectus and F-10 with the SEC under MJDS PR Newswire"" ?

Ref: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mindmed-announces-filing-preliminary-shelf-213200818.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mindmed-announces-filing-preliminary-shelf-213200818.html)

One can read in the article: ""The Base Shelf Prospectus and Registration Statement, when made final or effective, will permit the Company to offer and sell subordinate voting shares, multiple voting shares, warrants, subscription receipts, units or any combination thereof (""Securities"") **in various offerings having an aggregate value of up to CAD$500 million during the 25-month period that the Base Shelf Prospectus remains effective.""**

Market Cap of MMED is today: **$3.18M** with a Public Float of **194.89M**

**Does the CAD$500 million planned offering, mean a 10x increase of the number of shares in the next 25 months?**

I am a newbie with all this financial lingo...

2021-04-24 15:55:19,wallstreetbets,"If you understood what the psychedelic movement is about, you’d realize that there shouldn’t be any medical or recreational labels as all the companies have 1 thing in common; therapeutic uses for mental health. Instead of creating synthetic molecules they chose to go with natural products. This has allowed them to start sales (very very small scale at the moment) and to begin building infrastructure (production, distribution, etc) while others are choosing to burn millions on research.

Neither is right or wrong, just a different approach.

The company is supporting and creating a microdosing lifestyle which doesn’t fit the “recreational” label so many choose to use. They promote microdosing which more closely resembles a medical approach (taking small amounts here and there to achieve a therapeutic effect, not to hallucinate and get messed up)"

Meanwhile, AMC has to earn $100m week in PROFIT just to break even. The entire domestic box office was $25m revenue. Which is what maybe $15-20m in profit to AMC if you assume they are the largest player and assume everyone loaded up on 2x concessions? 

AMC is burning through cash it borrowed at 10%+ interest at an alarming rate. It doesn't take a genius to do the math on this one."

2021-04-24 02:27:44,wallstreetbets,"Hard to say after a massive run up like we just saw. Depends how convinced you are the Conference call next week is going to bring good news about their sample A. 

Not financial advice, but I’m personally feeling pretty good about next week which is why I went in so heavy. I’m hoping the test result confirmed MVIS lidar is best in class and that we see the market cap at least match the current lidar market lead. Which would conservatively put MVIS around $30 pps. 

Good luck!"

2021-04-23 21:40:56,wallstreetbets,Lmao ... I know. I’m switching to a real brokerage after this.
2021-04-24 15:07:37,wallstreetbets,What International broker do you recomend?
2021-04-23 20:45:54,wallstreetbets,If you like the stock keep at it. Sold all my GME positions in February and yolod into this.

2021-04-24 15:09:15,wallstreetbets,But it’s fine for your trade volume? I hear bad things about Robinhood
2021-04-24 11:38:49,wallstreetbets,"Depends. Might consider even holding through a buyout for tax purposes. Some buyouts pay with stock instead of cash. For example if Google acquired MVIS let’s say there’s a conversion of 10 MVIS shares to 1 Google share. 

If I understand correctly the conversion is not a taxable event so I could then just continue holding the Google shares (a lot less volatile) for a year and sell for capital gains tax instead of income tax."
2021-04-24 10:11:19,wallstreetbets,I meant I’m waiting for the buyout

2021-04-24 14:35:25,wallstreetbets,The question is how long can this anticipation/speculation be drawn out.
2021-04-24 12:54:23,wallstreetbets,Exactly squeeze has not happened. Imo we will first see gamma squeezs THEN the short squeeze
2021-04-24 12:53:15,wallstreetbets,And FRIDAY
2021-04-24 13:02:36,wallstreetbets,I was in the same boat but just decided to go in. I dont want to miss this ship. Might by more on Monday depending on some more good DD here.
2021-04-24 14:42:12,wallstreetbets,"As much as I would love to see 70% gains every week we know it just doesn’t work like that, at least not with how the market has been recently. Be objective not emotional."
2021-04-24 12:09:21,wallstreetbets,"Also... my post history doesn’t say I didn’t NOT take gains either. I sold during the first squeeze. After GME I paid off 60k in debt, bought a few toys, and reinvested the rest."
2021-04-24 11:29:03,wallstreetbets,Wait... You’re actually making money?
2021-04-24 15:13:32,wallstreetbets,"Valid point. I am actually planning to move to something bigger like fidelity after this. During peak GME RH had some liquidity issues but so did many other brokerages. It did screw me over a little. Once my MVIS play is over I’ll probably switch.

The one draw back is the UI/UX on all the other brokerages sucks compared to RH."
2021-04-23 21:56:46,wallstreetbets,"I’m well aware of what can happen. You’re preaching to the choir. I got fucked during GME...

2021-04-24 00:28:18,wallstreetbets,"Also it really doesn’t matter at all if a brokerage restricted the speed at which we could buy or sell, because once the BO/SP is announced the share price won’t dip below that number for weeks at least, probably months"
2021-04-24 17:14:46,wallstreetbets,Holy shit man that had to have been rough...
2021-04-24 12:37:06,wallstreetbets,"GME was at like $70/share at the time of these post bro. The squeeze up to $450 was a few days later. I sold half at around $300 and let the rest ride. Ended up closing the rest of my position when it crash back down in the 100s.

2021-04-24 11:49:32,wallstreetbets,Not to mention. Damn near ever home sold this year is overvalued. Something has to give .
2021-04-24 11:50:16,wallstreetbets,I'm going to assume most are just using it to their advantage imo. Once payments resume you will see a majority of the Americans that have been delaying start back up their payments
2021-04-24 11:52:21,wallstreetbets,"Hey I hear you, thats why my funds are safu on the RKT ;)"
2021-04-24 11:53:08,wallstreetbets,So once it resumes .. they’re going to pay double the rent now ? What they owe plus there current rent .. after 15%  of us lost jobs or in a totally different industry now starting over ..
2021-04-24 11:54:07,wallstreetbets,Go for it ‼️
2021-04-24 11:54:28,wallstreetbets,Its a good thing rocket sells the loans then so they don't baghold if the meltdown happens
2021-04-24 12:02:31,wallstreetbets,Doing what a wango can lol chasing tendies
2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,SNDL... sometimes it do be like that 🧙‍♂️ 
2021-04-23 23:58:46,wallstreetbets,I’m down 80%.  On sndl. Or as I like to say. I’m going long on it
2021-04-24 11:17:20,wallstreetbets,Imagine having $350k and investing in SNDL. What a nob
2021-04-23 20:58:15,wallstreetbets,"Holding 12,000 shares at a slightly lower cost basis. I’m not worried in the slightest about it though 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-24 03:34:43,wallstreetbets,I bought around 3k worth of sndl @3.7 and sold most at $1.25.  You sir make me feel a whole lot better
2021-04-23 21:17:28,wallstreetbets,Dayuum son!

2021-04-23 22:10:50,wallstreetbets,at least it was green by 0.09% today.
2021-04-23 23:17:44,wallstreetbets,This company dilutes shares every other week.

2021-04-23 21:12:43,wallstreetbets,At least you won’t have to worry about Biden’s looming capital income tax increase...
2021-04-23 23:50:52,wallstreetbets,"It will eventually go back! until then sell 2415 $1 strikes every other week for $5 ea! You have to give 2 weeks to get $5 but its still 12k every time. You could put the fees back it to lower your average.

By August it will be $1.50
Crayon eaters like me love cheep penny stocks so no matter how the business does it will go up again

p.s. only sell the contracts on green days and only buy more at .82 or less on red days.

Have my average to .98 now it was 1.65"
2021-04-24 11:43:21,wallstreetbets,"Diamond hands, when they legalize it could end up replacing tobacco"
2021-04-23 21:41:40,wallstreetbets,"Anybody who bought SNDL over $1 is truly a retarded ape that belongs on this sub, don’t worry thought, 1 share of GME will cover these losses, oh and it will also set you for life 🚀🚀🚀💎💎💎🦍👩‍🚀"

2021-04-24 01:23:32,wallstreetbets,Haven't met a weed stock I haven't bought high and sold low yet. I'm really hoping the shroom stocks perform better.
2021-04-24 02:38:38,wallstreetbets,Someone's been using the product. And not sharing.
2021-04-24 03:06:28,wallstreetbets,Holy shit my man...rip fellow ape
2021-04-24 08:25:32,wallstreetbets,"$SNDL is burning all that cash to smoke their own product. If the fuckers could grow a company like they grow weed, prices would be soaring."
2021-04-24 08:37:12,wallstreetbets,Very respectable bet lol
2021-04-24 10:19:59,wallstreetbets,This makes me feel better about my poor choices

2021-04-24 16:29:19,wallstreetbets,Yup.. me too waiting for fire 🔥
2021-04-23 22:30:00,wallstreetbets,"Sell 1$ strike calls dumbass. This is a really shitty company but the volatility on it is super high so it's pretty good to trade. I started a pmcc on it, bought .5 leaps and selling the 1$ weekly and monthly"
2021-04-24 02:19:28,wallstreetbets,will be over 2.25 again soon enough. dont be a paper handed bitch
2021-04-24 03:07:42,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, Congress & Biden will legalize weed and then🚀🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-24 10:25:02,wallstreetbets,The savagery. I’m surprised you didn’t call dibs on his wife’s bf
2021-04-23 23:14:51,wallstreetbets,...shrewed
2021-04-24 01:30:13,wallstreetbets,Same thing witb AMC. float increased from 100m to 400m. But people still waiting for the squeeze..
2021-04-24 00:40:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and it's disgusting they are allowed to operate tbh"
2021-04-24 09:25:18,wallstreetbets,I just got in at 84 cents 45 shares lol
2021-04-24 02:23:37,wallstreetbets,"awesome, i'm down 68% - clawing back $4 premiums at a time, lol, i only have 1500 shares though so we're not talking a big loss here"
2021-04-24 09:28:29,wallstreetbets,Ouch
2021-04-24 12:29:44,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s cheap as hell, why not?  If it doesn’t pan out, whatevs. Uncle Joe got some balls - calling out Armenian genocide, maybe he’ll push for pot legalization by then?!"
2021-04-24 00:15:02,wallstreetbets,How high is that going to go?
2021-04-24 02:17:51,wallstreetbets,...or it can just keep going down and then they announce a reverse merger and it keeps going down even more ...and then they'll dilute the shares even more =]
2021-04-24 09:27:29,wallstreetbets,Lol bought in because it was below 1$
2021-04-24 12:28:34,wallstreetbets,"It's a Canadian company. FWIW, although Washington and Oregon both have legalized weed at the state level, you can't take across state lines from one state to the other."
2021-04-24 00:10:19,wallstreetbets,Is there enough liquidity in those options to do that though? Would be a good play if he can pull it off.
2021-04-23 22:31:59,wallstreetbets,"I'd just sell the 1$ strike, this stocks isn't gonna be flying high anytime soon"
2021-04-24 13:51:40,wallstreetbets,Is...
2021-04-23 21:13:54,wallstreetbets,"Sell puts @$1.00, let someone pay you to average down!"
2021-04-23 20:15:15,wallstreetbets,I think he already has brain damage
2021-04-24 00:23:55,wallstreetbets,Well it was over $5 mid December... who knows but I wouldn’t be surprised if it ended around $10 on Tuesday which is first day of uplist trading
2021-04-24 12:53:15,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and it will benefit from US legalization. 

“Only 11 states have legalized the recreational use of marijuana. 35 states have implemented medical marijuana programs for patients, and the remaining states fully adhering to the federal law, under which marijuana is classified as a Schedule 1 drug.”[Weed News](https://www.weednews.co/marijuana-legality-states-map/)"
2021-04-24 02:12:00,wallstreetbets,"SNDL has excellent liquidity, volume in the thousands for alot of strike dates and some open interests strikes above 100k. This is a really shitty stock but IV is really high and it seems good to trade. I started a pmcc on it a few days ago 🤷‍♂️"
2021-04-24 02:49:42,wallstreetbets,Then if it gets exercised he’d be out at a loss
2021-04-24 14:03:08,wallstreetbets,Not...
2021-04-23 21:57:17,wallstreetbets,"Right, and at my current holdings in a small bag holder. But I have just some days they don't sell"
2021-04-24 07:24:39,wallstreetbets,I dearly hope this is the saddest thing i see today.
2021-04-24 00:56:13,wallstreetbets,I got assigned all my puts this week 😆. Now on to CC
2021-04-24 01:25:52,wallstreetbets,"You thinking sell that tip?
I don't see it staying that high without an actual profit from sales yet."

2021-04-24 13:01:46,wallstreetbets,"Welp, what are Congress and Biden waiting on? Biden's former boss, Obama and Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Democrat-controlled Senate kept marijuana a Schedule 1 drug."
2021-04-24 17:13:13,wallstreetbets,The way
2021-04-24 02:49:05,wallstreetbets,"abso-fucking-lutely not, biotech/biopharma are approval plays so if they run up prematurely you always sell

even if you believe in the stock, take your money and buy back in"
2021-04-24 02:51:34,wallstreetbets,"That's what I said.. if it runs up to #10, sell it because it won't stay there. 👍"
2021-04-24 08:33:14,wallstreetbets,If that happens I’ll prob shave off my cost basis
2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,I thought stocks only went up guys 
2021-04-23 20:56:39,wallstreetbets,It will be a V shaped recovery when you deposit some more funds...
2021-04-23 20:14:53,wallstreetbets,You’ve gotta set it to W for Wumbo

The ape mentality of not cashing out gains is what fucked you not the stonk not going up.

Im guessing you put all your money in 1 or 2 stocks otherwise it generally would not drop that quickly."
2021-04-23 20:37:38,wallstreetbets,You purchase options. They go down. Buy and hold.
2021-04-23 22:11:40,wallstreetbets,Stocks are like bouncy balls.  They gotta drop really hard so they can bounce higher. Looks like your stocks are getting ready for a moon launch 🚀

2021-04-23 21:40:14,wallstreetbets,There's your mistake. You wasted money on stocks when you should have bought stonks.

2021-04-23 22:50:12,wallstreetbets,You have it upside down
2021-04-23 22:51:46,wallstreetbets,Shoulda bought stonks instead

I told my wife I was going to spend 20k making this shit interesting enough for me to learn how to play the game.

[ ](https://preview.redd.it/0luibhk7lzu61.png?width=1862&format=png&auto=webp&s=b91a895346e9df73c2505b5ecae087c86f465405)

Hello apes, have not posted a technical analysis in a while. Last time I posted about TA was on $RKT and my price target hit on the dot (I was shocked too lol). This time I was looking at the GME Chart and I noticed something very interesting.

\- Currently we are breaking out of a descending triangle to the upside and the price target for that is 348$

\- I then noticed if we hit the price target of 348$ we are creating a W pattern which has a higher high base. The realistic price target of the W pattern would be 476$ but a 560$ could happen as well!

\- Currently volume overall in MA deviation rate, MACD and the volume bars is very low and stable which indicates a rise in Volume and Volatility soon. This can link to the fact that we are breaking out of a descending triangle.

\- Soon enough with George Sherman stepping down as Chief Executive we can hope the next candidate can sustain GME as a company better than Sherman did.

\- Last but not least, I have to mention the breakout to the downside price target which is 40$ however I think it is highly unlikely for that scenario to play out.

Please have a look at my TA in the screenshot, I've labeled each indication for you apes to see something other than crayons.

TL;DR - In the next 1-2 weeks expect GME to go Brrrr 🚀 🚀 OTM Calls are finally going to pay.. xd"

2021-04-24 02:07:34,wallstreetbets,your red line is a failed breakout. We're currently likely on the same. If it fails again stock will drop to a new level of support. I'm moving some money this weekend hoping to get in big big on a discount.

someone posted this same DD at the start of the week about gme breaking out of the triangle pattern and how it was back on the rise....... it dropped 6% that day.

2021-04-23 23:27:31,wallstreetbets,The price of GME really hasn’t done a while lot in several weeks. Look at the last pop and it’s been over a month.  But that’s might mean we have a floor in the 150’s.  At least it’s holding that.  But when is the next big pop $200+ ?
2021-04-24 00:42:16,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the only thing that will make the price go up, is the upcoming vote. Gamestop doesn't really follow the norm, but I am probably retarded."

2021-04-24 10:53:51,wallstreetbets,Reading TA is kinda like /r/vxjunkies to me where I can barely tell if it's real info or an elaborate plot to fuck with people
2021-04-24 12:27:33,wallstreetbets,"The thing about trendlines is you can adjust them any way you want to fit your narrative. You missed the most important TA - it's in a daily equilibrium. Volume has been dropping off and will pick up soon with a break of that pattern. Daily RSI generally bounces off of 40 and we are pretty close to it. My ideal scenario is for a dump Monday into 4hr oversold conditions holding the low of 132 for me to buy aggressively. Also, watch the 4hr EMA12. It rejects from it when we are bearish and holds it when bullish."
2021-04-24 13:03:29,wallstreetbets,If it drops to $40 I'm adding more.   That's my current average

2021-04-24 19:11:50,wallstreetbets,"FANTASTIC ANYLIS.

2021-04-23 20:04:39,wallstreetbets,"I have 90k just sitting on the sidelines.. If it Rockets, I'm all in!.. If it Rockets you can have my hot girlfriend and her asshole boyfriend.. Hate that guy!"
2021-04-23 21:27:21,wallstreetbets,"Thoughts:

1. Trendlines: You improperly anchored the lower trendline to 2021.02.26.  It should be back at the low on 2021.02.19.   So, it's already broken out ... low.
2. Yellow Line:  What is this ""W"" pattern and how is it derived?  But, hey, w stands for wahooo, right?
3. Green Line: What & how.
4. Red Line:  Again, what & how.
5. Blue Line: Yeah, broken record, what & how.
6. What are the indicators your are using?

&#x200B;

That said, my EWT puts the next price zone at $227-271."

2021-04-24 02:13:11,wallstreetbets,"You’re doing TA based on the previous 3 months of GME. But what you don’t account for is the situation of the past 3 months. Shorts entering but having to cover that’s why of the meteoric rise of the first and second squeeze. IMHO, the second squeeze up to $350... I think this price level from 200-150 has been overextended... very unlikely we will see bust again strictly speaking from a situational basis. Read up u/hooman_or_whatever dd thesis on this for more info on the situation"
2021-04-23 21:16:34,wallstreetbets,Sooo how do we get from 348 to 10 mil??

2021-04-24 14:31:37,wallstreetbets,"This is going to be a fun ride, waiting for it to pop 🚀🚀🚀"
2021-04-24 15:17:20,wallstreetbets,"$40 very unlikely for a variety of reasons. Retail holds a very significant portion of that floor as it is. DFV sentiment for his 50k share purchases at $150 level are strong. PT was set at $175 by that one dude who does that one thing. Holders keep buying on the way down, myself included. People who were posting large purchases at $200 and above, are in the red, and would gladly double down if it touched $100 or lower. $40 is a meme. $100? maybe. But I doubt because we already tested that floor when we hit $113 a few weeks back and we ate that shit up. I don't think we dip much lower than that. And like some of you said. IF for some reason it happens......... WE ARE ALL 10x our positions lol"
2021-04-24 00:54:13,wallstreetbets,I have 600 shares.  I bought at $6 2 years ago.  I probably will  never sell!

2021-04-23 23:25:44,wallstreetbets,"Based on fundamentals it's probably worth less than $40. But with the growth fantasy, hype around a squeeze, etc, I guess sky is the limit? Those of us who are bearish on this stock are learning how to survive. I've been selling covered calls for awhile now (taking in good money), and I told my first cash covered put this week. I hope this thing trades sideways for many more months to come! Seems there is always going to be some idiot willing to plunk down good money on a $200 weekly. :)"

The funny thing is that so many of us will all dump a shit ton more money into this if it hits the $40 prediction.

IMO the worst outcome for us is a slow unwind like has been happening over the last several days.  Each week it drops several dollars on Monday and then goes sideways all week."

2021-04-24 11:58:52,wallstreetbets,"I don't know what any of this means....but I see a lot of numbers that are higher than $150, so I've seen all I need to see."
2021-04-24 13:12:36,wallstreetbets,"Damn I bet on OTM calls for 4/23, but wish I was smart enough (or saw this) to push out a few more weeks like 4/30 or 5/07.  A word of caution for those looking for OTM calls, just know we've been thinking 'this is the week' for weeks now.  

And I'm sorry don't mean to sound negative, but after losing on 10 contracts last week, just want to spread the thought.  A strategy I'd suggest is to spread the bet; add some later dates, don't put it all on one week.  I miss you contracts, but back to faith in my 70 shares."
2021-04-24 14:26:48,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, opportunity cost is breaking my balls bought 221 @ 16$  and looking at missed out opportunities such as Mindmed 0.76$-3,50$ or MVIS with 60% jump last week.

I was stupid enough to start investing on REvolut and their entire money process is breaking my balls as well don't know how long it takes for money to become available for transfer to the account and at this point, I'm too afraid to act. But I guess I gotta wait for this one out since there are always new opportunities in the market."
2021-04-24 15:14:33,wallstreetbets,I know I know but I think it will go to $1000
2021-04-24 15:22:52,wallstreetbets,"It really looks like you did use a crayola crayon to scribble this garbage down, 40$ GME?!? You sir are a ruhtard, that’s Forsure!"
2021-04-24 17:20:25,wallstreetbets,Me thinks it’s as low as it’s going to go for the foreseeable future. If it gets shorted below 100 retail is going to start fomo again.
2021-04-24 17:23:36,wallstreetbets,Now is the time to buy!
2021-04-24 18:29:11,wallstreetbets,TA posts with no pics or crayon lines have no merit here.

2021-04-24 19:37:50,wallstreetbets,What’s the floor on this I hold most amc but I do have some gme I’m with you all💎💎💎🦍🍿🍿
2021-04-24 05:29:02,wallstreetbets,"Lol otm options will print.

Dude institutional ownership might be enough to keep gme at 100+.  What event is going to trigger huge volume?  Volume doesn't just appear from nowhere.

The next catalyst is for people to recall their shares to vote and freak out as gme gains like 10 dollars.  Then we might see some movement.  Like I said though, with institutional ownership massively outweighing retail you guys probably can't even buy puts and liquidate anymore.

Options lol.  Options on gme goes to pay shareholders writing covered calls and MMs.  Options were great in Jan and Feb, since then you'd be better off letting a bot trade for you than buying gme options."
2021-04-24 08:34:14,wallstreetbets,Technical Analysis lmao
2021-04-24 02:14:37,wallstreetbets,Ok is it me or there is no screenshot?
2021-04-24 05:17:27,wallstreetbets,"If it pops over $400 I’ll be tempted to sell about 80% of my shares in anticipation of a drop afterwards, then re-accumulate to own even more shares.   The only risk to that would be if it jumps further. But even then I’d still have 20% of my shares.  What do you guys think?"
2021-04-23 21:37:48,wallstreetbets,How is it possible to have new technical analysis and due diligence literally every single day? Like how much f****** changes from day to day?
2021-04-23 22:36:32,wallstreetbets,Are you guys really trading GME still? That shit is a lost cause buy silver
2021-04-24 09:03:09,wallstreetbets,BUY AND HOLD CLOV 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
2021-04-23 21:20:55,wallstreetbets,Im gonna sell my 2 shares at 348.48. So my final profits will be 696.96
2021-04-24 01:32:45,wallstreetbets,Why did my GME post about real news get removed by mods but this is still up 😂
2021-04-24 05:14:01,wallstreetbets,Amc or gme?
2021-04-24 15:50:17,wallstreetbets,"yeah, nah. Prolonged dead cat bounce."
2021-04-23 20:17:51,wallstreetbets,I bet it tests that $37 area.
2021-04-23 22:00:52,wallstreetbets,$40 is much more exciting than $300.  $40 means thousands of dollars in more shares.
2021-04-24 03:33:16,wallstreetbets,[removed]
2021-04-24 13:13:16,wallstreetbets,What is the safest most effective way to buy Bittorrent? I am trying to get my hands on some BTT but can't seem to. I have Coinbase and I have Trust Wallet. What is my next step?
2021-04-23 21:23:50,wallstreetbets,Now do AMC
2021-04-24 09:03:14,wallstreetbets,"You guys really gotta start using a log scale Y-axis for this bad boy. Makes it a much clearer picture. 

And people called my loss porn outrageously stupid... we shall see, we shall see."
2021-04-24 16:41:04,wallstreetbets,So... if I understood this correctly. You're saying price will climb to $348 then drop down to 40ish?
2021-04-24 12:53:51,wallstreetbets,This gamma?
2021-04-23 21:01:12,wallstreetbets,">this thing goes back to $40 I’m gonna buy so many fucking shar

SO MANY OF THEM SAME"
2021-04-23 20:22:15,wallstreetbets,I will remortgage my house for this

2021-04-24 00:26:05,wallstreetbets,"Been holding at an average of $49. So if it goes down again, I’ll be liquidating and buying what little more I can !"
2021-04-23 22:08:21,wallstreetbets,For real I'll lower the fuck out of my average. However with how many eyes are on it I doubt we hit $130. I think the price should naturally be at $500+ right now with how many people are buying and holding and the price is manipulated to fuck all right now.
2021-04-23 23:49:41,wallstreetbets,"Bro I know everyday I hold. It’s a day closer to my dream come true!!!! 

I love you all apes holding with me. 🦍 🦍 diamond hands all the way to the top!!!! 💎 💎 💎"

(Me too)"
2021-04-23 21:51:49,wallstreetbets,If it goes to 40!!!! I’m have to double down like I missed first time. I can’t do it again.
2021-04-23 22:32:35,wallstreetbets,I’ll sell my car and kids
2021-04-23 22:50:19,wallstreetbets,$40? I'll be remortgaging my paid off home and buying shares 🚀
2021-04-23 23:47:13,wallstreetbets,I would put every last cent I had if it went that low lol
2021-04-23 23:50:53,wallstreetbets,I'm with you there! Hoping that shit happens on a payday too. I've been buying the dip for the past month...
2021-04-24 00:34:02,wallstreetbets,I kick myself in the ass every day for not loading up at $40.
2021-04-23 21:56:53,wallstreetbets,I’m on the $1000 a week savings plan. Would love to see $40 again 🚀🚀
2021-04-23 22:23:18,wallstreetbets,"Same page man, same page. I really wish it would go back down, as I missed out on the last one and just held. I will throw my savings right at it without blinking."
2021-04-23 23:08:53,wallstreetbets,"I am dreading another dip to 40$ because I've already dried up all the money I can afford to lose. Hell, even the massive dip to 40 last time felt like rubbing one out  with dried up balls and I only managed to buy in at 90-ish because I was not fast enough in scraping up funds. But the gains overall are really tempting me to do stupid shit like YOLO-ing the rest of my money"
2021-04-23 23:14:36,wallstreetbets,"Same, ready to dump at least 10k if it goes back to $40. i fucken regret not buying when it dipped to 40$."
2021-04-23 23:16:31,wallstreetbets,40 sounds like porn
2021-04-23 23:46:58,wallstreetbets,"If you DO, I’ll take 3/4 outa our house down payment and follow you."
2021-04-24 00:20:09,wallstreetbets,There are so many bad things I would do just to see gme back at $40 per share again 🙊
2021-04-24 00:24:50,wallstreetbets,We’re gonna be so fucking rich
2021-04-24 00:32:41,wallstreetbets,"shares pls, thx"
2021-04-24 00:55:50,wallstreetbets,I will be able to move into the XXX share range
2021-04-24 01:17:44,wallstreetbets,This is the way!
2021-04-24 01:45:58,wallstreetbets,"I would cash out my 401k. I can’t even imagine. Please, for the love of god, give me such an amazing discount."
2021-04-24 01:47:16,wallstreetbets,I got your 6 lead the way!
2021-04-24 02:27:16,wallstreetbets,If it goes to $40 I’ll drop 20k on shares.
2021-04-24 03:20:02,wallstreetbets,A man can pray. At $40 i'm definitely putting in money i can't afford to lose.
2021-04-24 04:41:35,wallstreetbets,Ooooh fucking yess!!!! Oh hell yes
2021-04-24 07:12:24,wallstreetbets,"The shorties after reading this post:

Aw fuk"
2021-04-24 07:48:07,wallstreetbets,"If it goes back to $40 I absolutely will buy a fuckton more. It will hurt, but will be oh so worth it in the end.

I do not believe that will happen tho. Holding and bought a near otm call expiring on the 30th at end of day Friday."
2021-04-24 09:55:32,wallstreetbets,Ditto!
2021-04-24 10:50:06,wallstreetbets,"LOL

SAME"

2021-04-24 12:29:47,wallstreetbets,"Yea I've pulled mostly out because I feel an extended drop coming, but if it ever hits anything less than $75 I'll put all my investment cash into it. In the mean time I want stuff I can interact with every once in a while selling calls etc"
2021-04-24 14:07:12,wallstreetbets,"If it goes to $40, I'm moving my emergency money in to buy GME"
2021-04-24 16:11:07,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
2021-04-24 17:09:50,wallstreetbets,I want 40 more than 400 this week
2021-04-24 19:19:58,wallstreetbets,"If this thing goes back to 40 im taking out. a mortgage on my house and buying 1,000 shares"
2021-04-23 21:46:44,wallstreetbets,This thing should go to 25 where it belongs but don’t tell any of the apes that. 25 is being generous btw
2021-04-23 21:24:07,wallstreetbets,"If it goes back to $40, the stock its done. But that is not gonna happen"
2021-04-23 21:25:39,wallstreetbets,You are a 💎 ✋ stud in my book.
2021-04-23 20:31:22,wallstreetbets,Technically if they didn’t stop the ability to buy he could have very easily turned that $348 into potentially $1000 but we don’t know how many shares they bought either...
2021-04-23 23:10:06,wallstreetbets,I finally averaged down today from the high 3s. Now I'm just the high 2s lol
2021-04-24 02:06:34,wallstreetbets,Yea I'm confused... where did all the GME stuff go on WSB?
2021-04-23 20:44:18,wallstreetbets,"Bought rkt off this and other guys posts at $24 and had a limit sell for $47..

Ended up selling for break even, but got the divident atleast..

Yes, I eat crayons for breakfast..

Atleast entered GME for $148 today for a whopping 15 shares"
2021-04-23 22:55:55,wallstreetbets,">legit technical analysis

I understand these words individually, but they make no sense in that order"
2021-04-24 00:43:31,wallstreetbets,"He got lucky one time.  This is just complete nonsense.  He's talking about charting (guessing where a price will go based on looking for patterns on the price chart).  Charting has been academically disproven a thousand times over.  It's utterly useless.

2021-04-24 12:55:56,wallstreetbets,14 here
2021-04-24 00:25:17,wallstreetbets,Idk wtf that is but it sounds cool.
2021-04-23 20:06:20,wallstreetbets,I bought a power supply for my PC on 4/20 and it arrived next day!  Cheers to Customer Experience
2021-04-24 01:50:59,wallstreetbets,Lol good luck finding one after this. There gonna priced stupid high after all apes buy new ones.
2021-04-24 07:34:50,wallstreetbets,"So you buy GME at blown out inflated prices, but not a graphics card?"
2021-04-24 04:38:16,wallstreetbets,"Just built a pc with a 3080 in it for the same price as a scalped version of just the card. 

Only way to get one right now"
2021-04-23 23:00:04,wallstreetbets,That’s the “floor” now imo. Anything less is a sale price.
2021-04-24 00:04:54,wallstreetbets,"This MF bought the entire bottom at $38. Like we all were happy with $40-45 and this dude was like ok I am calling the bottom riiiiiight... *here*

2021-04-24 02:59:48,wallstreetbets,The DD is solid and DFV bought another 50k shares @ $150-155. There's no reason to keep reassuring yourself or look for more confirmation bias. **Just set alert and HOLD.**
2021-04-24 00:44:50,wallstreetbets,"There's nothing to understand.  He's looking at a price chart and pretending he can predict where it will go next.  He can't and this is stupid.

That said, I believe a squeeze is on the horizon."
2021-04-23 21:48:05,wallstreetbets,I'm just happy he color coded it. Ways more better.
2021-04-23 22:19:51,wallstreetbets,This cracked me the fuck up lol
2021-04-24 14:42:57,wallstreetbets,Here's betting a lot of funds have made significant profits selling options at skyhigh premium for GME.
2021-04-24 17:50:50,wallstreetbets,"Well seeing how every short since January has an interest of around 1% or lower, a very very long time. I don't understand why no one is talking about this. In January, the interest was 30%+. Thats the difference in them bleeding out $1b then vs. $33m now. That's a huge difference. Not to mention there's a lot of DD to show they're pulling some good money on selling naked calls a decent way OTM and collecting some good premium. This could go on for a very long time."
2021-04-24 01:06:55,wallstreetbets,Do you have access to the full paper?
2021-04-23 21:21:47,wallstreetbets,"If this drops to $50 again, anyone with a brain and $5,000 to their name should buy 100 shares to sell covered calls against."
2021-04-24 06:35:40,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn't Citadel and other similar big shorters just cover their short positions if it hit $40 though? Meaning no spike / no sweeze.
2021-04-24 07:33:47,wallstreetbets,"hence would not go there. i can't in any world see it going lower than 70, even 90 unlikely."
2021-04-23 20:31:52,wallstreetbets,that’s why those crazy sharp declines always happens around 350 or so.. Big effort there to temper it
2021-04-23 21:09:56,wallstreetbets,You should dare to dream bigger. Millions my friend.
2021-04-24 02:54:45,wallstreetbets,How does reddit own more than 100% of the float?

2021-04-23 21:32:26,wallstreetbets,"There's always a bias towards ending on whole dollar figures because humans tend to prefer them. When people place buy and sell limit orders, they pile to walls on those figures and the market will often close on them unmet, especially in a 3 digit price stock with above average volume done in mostly small individual trades . It's not a product of manipulation."
2021-04-24 06:55:23,wallstreetbets,"It started moving with market same like any other stocks. Low volumes show you that not many people are interested in trading GME anymore. It can change, but many original holders moved to something else, and whales are gone too."

2021-04-24 13:35:41,wallstreetbets,"Mine keeps giving me the, ""Ookaaay, if you feel that's best, then do it"".

Now only super important info and well done DDs/TAs show up here. Another thing is that some GME holders were really annoying and brigaded anything that wasn't GME, effectively taking the sub over.

2021-04-24 13:09:57,wallstreetbets,"Pretty basic, if you buy (cover your short position), the stock price goes up.

If they are short 10m shares (I personally think that's a load of horse dookey), then they would drive up the price by volume and covering.

It's possible to slowly unwind, but at the current prices that's most likely losing them money, and those big shorters don't like to lose.

There's no guarantees here, however. 

The stock is doing such funky-ass shit, there is most likely a large short position of some kind hidden here."

With something moving in wild swings like GME you can chart it better with log scale... it also shows that the price moves exponentially and not in a linear manner. 

Log scale would be to the power of 10, so your Y-axis goes 1, 10, 100, 1000 vs linear 10,20,30,40...."

Then, we went grocery shopping and when we returned from the store, the share price has more than doubled. Since then he’s basically treated me like I’m some kinda investment goddess.

2021-04-23 20:21:03,wallstreetbets,Yep. I am way long on rocket. It’s been holding steady at 21 for a while. It’s definitely going to pop again. Great company overall. Sitting at 200 shares around 22 because I cashed some of my positions in during the last spike. Just don’t want this rocket to blast off again before April 30 because I sold a covered call at 27 ha ha
2021-04-24 04:10:03,wallstreetbets,"Sure!  If a stock price were predictable based on something like a pattern on a chart, imagine what would happen.  Software would be perfected to monitor these patterns and instantly react to them with appropriate purchase decisions.   These then would alter the price of the stock by creating new types if demand or selling pressure that would replace the original predictions, making them wrong.

Generally, for any stock that looks like it’s following a pattern, there are other stocks that don’t follow that pattern and seem to be following a different one.   The patterns are imagined.   Stock prices move based on market conditions, company developments, industry expectations and a host of other unpredictable factors. They don’t move because of something that happened to their price in the past."

It's still going to be up to you in your head and your personal discipline to buy and sell. Noone can time the market. If it was easy everyone would become rich. I'd rather get stopped out or take profits too soon to fight another day than lose everything.

I suggested we do it to lower our average cost down and the look she gave me.

2021-04-24 12:45:46,wallstreetbets,"For the sell price to drop to $40, someone would be selling it at 50, 49, 48, etc. The shorters would be buying it starting somewhere along the way. Maybe no one would decide to sell at 40, but that already means a bunch of people sold from $150 to $40.

I'm not saying it WILL drop to $40, but if it does that's not good news for a major rebound because a lot of the short positions would very likely be exited."

2021-04-24 04:32:18,wallstreetbets,"It's not idiotic. Many retail brokerage list how many of their customers own GME. If you assume the average of these is the same across all retail and assume that they all own X number of shares, you get a rough estimate on the percentage of the float. 

I'd say a minimum of 25 million shares. Many assume the number is much higher than this, though."

2021-04-24 00:33:04,wallstreetbets,"Day traders do the same. I got into putting on this day trader show on YouTube as background noise when I was working from home so I learned a few things they do over time and they never use round numbers for their limits, so like any time they short for example they never short off a round number level. If they want it under 7 they short at like 6.75 as long as they can, then maybe a little at 6.80, and then once they get the feeling it’s gonna blow past 7 they cover. 

Same thing with longs, if they like it at 7, they think other people are probably thinking the same, so maybe they put their order in for like 7.25 if they really like the stock, or 6.95 if they kinda like the play but aren’t married to it, etc etc"
2021-04-24 03:42:26,wallstreetbets,"You’re absolutes right about not using round numbers for limit orders. 

I bought into GME at $19.96 and again at $40... (and again at $300.... and again at $140/....

BUT I set a limit order to sell enough shares to make back my total money in ($3,500 or so) so I think BOOM I’ll sell 10 shares from my $20 tranch of 25 shares at $350, still have 45 more shares. 

Key decision: I set my limit at $345 thinking that $350 was a big psychological threshold and I should stay under it for the second squeeze.

Sure enough the high is $348 and I get my sell order off. Covered my ass and still up many thousands. Thanks GME. NOW GET SOME MORE FUCKING PS5s in stonk so I can buy one with my Tendies."

2021-04-24 17:04:12,wallstreetbets,"Then what is the whole discussion about ""price suppression""? The idea being that right now no one is selling real shares so any downward price pressure is just more shorting. I would think the price going down to $40 at this point would likely be from short selling not real selling"

2021-04-24 03:27:23,wallstreetbets,"They need to buy whatever number of shares shorted to return them in full in order to close their positions. So yes, theoretically they could buy the same shares over and over again **if and only if** the broker is willing to keep selling those shares back to them. Put yourself in your broker's shoes, would they keep selling the shares back for cheap when they could be charging much more by letting the price skyrocket? 

If our speculation is correct, which seems to be considering their relentless attacks in multiple ways, they are still very deep in the shorting positions. If their brokers are helping them out, they wouldn't care if we held or sold. So you can infer that the only real/effective way they can ever close those positions is to buy from actual shareholders. And this is without taking potential margin calls or share recalls into account.

**Just HOLD.**"

2021-04-24 17:32:03,wallstreetbets,"Yes I do believe that, or the share price would be much higher if that wasn't the case. Most retail investors sell when they start to lose money. No idea why you think march is low volume when April is 2x-3x lower, and no idea why you think volume equals ownership. Degiro isn't even a big broker and who gives a fuck about trading volumes in the UAE? And none of this relates to now, end of April. Not Jan/Feb/Mar. Not buying when I sold or not buying why your trade is retarded? Easy to prove my trades, impossible to prove your hypotheses.

**P/E Ratio:** CVS has a PE of 13x which is way less than most companies at the moment. The SP500 has a PE ratio of 42 right now.

&#x200B;

**Charts:**

On the **daily** candle charts, we can see an inverse head and shoulders pattern with the head at $68 and the neckline at $75. We can also see two back to back hammer doji candles indicating price wanting to move up. There is also a pennant forming which is a bi-directional pattern.

&#x200B;

**Options OI:**

Taking a quick look at the nearest expiring monthly options, the strike with the largest OI is 80c with about $1.8MM in premium. The entire options chain is skewed to the bull side with a crap ton more overall bullish OI and bullish volume compared to the bear side. I'm too lazy to add up the numbers but you can do it yourself. I've highlighted the OI column if you wanna do math.

**Conclusion:** Looking at everything this bitch looks like it's about to explode. It's been consolidating for a long ass time. It looks like it want's to explode higher but time will tell if I'm right. Personally I think this is gonna hit $80, if I had to guess, somewhere in about 2 weeks. Oh also, earnings are soon so be careful holding through earnings cause you might get IV crushed

If the stock goes sideways then I keep the difference between the premiums and play again. If it drops, then I get assigned a stock that I am happy owning anyway.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"The Weekly Market Recap for Gamblers and Degenerates - April 19th to April 23rd What’s poppin bull-gang, Flux here with your weekly recap of the markets! Earnings season is in full swing this week, and the markets were volatile. Boatloads of news, combined with a healthy amount of FUD was dropped this week, and I wasn’t around to observe the markets until Thursday, so this recap will be a little bit more bare than most. Apologies in advance. If you want a copy of the newspaper early, feel free to see the links on my profile! With all that being said, let's get into it.

&nbsp;

- **On Monday, the media decided to spread some FUD regarding TSLA** after reports revealed that two people died after a driverless crash in Texas. TSLA shares initially slid 6%, until people pointed out that *literally nobody was driving the fucking car*, meaning that the owner purposely managed to bypass all safety measures in order to avoid outright driving the car. Fuk a weight sensor, fuk a seatbelt sensor, fuk a steering wheel sensor, and fuk the bears, buddy put a case of beer or something in the divers seat while he went to plow his Tinder date in the back seat. Despite this gut wrenching news, TSLA closed the week up 4%.

&nbsp;


- To add to the FUD on Monday, **The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission issued a warning advising consumers to stop using Peloton (PTON) Interactive's treadmill** if there are small children or pets at home. The warning comes after a small child died in March, *nearly two months ago*, during a treadmill accident. America really decided to snitch on PTON over some old old beef just to put my calls OTM, kill me man. This headline is extra stupid cause a small child and animal can die on ANY treadmill, not exclusively a PTON one. PTON never actually recovered, and closed the week down 7%. Guh.

&nbsp;


- **On Tuesday, Netflix reported some disastrous earnings**. Netflix beat on earnings a bit, but then casually tried to slip in the fact that they lost nearly HALF of their yearly subscriber growth, reporting 3.98 million vs 6.2 million expected. Obviously, investors were PISSED and Netflix plunged 10% on the week. To be fair, that’s what you degenerates get for sharing your Netflix passwords with your friends, y’all deserve this one. During the earnings call, CEO Reed tried to “urge investors to look beyond subscriptions"", as if the writing wasn’t already on the wall. NFLX did announce a healthy share buyback during the call, which is pretty awesome considering they just created a dip to buy. Cathie Wood, and CEO Reed were promptly seen religiously doubling down on their shitty investments.

&nbsp;


- Throughout the week, **random shit was mooning left and right, most notably SKLZ and MVIS**. No news announcements, no earnings reports, no catalyst. Just good ol fashioned market manipulation baby. MVIS saw $10.20 before closing the week up 80% around $18.00, while SKLZ followed closeby seeing $12.50 before closing the week up 50% at $18.50. I was eyeing skillz for weeks at this point but didn’t want to catch the knife until it settled. Ah well, live to trade another day I suppose.

&nbsp;


- On Thursday, the media was back to spreading FUD. According to a report by Bloomberg, **President Biden will propose almost doubling the capital gains tax rate for wealthy individuals earning $1 million or more per year to 39.6%** to help pay for a slew of social programs and the proposed infrastructure bill. The new marginal 39.6% rate would be an increase from the current base rate of 20%, the people said on the condition of anonymity because the plan is not yet public. The proposal could reverse a long-standing provision of the tax code that taxes returns on investment lower than on labor/salary. **When coupled with the 3.8% tax on investment income that funds the Affordable Care Act, federal tax rates for investors could be as high as 43.4%**. For $1 million earners in high-tax states, rates on capital gains could be above 50%. For New Yorkers, the combined state and federal capital gains rate could be as high as 52.22%. For Californians, it could be 56.7%. Although this news has already been known for a long ass time, it still tanked the markets 1% on the day. Algos reacting to humans reacting to algos, crazy shit. I can’t help feel like this entire situation was comedic as hell. Rich people make too much money, therefore we wanna increase taxes on the ultra-wealthy. The ultra-wealthy then immediately withdraw all money from the stock market and we’re left with retail traders left holding bags. Wealth is transferred from the poor to the rich. Mission accomplished.

&nbsp;


- **To those familiar with the [Lil Yachty Indicator](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/fg0975/lil_yachty_theory_goes_on/), this week was terrifying**. On 4/20, Lil Yachty released a hit single, causing the market to absolutely shit itself. Although the market managed to recover, the stress it caused wasn’t all that welcome, because the song itself was pretty dogshit. On top of all that, on Friday he also announced that he’s dropping a ***WHOLE ASS ALBUM***. Friday was a ripping green day, which is really fucking awesome, cause it means I got to liquid all my positions at an all time high. I hope you all followed suit, cause next week we’re gonna be blood red. Don't believe me? Search up ""Lil Yachty Crashes Stock Market"" on youtube for some definitive proof.

&nbsp;


- **There was a whole bunch of news this week that I didn’t have time to write about, but I encourage you to look into it** later if it interests you! I’ll summarize them all below. The U.K. government said it would probe **Nvidia** Corp.'s $40 billion deal to buy British chip-designer Arm from SoftBank Group Corp. Chat startup **Discord** Inc. has halted talks to sell itself to potential suitors including **Microsoft**, according to people familiar with the matter. On Tuesday, **Apple** announced a new slate of products set to include the company's own chip. **U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 547,000** in the latest week, below the 617 estimate and from 586,000 prior week. Continued claims fell to 3.674M vs. the estimated 3.667M.

&nbsp;


All in all, that wraps up this week's recap! Apologies for the shorter report this time round, I was extremely busy with work this week, and earnings season came with WAY too much additional news. I hope you all have a wonderful weekend, and come back on Monday rejuvenated for some more trading. Cheers 😎"

Synthetic Biology or Precision Fermentation is our ability to engineer living organisms to be machines. We've done it in the past with things like insulin, but this new wave is a brand new approach. In Amyris' case, the data from millions of iterations of proprietary DNA code are fed into an AI that can now create a 0-to-commercial scale strain all by itself without the input from a scientist ([See this webcast for more details](https://www.webcaster4.com/Webcast/Page/2101/40812)). The strains are so optimized that in some cases the cost of production begins to approach the price of sugar. Its making the expensive/rare molecules in nature cheaper and more sustainable.

FAQ - why skincare? and why do they own these brands? - long story short they have disgusting margins because they produce the molecules themselves. Because they have the cheapest cost to produce their molecules they can sell them B2B and then B2C where they reap \~50x their cost to produce. Its free money for them.

&#x200B;

**""Competitors and Valuation**

Many of you reached out to me before and asked who the competitors were and they have both stepped into the light just this month - Ginkgo and Zymergen. There is plenty of space for all three of these synbio companies in the game but lets go over what sets them apart using our organisms to machines idea.

* Machines that make a product, keeping the machine and selling only products - Amyris' strength
* Machines that find new products to make - Ginkgo's strength
* Machines that are the product - Ginkgo and Zymergen's strength

Amyris is currently around 3-5 years ahead of Ginkgo who is probably 3 years ahead of Zymergen. Ginkgo and Zymergen need much more data which is why their focus is different. Amyris already has the data that allows them to jump to commercial scale so they can make these machines and keep them - **this is where the money is at**. The other two need to do a ridiculous amount of yeast engineering to get enough data for their AI to be useful, so they have to whore themselves out to feed their AI.

* [Ginkgo](https://www.ginkgobioworks.com/) is going live via SPAC at a $20B valuation, we don't have numbers yet but we think their revenues are around $100M/yr.
* [Zymergen](https://www.zymergen.com/) IPO'd yesterday and is at a 4B valuation, its revenues are $16M/yr
* **Amyris** has been floating at $4-5B market cap, its projected revenue this year is $400M. **It is a diamond that no one has noticed yet**. Buy it up ASAP.

&#x200B;

**Important things to understand in this field**

\-The value of micro organisms. Currently the value for a commercial scale strain is \~50M, so keep that in mind Ginkgo and Zymergen will be making some cash. The issue is they are selling their strains to do so - **be careful of these revenues**. In Amyris' case they create a commercial strain and rather than selling it, they build around it so that the strain can provide millions to hundreds of millions in reoccurring revenue.

\- ""Commercial Scale"" is bullshit. Let's take Cannabigerol (CBG) for example. CBG is around $10-$20k/kg probably closer to $10k these days. Companies will say they have hit commercial scale if they have a strain that can make it at anything under the product value. So all those companies that say they have produced CBG at commercial scale might be making it at $8000/kg that's still a 2k profit. Bu this is no where near optimized. Amyris specializes in ""optimized commercial scale"" (pushing strains to their theoretical limits), where the cost to make their products begins to close in on the cost of their feedstocks (the cost of sugar).

&#x200B;

**WTF happened to the 500M deal, why didn't we jump?**

**The Deal - Amyris sold their entire Flavor and Fragrances Business to DSM for 500M (upfront cash + royalties + blah blah)**

I'm gonna be real with you guys... it just looked really bad on the outside (but its an amazing deal after you dive deeper). The Flavor and Fragrance business for Amyris is what brought them back from the grave. They were almost completely under from pursuing biofuels. They pivoted to low volume high cost materials (Flavors + Fragrances) in order to stay afloat. Now that they are what they wanted to be - A Company that sells Molecules - they no longer need to run that business. It also had some pretty bad margins running that business. It was a means to an end. On the outside it looks like they were desperate and needed cash, but knowing the inner workings - it was just a part of their plan. They sold a 30M/yr business for 500M, expanded agreements to 15 years, got rid of bad margin products, and kept their strains (not 100% sure on this last part). It was a great deal.

**The Offering**

People freaked out about this, but all they did was dilute 3% for like 150M in cash... It caught me off guard, but I don't see this as a big deal especially not after all their acquisitions this year. Diluting 3% at the top is WAY different than 20% at the bottom.

**Good Luck**

I'm still holding all of my shares and buying more every month. My ranking is Amyris > Ginkgo > Zymergen. Amyris is just so far ahead, Ginkgo is a good bet later, and Zymergen is going to be lighting cash on fire for the next few years."

2021-04-24 09:01:24,wallstreetbets,"For those investigating AMRS there is a key fact you should know that convinced me to buy in when it was $3 a share - John Doerr own 38% of the company and besides his 5m share ownership in ENPh this is how only other big public company play. JD is one of the greatest tech investors in history a d plays the long game - really long. He has basically kept the company alive for a period of years when it was running on fumes and he brought in his friends from Fidelity and Farrallon back in June of 2020 when they did a $200m pipe and bought in around $3 a share. (I imagine they are very happy right now ) if you want to follow the smart money in tech, no better person than JD. but this is a 10 year play at least. That said, mega trends like clean sustainable beauty are really starting to take off. If AMRS can make inroads into China their brands like Pipette and Biossance could explode. 

If interested in the company go to Biossance.com and look at the reviews and buy some products. Or try their amazing Purecane sugar substitute. You’ll see the quality."
2021-04-24 00:23:54,wallstreetbets,"I like the science, the sustainability goals, and the business model. Im not so sure the company is well run or looking out for shareholder interests. What's with the recent dilution?"
2021-04-23 22:32:46,wallstreetbets,It was oversold so I bought!
2021-04-24 09:42:23,wallstreetbets,"Agree with all of the comments, especially the competitive lead. However, IMO I think the lead could possibly be larger, primarily on the production side. Lab scale to pilot plant to industrial scale up is very challenging, and many unanticipated problems with GMO strains arise during this period. Strain optimization for commercial scale production can require months or possibly years. This is precisely where AMRS has a clear advantage which cannot be understated. I believe ginkgo and zymergen will suffer a similar early investor fate as AMRS did after launch. Rapid stock price increases followed by crash and a couple years of pain. However, they will not suffer nearly as long as AMRS due to significant biotech advances (CRSPR, optofluidics - BLi Beacon, etc). While these tools rapidly accelerate the R&D side, they don't offer the same multiplier when it comes to industrial scale up. AMRS has an end to end solution that puts them at a huge advantage, and will allow them to own the market. Once they control the sales channels, it will be very expensive for competitors to compete for control. Personally, I think ginkgo and zymergen are woefully underfunded for the task at hand. Expect multiple offerings and significant dilution of each (after gingko is public) over the next 3 to 5 years. Honestly, I could see AMRS owning one or both in the next 10 years because this space is soo capital intensive."
2021-04-23 22:10:06,wallstreetbets,I know nearly nothing about this space and did a total of 5 minutes of DD yesterday before deciding I wanted to pick up some ZY shares which have gone up 10+%. You sir have convinced me to sell my ZY shares and pick up some AMRS instead; seems like a decent pick for my Roth IRA account.
2021-04-23 22:24:58,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing your insight.  

Quick question:  is Origin Materials in the same space?  If so, how do they vary from Amyris/Ginkgo/Zymergen?"
2021-04-24 14:58:33,wallstreetbets,"Their financial show year after year of ness losses. The rare doing a 50% gross margin which is phenomenal (revenue 173m and cost of sales 87m) and so they can likely turn around their business if they rapidly increase sales volume.

Where did you get/see the projected 400m in revenue? Do you have a source? 

They currently trade at double their IPO price which was 5 years ago.  I don't see an increase in their revenue to support a share price growth coupled with negative cashflow operation.

What am I missing?

This is a speculative stock, is that the point?"
2021-04-24 13:17:36,wallstreetbets,CEO sold and bought calls.
2021-04-23 22:31:57,wallstreetbets,"Short term ZY might kick ass because Cathy is in it now. But long term, it will be lighting cash on fire."
2021-04-23 22:42:19,wallstreetbets,"I just looked them up briefly, they seem similar to Renmatix. Not in the same space as those three mentioned and I don't believe they will be as profitable either. But it's a step towards sustainability. No part of them screams automated strain engineering."
2021-04-24 19:21:08,wallstreetbets,"Projected revenue comes from the CCs I've been on with the CEO.

I believe they IPO'd 11 years ago and this post is just to point out a turn around on a very undervalued stock. It didn't fit anywhere before but now with 2 new synbio stocks coming in it's nice to see the price multiples that are coming out finally. Also this post was meant to call this stock out before their revenue explodes. Their model can have exponential growth limited only to fermentation tanks. Every 70M they put in can generate 200-400M annuall."
2021-04-23 23:04:56,wallstreetbets,"Good to know.

I've wanted exposure to this sector for a while, but have struggled to settle on a sensible allocation.  For now, I plan to start with Amyris and Ginkgo, and I need to figure out how many eggs to put in each basket.

You mentioned that Amyris is way ahead of the competition.  However, their market cap is approximately $4 billion, while Ginkgo's expected valuation will exceed $20 billion.  Do you know what accounts for that discrepancy?  I assume Ginkgo is a larger company, and/or they have more future upside, but I would love to hear your (more informed) thoughts.

Thanks again."

2021-04-24 09:31:08,wallstreetbets,"The good thing is that Mvis under $24 is a steal. The stock hit that price not long ago when it release that they had the components for the Lidar unit, imagine when they release more info on it. Not to mention halogen components and the hundreds of patents they have under their belt. I prefer my money here rather than some jerk off SPAC. Also, the fact that we can fck over the shorting bears is enough for me.

2021-04-24 09:54:57,wallstreetbets,I always pussy out on these things and don't buy. I always tell my self I'll catch the next one and then don't. God damn it. All my money is in GME still waiting for it to do something
2021-04-23 20:46:38,wallstreetbets,"Yeah after GME I chose to relax on meme stocks but MVIS has strong DD and really strong reasons to buy, for the past year not just Microsoft but also Apple has showed a ton of interest in them. With the huge government holo lens deal announced by Microsoft then there is a lot of reason to believe mvis stock has a ton of room to go. Not financial advice but I think with the right backing this could very easily be a $100 a share stock"
2021-04-23 21:23:18,wallstreetbets,this stock has spiked up a couple times in the past only to be dumped back down again. won't it dump on monday as well?
2021-04-23 22:17:21,wallstreetbets,Same here buds! I only bought 10 shares but at $13.43. Had a 39% gain on the day. Thank you for the great info.
2021-04-23 21:28:55,wallstreetbets,I’m glad I got in at opening 🚀🚀🚀

2021-04-24 15:05:55,wallstreetbets,I can't play like big boys but in at one share.
2021-04-24 03:07:17,wallstreetbets,Guys..trust me..Uxin is about to be next GME..dont ask me from where i know..just action  now and you will thank me later.
2021-04-23 20:41:51,wallstreetbets,Go to the mvis sub and read u/S2upid DD and decide for yourself. I’m buying more Monday. 350 shares 14.47 avg.
2021-04-23 20:54:07,wallstreetbets,"As a holder of 1100 shares and 15 calls I would buy more on Monday if I had more powder. However just know that the calls are getting pricey, but still profit to be had, and you could always buy shares. Just don’t expect the 300% return that some of us had today..."
2021-04-23 21:46:48,wallstreetbets,"I have been in since before the first run to the 20s months ago.  I have fully convinced myself there will be amazing news thursday, if I had free cash I'd put more in mvis."
2021-04-24 08:14:05,wallstreetbets,Rumour has it april 29th thisll skyrocket. Big news has been brewing for a while now. Best in class Lidar demo results or a buyout is the chatter
2021-04-23 23:34:39,wallstreetbets,"Well. This isn't advice.

But mvis has gone from 10 to 18 and back to ten all in the past two weeks.

Am I glad I bought in both times?

😉"
2021-04-24 14:34:25,wallstreetbets,"Ive always been a catch it out the gate or dont bother with it type myself. Ive seen way to many people get burnt thinking a meme stock or earning report increase still had life in it, then boom drops literally right when they buy, i mean ask yourself is better to regret buying and be flat broke or regret not buying and still have the funds for another stock on the rise. Or just figure out the fair value and decide from there."
2021-04-23 21:55:23,wallstreetbets,"Monday before you miss the wave, get in early though. After this weekend of hype, it’ll rocket!"

2021-04-24 18:20:51,wallstreetbets,Funny thing is the gay bears are here and down voting the shit out of me 😂😂😂 means MVIS is indeed the play.
2021-04-24 19:33:16,wallstreetbets,As soon as you take your money out of GME... Bam! GME +1000%
2021-04-23 21:53:14,wallstreetbets,"Agreed. This week will be wild between ER and LiDAR press release. I’m expecting a slight dip Monday, but I won’t be surprised if we see $30-35 by close next Friday"
2021-04-23 23:37:14,wallstreetbets,"After losing ample money making my first half dozen options plays and things like buying Gamestop at 220, and being down significantly, I'm now proud to say that I'm back to even after cleaning up on mvis this week.

And then I look around and see people who dumped 100k plus and think, nothing but chump change.

Oh well, had a lot of fun with all that green today."
2021-04-23 23:34:47,wallstreetbets,No this is a pre anticipatory run for a ER in the month of April that shareholders have been waiting for for over a year now. This is a major catalyst time for MVIS
2021-04-23 23:01:19,wallstreetbets,It will be dumped back down to 10.50
2021-04-23 20:08:44,wallstreetbets,is that where you think the stonk is headed? or is that your profit on the day?
2021-04-23 23:14:55,wallstreetbets,"You’ll recoup man, I’m going to continue buying. I’m fairly confident this company will be worth $100 per share post buyout"
2021-04-23 21:12:46,wallstreetbets,Alot of dickheads on the internet. And they love making sure u know theyre a dickhead ☝🏻☝🏻
2021-04-23 20:53:11,wallstreetbets,This was not the financial advice I was looking for and you most certainly won’t be blamed if I go broke
2021-04-24 00:22:39,wallstreetbets,"Ew the comments on there look like the fake ass MSNBC Reddit bot comments I was seeing on other stocks to distract from GME.....

I bought 100 shares last Friday (and sold a covered call way too early this week) after only seeing that it was gaining popularity on WSB but yeah those comments... big turnoff"
2021-04-23 22:44:13,wallstreetbets,"I waited for a dip in Friday to buy more, it never did. Gonna be lucky if I get one on Monday and I will be buying a lot this time"
2021-04-23 21:36:27,wallstreetbets,I'm at 500%
2021-04-24 19:37:15,wallstreetbets,"That's not very apelike. Me no think this is way. Gonna have to keep an eye on you. ""Sarge, we got a hanger."" 

Kidding obviously. I've definitely been there. Actually with MVIS. Got 1k at 16.50 a few weeks ago. Sold and bought back some CCs though so I'm down to about 12.50 after collecting those premiums. Still, I was kicking myself when it dropped to 10 soon after I got in. Friday was most definitely a pleasant surprise. ~Two weeks ago, I sold a July $17C on half and Aug $19C on the other half that are still open (almost bought to close them Monday for what would've been a nice profit, and could've sold another yesterday, but did I mention I'm an idiot ape), so if they take me out, my gains are limited. Long time until expiration though. I'm happy either way. Any gain is a W. Not a bad return if they do exercise anyway, for a month holding. I'll just have to catch the next moon train. Let's go AMC!!!"
2021-04-24 19:48:08,wallstreetbets,"Hope you're right, but that's exactly what I was reading every where at the end of last month when I got in way to high. ""April is the month... Gonna blow after Easter... Etc."" I guess it's still possible, but it definitely dipped big before it came back to where it is now, which is a little more than where I got in."
2021-04-23 23:32:19,wallstreetbets,And we'll be there at the bottom to scoop it up for the next run
2021-04-23 23:38:08,wallstreetbets,Sure hope so. I sold today. Ready for another trip.
2021-04-23 20:09:42,wallstreetbets,How is a shareholder vote a catalyst? Not bashing GME because I genuinely think the moves the leadership has made are positive. I just don’t know why that would be seen as a catalyst
2021-04-23 21:08:05,wallstreetbets,Gme is over
2021-04-24 19:47:05,wallstreetbets,Profit for the day :)
2021-04-23 21:11:22,wallstreetbets,Its not where its headed
2021-04-24 12:09:36,wallstreetbets,It dipped to like 10$ jsut a week ago lol. What did you buy then?
2021-04-24 19:57:42,wallstreetbets,I can agree with that thinking!... but the main difference now is having a set date that we know we will hear from management! It should at least hold up or go up decently until Thursday IMO
2021-04-23 23:51:46,wallstreetbets,Ya sold mine too
2021-04-24 02:14:36,wallstreetbets,"We strongly believe that GME has been victim of naked short selling. So if the vote shows more existing shares than 70M, it is a proof of their illegal activity and the shares will be recalled which will lead to a short squeeze.

Regardless, this stock is going to $1000 in the next few years without any bubble. The squeeze is just the cherry on top"
2021-04-23 21:10:24,wallstreetbets,Like holding onto a toxic marriage cuz you only remember the good times
2021-04-24 07:04:44,wallstreetbets,k bro
2021-04-24 17:44:46,wallstreetbets,Did buy MVIS back then too..
2021-04-23 20:58:34,wallstreetbets,"Can you elaborate please ?
Thanks"
2021-04-24 03:31:11,wallstreetbets,I made a lot of money off GME but this is just delusional.
2021-04-23 21:07:09,wallstreetbets,"Yes, absolutely. I’m driving right now, so I’m going to give you an abridged version at the moment with the understanding that I’ll go further into it when I get home. The simplest way to kind of explain it quickly is to say that Microvision serving a very specific part of the market right now for lidar. A large portion of their technology is specifically designed for use in automobiles to be able to see, detect, quickly map, and then avoid the things coming in front of them. It’s how the auto driving systems work. I am the other hand I’m using something called a Velodyne  Geo-MMS Navigator VLP-32C. This is the one they use in the Amazon rainforest when they’re trying to find Incan in Mayan temples under foliage. The strength of the beam on mine is good at max strength up to 200m in height, and delivers you a point cloud that is unparalleled. Using something like that in the car would be the logical equivalent of using an atomic bomb to clear the snow off your driveway. The thing is, mine also cost $100,000, so In no way should you expect them to be even remotely comparable"
2021-04-24 03:44:28,wallstreetbets,"Nice, I've also made great money. The long-term is solid regardless of the squeeze (win-win)"
2021-04-23 20:48:28,wallstreetbets,Wait so you work for micro vision?
2021-04-23 23:24:38,wallstreetbets,"Got it thanks and great info.  So Mvis lidar is not always the best to use, but is the best for cars which is I assume one of the largest markets for lidar. Also as you said, Mvis is cheap enough for use in 
 situations  where others Will be way too expensive to compete."
2021-04-23 23:32:29,wallstreetbets,?? How did you get a sample of their product? Pretty sus
2021-04-23 21:45:05,wallstreetbets,Nah I just did a lot of research into the company.
2021-04-24 19:52:44,wallstreetbets,"No, doesn't work there but he's family. He married the stock. 

Just kidding u/mbarilla. I'm in MVIS with you and ready to moon."
2021-04-24 05:52:21,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I totally passed out when I got home. I’ll give another shortened version of the answer but slightly more elaborate. The same way you don’t need A 50 Cal mounted to a Humvee to shoot a deer is the same way you don’t need the same set ups for things like this. The one I use for my work is fucking enormous, but it’s totally inappropriate to mount on the front of the car because it’s, like I said, killing a fly with a sledgehammer. And in terms of where I saw the microvision lidar, you need to understand what these things are and look like. What you see is a visual representation of what the sensors are getting back as a data point cloud from the beam itself. There’s other companies that make the exact same thing with the exact same kinds of technology. Microvision didn’t invent LiDAR, they applied to something. Even with that said though, there is examples of exactly what microvisions LiDAR looks like after it’s processed through the data software. I’ll post a link to it right now. I think it’s actually even labeled microvision at the top of one of the examples. And even if it’s not the newest, 2021 version of whatever they’re using, the technology hasn’t dramatically, earth shatteringly advanced in any dramatically meaningful way that would render it being/looking any different than what you’re looking at. The differences will be in its ability to pick things up that I couldn’t before.

2021-04-23 23:51:47,wallstreetbets,"Hey, I just wanted to say I’ll respond to this when I get home. I’m driving at the moment. It’s not like a complicated or crazy explanation as much as it is just kind of detailed to explain and have it make sense. And by “explain”, I mean try to type or speak while I’m driving lol."

I’m 25 years old and have been smoking everyday for the past 7 years, and nothing to really show for it. My Parents are old now and my family isn’t big, so I just want to show them all, that all those years of sacrifice was not for nothing. It kills me knowing I have all this potential to change things, and then I don’t use it to better my life and those around me. So I’m going to go ahead and try to finish 2 years worth of school in a year and a half and get my bachelors degree. I’ll be the first in my family to graduate with a degree if everything goes as planned. 

Wish me luck boys, hope we all get rich next week."

2021-04-24 00:31:13,wallstreetbets,Anyone that is holding MVIS... I bet Microvision will release Lidar press release before earnings. I’m guessing Tuesday. This is just a hunch because in August they released some cool videos the day before earnings. They have been releasing PR almost every week lately - so I am hoping we get an update early in the week but if not we will get one on Thursday. With all the movement on their board of directors and the CEOs new employment contract I think we are close to a buyout! They will want the price to run up close to the buyout price (and the shorts!? Have they covered yet!?!)

2021-04-24 10:01:59,wallstreetbets,"BUYING OPTIONS ON EARNINGS IS FOR CHUMPS. 

If calls & puts are your weapon of choice in general playing earnings is a losing proposition . The IV on all options is never as high as per just the day prior to reporting. So even if you are on the right side of the bet the IV tends to drop right after any company reports and by default the option prices decreases. Best is to play them 10 days prior to earnings or two days after."

With the Market the worst thing to happen is for you to get lucky, or have to long a win streak.  The better you do early the worse long term you will become because you won't really gain the ability to calculate risk effectively.   I honestly hate the fact I started Options last May.

It's pretty much wall street boys wanted an easier way to make money so they made index futures for themselves. High leverage, high liquidity, 24/5 schedule, tax advantaged, trades in ticks, cash settled, no PDT rules.

It's basically the god financial product made for degens and yet nobody here trades them.

For those wondering a contract is roughly equivalent to 500 SPY shares. Every $0.025 SPY moves you make (or lose) $12.50."

If you are buying at the current share price and did not buy into meme pricing BB (this is not a meme stock now and it never should have been) is great value and has huge growth coming. All the EV manufacturers will be competing to sell a car while BB has a lock on the software side of the EV business. I’m in for 11,000 shares of BB now and I’m already in the money with my average CPS. There is so much good news about BB lately and to me it’s a good growth tech stock to be in."

2021-04-24 06:11:41,wallstreetbets,"I just read Wiki def of an iron condor WTAF 😳 
Posted below for intellectuals 

The iron condor is an option trading strategy utilizing two vertical spreads – a put spread and a call spread with the same expiration and four different strikes. A long iron condor is essentially selling both sides of the underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of calls and puts, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money call and put respectively. The converse produces a short iron condor. The position is so named because of the shape of the profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied bird, such as a condor. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the ""body"" and the outer options as the ""wings"". The word iron in the name of this position indicates that, like an iron butterfly, this position is constructed using both calls and puts, by combining a bull put spread with a bear call spread.

On my 2019 taxes, I didn’t report the income, because I figured she already handled it. 

I’ve been waiting for my 2019 refund for a while and finally got it. they ended up processing it as an extra payment and I got the full payment back plus my refund.

2021-04-24 06:35:02,wallstreetbets,"The hot dog is an option trading strategy utilizing two sides of a bun – a mustard spread and a ketchup spread with the same expiration and four different fries. A long hot dog is essentially selling both sides of the underlying instrument by simultaneously shorting the same number of mustards and ketchups, then covering each position with the purchase of further out of the money mustard and ketchup respectively. The converse produces a short hot dog. The position is so named because of the shape of the profit/loss graph, which loosely resembles a large-bodied hot dog, such as a schnitzel. In keeping with this analogy, traders often refer to the inner options collectively as the ""dog"" and the outer options as the ""buns"". The word hot in the name of this position indicates that, like a hot butterfly, this position is constructed using both ketchup and mustard by combining a mustard spread with a ketchup spread."

The company I'm calling about has earnings in the next 60 days and many potential catalysts, and I bought in a few years ago, and it's done well but I don't know if I should stay in, it has products that are used by many other companies and in fact I even have some personal items by them.

Probably save more money in the long run since he can put me in institutional funds which have lower fees than the retail versions, plus can bypass the crazy minimums. Like some of the vanguard managed funds have $50,000 minimums. Fuck that."
2021-04-24 07:13:19,wallstreetbets,Is this a freebase joke? You know you have to tell me if it's a freebase joke otherwise it's entrapment.

2021-04-24 13:03:27,wallstreetbets,That means it should drop again which also means it won’t and we should buy calls
2021-04-24 13:41:55,wallstreetbets,Too risky. A high interest savings account should do the trick
2021-04-24 16:45:21,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but the premium gained from selling farther out is > the cost to close the 5/21s. At close the 5/21 12.5c was $1.53 each and selling 10/15 20c would get me $2.20 each, for a net credit $.67"

2021-04-24 17:05:02,wallstreetbets,They’re planning on charging $70 for it too. Why would anyone pay that when they could come here for free?
2021-04-24 16:54:29,wallstreetbets,"I went to their website, and they’re raising money through Gofundme. They’re doing virtually nothing, but taking all of the profit."
2021-04-24 16:57:29,wallstreetbets,"I hope to god not. Considering both the content, and funding is crowdsourced this is the laziest cash grab I’ve ever seen."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,Vizio flew under the radar. Why do more people not trade it? Yolo 
2021-04-23 21:32:19,wallstreetbets,It went from $18 to $22?
2021-04-24 02:12:08,wallstreetbets,"Vizio makes some damn good TV’s. But, it’s not just a TV business. They’re going after roku. As far as your mom and dad are concerned, maybe your grandparents, that’s the only gateway to content they’ll ever be able to understand. They’re not streaming content on a smartphone. Try and walk a boomer+ through switching inputs and using multiple controllers."
2021-04-24 04:11:42,wallstreetbets,This is a bear play right?
2021-04-24 08:13:29,wallstreetbets,Nah
2021-04-24 13:39:57,wallstreetbets,I was arguing with people that it was a good play and then forgot to buy some lol
2021-04-24 15:38:12,wallstreetbets,Vizio quality has gone to hell. Can't believe in the company can't believe in the stock.
2021-04-23 20:20:57,wallstreetbets,You can pay for no ads on Hulu. It’s like 2 dollars more a month if I’m remembering right.
2021-04-24 00:58:17,wallstreetbets,"Good luck finding a tv that doesn’t. Everyone clamors for a 60” dumb tv, but they subsidize the price by selling access to our attention. I would love a straight hdtv monitor, but if it’s $2k I’ll just get the regular one and never connect it to the internet."
2021-04-23 21:01:42,wallstreetbets,"When Hulu came out it was subscription and ads exclusively, so I vowed to never to pay for it. It's now over principle that nobody but I care about and my objections are no longer associated with reality"
2021-04-24 00:39:20,wallstreetbets,Who pays for Hulu?
2021-04-23 21:08:59,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. Hulu kind of sucks anyways; I canceled mine.
2021-04-24 08:12:20,wallstreetbets,User name checks out
2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"GME from a brokers perspective Not to be dramatic or anything but I would rather die than talk about GME anymore. Some clarification before you send a message to your broker:

The information just came out today so the information will not be there until Monday, please calm down. It is not a conspiracy. 

Please please please do you due diligence before you place an order. Different order types do different things. There are plenty of good reputable sources online that go through everything. I suggest using investopedia. They are great! 

You needed to have bought your shares before April 15th to participate in this meeting or vote.

Please do your own research on a stock before buying anything. Don’t get your information from a stranger on the internet, including me. 

Sincerely your local broker with a new drinking problem 😂"
2021-04-24 04:40:05,wallstreetbets,Man you have to get asked about a stock at your brokerage job? What is the world coming to.
2021-04-23 23:04:40,wallstreetbets,You probably shouldn't be in customer service I'm thinking.
2021-04-23 22:35:09,wallstreetbets,You seem like a good person.  Sending my thoughts and prayers during this difficult time.
2021-04-24 15:08:59,wallstreetbets,This sounds like a scared broker who either has or is about to lose all of his money on his short positions.
2021-04-23 20:06:01,wallstreetbets,Calm the fuck down Karen
2021-04-24 00:58:33,wallstreetbets,"I plan to sit and spin on GME. I know what could happen when I bet in a casino.  
At the end of the day, if I get my money back I'll be more than happy. At least in those months its 76 shares nobody else could play with."
2021-04-24 08:48:57,wallstreetbets,You should just make videos debunking conspiracies as you hear and read them.
2021-04-24 12:47:57,wallstreetbets,"At first I thought this was an anti-gme post but now I see you’re just tired of being raked by people with emotional problems who lost it all to the meme stocks most commonly GME. I really feel for you I can’t imagine. I’ve argued with people at JCPennies over 2 or 3 cents on the price of some clearance clothing and if some internet phenomenon drove an unending hoard of those people. I’d have a drinking problem too. I’d bring a flask. “Well idk what to tell you Brett, you didn’t use your diamond hands and you got screwed. Just buy back in and see what happens, sell when you make something back. Now excuse me I have 46 more people to tell this today” would become my standard response"
2021-04-24 17:11:45,wallstreetbets,Sick of talking about GME? What are you retarded?
2021-04-23 20:39:38,wallstreetbets,Seems like a pretty good take to me

2021-04-24 12:12:22,wallstreetbets,There's no date and you know it. Available shares are going down down down though looking great.
2021-04-24 12:40:13,wallstreetbets,I have a friend that does that. I’m not like able enough for that.
2021-04-24 17:27:21,wallstreetbets,Yep! I actually am long GME too and have no problem with the short squeeze. It keeps my job interesting. What I am tired of is misinformation and stupidity. And on top of that the bull headed responses when they don’t like my answers. Before this 90% of my interactions were kind and people who genuinely wanted to learn. Now at least half are rude and impatient. And some of these responses has made me think I told these people no before. I get the same vibes 😂

2021-04-24 12:39:35,wallstreetbets,"I’m not an intern. Some people are dicks, some people lose money, some people are making money off of telling dumb people to do dumb things. It’s not a clear cut situation. I’m mad about a lot of things and sad about even more. Believe what you want, though."

The point flew right over their head"
2021-04-24 16:23:46,wallstreetbets,Why are people downvoting your comment. It literally went over their retarded heads. It’s this level of retardation that makes me question the overall DD that convinced me to have a stake in GME
2021-04-23 20:10:16,wallstreetbets,"You deliberately chose to waste your own time by fielding questions on here...

Must not be very busy or good at your job"

2021-04-24 12:27:13,wallstreetbets,I see you've never worked retail and you're getting a taste. Shut your mouth is what you learn to do
2021-04-24 12:59:04,wallstreetbets,If I implied a date is known to you I’m sorry about that. Wasn’t my goal
2021-04-24 00:32:39,wallstreetbets,"Wait. Hold the fuck up. You own shares of GME and understand the hype around it. Which makes me think you are familiar with Wall Street bets. You are a broker, and you are upset that people are interested in the very stock you are invested in, and spend time on a Reddit page that is mostly about GME?"
2021-04-24 11:47:50,wallstreetbets,Who the fuck is putting their life savings into meme stocks? If that’s really happening it’s referred to as Darwinism. I’d rather have idiots penniless than wealthy. When idiots become wealthy they frequently run for public office and then their idiocy really starts to take a toll on the rest of us.
2021-04-24 04:13:36,wallstreetbets,Why couldnt they vote? you bought lambo with their gme money?
2021-04-24 11:46:23,wallstreetbets,"Wow the kindest most humane broker that ever interned at FUGotMine corp.

2021-04-24 11:24:42,wallstreetbets,"I thought this was about your poor customer service skills but you keep repeating people are losing money.   
Yet according to you the calls are about voting and the people are assholes.    
That does not add up. Broker intern? Call center more likely since you said 120 calls, getting time and a half today, not even on commission."

2021-04-24 07:42:35,wallstreetbets,I lost a ton on GME. Then I made 3 tons. Now I'm holding some bags at a reasonable price and am making income selling calls and puts. I love this stock.
2021-04-24 11:42:03,wallstreetbets,Good catch. This mix of hate and concern doesn't scan. Broker intern hm.
2021-04-23 20:16:29,wallstreetbets,"This is my free time... I happen to be enjoying this. It’s fun to talk about things you are passionate about in your free time, don’t you think?"
2021-04-23 20:18:18,wallstreetbets,Also why do you care what I do? It’s my choice. If you don’t like it don’t interact?
2021-04-24 08:29:40,wallstreetbets,No that’s not why I am upset with the whole GME thing. Did you read my post at all? I could talk about this for hours but basically I’m tired of the entitlement. If you don’t know what you are doing than ask before you do it. Stop cussing out people who are trying to help you after you fucked up something easily avoidable.
2021-04-24 10:06:19,wallstreetbets,They bought after the 15?
2021-04-24 00:56:49,wallstreetbets,A lot of people came to WSB during the hype and may have taken WSB advice before the normies outnumbered the originals and bought options. Options absolutely can expire worthless and leave you with realized losses even if you don't sell.
2021-04-24 13:29:57,wallstreetbets,Thanks

2021-04-24 15:42:44,wallstreetbets,"You say anybody who bought options in GME past january deserves to lose money. I say anybody who bought GME above $20 deserves to lose money.

But certainly anybody who hasn't sold shares that are tanking haven't realized losses yet, they're just losing the opportunity to invest that money into a profitable investment. Educated people will usually call that opportunity cost a loss, but if you define things questionably you can avoid that reality effectively."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"I figured out how to prevent RobinHood from closing positions at 3pm on expiration date. Yes, RobinHood is awful but it's easy to use for my degenerate gambling account. My 'adult' account is elsewhere, no need to lecture me. That said, I've sorted out how RobinHood closes positions on expiration. I'll walk you through the rough logic on the server side, then explain how to keep them from closing positions you want to hold until close like a true degenerate. 

At 3pm EST their system starts the following sequences;

3:00 - Does user have an option expiring today that they do not have funds to exercise? If yes, cancel sell order and notify user.

~3:04-3:09 - Sell all options expiring today that are OTM and users do not have sell orders for, or are ITM but not enough buying power to exercise. Sell at bid.

3:10 - The process starts over, and repeats the previous process. 

This is every ~10 minutes as far as I can tell, until 15-20 minutes before close. At this point the process is restarted every 5 minutes roughly. 

So how can you hold something until close? Create a limit sell order above the bid, and as soon as you are notified that your order has been cancelled you need to create a new one. This will prevent the next step from being executed, and you can hold those options until the very end like a true degenerate."

2021-04-24 12:11:22,wallstreetbets,RH did that to me. I was so pissed off since I ended up taking a loss. You know what I did? I closed my account and gave their app 1 star review. I also use TDAmeritrade. TDA never did that to me. So I'm just sticking with TDA.
2021-04-23 21:57:27,wallstreetbets,"So this app is basically known to steal people's hard earned money. But after some rigirous trial and error, I think I figured out a way around 1 of their tricks. But it only works about 5 times and then they threaten you to stop doing the thing so they can keep taking your money. I really hate robinhood but I can't leave because they won't give me my shares when I try to transfer.  They'll hold up the process and I might not be able to sell at the opportune time. So I'm basically a hostage  with no means to provide any ransom money to get out because they'd probably fucking steal that too."

Remember, if the TD guy can on average get a 1 cent better fill on an options contract, they've made up that commission.

For an example, my non-RH broker which does fairly decently  with fills did worse than my buddy on TDA when we put in an order for the same option a few seconds apart, with me putting my order in first. He got filled and I didn't and wound up having to increase my price to get filled immediately."

2021-04-24 00:33:46,wallstreetbets,"You insisted EDT, I said EST. ET would technically be correct, and you insisted the inverse of what I said so why are you so adamant about this?"
2021-04-24 00:48:26,wallstreetbets,"Because between 3PM EDT, EST, and ET, only one of those is incorrect at this point in time and it's EST.

Not every part of the US observes DST so if you're going to specify explicit timezones like EST instead of implicit ones like ET, it's important that they're correct otherwise you're saying the wrong thing.

If I wanted to get lunch at noon but I told you 11 AM, and when you called asking where I was I responded with ""well you know what I mean"" wouldn't you find that a little bizarre? That's essentially what you're doing when you use EST when you really mean EDT.

You were correct when you said it's not worth arguing about since you've already decided in your head that you're not going to attempt to understand why EST and EDT are an hour apart.

If I'm in Arizona where the timezone is MST (-07:00) (they don't observe DST so it's MST all year around) and they were to convert 3 PM EST (-05:00) to MST (-07:00) they would get 1 PM MST, but since you meant 3 PM EDT (-04:00) the actual time is 12:00 PM MST.

The miscalculation is true for any timezone since you posted the wrong time, I just used MST as an example since it's one of the standard timezones still being observed.

tl;dr just use ET for Eastern Time if you can't be bothered to use EST and EDT correctly."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"MindMed to be listed on Nasdaq! Time for a trip to the Moon 🍄🚀 MindMed is a psychedelic medicine biotech company that studies how shrooms, LSD, and even MDMA and DMT can help treat depression. Honestly, I already confirmed their studies to be true in college.

Anyways, MindMed has been trading OTC in like Canada's market or something (I guess there are companies that exist outside the USA) so only brokers that allow OTC trading let you buy it. As of today though not anymore!

They announced that they will begin trading on the Nasdaq on Tuesday, April 27, 2021 under the symbol: MNMD.

Reasons I invested:

1 To get in before Nasdaq listing (not too late to do so)

2 Always saw the psychedelic market to be the next drug market to boom (It still is relatively new market, more research and potential catalyst in the future)

3 I believe in the research (our generation is like number 1 in rising depression cases and most treatment for depression sucks. This research can be revolutionary for depressed apes that Yolo'd too many FDs or actual depressed apes that aren't retards.\[Edit: Other mental health issues they are studying to treat are; anxiety, addiction and ADHD\])

4 Kevin O'leary AKA Mr. Wonderful is invested in it (I usually don't buy into celebrity endorsements but Mr. Wonderful believes in the company and he doesn't invest in something he would lose money in. Also he did mention MindMed to Cathie Wood in a four panel interview on CNBC a week or two ago. So possible Cathie Wood interest after listing)

5 Nasdaq listing allows more money to flow in (after April 27 robinhood retards can throw YOLO money into it)

6 I like the Stock

The only disclaimer is that I am not a financial advisor and this would've been a YOLO post if I didn't lose so much money on stupid PLTR calls

Mods plz this is my first legit post here ever

edited a lil more info

Edit2: So there are people getting banned for mentioning the OTC ticker because its not 1b market cap. But it def is over 1b, sitting at 1.1b rn on Yahoo.

To see how this company has progressed over the last year has been incredible. You all should get to know the owner and founder of MindMed JR Rahn. His story is one of millions that have dealt with the effects, trauma, crisis and addiction. He is so humble and intelligent. I never invest in companies I only see monetary value rather ones that also solve world issues. Mental health and opipiod addiction post pandemic is a crisis too. JR Rahn is a father, husband and problem solver. His connections are world known. I can't say enough great things about Mind Medicine and it's future. He frequently does interviews with a gentleman named Aaron Missere and many of us have been able to have our questions answered. MindMed is not a get rich quick fix company. Everything they do is done with such precision and true logic. I'm glad they are finally getting recognition so deserved. They are well connected to Switzerland 🇨🇭, Germany 🇩🇪, Canada 🇨🇦 and the USA 🇺🇸... The CEO if you haven't checked out his LinkedIn profile yet well, it speaks volumes. Having big connections to possible Chinese markets can bring many other institutional investors. Anyways I'll leave it at that now. I'm one happy lady right now. Thank you MindMed and Reddit and the WSB community for allowing me to share my opinions about this amazing company. It's going to take me awhile to adjust to the ticker MNMD but I can deal with change.

2021-04-24 06:28:42,wallstreetbets,"Great company imo, happy to have got in at CAD $.67. I believed in it then because of the research they own patents on, and the backing of solid investors...they also support a serious need in exiting a rampant opioid epidemic (doing great research on ptsd as well).

They are definitely not the only company in the space but they are one of the best. The news about Nasdaq has me hopeful for a push to $20 at the minimum....play smart, play, and know your risk tolerance though :)."

2021-04-24 07:52:05,wallstreetbets,"My 2020 stimulus went into mindmed at .40 a share when it hit $5, I sold 75% now left with 500 free shares. The Nasdaq listing opens up margin trading, so many of us that didn't have any more money to add to the position will have a few more bucks to throw at it in the early moments of the listing. Just something to keep in mind for those that put all their eggs in this basket."

2021-04-24 15:07:40,wallstreetbets,"Price targets for NASDAQ Day? 
My guess is $6.80 minimum.

I'm basing this on. Compass Pathways 71% increase on their NASDAQ Debut. 
Yes MMED has already rallied 68% on the news of uplisting. However. At $2.70 CAD last week it was highly under valued (possibly insider knowledge of F8). So the 68% rally thus far has put us in around the $4 mark which I would argue is close to true value. So $4 x 1.7 =$6.80 which is a 70% increase. Also I am not sure if Compas Pathways announced their NASDAQ listing publicly for a pre listing rally. Anyone able to confirm when CMPS announced IPO, how many days before listing.

I also think with the MMED following being stronger than Compass we could be looking far beyond 70% or $6.80 shares? Whats everyone's thoughts on this?"

Highly believe in the effectiveness of such treatment. I truly believe without some high quality LSD 25, and psilocybin I had as a very young man (16), I might have been a total maniacal lunatic by the time I was 25.

I am sure this treatment is not for every type of person or diagnosis, but I felt some lasting relief from the isolation, anxiety and depression.

I think they likely mean, how do you become aware of penny stocks as individual companies worth investing.

I heard about mind med during the gme craze and decided to yolo some money because I wanted some skin in the yolomoonape game.

However, that is just pure luck.

2021-04-24 12:08:09,wallstreetbets,"Hello. 

**Disclaimer:** I asked the same question on another post on MMED. I did not get an answer, so I am trying in this post.

\----

What do you make of the "" MindMed Announces Filing of Preliminary Base Shelf Prospectus and F-10 with the SEC under MJDS PR Newswire"" ?

Ref: [https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mindmed-announces-filing-preliminary-shelf-213200818.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/mindmed-announces-filing-preliminary-shelf-213200818.html)

One can read in the article: ""The Base Shelf Prospectus and Registration Statement, when made final or effective, will permit the Company to offer and sell subordinate voting shares, multiple voting shares, warrants, subscription receipts, units or any combination thereof (""Securities"") **in various offerings having an aggregate value of up to CAD$500 million during the 25-month period that the Base Shelf Prospectus remains effective.""**

Market Cap of MMED is today: **$3.18M** with a Public Float of **194.89M**

**Does the CAD$500 million planned offering, mean a 10x increase of the number of shares in the next 25 months?**

I am a newbie with all this financial lingo...

Thanks in advance for your insights."

Just an anecdote but my gf was very interested as she was looking for some purpose in her work, she asked a friend of a local business what they would offer her as a licensed RN they paid $26 an hour as a 1099 only offering part time work.  She was receiving $34 an hour with benefits from her current job, so essentially they make so little money that their rates were around half of market.

2021-04-24 00:10:54,wallstreetbets,"I think there is some money in patenting a psilocybin delivery method. Pills take to long to be convenient in regular CBT therapy, but there are a couple of pending dissolving oral strip concepts that have real promise.

You are 100% right though. This is a mental health biotech play. I'm bearish on national weed companies. Anyone can make the product and there isn't much economy of scale over stake level companies. But psychedelics have huge clinical applications that have gone largely unexplored for sixty years and what we already know it's game changing. Some of the research us putting psychedelic aided therapy orders of magnitude more effective than anything else for some serious problems that impact millions of people. There is a lot of fucking money in that, especially with new generations of adults that aren't scared of therapy or psychedelics."
2021-04-23 20:41:39,wallstreetbets,Very well said. This is absolutely a biotech play rather than recreational drugs targeted at the average consumer. The population that MNMD will reach are clinicians and the health care industry such as prescription meds. Imagine investing in Eli Lily Co or Pfizer back in the early 2000s when they were releasing SSRIs and other antidepressants. This is mind medicine now.
2021-04-23 21:36:03,wallstreetbets,Now this is a very intelligent ape
2021-04-23 22:08:18,wallstreetbets,That's more or less what Kevin O'Leary told Rahn. No recreational aspect. All clinical research and finished products to market for different ailments.

Maybe should have stopped beverage industry after Barqs. Look you fucking lepton: YOU DON""T NEED A MONOPOLY TO MAKE MONEY. Just growing and selling shrooms can be absurdly profitable. Retail price similar to tree, much quicker crop cycle, can get 50 units from a 10'x10' room with shelves and it ain't remotely as easy as growing herb. The demand for mushrooms relative to the supply is laughable. We are in the first inning if not warmups. Mycology Phds aren't always successful right off the bat growing. Patents are great but selling boomers and microdose teas on a large scale will get someone a hovercraft fuck whatever you think and this ridiculous drivel."

2021-04-24 01:47:06,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's this thinking that got drugs criminalised in the first place and encouraged the marginalisation of natural remedies."

I've not been one to do any type of drugs but after following and breaking down the compounds and diving into the history as well as changing to a holistic way of living I decided to see what this could do. Let's just say since that day I'm not the same person.... I quit my job in Government with Alberta Health, I haven't taken a single pill, I interact with my children like our connection was never impaired, I am able to communicate effectively in personal and professional relationships and I no longer live in fear of what others think about me nor do I feel the need to judge others. It truly helped me, although I think a controlled microdose and therapy would make this even more effective, what I've taken from my one time experience was life changing. ❤"

2021-04-24 04:51:08,wallstreetbets,"Hi! The Nasdaq up listing just means that another exchange will be added to the list already available which is Frankfurt and NEO Canada. 

The only thing that will happen is more people will have access to buying Mind med shares because many brokers don’t trade penny stocks on other exchanges. Like Robinhood. When a price on Nasdaq goes up due to massive buying volume, your Frankfurt shares will also go up. All exchanges match closely in price so you don’t need to worry about missing out. 

It’s all about volume and that’s why people are excited about it being listed on Nasdaq as it brings a lot of buying volume. 

Hope this helped."
2021-04-24 06:40:37,wallstreetbets,Degiro mate
2021-04-24 10:34:01,wallstreetbets,It will be available on Robinhood on Tuesday! 🍄🚀
2021-04-24 13:16:44,wallstreetbets,"If you don't need the car to commute to work or can just take the transit or cycle then put all the money into Mind Med. Cars are an endless money pit. Insurance, gas, maintenance, parking. Sheesh. I spend about $5760 on my vehicle a year. All that money can be used to invest."
2021-04-24 13:17:50,wallstreetbets,Infant stages. Buy Monday before uplisting tuesday and your golden.
2021-04-24 13:29:48,wallstreetbets,This stock has a lot of room to grow so you can’t go wrong either way! 😬📈

2021-04-24 07:06:17,wallstreetbets,:(
2021-04-24 01:16:48,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. The uplisting is not an end all be all for this company. The trial results are what really matters and will ultimately determine the fate of this company. However, the uplisting is great for expanding to more potential investors and people that wouldn't ever consider the possibility of psychedelics being used in medicine, and that would also help with easing people out of the stigma surrounding them. Yes the hype will drive the price up for a bit and I see it as a good swing trading opportunity, but it will likely fall again until there is news about trials. I'm long on this as well so NASDAQ doesn't really affect my excitement more than for the reasons I've mentioned. Having experience with psychedelics, I see the potential these substances have in mental health treatment and I really hope at least one of these trials works out."
2021-04-23 20:08:48,wallstreetbets,Mindmed is currently trading on the OTC market I believe schwab and vanguard allow OTC trading but Tuesday MindMed will trade as $MNMD on the NASDAQ and most if not all brokers will trade $MNMD

2021-04-23 23:30:54,wallstreetbets,You will have to wait for the big day on Tuesday where it will trade on Nasdaq as MNMD
2021-04-23 23:53:15,wallstreetbets,Ticker stays the same on the Canadian side. In other words you don’t have to change anything.
2021-04-24 04:07:14,wallstreetbets,Yes
2021-04-24 03:08:36,wallstreetbets,If you think this is just a mushroom stock you have not done any due diligence.
2021-04-24 04:45:10,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have to worry. It won’t be converted but that doesn’t matter. Their will be 3 exchanges in which you can purchase on Tuesday instead of the 2 currently available (Frankfurt and NEO Canada). 

However, prices match on all exchanges to within a few cents. Meaning if Nasdaq prices go up, so do Frankfurt and NEO prices. 

I also have Frankfurt shares. Just sit back and relax :)"

2021-04-24 16:50:29,wallstreetbets,You can buy on any trading app that has access to the OTC or NEO exchange. If your platform doesn’t allow trading on those exchanges then you just have to wait till Tuesday when it gets listed to the Nasdaq

2021-04-24 04:09:24,wallstreetbets,Invested in Mindmed and Numinus. Numi is also my favorite bc they are partnered with MAPS-which gives them access to leading psychologists/therapists with experience in psychedelic assisted therapy. This includes MAPS phase 3 MDMA assisted therapy trial treatments for PTSD expected to get FDA approval by 2023👍🏻
2021-04-23 21:32:01,wallstreetbets,You can buy on Tuesday when it goes onto the Nasdaq!

2021-04-24 01:32:24,wallstreetbets,Psychedelics are not exactly a cure they're more of a catalyst for change. It immerses you into a powerful experience that brings your mind to the root of your mental issues. The whole integration period after is where the change happens. You use it as a learning experience to understand why your mind is working the way that it does and makes it easier to make positive changes afterwards.
2021-04-24 13:36:59,wallstreetbets,"As a son of two psychologists, I can tell you that there is no medicine that will cure depression. Depression is a mental disease with psychological origin, no pill will ever cure that. The only actual cure is, as far as I know, conversational therapy. Meds however help a great deal with the symptoms while people try to get better. Meds in this field have prevented a lot of pain and many potential suicides."

That positive change you mention could very easily be a negative for a lot of people.

You’re talking to someone that had a mother prescribed to Xanaxs for serious injuries and got hooked on them after years and turned out to be a meth head. Don’t be stupid. This is another way for pharmaceutical companies to get rich AGAIN. Lean was used for medical purposes it is liquid heroine and people drink it like it’s soda. These drugs will be used and handed out like candy. I know 20 year olds that get prescribed xans like nothing. Don’t be a dumb ass.

Also the fact that a doctor prescribed medically(in Brazil)to a patient red light Holland’s magic truffles and the gouvernement allowed import for medical treatment speaks volumes.Canada has even allowed for import of the magic truffles into a Canadian lab.
Red light took a different path then all the other companies and this path will lead to same destination except for we will have revenues this whole time unlike everyone else who is just burning money.

2021-04-24 00:14:54,wallstreetbets,It’s only available on the OTC (US) market and NEO exchange (Canada) until Tuesday when it gets up listed to the Nasdaq and will be available on all platforms :)

This treatment would be prescribed to those that are determined to be good candidates for it, just like any other drug. I think the psychedelic experience along with proper therapeutical guidance after would greatly benefit a lot of people."
2021-04-23 21:42:27,wallstreetbets,"Well you just showed your ignorance, Lean is actually made with prescription cough syrup (Codeine) Makes it hard to put much stock in anything you say. But yes drugs always have been abused and always will be. No doubt about that. They also help a lot of people. I work with a girl who gets the prescription GHB for narcolepsy. Before she could barely hold her job, or any job because she would fall asleep in meetings or at her desk, even in the bathroom while taking a wee. Now you'd never know anything was wrong with her.

Thing is rec users are always going to find a way to get high, even if this or any other psychedelic company stopped all R&D tomorrow. Dosages are not really going to be attractive to someone looking to trip off it but you're right some will try, and thats the bad side of it. I say let them develop it and do some good with it. But most of all I say I'm an investor and there is a market for it. I'm here for the tendies."

2021-04-24 15:24:44,wallstreetbets,"Yea like your edit says that's what my understanding is for most psychedelics, but it's still quite a grey area. 

It's exciting to see this sector becoming more and more legit and hopefully these treatement options become available soon. I know they can help alot of people. I've been on alot of medications over the last 10 years, and for me personally they all had bad side effects, no benefits, or lead me into a cycle of addiction (benzos). 

I'm not the stereotypical psychedelic fan who's against antidepressants and modern medecine, or believes psychedelics can cure everyone and have no potential side effects. I have however found LSD to be very beneficial to my anxiety disorder/depression, and am a believer in this space. 

I think therapy will play a huge role in getting the most out of these substances, because while they do have some non-trip related benefits due to it's mechanism of action and effect on the brain, it also is really cool how when used properly you can re-train negative thought patterns into healthier thoughts and outlooks."
2021-04-24 12:34:03,wallstreetbets,There website is pretty crappy. If you go back and watch interviews with JR it’s all there or look up all the PRs from the last year. Lsd reversal is huge because they can claim they have the only “safe” large dose lsd treatment method. Lsd lasts way to long for most practical therapy sessions.

Also, does tolerance build up fast? I have to imagine that would be an issue with long term daily use."

2021-04-24 06:46:12,wallstreetbets,Btw alcohol is at number one at the chart that i looked up and i hardly believe alcohol is worse than cocaine. It seems like the chart is based on number of cases instead of toxicity
2021-04-24 15:07:07,wallstreetbets,Damn you’re stupid. Alcohol is legal and #1 on that chart. Lsd/shrooms are psychologically addictive and cause psychotic episodes especially in those with mental health issues which plenty of people have. Giving mentally ill people something that can make them go psycho doesn’t sound to bright. Especially places like Oregon where almost everyone has mental issues. Don’t worry no one will abuse this at all 😂🤣😂

2021-04-24 16:48:25,wallstreetbets,I can link you plenty of studies on low dose heroine. Don’t worry no one abuses that either
2021-04-24 03:50:38,wallstreetbets,It will only trigger if it opens below your limit price. If there is a gap up (which could happen as was seen on Friday's open) then your order could not fill if it opens higher than your limit price is set at.
2021-04-24 10:46:11,wallstreetbets,"You clearly know nothing about drugs if you think codeine is nearly as abusable as heroine. While it certainly has the potential to be abused, you literally can only gain so much positive effects from it before you're overloading your body with too much for your liver to process and wasting it. Also if you think shrooms are at all even close to being comparable to opiates or benzos you clearly have zero understanding of these drugs."

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"Why it is time to take your profits on OCGN I have been following OCGN for months when they initially partnered with Bharat Bioscience and was initially extremely bullish and rode OCGN from $6 to 16 the first time. After doing more DD, there are too many risks for OCGN to be valued even at 2B.

* OCGN only makes money on Covaxin vaccinations in the US
* The 70% efficacy is significantly below both Pfizer and Moderna, which we already mass produce enough of to cover the entire population for as long as we need
* They still need EUA approval, which will take several weeks if not months, as there would still need to be an independent trial conducted in the US
* By the time their vaccine is maybe approved, 80%+ of people in the US would already be vaccinated
* Covaxin takes a long time to manufacture and OCGN still needs to develop the manufacturing facilities in the US to even start manufacturing
* The price of vaccine is low, like $10-20 total, the small margins then are split among OCGN and Bharat Bioscience(the company who developed the vaccine)
* They only make 45% of profit per vaccination in the US, only place where they can sell it, which is about\~$5 They would need 25 Million vaccinations a year just to make 125M, not happening
* They had adverse reaction issues they swept under the rug in India in order to fast track this to market: https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00145-8/fulltext

TLDR Even if OCGN gets EUA, it will take too long for them to get the vaccine to market in the US, the margins will be low, the market will be saturated, and their efficacy is lower than American competitors.

Positions: small short position of 300 shares, will add on as hype dies

Position update: 500 shares short at 12.24 -> Covered at 9.64, booked 1.3k in profit.

2021-04-24 14:20:40,wallstreetbets,This didn’t age well..... that D.O. deal was already planned in March with MEGA RICH health focused Investors they agreed upon buying the share at $10 last month the 10 million shares already had a buyer since last month that money is suppose to fund U.S operations to further strengthen the push for Covaxin into the U.S Market. Covaxin is becoming very appealing to many countries as it’s the only traditional vaccine and it can defend against every COVID variant.

2021-04-23 20:50:55,wallstreetbets,"I always appreciate a shorter stating so up front. A few things you are overlooking,
IMO...I refused to take Pfizer and Moderna  but was semi comfortable with JNJ because it worked like a flu vaccine and didn’t mess with RNA. Otherwise I wouldn’t have bothered getting vaccinated. I didn’t want two shots. I didn’t want to mess with boosters. To be honest,
I likely won’t get any more shots. One JNJ was it for me. 
I know a lot of people who have no plans to get vaccinated because they don’t trust any of them. I do think additional new vaccines are a good  thing and have a place. It’s called competition. There is a need for more because there are still a lot of people who want something they can trust actually works. You don’t determine what “i” or anyone trusts. I did buy some stock but sold."

2021-04-24 00:41:10,wallstreetbets,"Ooooooohhhhhhh.  I just got an idea.  So if we run a pool on the exact amount the AMC squeeze peaks and say the 1st place/the one closest gets 4 percent of the pool. 2nd and 3rd place gets 2 percent each.  4th -10th place gets 1 percent each.  11th to 100th gets 0.5 % and 101st - 505th get .01 % ish.   The guess range is from 100k to 1M.  1 share per vote. 5 votes max.     Can only win once.  This would give everyone  incentive to just f'kin hold.   

So what if:  500k total votes and for the math let's just say 100k is the peak.  Thats 50Billion.  4 percent of that is 2 billion.  2 percent is 1 Billion.  0.5 % is 250 million 0.01 % is still 25 million.  And this is low Ballin it.  (The votes and the peak)

The best part  it can help ensure people f'kin hold."

What if Ocugen (which some guy somewhere said citadel just recently shorted past 100%) is actually a small money, small scale version of GME that citadel is testing to figure out what strategies would work best to make the most money when they have to cover? 

It started its steep climb around $5.50. Move the decimal over two places: $550. That’s right around where margin calls would most likely start coming in. Pretty convenient to analyzing a strategy if you just have to move the decimal. 

Plus, Level 2  shows all of the sell orders are stacked in a at a constant climb, which could simulate a constant rise in price. And there’s major sell offs at mental breaking points on the dollars and on the $.5s, to simulate well, major sell offs.

2021-04-24 00:00:00,wallstreetbets,"How r/Wallstreetbets changed Wall Street Below is a link to a video currently running on the front page of [CNBC.COM](https://CNBC.COM), titled ""How meme stocks, Reddit and retail investors flipped Wall Street upside down"".

It gives a history of ""memes"" from birth, through infancy, up until today.  TIL ""meme"" was a phrase coined in the '90's by a guy trying correlating Genes of the New Generation, hence Memes, into infancy social media posts.  Interesting.

In any event, you can watch the video yourself, 9-minute run time, but at least this subreddit gets a mention of being the catalyst for sweeping changes on Wall Street, particularly hedge funds, and they way people invest.  I think we would call that gambling, but whatever.

I didn't take this as a smear campaign or a ""buyer beware"" piece, just reporting facts.  It's worth 10 minutes of your time, if for no other reason, to see that a group of individuals can challenge the establishment.

2021-04-24 01:23:49,wallstreetbets,"Meme: an element of a culture or system of behavior that may be considered to be passed from one individual to another by nongenetic means, especially imitation.

That’s the definition of a meme as coined by Richard Dawkins. Not “a funny picture with words.” Funny pictures with words are just one kind of meme, but so is all the stupid shit you did in high school like repeatedly saying “your mom,” “that’s what she said,” playing “the game,” etc. Literally anything you can pick up from someone or be taught intentionally? Also memes. Just typing, “I like the stock”? Meme."

All of the remaining insider shares unlock next week.  That's why you've seen a lot of positive (but meaningless) media reports on them over the past few days.  They want this thing as high as possible before they dump their shares onto you, the retail bag holders.

NKLA only has \~$1.75 of cash per share on hand.  They have no real tech, and are about to have a bunch of shares dumped onto the market.  If you think they do have value, do yourself a favor and wait for a better entry.  And if you're swing trading it, or currently bag holding, be careful, it might be about to get a lot worse for you."

So here's a concise version

My personal definition of ""Silly Drop/Pop Opp"" - instances where market/investors ***considerably*** overreact to news/developments directly and/or indirectly related to a given company...

**AHCO** (52 wk range $14.55 - $41.58) // next ER 5/6 BMO

Leading provider of **STAY-AT-HOME** (this is important) medical equipment

dropped like 20+% last week because their Co-CEO (yes they have another fully vetted and competent individual to navigate) - again Co-CEO got charged w tax fraud....

So you like - hold the phone - dude are you tryna to somehow persuade us this might be an opportunity ??? Well YES!!!

1. charged - NOT convicted
2. charged - ...... waaaaaait for it...... IN DENMARK (idk what's up w Denmark thing but all business is in  US)
3. charged - for PERSONAL stuff he, allegedly ran in 2014/15
4. company sent the culprit Co-CEO on unpaid leave like same day and issued a statement reporting the charges have nothing to do w AHCO business
5. before the ""Danish Affair""  - hedges were accumulating; most notable Jay Pee Morgan and Chase
6. Also before the charges - Co received several upgrades in the $40-50 PT range
7. after the charge - updated ratings came out but lowering PT slightly and no-where near current lows
8. last ER - **Co upped guidance for 2021;** now afak Co's don't dole that chit out willy-nilly unless they are pretty much sure they can deliver and maybe then some; last thing Co wants is to deliberately over-promise and under-deliver. Co did miss earnings and as i understand it, in no small part due to financing of various accretive acquisitions of complimentary business)
9. Calls been accumulating past two weeks around - $35-40 strikes; outnumbering  25-30 puts
10. My two cents - stay at home medical equipment business should have only grown since last ER and going into future - obviously we are not fully open; aging population growing etc

2021-04-23 21:48:31,wallstreetbets,"What gives you confidence in the May options, any catalysts to let this rebound? Otherwise, might be better to consider this an opportunity for shares, as it may only recover organically, not in one month."
2021-04-23 23:35:47,wallstreetbets,"next ER is on 5/6 (Q1/21 reporting) - i was thinking they should by then be realizing some synergies from acquisitions; Q1 product/service demand should have stayed strong/growing since we are just getting to ""opening of the economy""; thinking by then there should be some developments regarding the charges and what direction the Co will take with Luke McGee - am actually thinking they should have something decided before ER but it's wishful thinking at this point 

This sharp drop was due to the development on Luke McGee so  I certainly would like to see investors/market taking the advantage of  the ""sale"" and getting back into position moving the SP over $30 confidently; it has done so a couple of times since the drop but is not holding; thing is it's not your sexy widely recognizable name; the business itself is rather pedestrian - i mean they are not launching EV's in outer space or nothing so imo opinion ER will be the main driver in the near future that might give SP a significant boost - and they have to surpass the expectations...

Since i'm in options and  i've mentioned this before the Volume/OI are not great - so i see it now i've jumped the gun to get in; bids/asks are getting a bit more agile now; it looks like could have had same calls for around same price but for June to give more time.. still thinking w ER on 5/6 and expatriation on 5/21 is enough time for my calls to get printing provided of course my directional bias confirmed and broad market co-operation (as with anything)"

If you judge them by modern capitalistic poverty standards (i.e., omg their USD GDP equivalent was only like $9 a year!!!) then sure it seems like their ""system"" was way worse, but I don't really think that's a meaningful metric for comparison."

I don't have to work in a field all day for enough to eat. I walk a few feet to the kitchen or bathroom, turn on the tap and out comes clean, drinkable water. It even comes in hot and cold, however I want it! I don't have to travel each day to a well or spring with water that might randomly make me sick.

Many people also think that if the USA would have public healthcare, it will somehow magically transform into a communist / socialist hellscape, even though many countries have successfully implemented it and spend on healthcare much less than the US spends.

For the people in poor countries there's a lot stopping them from living our lifestyle, but for us (maybe you in particular?) there's nothing stopping us from adopting their lifestyle again. It's not like there's anything restricting people from working in fields or drawing water from remote wells rather than the tap. There are still places on earth where people live hunter-gatherer lifestyles and for the price of a one-way plane ticket anyone can choose that. And there are people who have chosen to ""live off the land"" and are very happy like that, while others have chosen a middle-ground that they enjoy. The point is, we are lucky because we can choose. Most choose not to, but it's hard to argue that we're not damn lucky to have that option these days."

Drawing water from wells or other natural water sources: if you're a hunter-gatherer where else are you gonna get water? You take the nearest water source you can get, and if it's far away, you gotta go there carry it back each day. I just go to the kitchen sink though.

Hunting: methods like persistence hunting involve chasing prey until they are too exhausted to run and overheat. This is one of the oldest methods of hunting and the human body is uniquely evolved for it. We don't have sharp teeth or claws, we're not particularly fast or strong, but our bodies actually have exceptional endurance, which makes this method effective. Regardless of method, hunting requires quite a bit of tracking and traveling, with varying levels of success. If you sprain your ankle or break your leg, you and your tribe are in trouble.

Gathering: involves traveling larger distances foraging for food. Since you're not farming, it doesn't all grow in one place and food sources are dispersed over large distances. You'll spend all day traveling around, gathering food, and expending quite a few calories just to attain more.

Both of these require more effort than working a field, which was the appeal of agriculture, ""right"" or ""wrong"" it may be. Wouldn't it be nice to grow things in one place and raise animals in one place?


Here's the San people doing persistence hunting: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=826HMLoiE_o
It's not an ancient time, that's a contemporary video and people still live these hunter-gatherer lifestyles.

San people in the Kalahari Desert, and the Rarámuri people of Northwestern Mexico still use persistence hunting. You can take a one-way plane ticket to places like these. There are many places on Earth where life is like this. In fact, more of the world lives in poor conditions than wealthy ones where people have spare time to post on reddit. It's definitely not glamorous once you try it, but if you really want to, you have ample resources and no valid excuses not to take that step away from modern society. It's just that most people say these things but deep down don't actually want to do them."

2021-04-24 01:42:02,wallstreetbets,"AZ did disclose their single dose efficacy and also confirmed delaying the 2nd dose up to 90 days increased efficacy. This sort of benefit in delay has not been verified by covaxin. From what I gather from colleagues in India, they pushed it out to 45+ days, and that can be a problem if the single dose efficacy is not as good given the massive surge in cases. AZ and Covaxin use different vaccine tech.  My concern here isn't about the full dose efficacy of covaxin, rather the lack of transparency."

2021-04-23 20:38:03,wallstreetbets,"Ok, sorry for the noobness, but... calls:

· Call 17.06.22 AMD 88 @ $1: This means I pay $100 for 1 contract, which is the option to buy (paying for them) 100 shares at 88 by 17.06.22. So it'll be worth executing it if the shares are a bit over $89, and then I'll have 100 shares worth over $89 for which I paid $88x100 (for the shares) + 100 (for the contract). Is that correct?

If so, what about these calls I see?

· Call 17.09.21 AMD 60 @ $2: Does that mean that the person offering this contract thinks AMD will be under $60 by 17.09.21? I can see that, because it is more likely to be over $60 than over $88, this contract is more expensive and you would pay $200, but compared to the above one for example, the benefit would be huge if you only have to pay $60 per share and they are worth, let's say, $89 as above.

So in the first case you will break even, while in the second case you would be earning $29x100 - $200 = $2700.

Additional question: In the second case, why wouldn't anyone just buy that and execute it straight away for free earnings? I'm struggling to understand why that particular case exists at all... I think it might be because you don't get 100 shares, but just 1 share by paying 100xpremium, so in the second case you would need the share price to reach $260 in order to see profit.

Did I get it right? Can you correct any mistakes? Thanks a lot, never bought calls before, but I'm interested in trying."

2021-04-23 20:56:35,wallstreetbets,"well one of the big things that makes me bullish on a run with good earnings is that they have traded sideways for the last 2 earnings pretty much. they are lower now than they were right before october earnings. 

for october earnings, you had the xilinx acquisition and the fact that they ran from 50 to 80 off intel's delays and good earnings in july. you could make a case that it had to cool down.

Jan/feb earnings had the fact that a large bit of their earnings came from tax credits which isn't quite as sexy as other forms of earnings since it isn't something to expect every quarter.

I would be extremely surprised if the missing 20% from intel datacenters were AMD/NVDA since intel literally said that it was due to oversupply. That said, AMD is so low in market share that i think oversupply shouldn't affect them too much.

All that said, if the impossible happens and it truly was due to AMD, i expect this stock to be at 100 by next week

BTW, i would absolutely love to see your further analysis on them. What do you think about the risks of RISC V to x86? how do you see xilinx integration allowing AMD take on NVDA in the ML/AI space? xilinx is big in automotive, any inroads for AMD integration there?

2021-04-23 21:06:36,wallstreetbets,">their guidance is usually spot on

I just checked the last two years of ERs: In 2019 they were all correct up to the first decimal point, so yes, pretty much spot on. But in 2020 their guidance was consistently below the actual revenue, esp. in Q3, where the actual revenue was 10% above the estimate.

Now, it's probable they will be correct this quarter since the capacity has not increased yet, but I think there is a possibility that they could increase revenue if they for example increased ASP or sold more to DC instead of consumers."
2021-04-23 22:59:20,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, there's more competition. But if last quarter Joey sold 10 oranges and Suzie sold 1 orange, then this quarter Joey sold only 8 oranges but Suzie sold 2, guess what, overall market sales went down. Even though Suzie doubled her sales.

2021-04-23 21:23:21,wallstreetbets,"> Apparently it's a material component shortage upstream that's causing it 

Umm, I think you're talking about semiconductor wafers, which is what TSMC produces for companies like AMD, NVIDIA & Apple. They've basically been at 100% production for most of last year. It's only a shortage because the demand has increased significantly.

The solution to the shortage is either lowered demand (which would be bad for companies like AMD) or increased production, which is what TSMC is currently planning to spend over $30bn per year on."

2021-04-23 22:11:34,wallstreetbets,Hard to say; I’m more risk adverse with AMD because I really don’t know what to do with them. I think buying shares are selling CC’s are the way to go; leaps would be my second choice.
2021-04-23 22:17:05,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying that it won’t move 4-5% in a day; because it does move like that on occasion, but it usually doesn’t end up that high. As for what we’ve seen the last two months; it’s been more sporadic: hitting +3% and then dropping 3% the next day and repeats the cycle for a week until it ends up +1% overall and then repeats the following week. So yes technically it’s had +-3% the last few days"
2021-04-23 21:18:15,wallstreetbets,"Sure, but to give credit where it's due no one would have expected the demand that came out last year for computer equipment. Literally everything was sold. That's pretty uncommon. It's also an error in our favour so I'm willing to overlook it :) we may see the same this year, but I wouldn't expect it, they like to meet goals.

They probably will increase revenue thanks to higher margins, I agree with you there, but they're also known to be buying more capacity at TSMC and their roadmap has them shifting some production to 5nm this year, likely for DC which may offset some margin gain because of higher cost, but will further increase 7nm capacity for consumer and commercial sales.

It'll all go hand in hand, it won't all come from margin. This is a good thing. It squeezes Intel on margin while AMD is better set up for a price war, and also gets them market share."
2021-04-23 21:24:37,wallstreetbets,It was the Xilinx deal that the market doesn't like... they're still in the penalty box because of it... imho.
2021-04-23 21:46:54,wallstreetbets,"While it's true investors haven't reacted well to the deal, I think it's because they don't understand what it brings to the table. All they see is dilution, but they're not considering the extra earnings, profit margin, acquired engineering talent, etc. It's a great long-run play with some immediate benefits the second the deal closes. FPGA's allow AMD to really spread its wings in the server market and specifically tailor CPUs for applications. They'll be able to show better performance over price vs the custom cpus amazon, google and microsoft are making."

More of a conspiracy than facts. But with Canada going into business with BB, shows me they provide better security than others. I’m no cyber/communications expert but a country’s government picked BB over others. Those institutions have experts in that field drafting white pages on the topic and they base their decisions on that. So I wouldn’t say their services they provide are subpar. They must be able to compete or exceed their competition. I know their financials never showed any outstanding moments but they are in a whole new market now. Before it was just phoned that gave them their popularity. Now they are trying to be the best in cyber security and communications. The world will soon be moving to EV. Electric vehicles, more importantly autonomous vehicles. Chandler, Arizona has had a taxi service that’s autonomous since 2018. BB created software that will allow apps across all manufactures interfaces. Example would the same app across android and IOS. I’ve just completed a white page on autonomous vehicles in London. They have been implementing this since 2016. With the direction the world is heading I believe cyber security will become a big part. You don’t want someone hacking into your car and just drives you into a wall or changes your destination. Consumers sure won’t want that let alone the manufacturers. All speculation and time will tell. I agree their financial sheet has been subpar for years, but they also might be on to something here and positioning themselves for a “minor setback, for a major comeback.” The partnerships they have entered too, seems other big companies have faith in them as well. Just my two cents. And I’m a dyslexic, autistic, Italian who flips his charts upside down when they are pointing down to show them pointing up."
2021-04-24 16:43:44,wallstreetbets,"I mean it's possible Obama handing out phones could have been a catalyst? 10 years ago? But it's an irrelevant point now.

Most if not all governments contract cybersecurity firms for some services. I think the US government has 23 approved cybersecurity providers? It's not really a new concept. BB was contracted by the Canadian government to provide a UEM - but their are other providers of UEMs to the Canadian government too, like Microsoft Intune.

Usually it just means they're approved as vendors, and the varying agencies can choose from a list of approved vendors depending on what they need. Blackberry UEM seems to be a fairly secure option which is why a fair few governmental bodies choose it - but outside of the public sector it's not a very popular UEM. And it doesn't dominate the public sector.

I think this is the worst myth the WSB/reddit BB hype has perpetuated - BB isn't really a wildly innovative cybersecurity company. Microsoft/VMware/IBM have better UEM solutions, Crowdstrike has a far better UES solution. BB isn't seriously a large contender in the cybersecurity space. 

Putting aside that people have said we're moving to autonomous vehicles soon for the last 10 years and we keep missing targets, BB QNX isn't a good revenue generator. It makes less than $4 a vehicle and it's rapidly losing market share to Linux/Android RTOS'. Hell if you think EV is the future, you should see that Tesla is entirely unreliant on BB and doesn't use any BB products, VW is looking to create a whole new VW.os that will mean no QNX. IVY is an interesting problem but how has it differentiated itself so far from other vehicle data platforms from Google/Microsoft or the host of other companies making the same product? IVY enabled vehicles won't ship until 2023, it's a long time to hold onto for what could easily be a subpar product tbh.

I think it's a little easy to say ""look at the partnerships, other companies have faith"". AWS partners with 1000s of firms on 1000s of products. Arguably the fact that IVY is using ML/AI from Amazon shows BB doesn't have the in-house talent to develop such solutions - which kind of worries me. 

I'm not so convinced there'll be a major comeback. A minor comeback sure - QNX will sell, IVY will sell. Their cybersecurity products need some catching up tbh. I think the major issue is they'll struggle to attract new talent, patent sale will strip the company of a big chunk of revenue and widen losses. I'd certainly expect a downside swing before an upside tbh"

2021-04-23 20:50:42,wallstreetbets,"Lol wow you truly don’t know anything about this stock huh? It DID hit $20 a month or two ago.

But the idea is MVIS will probably be bought out by a much larger company, and the payout to shareholders could be much larger.

Even if a buyout doesn’t happen (which by all accounts it will), the share price is def going upwards"
2021-04-23 21:47:04,wallstreetbets,"Jesus Christ you are dumb.  You are way too young to be investing. You think because a stock was once a certain price it has to get there again? Like Jesus Christ kid 

Im not saying mvis is not worth it- I’d love to see mvis go to 50 but shit you are dumb lol. You should quit while you’re ahead"
2021-04-23 22:08:54,wallstreetbets,"Quit while I’m ahead? You’re the one who sold, expecting it to not go much higher.

Don’t blame me for your bad financial decisions. MVIS is the leader is Lidar technology. It’s worth way more than the current $17 price even.

There’s no “obviously in hindsight” about selling at $14 being a bad decision. This thing has been in the making for the past year.

2021-04-24 10:13:20,wallstreetbets,"You cannot give $TTCF the same multiple as $BYND; it's wrong.

You need to give $TTCF the same multiple as CPG industry - which is 3x revenue at best on average (and most are even lower than that - as it depends significantly on GMs); then forecast their forward growth and use a discounted revenue basis to today for it.

$BYND has a higher multiple (and personally believe it's over-valued - but that's another story) - because it's aggressively targeting TRADE business - trade has higher GMs and scalability than CPG in Grocery/Retail - especially as Beyond is International front as well.

Key example - I can buy Beyond Meat products in Starbucks in the UK at £4.99 (just under $7), the margin on that is huge, the distribution in a key outet (Starbucks) gives it higher margins and higher distribution than Frozen items in a supermarket.

Based on current analysis - the fair value for $TTCF is closer to $10-$12/share and would depend significantly on their ability to increase GMs and exceed revenue growth expectations.

Other things you need to be aware of:

* CFO promptly left with no notice
* 5 Material financial red flags in latest 10-K
* ""Recently, an insider director bought 250k shares on April 15th."" - no he was gifted them by the CEO at $10/share - the CEO sold his shares for $10/share - the CFO refused to sign off on the deal - so he left and the new CFO signed off on the deal.
* There is further reduction in revenue expectations (not highlighted in analyst day) - as some grocery offers reduce revenue rather than come as a cost
* The advertising campaign is terrible; started late and is going closer to Summer where natural demand is lower; weakening growth / take-up
* GMs will be further destroyed during a recession - especially as their clients are concentrated - so will squeeze their margins
* The analyst day presentation; the key question; why is revenue not growing as fast as distribution - no clear answer - it's actually answered by them reducing GMs / taking a hit on revenues to get the stock in stores. 
* NPDs are likely going to cannibalize existing shelf-space rather than grow, given their size; this isn't good given their key reliance on a few products for their revenues.

Disclosure: Was long $FMCI -> $TTCF - sold most of it at $20-$26 - as knew April would be a terrible month for them; bearish but no position, not until there is more information re: $200m of cash and what they plan to do with it - and any plans for trade expansion."

back when BYND launched, i thought plant-based meats were just a fad but they've stuck around for this long and the market for it is growing. so my initial gut reaction to it was wrong 😂 which is usually the case with new disruptive shit.

2021-04-23 23:48:20,wallstreetbets,Nothing amazing about 10% annualized - just holding SPY typically will beat that.
2021-04-24 05:41:28,wallstreetbets,"Sure, if you held the covered put for that long, but selling a covered dated a year out, then waiting for IV to crush it, you'll triple APR rate.

Right now there's a 1/21/21 $7 put that has a bid of $0.50; The cover price is $700 per contract with a 7.14% return rate over 272 days. Or 9.59% annual.

Now, accepting the very low likelihood that GME returns to $7 within the next few years. Even as turn-around speculation by itself, I don't see it dropping below $20 in that time. This is the baseline return of 9.59% annually. But closing early, depending on how soon and how low you can close, can easily push this to 13% to 20%.

This is also for the bid price. The spread is high enough on some of these options that your price improvement alone could be fairly high if you're using a decent broker like fedelity.

If you want to play it a bit riskier, there's a $14 7/16 put with a bid of $0.42. APR on this 13.19% for only 83 days. If GME doesn't drop below $50 within the next 2 months, you should be able to close this for about $0.01 in about 45 days. Giving you an APR rate of 24%.

Even the most bearish case for GME is $10 according to analysts. And this was before they raised hundreds of millions and closed like 1/3rd of their debt. The strongest bear case for SPY in 2021 sees a 20% correction this year.

Point is, right now, selling some of these GME puts is both safer and has a higher return rate than SPY."
2021-04-24 07:22:13,wallstreetbets,"I had the same thought and I had tried this with some 2023 $2 and $5 AMC puts. Wow, I thought,  I'm getting paid almost the entire share price for practically zero risk. The problem is that the IV doesn't crush AT ALL that far out. Even when AMC popped to $12, the $2 and $5 puts barely moved. I ended up closing them out for like a 50 cent per contract gain on 50 contracts over 2-3 months. Complete waste of time IMO."
2021-04-24 08:24:13,wallstreetbets,"I mean... it's been what, 3 months since AMC and GME went nuts? And IV is still super high on both. So Jan 2023 is still 636 days out so yes, IV crush hasn't made much of a difference. You'll need to see IV drop to like 10% for it to make much a difference at that range. Over such a short time span.

But for those $14 GME puts 85 days out, or the $7 272 days out...

The rule of thumb I use is for IV and theta to make a difference, you need to work on half-time scales. So for 600 days out, you'll want to hold for 300 days to see real movement. For 300 days out, you'll need to hold for 150 days... etc... So if you had purchased 6 months out and held for 3, you would've seen larger returns.

So when you sold like 700 days out, don't expect much in 90 days. You weren't willing to hold that bet for 350 days it would seem.

Converting bid/cover to APR % only helps you find what might interest you. It's the lowest level of returns, assuming you ignore the risk of getting assigned. And I think $5 on AMC is actually far more risk than some of the GME puts I'm looking at."

They have a lot of irons in the fire and have been having trouble completing trials in a timely fashion compared to peers. The strategy of a broad pipeline for a small company is pretty unique. Generally small bio's have 1-3 products, Sorrento has dozens. Even their Covid programs are incredibly broad. Time will tell if this wildly broad approach is a good strategy or not. The lack of investor calls is a major major issue, meaning you cannot ask the CEO what is going on once a quarter. Totally new for me and I really don't like it. I own a whole lot of shares and basically view their Covid pipeline as a means for post Covid therapeutics.

Their stem cell treatment, MSC, is pretty novel. Their supplier can apparently scale to 8k doses a month 10/10 folks in a hospitalized and ICU setting left within 3 days of the last infusion. While, Covid may abate prior to EUA, ex-covid 150k Americans die of ARDS for a variety of reason. Worldwide a multiple of that. That is a big big market opportunity post Covid if it works, and there are no existing super effective ARDS treatments. This would be a unicorn.

Abivertinib trial which is ending this month is exactly the same re: ARDS, but they can manufacture that at much larger scale than stem cells. We don't know if it works, but if it does then that worldwide ARDS number becomes a reachable. It is also somewhat effective for NSCLC so dual use there as well.

The Genemab DARPA funded project, which we have heard nothing about since funding, could be a Covid surprise. It is a therapeutic and prophylactic, so sick and well people can get it w/ some duration of protection. Small dosage and no cold-chain issues (I believe) so that could get rolled out at scale in places like India and Brazil.

Net, it's an interesting company with a whole lot going on, some good potential science, horrid communication, trial/FDA execution problems and dilution issues. I plan on staying long and keeping an eye on it. There is some massive upside potential and less massive downside potential. Classic asymmetrical investment, and I like to go big on those."

2021-04-23 21:10:26,wallstreetbets,"I think you underestimate how many amateur videographers there are who are going to college for filmmaking and need the inexpensive, yet very quality options like GoPro.

  
There are companies out there that sell cameras for tens of thousands of dollars and still have large volumes of sales (Looking at RED cameras specifically as an example). The quality in GoPros is actually pretty bad in comparison to most pro video cameras, but it has the affordability that makes it so anyone seriously wanting to be a filmmaker can get started with it.   


I used to clown on the company all the time until I actually got into Youtube and Photography. They are making a very portable product, with quality that is fantastic, available to the public for under a thousand dollars.  They may be overvalued, but I don't want to see them fail. In addition, without them, we wouldn't be seeing so many great competitors like the insta360. Sure they may exist without GoPro, but GoPro causes a lot of other companies to push the limits of Quality/Price to a point where the consumer wins."

Keep in mind that US MSOs have a massive moat at this point that they've developed across every legalized state. They have the licenses, the established brands, dispensaries, grow ops... Trulieve alone is already supplying over 50% of all legal weed sales in Florida. Just a fraction of the US market is already making exponentially more money than Canadian cannabis entirely.

You mustn't underestimate the significant time gap between US MSOs hitting the NASDAQ market and international trade policy changes (we are talking years here).

2021-04-24 15:08:53,wallstreetbets,"Economics Explained on Youtube did a great video about what to do in this situation (hyperinflation). Basically load up on debt on an asset (like a house), and then when the dollar hyperinflates, you can pay the house off in 3 years instead of 30"

CZ tweeted about it and rapidly deleted the tweet when he was shown the supply

2021-04-24 00:43:06,wallstreetbets,"Good analysis but you are missing something. You are missing how the telematics data are being collected. At the moment only ROOT is able to do this properly. Since you will need to clean and process the data that is collected from sensor such as  GPS and gyro/inertia before it can be store and analyze. You can checkout this presentation from ROOT here [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jB49HeZbU4](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jB49HeZbU4)

Telematics is not a new industry as they have already implemented in the UK where you can buy extra device and put it into your car to capture and monitor real-life data. However, what make ROOT special is how they are using the phone sensor to collect the data. Which is a very difficult task that can't be easily implemented. Yeah other company have more data and can try it but most of the challenge in my opinion is how to calibrate the sensors properly. And I think this is what the engineers at ROOT spend most of their time on."
2021-04-24 14:29:15,wallstreetbets,"Alteryx is pretty fucking cool. I used Alteryx Designer as an analyst and man it made life easy. It’s great at building processes and moving data. 

Plugging in data and automating reports to send out to annoying VPs so I didn’t have to do it myself every day was sweet

As someone mentioned it is a bit quirky and from my experience there are constantly bugs that limited functionality"
