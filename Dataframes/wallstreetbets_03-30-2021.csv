03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I live in Irvine, CA close to Spectrum mall where there is huge Blackberry building and the lights are always on. So I’ll say BB is still in business. # ApeLogic"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My cat’s name is Vincent. That’s about all the valuable discourse I can add here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Possibly but in the meantime just HODL and buy the dip at $6 cause frankly why the fuck not at this point. Yeah it will take 2-3yrs for those earnings to spike up to the old days but damn it will be worth it if you buy in at 6 and sell for $100. Might take my EEENF earnings and average way the fuck down from $17...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ABSOLUTELY, THEY ARE PIONEERS. BUT THEY HAVE TO STEP IT UP IF THEY WANT TO SEE IT RISE AGAIN....."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the way up is through WSB again!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only think promising is a potential buyout.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention that you can get a small container of blackberries at the grocery store for $2.99 that has to count for something in the moral department
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My cat's name is Vince too. He's a maine coon. He is also the shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#I am gonna be buying the dip until 2069🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess below $7 is lucrative again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man already - %9.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"John Chen just signed a contract to be on till 2023, so I don’t think a potential buy out is on the table anytime soon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends where you are, honestly.  BBs go way above $2.99 in this part of the country."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You ain't wrong
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean sometimes you just gotta wait
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How shitty will that be when a tiny container of blackberries will be worth more than a share of BB. Maybe we need to just start a WSB blackberry farm that we all invest in instead.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,May you steer this ship into Ever Greener waters.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IMAGINE THAT??.... WHOLE GAME CHANGER!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lube with talc and clotrimazole
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's a sexy dip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rkt only dips
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was lower 5 days ago
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did the same
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it again tomorrow on the next dip?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who does not already know, institutions and insiders own MORE THAN 100% OF THE FLOAT and there is a Billion $$$ buy back in progress. 🚀🚀🚀

104 million share float

112 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why RKT when you can GME?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This RKT crashes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Trash
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn strait it is!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought what I could then as well. Just not enough tendies
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there’s one tomorrow, then hell yes. I’m just a smooth brained ape here"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why buy GME when you can buy RKT?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Show us your put positions then
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only trash I see here is you 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,laughs in Brazilian
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I’ve made thousands of dollars from GME and nothing from RKT. 45 @ $80
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course I don’t have any RkT stock, it’s shit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Waxes in Brazilian
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I’m playing the long game with RKT so I don’t care too much what happens in the next couple of months. Long term RKT is a good play. Tendies are tendies my fellow ape.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t disagree with that!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yahoo finance, ok, proof or ban"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how they still label it a gain. 

Congratulations! You just made a gain of -$60,000!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Son: Daddy, what is a bag holder?

Dad: *Shows child this thread.*

Son: GUH"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hold. You may not make much, but you will eventually get your money back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I literally.juat bought calls for January 2022 lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🥸 son get off the internet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fb deal still in the works....possibly 20,000 patents will be sold.....that's a LOT of money!!! Future looks incredibly bright and IVY is being released earlier than expected (feb)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If someone want to check.

This look THE SAME drop after the GME earning report right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#better setup a dip-buying plan.  Gonna be a while 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as YOU believe in BB, it’s the only thing that matters"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why people thought bb was a good play. It reminds me of pltr and uwmc plays. Lots o loss porn

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Optimism to keep the hopium
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get back in the damn house, it's Boyfriend Tuesday!  We'll be back after my bags been held."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dammit, I told her not to marry your kid."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as he doesn't care about money one way or the other, thats what matters?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im so deep into uwmc :( good thing it has a dividend
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad user
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sigh 😔 they always end up learning the hard way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He only loses if he sells lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We all learn and start somewhere unfortunately.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ER was fine in my view.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i feels bad mane i doubled to lower costs but the dip keeps dipping 🥴
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#grab your cheeks wide open and cough... BB is coming
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont understand this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit at this rate I'm gonna have to hold till I have grandkids.  My oldest is 7.  😭
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB will be launched 🚀🚀🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My puts won’t break even until this POS hits 8.05

Finally on the winning side of a BB catalyst"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So if i like the stonk and want to make money from said stonk should i buy puts?? seems like my decision making goes the opposite way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The squiggly lines didn't stop the stock from going down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you say that? I’m also a BB holder
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He lost 17.5k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The number 515 is a mixture of energies and vibrations of the numbers 5 and 1. The number 5 appears twice in this number and that intensifies its influence in the overall symbolism of the number 515.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The design wins in EV were good. Selling the patent portfolio is good. There was nothing about this quarter that made it a particularly critical one as long as they keep pushing forward on all fronts which they are.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a company that's focusing on restructuring their business I didn't expect much this quarter. Revenues were down partially due to an ongoing patent sale and chip shortage. Patent sales are mobile/messenger related. This shows they're serious about change, going to reinvest majority of this capital into their newer product offerings. Ivy expected to roll out early 2022. Good news for longs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck?  Lost me at numbers
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right when I sell, but I'm stubborn so everyone will have to wait."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You monster
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. This is why I never sell out of any of my positions anymore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Will this save my gush positions... probably not. Sigh.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it feel like a coordinated post?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still good to get in at opening bell. Price still down from earlier dips.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MRO is a slept on money printer past few months
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re gonna release more shares to reduce that debt
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at $3 last march. Sold for $11🤘🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/wasupg; i made, then lost, over a million in the last market bubble. 2008 i think it was. and i learned, then, that  YOLO is a big lie. You don't Only Live Once. We have many lives in a single lifetime. And I'd be embarrassed to tell you how much I have lost in my lifetimes.. for all the gains i have right now. We reinvent ourselves constantly. And we balance our losses with our gains.  I was told by one of many Gurus:  ""When something bad happens, ask yourself, ""What is the lesson in this?. Then it will be a gift.""  My lesson in losing so... much... money trading in the market in 2008  was the knowledge and skill sets to earn it all back. On stocks I could afford. Limiting myself to accumulating and holding long. (I was way too addicted to trading. Everyone said go OXY, however, i prefer this price point.  And this particular company. Less than 12 bucks a share?  I think i got that much in my pocket right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL. GUSH I got rid of it last week. I bought it and XLE, but only kept XLE. GUSH started to hurt."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take out the S
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"because i, me, a person,  am your basic human being: currently in my home; on the sofa: in a pandemic; so i hit the ""cross post"" button to share it with my friends on other stock boards here on reddit. i enjoy when other people share an uptick in the wind with me. thought id do the same. you may notice the posts do come from me. i don't have anyone to coordinate with. except two dogs. and they're into cookies. not stocks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/Macool-The-Ape.  What you said. FWIW, getting in at opening bells never used to work for me UNTIL I started investing in MRO.  i got compulsive and wanted feed my share addiction from the .03's- 11.90 while MRO was flying under the radar.  Then I bought in at every single uptick. Damn. I didn't go  out to lunch today and I have enough money for a share of this stock. Under 12.00 a share for a oil company in Texas? A company in biz since the 1800's?  MRO seems such a no brainer to me. Of course i could spend nearly two hundred dollars for a share stock of GME now.... yet whether i go to the moon or the debt collector; the stress ain't worth that price. no way.  I find zero stress holding this stock long. I am not a player. I am an investor."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My 1800 at 18 are with you on this adventure.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$14 bag holder checking in. We’re drilling to the earth’s core whether we like it or not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I’m in at 20, so there’s that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add 4 more shares and it looks to me like 54 contracts that can bring some of that cash back to you every week

Edit- the 4/9 12c alone would bring you in $1,134 in premiums. Me personally I’d take a bit more of a chance and choose a lower strike because it most likely wouldn’t hit $11 by 4/9 and that’s $1,728 in premium for the same date. This isn’t financial advice but come on man, make your shares work for you"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, what the hell are you thinking? 

Buy 5 more shares so you can sell another contract..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bag holder also checking in, looks like we'll all be friends for a long time because I'm not selling for a loss. I either swim or I'm going all the way down. Fuck it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$13 bag holder checking in
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at 9.28 yesterday should’ve waited for today lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"300 shares @$16 bag holder checking in for duty, sir!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you're selling some CC against it until the tendie machine cranks back up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i bought in when it was 27 lol. Then average it down to 23, then sold it all when it was 17. I was lucky. But then I use that money to go into GME and AMC.

Ape is in my DNA"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When GME is squeezed I'm putting half of my portfolio into BB. I really like this stock, so don't worry... I'll come for you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I have $10 April 1st calls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not. There’s a thing called opportunity cost. At some point, you can take that 50k and put it to better use!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you bought in at $5, you would still be holding for the same amount of time.  What's the problem?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB has promise, and I feel it only lost steam because of the RH bullshit and everybody is just too focused on squeezing GME to move over. Give it time"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,13.48  ugh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 18k, it hurts my bum."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy more it goes down I buy more it goes down, what the fuck Chen what the hell do you want from us?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember that's how much you lost so far....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just averaged down the other day to $14.50 lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is not a bag holding when u sell covered calls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sell some covered calls and start chipping at your costs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh what’s another three months
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell ATM covered calls 45 DTE for a higher assignment risk but remember you can always roll your contracts either up, further in time or either both. You can become a master at rolling and roll only into rising implied volatility 😉"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some cc you'll be aight
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least it is going to be much easier to bring that buying average down. This really is a 2 year investment play for me. Maybe longer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah... this will soon blow over and we’ll rocket back up to.... $9.25. 😬
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I bought BB and NOK at the TOP looking for one day of wave riding, we got shut down the next day, and while GME rebounded for a day, these two never moved. I bought BB at 24 and sold at 14.5 and Nokia at whatever it was and sold at 5-6. What a shit show"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why doesn’t everyone here with high cost avg’s double down at this point? Or sell cc’s to lower your cost avg
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same boat brother. :( I bought at $23.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell that crap and buy something else
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cut ur loses man gtfo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,20 @ 24.81 :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either BB or Amc will fly after GME and it scares me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#BB is a turd.  Papa Chen has gotta go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you pressed ""exercise""?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was in at 13.72 cut my losses at 11.70, was just tying up capital"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding with you @13.65
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats quite the loss, Just_Lick_My_Ass. Damn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I might just sell my 270 shares to invest in EEENF in the morning... I originally invested 5k and here we are
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls, you can lower your cost basis and hopefully unload some bags."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,18 average here 💀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s at the same place where it fucked me on December calls lol Earnings was bad then too I was trying to warn people
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,17 @ $22.06 l feel your pain!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤷‍♂️😭😬
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put up your weekly chart with these averages... 52 , 104 and 156 ... Hopefully she holds at this convergence. My price target posted yesterday on someone going bullish prior to earnings ...  $7.50  Best of luck! Have it on my watch to hit that but I'm not going short."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1400 @ $14.90 here. I've got a standing buy order for another 1000 @ $6. I both want it to fill and don't at the same time. But I think it has huge growth potential as autonomous vehicles become more common.  I like the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro. I had 50 shares at $25 on the initial jump up. I was hurting for so long... I’m glad I liquidated at $18 and threw the rest on Tesla puts, was able to make all my money back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. I don’t even want to look at my portfolio anymore
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"17,000 @19.50. 
Bag holder for life!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,21.50 checking in.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You win
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea r/thetagang really makes the money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just a smooth brain. Why would those fly after GME goes to the moon?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? I own shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m on damage control now. I’ll be selling CCs below my cost basis and if I get assigned then good I off this train and I’ll make up my loses somewhere else
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow very smart of you to do that but then again you bought BB at the top so idk lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Always bigger in Texas.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I like to play both sides. FDs and scalping options are fun when it works out, thetagang is definitely smaller percentage gains but they are consistent and somewhat reliable. Shit... even just to get some value back when the underlying takes a shit is nice. I had 1 stock that I was bagholding until I ended up making more back in premiums than what I lost in the value of the underlying. If you’re a young(ish) investor like myself it’s worth it to play smart and take some bigger risks while you can afford to make it back. That’s why I follow WSB and theta. I love having both plays at my disposal. Hell, sometimes I’ll even use my premiums as my gambling money for FDs lol. Better to bet with house money am I right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Edit- I take this back. I’m guessing the bottom of the picture is CCs considering it says collateral?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause of wishful thinking
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because months ago our DD guys showed us the way of BB, also we want a amc squeeze to happen after GME or if it doesn't happen parallel to gme squeeze"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You got this homie
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro my anus was gaping for a minute there lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I do the same thing! Sold a RAD FD on Friday to buy a RIOT FD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes only just spotted that as well. He could should definitely get up to 54 contracts and should also set a closer strike for more premium
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,2023 is the year I guess.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 600 shares at like $19 or so. I've sold like $4k worth of covered calls against these shares so the loss is a bit lessened.. but still awful lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did say that he won’t dilute the stock. So we’ve got that going for us, which is nice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is a long term play. I rarely even check in on the price. If they haven't gained significant traction by the end of the year then I'll start to worry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Their stock popped a wk or 2 after earnings last time. Gonna wait to see what the next few weeks bring.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it helps, I have 15C's that were up 20x at one point and I just stared at them 🤷 

Still got 80 days left on the tires so either Papa Chen takes us to Valhalla or I burn in shame."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"in the same boat my dude, just hold at this point"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been saving up just to buy its dip. Where will it be? $8? $7?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings are exactly where they forecast it.  $0.03 share.

Anyone who was invested in this stock for this earnings report hasn't done the DD.

Partnerships with Amazon, Baidu, x # of Car manufacturers is why we are invested.  And all those were just starting."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got some 9 dollar puts.. *avoids eye contact*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For me BB is a long term hold.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good chance to buy more tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think one of my favorite things to do is wait until a bad earnings report, cruise WSB to see who was betting big and just bask on their misery. It makes me feel better about how much money I loose on a weekly basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The loss porn hasn’t reached its full potential
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine matching your projected earnings and the stock tanks 8%.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i think this was expected though wasnt it? i havent dug too deep on BB but how was their earnings call? any recent DD someone mind linking?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely will be, I'm holding 300 @17can so I'm with you. If you look at the after hours graph it isn't pretty."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess my 10k yolo is better in BB stock than in my checking account. Wasn't planning to touch it till then anyways.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haven’t seen the news. Bad earnings?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe this bad earnings report will have the same reverse effect as the positive earnings reports.  Stocks will moon tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's down 5% already, gonna be a big drop tomorrow for me and everyone. Pain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB dropped more, no surprises here"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some small street bets $9.50 strikes expiring this week. They gonna be worth $0 I’m betting so 100% loss. Small street though so who cares too lazy to even sell what’s left
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted here a few days ago.  WEEKLY chart points to $7.50 and teased that I would buy at that price.  How I chart. WEEKLY CHART .. SMA 52  104   156  1y 2y and 2y price average. This is a convergence play.  Note, I never buy anything and hold. I'm an active trader mostly trading weekly options and use the WEEKLY chart to determining major support or major resistance. Good luck with this one!  I'm Canadian and love the company. Rarely buy shares or short shares. Mostly options trading."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It happened again if you check after hours. Holding BB is like burning a cigarette on your thigh every day
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ain't a lost until you sell. Especially with my large $16 bags. Good think I have it in my IRA which I never touch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost about $700 with weeklies. They weren't FD's because they were in the money when I bought them originally.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh.  That explains the after market nose dive.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's this return to fundamentals in price? We're in the land of the TSLA and GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Took my $1500 losses a few weeks ago. Moved on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it that bad ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Really that bad? I didn't think so
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reports were absolutely brutal, idk how they fucked up so bad."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hopped out of $bb when I had the chance. That shit was wild. Holding my $gme shares now like a boss
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. I wish I could afford to DIVORCE my BB. She keeps doing me wrong.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This earnings call is cringe worthy. Who the fuck is this guy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get the impression they just wanted to fuck retail traders. revenue holdovers, real estate losses, and a bunch of bullshit that seems almost intentionally directed at the stock price. One asshole even through his nose up to ""unprecedented volatility"". they'll probably beat next Q when no one's looking."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro the premium is dopshit for OTM calls, how the fuck you made $4K?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I sold at 15c for may 21. Easy 100$
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on ""chart astrology"" the bottom should be $6 (strong price support) . I doubt it will go that low, but it's very unlikely to go lower."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is true and I didnt expect good earnings. But I really hoped for a small beat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree but the red still makes me sad.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great comment last earnings killed me on calls so I tried to warn people this isn’t an warning play, plus auto delays for chips is bearish on bb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I get that but this shit is going to $4.  There are more sure ways to make money right now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I might if it goes down enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah son.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the true purpose of WSB.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earning missed but they seem to have quite a bit in the pipeline with IVY and QNX that will take a while to realize.  I'm a fucking moron when it comes to this stuff but I still think they have good long term potential.  I'll keep buying every month.  


They also mentioned they have a marketing campaign starting soon in the US and UK to let people know they're not just making phones anymore."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've already written it off.  Not gonna chase that loss.  Just training my asshole for the next one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m also holding 300@17
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think earnings were normal. Exactly what was expected. Stock has dipped 8% after hours though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm tired of it.  I'd rather just realize the loss than stare at every time I login.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah... I don't really understand most of it but even I can see it is devastating. I will hodl this till 2030 now...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im confused.. I'm listening live now are the reports already public ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why were they so bad
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ehhh. Disagree.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean CEO? Seems fine to me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they just doesn't care about share price at this moment. This was never quick buck, even though I had 30$ sell order setup in January and was couple cents away from executing lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow earning down now we're going to see upsides pretty soon given all the good news that have happened over the past couple months so far. Go BB go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i bought pretty much right at the peak and immediately sold a $25c.
here's just one of the calls i sold -
https://i.imgur.com/sk14p1t.png"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Never maybe 6 but it will come back next year as the write offs have cleared their calendar of bad news expect revenue bottom line growth and debt reduction bb to the moon in 2021
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be okay with that, I'd pick up a fuckload. Bb is a long play and will be undervalued for a while to come I expect."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What magic number are you waiting for? Or just buy shortly after open?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Foreal. I’ve had enough of this shit 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What doesn't hurt you makes your anus looser.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think people wanted more progress in software. Plus it is looking rough for auto sales with the chip shortage. Most people still see the potential but sitting on this for 3-6 months before she starts chugging along again isn't appealing. Plus Chen isn't exactly an inspiring CEO. I don't blame people for selling. I don't think I'll add until she drops to where she was before Ivy news. Then I'll feel pretty comfortable averaging down.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. The amount of time researching and looking at this albatross is not worth it. Going to sell and release myself from the prison that is BB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They hit expectations, no?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“The ceo doesn’t care about stock price”. That doesn’t happen in our realm of existence, ever. 

They had other priorities, clearly. On the call, their priorities were clearly write-offs and fiscal year earnings. 

Which is all fine well and good, but 300 million in losses definitely fucked this quarter."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol then you smart. I held on to it like a chump and now premium's cheap as hell
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">will be undervalued for a while to come I expect.

Then theres plenty of time to pick it up later lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just bought some today. I usually wait for an extra \~25% drop before buying more. However, I intentionally bought less today in case of an earnings drop, so I may buy some more at 10% down.

I do not have a big position, but I am probably going to start buying a little here and there each month. I have a feeling this stock is in for a beat down period for awhile, but is still a good long term stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think expected was \~230m, reported \~215m

&#x200B;

Honestly I don't see the panic when they've got so many projects under the hood that aren't even close to reaching their full potential (IVY, AWS collaborations, etc)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc ceo said he doesn’t care about stock price and checks only weekly at best
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"scraping $0.03 to $0.10 covered calls to recover some of the losses ... but after today, i may not be able to recover financially from $BB"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Honestly I don't see the panic when they've got so many projects under the hood that aren't even close to reaching their full potential (IVY, AWS collaborations, etc)



Which don't generate any revenue apparently."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got nice fat bridge for sale too. Special price just for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"?

&#x200B;

How can BB generate revenue from technology that isn't fully public yet"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's weird how the business I'm planning to start when I retire isn't generating money in my thirties
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"By getting paid for development of services e.g. for AWS

Either way, they generated less revenue than Q4 last year - in a growing cybersecurity/tech market. That is quite terrible."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know. I have this super awesome plan for the future. But why isnt it giving me money now!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but nobody's buying stock in your dream retirement business now are they?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They should still generate revenue.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So the AWS agreement was made public in December last year - Did we expect revenue from that agreement in Q1 2021? I certainly didn't think so. Wouldn't this be more likely to show as Amazon  inches closer to deploying hordes of self driving delivery drones?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something something, Amazon wasn’t profitable for the first 12 years or some shit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But they had growing revenue and were a growth company.

BB apparently is not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget. He likes the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This morning I decided I would pick either chewy or bb. Spaghetti for dinner.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This March dip has been fucking delicious for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds bullish for gamestop. Ryan Cohen is a fucking beauty.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, now stop dipping below 80.  We raised you better than that, kid"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chwy has a market cap of 33B. Gamestop has a market cap at 200/share of 13B. When you think about it, shouldn't gamestop be worth as much as Chewy?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait until the hedge funds find...oh, you don’t say...really?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was already invested. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait one sells pet food and one sells game.  How is that a comp lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE THE STOCK 👍🏼
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Went 70% chewy and 30% Bb because of experience holding bb is an abusive portfolio relationship for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Rolled into sept 90c. Should be keepers for a bit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ net sales grew 50% year over year

Bull 4 sho"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ful as fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Packing heat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We don't think
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,game stop will be worth a lot more than chewy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop is worth bout a tril buddy, haven’t you heard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop is worth in the trillions what are you talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So they should both be worth $3B?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chew toys, treats, ect.. are all in the game realm if you are a pet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cohen fudge packers unite.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should rephrase that, shouldn't the big banks think of gamestop worth as much or more then chewy? The gaming industry has to be bigger then the pet industry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So will I
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All in good Time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before gamestop can be Worth anything again,  they need to provide a clear path to show they can increase sales in years.  The business model they had is going to be dead.  No matter how big the gaming market may be,  how does gamestop collect the money?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that's the path. Its going be chewified.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But they really need to prove themselves.  I have a teenager and it's just too easy buying the games straight off the respected console,  or steam for pc.... as a 3rd party they really have an uphill battle to get someone to go off the platform specifically to gamestop"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If GameStop created an “app” for all platforms (essentially steam but can be used on pc/Xbox/PS/Nintendo) where you can buy *one* copy of the game and activate it on any platform where you log in...that’d be awesome. I have already had to buy multiple of the same games for different platforms to play with different friends. I’d even shell out an extra 10/20 bucks to have the ability to download it onto any platform I am logged into whenever I want. Would incentivize buying from GameStop and bypassing the consoles digital store.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, it's going be a long & difficult uphill battle to prove that the business plan is valid. I really believe in Ryan cohen, and when you think about it a lot of the people in this forum are consumers too so we are ""validating"" the concept ourselves with the money we spend there. I really like the cat moon t-shirts that gamestop is selling now, and for $20 very affordable. https://www.gamestop.com/clothing/mens/clothing/tops-shirts/products/mooncat-t-shirt/11106326.html"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I always run into a problem buying peripherals online and feeling like I am either not quite getting the right product or am getting ripped off in some way. Bought an Xbox controller and had just way too frustrating of a time with it. I’d look to a gaming specific place for something like that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely intriguing,  I just feel the market is going to make them prove a concept at this point.  Essentially they just have to take their business name and money and completely rebuild it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We get the peripherals at best buy. Points and certificates as elite members add up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The market is different now. I don't care as an investor all the mumbo jumbo you are trying to get at. We vibe with potential and leaders. That's it. Investing at it's finest. What can come from this? Idk but I'm investing everything in it, for the potential."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is PLTR trending but barely pushing green?

As a ThetaGang call seller, I can say the premiums are cheap now. Almost...too cheap"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's going on with PLTR today?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As a palantard I'm pretty sure it's trending from people making fun of us. I'll take my gold star though!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know for a fact AAL was listed enough to be on this today... I know this because I’m the one who listed it so many times
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So far... Today. Today is tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR dethroned GME?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im all in on PLTR
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Palantard I approve this message
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you delete all AMC posts or anything not related to GME (I'M HOLDING GME)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao  
ONE green day and pltr dethrones gme"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Need some $UWMC on here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy I never really stumble across  people talking about palantir no more
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR regains the throne 👀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must be a schill for posting this!

(KIDDING IM KIDDING!) 
Thank you pdwp90 for your awesome work."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was expecting palantir to be up 11%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow the PLTR one is exploding like a rocket 

https://youtu.be/6VTKtJN-e24

🚀 PLTR $30c 6/18"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$BB for life.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This enforces my confirmation bias that amc sentiment is dying. 

If you need positive amc sentiment btw go to the amc stock sub you aren't allowed to be negative."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea green day ... pltr was 1.46% up today.. wtf🤣 .. #gme forever.🙌💎💎💎🙌
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This sub is ruined. Why keep talking about GME Jesus Christ it’s not even that interesting.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh AMC you try so hard to be relevant
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,great chart. how didi you do that?  I would never have thought that [tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BodpOp0qaAU) would be discussed so much.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the only three stocks I hodl are the top three most talked about rn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you guys enjoy the data. A point of note is that this is only in the Daily Discussion and Tomorrow's Moves threads. Does not include the GME-specific thread.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I get a permanent one of these as my lock screen?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Green day, rare occurrence"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I saw that and thought, ""PLTR must have had a nice breakout!"" Checks chart: up 1.47%...a green day is a green day I guess😂"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha my code has a number of bells and whistles to prevent against manipulation, which also includes some measures preventing single people from having undue influence"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Peter Thiel knows how to use bots very well to try to manipulate online sentiment. He needs to keep the price up enough to keep dumping his shares. Lot of fools will be left holding the bag this year.

Edit: Thiel has been using bots since at least 1999:

>	When Paypal figured that eBay was their key distribution platform, their marketing team came up with a creative marketing campaign to simulate demand. They created a robot — a script that could spider eBay’s site looking for certain types of auctions — that bid on items and then, insisted on paying for the auction using Paypal.

You bet your ass Thiel has a social media manipulation bot army on this sub. The difference this time is he isn’t trying to get a startup off the ground... he’s trying to dump his shares as quickly as possible at the highest price his army of bots and tape painting can support. He knows a correction is coming. He’s been holding his shares for a looong time and he’s cashing out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this for discussion threads? That kinda makes your comment fake news.

Edit: they deleted their comment so I guess they realized the mistake."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every week there is someone claiming the mods are censoring discussion of a particular stock. The fact that it seems to be a different stock every time I post leads me to believe that perhaps claims of bias against particular assets is exaggerated. I think a lot of posts just get removed in general due to the bot army.

If there is evidence to the contrary I'd be happy to entertain it, but I haven't seen anything on my end. It's pretty easy to give benefit of the doubt when there are countless examples of u/zjz and the rest of the current team acting in good faith."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That sub is fucking terrible.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It is one of the most interesting things that is happening right now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When you buy GME at 450 and need to shit on other stonks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that you even mention it proves everything . Let me guess a GME bag holder ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm after a green day,  still down 35%"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds stupid. I’ll buy more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't trust Thiel with watching my cattle grace

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the executives of AMC sell out large amounts of stocks in the middle of the whole ""AMC movement"" then you know the company is shit.

I can tell you how GME is going to change the gaming industry"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC was done 2 months ago.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How is GME gonna change the gaming industry? By creating a Steam or Epic store competitor? Consoles have their own marketplace. A one stop shop for all gamers? Isn't that what they've always tried to be? Clue me in on this digital approach because I'm genuinely curious and don't understand.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol GME is not changing the gaming world , they may try and get into it by buying one of the gaming companies but not changing it
Shit you could say the same for amc they have tons of brick and motor and could also buy a gaming company"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right... mr crystal magic ball.  I won’t waste my time. There’s enough great DD that won’t appear on here.  Do some research stop wasting brain cells. Bye
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The C instead of Z? Who's to say I'm not talking to my assistant, Grace.. Huh? Huh?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think AMC is gonna squeeze or do you believe long term in the company?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME has been basing around 175-200 for quite a while.  Shorts are making no progress.

What they didn't expect was an actual pivot to break even online + storefront with prior management. Now they are stuck holding  a massive short position where the business is actually adding actual executives who know how use online marketplaces as leverage.

HFs are fucked. They stuck shorting what they thought was one type of businesses when instead it's another. With Ape sentiment behind it."

... wow, throw some truth bombs and get -17 .. lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude just shut the fuck up about GME. Literally hundreds of new posts about it DAILY. There is nothing new here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It's looking like the new foundational support. Like $40 was. Until we get a big catalyst. If Ryan Cohen is confirmed CEO. And u/Deepfuckingvalue buys another 50k shares same day or around there. I think it's time to put space suits on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps they are planning on something devious again. Imagine once the hype train happens, they decide to pull the rug again."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"well they can't just sell stock, they have to file in advance"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"...But they fucked over kids and poor people who were trying to sell their used games for over a decade. They also fucked over their employees with low pay and shit working conditions.
I despise GameStop and its brand for their predatory practices. No amount of reinvention will erase their past mistakes for me. If they were an honest company, they would have gone bankrupt years ago.

Unrelated: Imagine a GME stock buyback when the Stock is $200 a share. The company would offer shareholders $20 of in-store credit per share. $11 if you want cash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If people buy their games online directly through the platform and download to their machine, what is the model that is being proposed for GameStop?  Where do they add value?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy to triple sales when they weren't making any before.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,None in stock due to Covid chips shortage though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last year the April share recount caused a short squeeze. Conveniently, he put his options the same week as that meeting, 2021."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow is both the quarterly earnings report for hedgies and the end of the SLR exemptions.  Might be a spicy next couple of days.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would bet money his plan is to exercise those contracts in time to be recounted so they are enforced right away. Or maybe right after while they're buying.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His options are up in April right? If he exercises them at the 4 or 5 dollar mark he’s going to have so many shares he may have to be reported on the next SEC filing!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Already got the suit on, waiting for take off"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ground control to major tom 👽 🚀 🌝
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What should they do? Shutting down the Internet? The global energy supply for a week? So they can’t do shit in the meantime, after its they still need my shares to cover, and I can wait for my paycheque! kinda used to it as an self employed Europoor ;) so I hope this show will go one for months, after a hole year, less taxes to pay and I can buy more with every penny I’m earning in the meantime! As long as someone is willing to short the Gamestonk, more 🍌are growing on this beautiful tree waiting for this retarded 🦧 holding all they can afford 💎💪💎✊💎👍🏻💎"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This needs to be it’s own highly upvoted post. Talk about a bump in earnigles.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine thinking anybody is under any obligation to buy your used video games. Mine just go in the garbage.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Username checks out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My man, you are the wrong kind of retard for this ape squad. We’re real sorry that you didn’t get enough for your scratched up PlayStation 1 games, you’d probably be a billionaire now if they gave you a little more, I’m sure..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow this is mind numbing retardation. and not the good kind.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, are you trying to make money or have morals? Choose one. Note: what you bring up has been one of my primary beefs with them, though I better understand *why* those prices were so low (there were 10 more used copies in the back) and it's also a primary point they're likely to change since it's one of the primary complaints."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the millionth time, e-commerce and digital distribution are not the same thing. GameStop’s competitors won’t all of a sudden be Sony, epic, steam, etc. it will still be Walmart, target, Amazon, etc"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There will always be a demand for physical discs as long as countries like America are decades behind in modern, high speed internet infrastructure. Gamestop can take advantage of the demand for physical during the transition which is going to last years, not overnight like boomers predicted.

Consoles and console games are just a slice of the pie that is the gaming market. Peripherals, gaming parts, accessories, gaming merch, limited edition collectibles, bundles, sponsored events, esports, etc. are highly valuable revenue streams that all experts agree will grow YoY for the longterm. Not only that covid proved these streams are pandemic-resistant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can make a company look great while putting it in freefall
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that's the kind of DD I needed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Link for April share recount this year?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like you. I’ve got that feeling and I’ve never even met you Brrrrrr
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn't know I could love him more but I do.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what we all would love to do, right? ;)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They are 12 calls expire on 16 apr

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you. I just feel the  new comers could get discouraged. I will hold no matter what but imagine the new apes going in and they go through a massive short attack. Well if any new comers are reading I suggest buying the dip when it comes, not financial advice, just another apes opinion to always have enough to buy the dip."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How about you do it? ;)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe businesses should act ethically. Back in the early 2000s, selling to GameStop was the only option for young people to get any money for their games. 

Gamestop took advantage of that and turned it into 50% of their business."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the plan?  To compete for sales of headphones and gaming chairs?  That's not very innovative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn't sound all that innovative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing not certain in this whole ordeal ironically is the SEC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Last year I believe it was announced in April. Theres dd on this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What would you need a link for man? Literally this shit has been all over wsb. Quit being Uber retarded and use the gosh dang internet. 

Like literally man you take all the shit you hear online as solid dd without any type of due diligence on your own??"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A call contract is for 100 shares. 500x100 is 50k, not 500k."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s only 100 shares per contract, so 50k shares are in play. Not a big amount when volume is like 10-50 mill a day"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its 50k shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ehh lots of people held from 300 down to 50 why sell now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fool me once, shame on you. Fool me twice..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would that be permission fellow ape?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Games have Little resale value. Unless you’re holding a mint copy of DEF jam fight for New York, I must scream but I have no mouth, or anything of that nature you’re not gonna get much. The fact that GameStop even buys back games in and of itself it is convenient."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol it doesn't matter if it is or isn't.

They shorted what they thought was a sears or jc penny or barnes and nobles. They choose poorly. And doubled down to that extent.

Now they are stuck shorting something that would fundamentally fail and that they could accelerate through whatever means. Short sells. Common sharing between ETFs. Coordinated media coverage. Coordinated forum cointelpro stuff. Hell, they prevented people from BUYING. And whatever crap/leverage they got going on regarding pressure on Cohen and company.

They were wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to a smooth-brained ape such as myself? How would the SEC throw a wrench into all of this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is, because how much of that volume are the same X amount of shares being traded between bots and daytraders?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m still holding onto 1 I panic bought at $307 🤦🏼‍♀️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not even to sell. Just to buy at the best time for the best availabe price.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes! I’ll prob delete this account soon for anonymity reasons
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My only gripe was the markup on the used games.

New Game: $60

Used Game: $40

Buy-back: $5"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If games had little resale value, reselling them wouldn't make GameStop much money.

Gamestop, on average, paid 52 cents on the dollar for games. (They earned an average of 48 cents profit per dollar of used game sales.) It also accounted for 44% of their gross profit in 2013. It's literally the only reason they haven't gone bankrupt.

Used game sales is the only thing unique to GameStop. Other businesses do everything else better and cheaper."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Allowing hedgefunds to just keep the borrowed shares, without buying them. Lack of enforcement or possibly corruption/collision. Using phantom shares for free to return the borrows. I doubt it though."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t delete the account now with a name like that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buyers market.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only reason GameStop buys games is to sell them. Because making 35 dollars off a used copy of Gears of War 2 is better than not making any money at all. And this in turn let’s kids and customers buy games at discount instead having to pay full price. It’s called business. You maximize profit and minimize cost. Again who else aside from a pawn shop is going to buy used games?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, already deleted. Now I’ll always wonder, who was that secretive primate?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He actually did it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wasted an award on him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Achat my pants when I bought PLTR and it went down 10%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The dip that keeps dipping
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm addicted to averaging down my PLTR leaps
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,April should be good for us 🙏
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid buy. I’m right with you on the heavy leap contracts.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It means keep going
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed soooo much
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Mother fucker that was funny.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing!!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True story, I am on day 59 of buying the dip. Not sure how much longer I can keep this up"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You and me both my friend
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought February was going to be good for us?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean the CRA from overseas right ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,France
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did those cost you insurance-wise? I’m too lazy to look
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“shityiest”...

holy fuck bro... 😂"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Love the fact im downvoted - palantir hype is a weird ass echo chamber for reals
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been buying the dip of the dip of the dip of the dip so much I ran out of money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When I had gains I was wishing I had bought more the gods answered  my prayers lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk I’ve been holding since November
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shittiest is a Word that would compliment pltr.

Shityiest 👌"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah you should have been upvoted for your hilarious comment twot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess if April’s is no good there is always May
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's GO! This stock looks a hell of a lot like RKT right before it spiked. Bought 30 more shares this afternoon. Plan to sell if there a is a spike. Long term hold if not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife's bf texted me to tell you to take that 11k and buy the dip tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably should sell, lockup ends tomorrow. Earnings beat, stock price double from IPO, no better time to dump a large portion of your shares..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s crazy how low the volume is on this stock. IMO it is very undervalued. I really like the stock . May be just as much as rkt if you know what I mean.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought several 100 at $24 and sold this AM at open. Made a solid return on a short term bet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol didn’t they declare bankruptcy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell make 11k like that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He should sell? Just to buy more?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lockup expiration isn’t nearly as big a deal as people make it out to seem.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Carl has puts on ASO. no worries though, i thought about a one or two-day play on ASO puts for a split second as well, but i'm now hoping the lock-out expiry is a non-event and that the shorts have to sweat out the long weekend. Expect the unexpected! Hold your 4/16 calls until April 7th (why? because! that's why! \*\*not advice\*\*)!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he sells high and then it dips, he’ll walk away with more shares in the end. Assuming it bounces back up after the dip, he’ll be up on gains and share size."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do have puts, 3 to be exact, bought ITM calls end of February and they bled, just made even today. Watched this ticker a lot, volume was off the charts for this one today, Seen this thing have days under 1mil. Glad for OP, I would take some profit and leave some ride, I just don’t trust this stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I can assure you, I do not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just delete the app and claim the “whoopsie daisy” defense in court.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you assume we are making money"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never sell, problem solved."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, do I get PAID if I lost money?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sales net out at the end once you sell. Any losses from previous purchases of same stock will roll into cost basis at time of repurchase. If you have realized gains the previous loss will reduce amount of gains you report. I don’t know what this idiot did but If you’re in and out of trades the loss or gain keeps rolling into the repurchase until the final realized gain once you sell. He didn’t plan well what a dummy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How much does your mom charge?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"On November 30 or before that, you just need to sell all and take December off from market."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the government can bail him out....

Or he can call shitadel for tax evasion advice?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys have alot of silly rules down there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I might be screwed by this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Um had between 200k and 2 mil in trades daily and traded over 45million worth....so he lost all of it and ended with 45k but still has to pay taxes on his gains he lost...oops
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you make over 1000 then just get an effing accountant to do your taxes. Not financial advise. ...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody know if wash sale applies to options that are same company but different strike or expiration date?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t wash sales only mess you up if you hold though the new year? My understanding is the loss gets added to the cost basis, so as long as you sell the stock eventually and don’t rebuy and hold, you’re all good. Someone correct me if I’m wrong, but I think that’s how it works."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule, does it mean I can't buy the same stock again within 30 days, or any stock for 30 days?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question: what should I set aside for taxes?
Will your app give you the relevant info?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s one of the big advantages of trading out of a Roth IRA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which one of you retards is this? 45M in trades and ends up with a 45k net profit at the end of the year.

Maybe this is why they say that day trading is a bad idea..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know how to sell, so i dont have understand wash sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can tell that Forbes really gives a shit about new investors understanding the wash sale rules because they were touting this kinda stuff in November
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve luckily never been fucked on a tax bill, but I don’t think I fully understand the wash rule even after years of trading. Let’s say I buy a rack (100 contracts) of SPY calls.  I close the rack for a loss. Later I buy different strike SPY calls to enter at a better price.  I sell these for a profit.  Is that a wash? I.e. I owe capital gains on both transactions and not just on the profit? 

Shit shouldn’t apply to options imo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He obviously never got into options.  I mean the massive losses I take in options will easily equal out my stock gains :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,800K is chump change.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can just declare bankruptcy (unlike my student loans)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I buy high sell low so I can owe more tax. Yes makes sense to this ape.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"WTH?  I wash my ass everyday, thank you very much, ain't payin' no damn taxes on my apeness."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to have gains for that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sale doesnt apply do mark to market traders
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow lol 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, is this tax advice?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a taxes ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow so this is something people up vote?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"STOP POSTING THIS SHIT IN THIS SUB. Jesus fuck it’s a God damn CASINO.  

MODS"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares man. GME was cool like a month ago.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither does 95% of the sub.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But your honor... i was... uh. I didn’t.... well... i was unaware. Yes i was unaware.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking of not paying anything at all in taxes this year, and then just double up earnings next year to cover both... seems sound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have had a few concussions growing up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is you can owe taxes without making any money.  If you make $3.50 on one trade and lose $3.50 on another, it's possible to make $0 total, but owe taxes on the $3.50 anyway, which you now don't have because you already lost it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you explain this using a made up single instance example?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is my understanding too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This folds together all previous gains/loses together for the year, regardless if bought in the 31 day period for your true realized gains/loses?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s because we are the most free people to have ever lived.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,To stop everyone from selling their losers on dec 31 and buying back on Jan 1 to lower their taxes. Why's that silly?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you just started this year, just make sure you close out wash sale stocks. If that happens to be GME and the rocket is in December then maybe take the tax loss if it wasn't a big deal LOL."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost $36,000 in the Nasdaq crash and could only write off $3,000 per year for 12 years!!! (Of course, I no longer had money to trade...)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What?

$45 million was over the entire year. $200k to $2M was a day.

You buy 1,000 shares of Y at $20 and 100 shares of X at $250 and you've done $45,000 in trades and with triple margin you just need $15,000 in cash.  Sell Y at 21, buy at 22, sell at 23. And you've have $42,000 in costs and $46,000 in proceeds for just Y. But you still started with that $15,000. 

Last year I had about $650,000 in proceeds/costs despite never having an account balance over $100,000."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one knows because the IRS doesn't say. Wash sales are defined in [IRS Pub. 550](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2019_publink100010601), and ""substantially identical"" is outlined for stocks and bonds (scroll down a bit), but not for options. The IRS *does* say the following:

>In determining whether stock or securities are substantially identical, you must consider all the facts and circumstances in your particular case.

&nbsp;

A rule of thumb incorporating this ""guidance"" is that options are substantially identical if the new option allows you to experience the same ups/downs as the one sold at a loss. How different the strikes and expirations must be to not cover ""the same"" market fluctuations is ambiguous though.

Of course, the best way to avoid wash sale restrictions it to not have any losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah once you sell it and wait 30 days you get the loss
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the mother fucking way.  They'll just print it away
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought wash sales only apply to selling on a loss. So if you made 3.50 on your first trade, and sold and rebought the same security pre30 days and lose 3.50, you can still claim that as a loss.

However, if you sold a security for a loss, and then you bought back that same security then the loss amount gets added to your total buy price, your first losses can't be  written off until 90 days following the sell of your second time buying assuming you don't do anymore wash sales.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7OmiwjGsZE&ab\_channel=TDAmeritrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7OmiwjGsZE&ab_channel=TDAmeritrade)

I believe the kid who made 45K profit but owes 800K is because the timings didn't line up and he didn't sell his second wash before the holdings time before tax due date so he couldn't report losses for 2020, but he could for 2021. However, you can't get deductibles on 2020 taxes with 2021 so he still owes those taxes for 2020."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure capital losses offset capital gains but im also stupid so idk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy 10,000 gme Jan 1, price goes down by $1. Sell it and have loss of $10,000. Buy back in the next day when it drops even more. Loss disallowed until you sell again"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"December has 31 days, and you held no stock in December. All will be realized.

BTW, this is a satire to those who do not know how to handle wash sale."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😳
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, the article says ""he transacted $45M (yes, Million) in total trades""  not that he had 45M"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've never read a k10, but I've pet plenty of k9s.

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's my ""it's possible"" caveat.  There's specific rules you have to follow, otherwise it looks like you're trying to rack up capital losses on purpose (by moving in and out of the same stock), which the IRS doesn't want.  

If you don't even know that's a rule, you can accidentally not follow them and get fucked with surprise taxes for gains you no longer have."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sales is really just a timing issue, it was implemented in the past because assholes didn't want to pay taxes so they sold securities at a loss to try and claim that as their tax write off. The guy who lost 800K on 45K profit is truly retarded, he waited for the stars to align and timed it perfectly to miss the year window."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does loss disallowed mean?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may be dumb, but it works"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a few wash sales myself, but since I'm out of my positions now and it's been 90 days, I can file all my losses. I got scared when I read that Forbes article, but then I realized that guy is truly retarded."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It means you can’t claim it on your taxes until you sell the shares for real (and don’t buy back in)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't write it off. Come on man. I know we are all retarded...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so sell november and taking 30 days off would prevent a simpleton like myself from ever having to actually understand this right?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you'd want to liquidate positions you had previous losses in before the end of the year?  Would that solve things?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The wording made no sense to this retard!  I would have said “you can’t write it off until you sell again”.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah pretty much.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no- depends on what you’re trading and how often and how much.

Ok so better example:
I bought 100 A at $10 then
I bought 100 A at $5. Then
I sold 200 A at $8.  Then
I bought 200 A at $5.

My taxable gain for this series of events would be $300 ($5 A to $8 A). My potential loss would be $200, but because I bought back in all of those shares within 30 days of the sell transaction, I cannot claim that loss until I sell my shares again and keep them sold."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NICE
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man that could get really confusing real quick!  So this guy in this article could potentially write these losses off next year?  Even so, I guess that doesn’t change the fact that he owes 800k now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right

Well the intention of it is to prevent you from selling all your red stocks in December and then buying them all back at the same price in January to evade taxes.

Overall it’s kinda stupid because it all works out in the long term anyway"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  WTF??   

"" Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the [LastPass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass) account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies. """
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All credentials and software source code compromised. They pretty much need to start from scratch to have a clean environment. This can't be priced into the stock price yet can it? 

Short it to the center of the earth."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been pretty underwhelmed at UI's software, but I didn't know it was THIS bad. Seems they make decent hardware, but that's about it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances with networking connectivity to said databases,” Adam wrote in his letter. “Legal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes within the relevant period.

TL;DR: OOF"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus. Krebs is legit so I'll take his word for it. Ubiquiti sounds like bunch of idiots, maybe hedgies or Mr. Bill have a new and justified target. I wonder why in the hell we didn't hear about this from the burning ship Hidenburg or Shitron first."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Woah, check out the lower end of the options chain on them.. I haven't seen anything that bad since the Texas storm had people betting on power companies going bankrupt.  Every ask price below $270 on puts is $10."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s up with the option chain? What’s with all the puts with a $10 ask?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"UI is not a cloud company, their cloud stuff is more of an annoyance.  They're hardware with free software accompanying it. Also, they were already investigated by the sec (I bought the shit out of that dip), they're a pretty good company that'll rebound from this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And that's, my fellow apes, why you shouldn't use such garbage as LastPass, DashLane, 1password etc. If your all your passwords are stored online, behind a single username and password, it's already a security hole in itself."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Given how SolarWinds went down, I'd say so. If I would have shorted when I first heard the news about SolarWinds, I would have made BANK."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, that's so crooked and devastating especially for a company that deals with back end network equipment/security cameras etc.

""Catastrophic"", is definitely the right word for this company. I wish I had a margin account."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"actually someone took over their password manager account and got access to everything (databases, AWS, cookies keys etc)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that was the case they'd be a dollar, not ten."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it depends on platform, I'm showing $10 on eTrade, with the $260 put strike at $9.50.  Above 270 they're the normal numbers you'd expect to see."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How the fuck are you an IT company this large and you don’t set up MFA for AWS access?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are $1. I checked before I responded. 

Dude is a special level of dumb."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not familiar with eTrade options, but if you pay a fee on them does it get tacked on to the price there? They may have a different minimum when there’s no bids because of that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Mfa tied to sms is super exploitable
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,even less on some.. 4/16 270p $80 👀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,".50 fee per option tacked on when you trade, when I say $10, I mean $1000, it's showing $10.00, not $0.01.  I think they'll all get repriced to real numbers tomorrow and it's just an after hours glitch.  But the Texas storm when I was betting against power companies was the only other time I've seen this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s why you don’t use text based mfa if you can avoid it. Thankfully AWS allows you to use hardware and virtual token generator with SSO. If you decide to use mfa and pick the most insecure way to implement it, you fully deserve whatever happens to you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How? Genuinely curious.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was surprised $280P option is about $1 (ie $100 per contract). This shit is definitely going to half in price at he very least...will go to $150 easily based on the ensuing shitstorm. It will be a reverse gamma squeeze. The entire put option chain ITM by eod"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, this rotation into cyclicals and fading the FANG names cannot last forever. 

I'm balls deep in AMZN, but i think I'm a dumbass with this union vote shit. You'd think it was priced in cause it is has such a high likeliness to pass, but idk the market could knee jerk down.

The other negative with AMZN is that it is going to be lumped in with the overbought tech names, despite having gone sideways for 6 months. 

So selling the ""growth"" story in a market where tech names are trading at 20 year highs relative to revenues, could potentially drag this shit down.

With all that said, logic says not to be long here, which is why I'm long. I'm a stupid fuck, and inversing my sMarT bOi take should make me money somehow."

AMC should not be coupled to GME, because the latter actually has long-term potential with its transition.

Just don't blow up your portfolio for that stock... it's not worth. At least throw it in GME where there's a good chance you make some nice returns."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop will reissue most or all of the shares they repurchased in 2019 and 2020. If they drip the shares out rather than flood the market, they can maximize the amount of cash they receive from this and can pause if the stock falls too quickly. If GameStop's management is able to issue the stock for $100/sh, that's over $3 billion in profit based on the shares they bought back in 2019 and 2020. This should effectively pop the bubble in GameStop stock and should decrease the volatility as well. GameStop's management should be able to cash in on the market mispricing them via this mechanism.

I’m still holding Airbus and Diageo especially. Diageo (Guinness, Johnny Walker, Bailey’s) is my reopening play, cause after the vaccines get out to the majority everyone’s gonna go out to the bars. Especially since Ireland was the surprise growth economy of the pandemic, I imagine the pent-up demand everyone talks about will roar through Ireland as people go out to the pubs and get blasted on Guinness, in the great Irish tradition. 

I got Airbus because everyone’s all distracted with Boeing, even though their products suck in comparison (outdated, dangerous, and for the rockets less const efficient and effective than Daddy Elon’s), and Airbus is the only major plane maker currently working on Hydrogen on a public scale instead of on the dying fossil fuel of the boomers."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What people don’t seem to realize is AMC knows exactly what they’re doing. You don’t stay in business for 100 years by accident. It was a very bold move to try and short them into bankruptcy. They are the most iconic move theater in the world after all. Now they have to buy back the shorts they never planned to. Wrap your head around this and the chart makes perfect sense. The media will try and dissuade you into thinking its a dead cat. They’ve been saying it for weeks. But technically speaking I can’t find a more bullish set up. I really can’t.  Bankruptcy is off the table. We are gearing up for the biggest blockbuster summer of all time. They have billions in cash. Not a dead cat. 📈

Honestly, you guys have such amazing mental fortitude for being able to see a $20k loss and then laughing about it. I didn't know investing could be this punishing but when I sold for a profit today (not GME obviously), it just felt amazing!

The sub is divided and hopelessly compromised.   


It is all about GME. Always was. Nothing else matters.   


See that last minute effort to push GME below 190? It was not done by selling GME shares but by shorting or selling a whole bunch of other stuff: even QQQ had a weird last minute plunge. Several other stocks, identical pattern.   


They are trying to throw us off the scent. That ‘Game Stop saga is over’. They are already doing a POST MORTEM.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's way too much to describe. However I will try to take a stab at the most simplest of them long calls and long puts. A long call is where you are saying I think the price is going to go up and I think it's going to go up to this number. A long put is the same thing except you think it's going to drop. Each option contract is for 100 shares. Simply put if stock is $50 and you think it is going to $100 and you buy a $100 call and it ends up going to a hundred and twenty then you basically just made the prophets of the $20 difference between 100 and 120 * 100 shares minus the premium you paid for the contract. It is the reverse on a put.

This is a major oversimplification of these options and in reality you really need to spend some time studying and watching some YouTube videos less you end up with all your money gone. Options are very high risk as you can lose the entirety of your premium in just the two I described. Other options have other varying levels of risks and you would be foolish not to fully understand them before you purchase them. Nobody is going to be able to properly tell you how they work in a short space on this site"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"calls means up, puts mean down, flat means you lose"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy some. You will understand.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buy the right to sell to someone a stock at a specific price. For that right you pay a ""premium"".  

Essentially you're betting that a stock will hit a price and if you're right you win big. If you're wrong you lose the premium you paid (well not really, you can still sell at a loss, but thats the basic jist behind it)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Someone make me understand options

Also, it should be noted only you can make yourself understand, don't try delegating that responsibility to others. Ask inquiring questions based on your research."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"(╯°□°）╯︵ ┻━┻) 
Wishing I had started saving and investing years ago with my measley 6 shares at $154."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he's almost got a double.  hold on for a quad-triple-octle
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,etoro
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Etoro is hot garbage if you didn't know that already, spread fees are insane."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The first one, yes. The second one tho....

(Swipe right)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s 2 screenshots
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you try swiping?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There are 2 pictures there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Look at the second picture
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is what all of us feel.

The best we can do is wait for history to repeat itself and teach our children to invest early"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but sadly its one of the more international ones of sorts . In my country the only broker that has the gme ticker is them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also insane waiting times for execution and just doesn't work half of the time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hate etoro, slowly moving all my trades over to Freetrade. 

Limited features but everything works solid."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I didn't see that shit at first either. I just freaked and checked after hours prices to make sure I wasn't missing something 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Apologies... didn't see the other one
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm kicking myself extra hard because I ran up frivolous credit card debt on stupid crap when I could have easily been setting aside close to $1k each month for the past 3-4 years. Everything is paid off now and I've cut out all the unnecessary stuff to focus on saving and investing. My only outstanding debt is my car and I should have that paid off about 2 years early. Better late than never.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I moved over to interactive brokerage, in Australia so I don't have too much choice here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I had contracts worth 450 each and I let them drop to about 80 each now...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But what’s your other 00.16% of your portfolio invested in?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait... your going to die trying to go broke? 
Well congrats you do belong here!!🦍🦍🦍"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that’s a YOLO! Hopefully will fly just needs a catalyst
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a little too much diversification here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you’re selling calls. Could be making couple of G’s just off the premium
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like nice even round numbers
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Such nice even numbers
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't answer the phone unless its the moon. Let that shit go to voice mail.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell CCs at 26 out at April 9-16 and you'll make a shit ton in premium
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro just put all of that money on Gonzaga tonight.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BUY THE DIPPPPPP
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have a voice message and should probably charge your phone
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You smooth brain ape wants to be broke or desire death.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who does not already know, institutions and insiders own MORE THAN 100% OF THE FLOAT and there is a Billion $$$ buy back in progress. 🚀🚀🚀

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"at this ruined moment in contract premium you could sell 50 CC's for 4/9 31.89 strike price for $450. measly considering how much you put in on 10k shares, but literally free money. what are the odds rkt blasts through to $32 in 7 days?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on his life
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"...but you’re not broke. Not yet, anyway. I guess the proverb is true."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good speed sir. I hope the tendyman comes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What you own?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what's the bull case at this price level that makes this a more attractive investment than TQQQ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Picked up that sweet divvy too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think robinhood was trying to get ahold of you to SELL 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like GME personally 😋
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People still talk about rocket?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why RKT? Thought we were going full ape to GME?!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should liquidate all of that and put it into gme right this instant
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all are still fucking around with this monkey ass company?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Clear your notifications foooo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,U got a missed call from your accountant u retarded ape
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've bought GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Strategy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Had three yesterday and sold one at $350. Im glad I was smart enough to sell one (and hoping I wasnt dumb for sellin the other two)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Btw, is it difficult to get a $1.7m order filled? Like, do you have to divide that into smaller orders or something?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"so you should get your 73,652.4 shares to a nice and round 80,000 shares"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"hows 4"" sound?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's your bookie?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Arkx
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this mean
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My friend
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where have you been? It’s in the top 5 mentioned like every week
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,im monky
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The negotiator
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rkt is fun, buy cheap bled out calls 5 minutes before close, sell them next day after the inevitable pop around 11:30, repeat as needed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I sold 1 off as well. I guess hindsight is everything tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Now that’s funny shit!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,its cathie's fault or is it kathie?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only way I'll go broke if people keep talking instead of buying lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just set limit price
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got you fam. Message me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man just living under my rock scratching my ass
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t get me wrong, I like their financials, but someone is putting in a lot of effort to keep this thing from flying. There’s no other explanation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There's always tomorrow or Thursday if you're me with 4/1 expiry
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie motha fuckin woods
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What if it moons 😅
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Brother
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Art of the Deal
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I believe we can recover ATLEAST a little. It isn’t out of the realm of possibility’s for it to go quite a bit higher either
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It wont moon while you are buying. Just look at a single minute candle. $1mil cant even move a needle in a stock worth 40b
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea its possible. I really believe RKT course corrects quickly compared to all the other stocks I have lost money on

PS: I was so close to getting one $25 call for 4/1 because it was a .11 a share and I gots $11 worth of buyin power"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No I meant what if price goes above your limit price
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m debating on buying some cheap options at open
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He won't get more purchases unless someone is selling a limit price at his level.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You will get filled. Dont worry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all need to be smarter with your strikes on GME for real...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to diversify and only put 90% in. The 10% is to buy the dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buys retarded calls

Tells people not to buy retarded calls

Quite the paradox brewing here..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cell phone is down to last few seconds of charge---you belong here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the STOCK, do not gamble on GME, do not be greedy, see where greed got the HF and their crew.

GME is not the norm.

Just play it easy, hold it and the reward will be sweet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be selling 2 well-OTM calls every week until IV is below 150% lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,800 lmaoo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Got them at 15 cents and got 1 on 4/16 im green on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont even buy strikes. Shares y’all please.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought 199 WAS the dip 😆
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do as I say, not as I do. They’re also .01% of my portfolio 😂"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, this smooth brain is buying 2 well-OTM calls every week."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Might as well do daily close to expiration and just rebuy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,bro we all see that $800 call... 👀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this getting downvotes? Hedgies?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you think some dude buying two shares for $400 instead of an option with a premium of $400 is “hurting these guys” more than the other you out yo mind.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everytime I see dip, Imma like look at those curves"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dip is like midd-low $100s.

It is were I got my few shares and just sitting and waiting for the next drop back to the 120s"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the same ones although they’re 100% of my porty
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's like ""lOoK gUyS iM BuYiNg CoVeReD cAlLs!!:1!!-"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's getting down voted because he came into WSB and told someone not to trade options and buy shares instead. That's like going into the vatican to preach the benefits of satanism.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares are the only way to truly hurt these guys
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well the dude holding 2 shares is at least keeping shares out of the pool.

Buying a $400 FD just gives someone smarter than you $400.

If you're going to buy calls they need to be at least 50-60 Delta to make it worth while.

190c at $1700 an option... That's less than 10 shares of gamestop that will get hedged (maybe) for 59 shares.

Seems like a no brainer at that point. Just cough up the $1700 though"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he sold some OTM calls... He could possibly even afford to buy an ITM call. 🤔
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would 100% agree if it were any other stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or accumulate 35 more shares so he can start selling THREE calls a week.

Seriously you can sell a call that's 25%+ OTM for next week for $1,200. Dude can make $2k+ per week off 200 shares until the price either drops or the squeeze squozes. And if it squozes you can probably buy back the calls you sold that week and ride the squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Its a squeeze. The demand for shares sparks that very squeeze.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"the assumption is they don't cover far otm calls with low probability so it's actually pointless and just speculating. Also, you don't force 100 shares buy everytime an option is traded (if at risk of exercised), just once per contract."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The one problem is that I'd be too retarded to recognize the squeeze until it's too late for me to buy back my calls and I'd watch the squeeze squeeze my ass cheeks for a couple grand. Yikes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You wouldn't get squeezed for a couple grand, that's why you have shares. You'd get cucked out of some gains, but you would still be selling 200 shares for a decent gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You had worded it better than me. I just couldn't comprehend allowing myself to be cucked so hard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket labs is suppose to go public sometime soon. They will be a sleeping giant. Very talented and they managed to beat Jeff Bezos to reusable rockets having just successfully recovered a rocket they are planning to relaunch. ARKX will go heavy into this company. Their small size leaves huge room for growth especially if they achieve the same kind of efficiency as the falcon 9 in reusability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket Labs is big potential
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t wait to hear the first report of a space-soldier capturing a foreign intruder and making them reveal their Netflix login info, only to be forced to watch Cuties “A Clockwork Orange” style. Space wars are going to be FUN."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically she started a war fund to fight an intergalactic enemy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. Bring on those blue alien women that Captain Kirk was always banging.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought in today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maxr is becoming/already is a 'full stack' geospatial information company.

Next constellation launch will enable super fast super high detail refresh of earth images"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,To Mars baby 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Another great ARK fund to watch you numbers go negative. Whoops woop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR for sure before any listed in this post. Data analysis will save trillions in space cargo. Get in before it’s to late🤷🏻‍♂️🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BLL - Aerospace is a small portion of their revenue, but could be a good foundational addition to help smooth things out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie brings me the wood
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ARKX without RYCEy is trash buy RYCEy before Cathy buys the dips
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the holdings of her space fund?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NYT just put out an article stating a study found an astronaut’s heart shrunk in space. We still don’t know some of the long term effects of human exposure to those elements.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed they already have a deal to go public via SPAC so its a matter of time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This! Also, you may have noticed the 3D printing ETF included in ARKX. Rocket Lab and others will be driving down rocket cost by 3D printing rocket components."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was actually very surprised they were not initially added.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Lab (VACQ) and Astra (HOL) were perfect additions to ARKX. Considering ARKX wants to want invest in “Orbital Aerospace” companies. 

The only reason I can think of is that they are expecting to invest in Starlink (SpaceX subsidiary) eventually. And don’t want to hold anything that directly competes against SpaceX (orbital launches). Ark-funds is obviously a big supporter of everything Elon.

Maxar was a no brainer with a low P/E ratio but high growth potential. Very surprised MAXR wasn’t included."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. the digital globe part of the company is incredibly interesting as well and that will drive revenue too. I was focused on the vehicle stuff opposed to the imagery
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The key is to pick what you like from her holdings. Don’t pay her to buy stock for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but don’t mean PLTR stock price go to moon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"proud owner over >2K PLTR shares, i feel you i was focusing on infrastructure better than John Deere and Netflix"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yes - which is why i wrote this shit DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually I think they may given up on it. Elon has proven that the specific variant of steel he is using for starship is a much more cost effective way to build. Overcommitting to carbon fiber may prove to be rocket labs one mistake thus far. It’s very hard to work with and much too expensive.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed and cathy buys SPACs so its not like she couldnt have
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKLB doesn't exist yet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think its an acquisition target for a big boy, similar to how AJRD got snatched up.

Maybe Google or another information service but I think most likely RTX or LHX as a stretch. MAXRs offerings fit in within both company's portfolios."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,did exactly that with DE at the beginning of the year and it has crushed for me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, unless you think Alibaba, John Deere, Netflix, etc, are space companies.  Top one on the list is Trimble (TRMB), so may be best just to stick with that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw the initial holdings and immediately decided the fund didn't exist in my mind 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relativity Space uses a machine that they call Stargate to completely autonomously 3D print and assemble metal rockets. This would be a faster way to get to cheap manufacturing of rockets.

List of Relativity Space investors:
Y Combinator, General Catalyst, Tiger Global Management, Mark Cuban, Elad Gil, Iconiq Capital, Baillie Gifford, Michael Ovitz, Jared Leto, Social Capital, Spencer Rascoff, David Spector, Senator Investment Group, Playground Global, Lee Fixel, Combinator Continuity, Tribe Capital, Allen & Company LLC, Bond, K5 Global, 3L, Fidelity Management & Research Company, XN

Relativity Space hasnt gone public yet but the largest holding of PRNT is THE EXONE COMPANY which also has developed metal printing machines."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think she only buys SPACs that go through DA. Most of the space SPACs have not completed the deal yet
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They could have added VACQ.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"agreed. hell you have to wonder if MSFT or AAPL want to get in on the action like amazon did. RTX a possibility, LHX trickier cause they divested from all the consulting/contractors at Gov buildings when Harris and L3 merged"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, John Deere has working contracts with NASA and have developed tech through that partnership. Doesn’t Alibaba have some type of satellite side hustle? I’m not sure, but I feel like I remember reading about that at some point. I could be completely making that up though, so definitely take it with a grain of salt. I have no idea why Netflix is in there"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"probably the smart decision. when i saw her own ETF in ARKX i immediately thought a CDO inside of a CDO, ITS AWESOME"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could have, Yes, but why drag it down when you get it direct without the baggage."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can ""maybe"" see JD (from a distance) involved in mechanical engineering on the lower end, but what troubles me is Alibaba.  For that reason alone I won't touch it.  Netflix, who knows, maybe just for it's real-time delivery of feed.  As an investment, though, I would rather chose my own than an ETF for other than what I just flipped for quick few bucks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's very clear she decided to open and bring to market an ETF in the Space sector before the Space sector was big enough to create and ETF in.

It may pay off in a decade or two, but there's no reason to rush into this ETF."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does Alibaba trouble you specifically?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This dudes account fluctuates by my entire account daily
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How does a retard obtain this absurd amount of money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Losing money with Apple and Amazon, but profit on GameStop, how ironic lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes buy high sell low, brilliant"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You lied since last submission.  You said you gonna sell some of that weird fruit company and buy more meme stonks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Richass retard 🦍

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazon may have interest in both, AMC and GME..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus Christ you are a millionaire
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy duck! You are one of those that make GME move! Do it more! :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This takes into account absolutely nothing that indicates actual value
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this what ""they"" refer to as : Diversify your portfolio????

*just asking for a friend*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,do it pussy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm. I'd follow all the arrows to the green, personally."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Both arrows to GME.........

This is the way"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you want adopt me?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got so dizzy following the lines, I spewed my crayon cereal chunks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can also swap the + and - signs around. I learned in math class that a negative plus a negative equals a positive.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where’s $PLTR ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much did you start with, god damn"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not yolo. Your portfolio diversity is too high.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow! #goals
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Go all in GME and b a legend
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Transfer AMC to GME. You don’t need both and GME has higher growth percentage.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just point both those arrows towards $GME and you’ll be good
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Giving off 🐋 dick energy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your AVG Gme cost if you don’t mind me asking
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,DO IT
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking do it!!! Lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look into Novan. Great pipeline, send us to the moon with a yolo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Interesting. Just posted on the WEEKEND that AMZN may drag down the QQQ with all the labor troubles. I made a nice day trade in it short and covered. Guess it ain't a one day event.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ohhhhhhh, shiiiiiyat. If everyone did this even a little... [low whistle]"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds about right LOL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only if you want an even more obscene amount of money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The arrows are wise
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn AMZN not just getting its exec's poached by GME but even its shares too

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options.

An option is the right to buy 100 shares, but not a commitment to do so.

2 large ""calls"" betting on the price rising:330 at the strike price of $52, so if exercised he could have 33000 shares.261 at strike of $52.5, so 26100 shares if exercised.One moderate ""put"" betting on it falling to strike $51, 6 contracts, so the option on 600 shares

The cost on the far right is how much the options cost, per share, that x100 (and times the number of contracts bought) is gone, you spent it. You hope to recoup it either selling the options, or exercising them if they turn ITM (In The Money)

With the 52 call example the shares would have to have hit $52 + option cost for them to be profitable if exercised, but exercising means buying all those shares.

People sell option contracts they bought to others if they cannot afford to exercise them themselves.

When you exercise, you're paying the strike price per share, so the difference between that and the share value when you exercise is profit (less the option cost) if you then sell them off.

If it doesn't hit 52 by 4/1/21 they're worthless though, your option to exercise has expired.

I'm not good at this but it will do until someone wants to explain it better/pick holes in what I have wrong.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He gave some theta gange retard 14k to gain all the profits that MO would get from 60,000 shares after it goes above 52$ per share. 

Too retarded? 

He essentially gave some one 14k dollars in a contract. In the contract it says “ALL PROFITS THAT 60,000 shares of MO stock would gain after 52$ share price will be mine before 4/1”. So if MO gets to 53$, his contract activates, 52-53= 1$ but he has 60,000 shares, so he actually gains 60,000$ and he didn’t buy the shares but just paid 14k so the profit is 46k if MO gets to 53$."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re not alone, bro!  Chin up!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have time to spare so I’m gonna grade your “option” explanation- I’ll play the knowledgeable and the beginner so both sides views are made. 

Start: 

>An option is the right to buy 100 shares, but not a commitment to do so.

True, but this is not needed. 1) no one should ever exercises. 2) this definition just confuses beginners- it’s more confusion. Some some can learn option without understanding this as they will not be exercising. 

>2 large ""calls"" betting on the price rising:
330 at the strike price of $52, so if exercised he could have 33000 shares.
>261 at strike of $52.5, so 26100 shares if exercised.
One moderate ""put"" betting on it falling to strike $51, 6 contracts, so the option on 600 shares

Here you should really define what call, strike, and put, and exercise even mean before writing the numbers. For someone that doesn’t understand the image, they def will not understand what any of what you wrote means. And using word alike “large” should be avoided. Large option could be either the leverage or the price- which is stupid since this same “large” bet would be like 10 GME calls- not something if call “large”. 

>The cost on the far right is how much the options cost, per share, that x100 (and times the number of contracts bought) is gone, you spent it. 

The cost of the far right is the MARK price of the option CURRENTLY. Mark price is just the mid point of bid-ask spread. So it’s not exactly the value but close to it. The option he bought costs more than the price show in the right, since he had loss, so you can assume that he bought the option for more than their current price. 

>You hope to recoup it either selling the options, or exercising them if they turn ITM (In The Money)

The first is true. Second is- no retail investor does it so it’s not even an “option”. (Funny because the reason it’s called option is that you have the option to do so, but no one actually does it). You make money by selling the contract. DO NOT EXERCISE (buy shares at strike). 

>With the 52 call example the shares would have to have hit $52 + option cost for them to be profitable if exercised, but exercising means buying all those shares.

The strike+cost= break even. So the profit would come after hitting that number. Because he is leveraged 330X in 52 calls, every cent $MO gains after 52+cost, gives him 330 dollars. Every dime gives him 3,300$. And if MO hits, 53$ (currently 51.3) or gains 3% in the next 2 days, he gets 25k just from the 52c. (Every 1$ gains 33k from 52c). 

>People sell option contracts they bought to others if they cannot afford to exercise them themselves.

99.99999999% of the time this is true. 

>When you exercise, you're paying the price per share that it was when the option was bought, so the difference between that and the share value when you exercise is profit (less the option cost) if you then sell them off.

This is wrong. The price at option bought time doesn’t matter. The strike of the option is the price you agreed to buy the stock at. When you exercise, you are simply paying the strike price of the option. 


>If it doesn't hit 52 by 4/1/21 they're worthless though, your option to exercise has expired.

True. 

>I'm not good at this but it will do until someone wants to explain it better/pick holes in what I have wrong.

>Edit: mostly formatting, strike, and to not forget to multiply options cost by no. of contracts too, and the important bit about exercising."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, 
I'm new to this and most sounds like rocket science to me, but you've actually explained it pretty well. 
Im too new to do options but i still have a small question:

I'm learning with like 2k in my brokers account, options (if always multiplied by 100) would be too expensive right and would not be an option with that amount of money?
Except for if it was a pennystock maybe?

Correct me if I'm wrong :) and thanks again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"less money, less tax, which means less problems I guess"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It won't.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"'this is wrong' part - Yes, sorry, chewed through too many crayons at that point while trying to untangle it all, fixed now I think as I don't want to spread the wrong thing.
And thank you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can buy options with the intent to never excise them and always sell them on instead, and this is very common, and a quicker way to earn, but they are a larger gamble than stocks because they can expire having not hit your strike price, no-one might be interested in buying them.  
So though it protects you from loosing the cost of buying 100 shares as you were never committed to that, you can still end up missing every call you ever make or not finding a buyer and lose 100% of what you spent buying the option in the first place.  


On the other hand if you buy shares they're also a gamble but if they go down you've normally only lost some of the money you put in, not all of it, and it might go back up again at some point anyway, and if you've done some decent due diligence you're more likely to come out not so badly.  


I'm fairly new at this too but I would suggest spending quite a bit of time learning more about stocks first before options as on the way you'll also end up getting a better understanding of how prices move, what affects them, and that will help later for judging what sort of strike prices people go for and the date, and you'll probably get a better understanding of all the risks too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,now that you sold it will lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, thanks for taking the time. 

Alright, got it so far. Ive actually seen some options (calls) the last couple of days where the stock price already matched or was higher than the strike price. 
The time was almost a non factor in my eyes (like really close to expire). Those calls wouldve been a save bet or not? U dont need to go into detail here, but I think in those cases the premium is way higher and therefore maybe not worth it?
Was hard to google that phenomen this afternoon, couldnt find anything. 

Well yeah, I defo will be learning without options for now but understanding them more and more will help definitely. Before doing this kind of stuff I prolly neee to set up a free account for testing. Thanks again  :)"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dave Chapelle also worked with Netflix to get the rights to his show lately.  Haven’t seen much more on that but that doesn’t help Comedy Central at all
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense since they were down 30 percent for no other reason that someone else made a bet on another company and failed miserably. So yeah, unless something is wrong about their business model, I don't see why a cool 30 percent over 8 months isn't realistic."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it hinges on people signing up for Paramount Plus rather than their nostalgia for old reruns on Comedy Central
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no, this will be consolidating for a while under 50 lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long VIAC.
4/21, 6/21, 1/22 calls at 47.5$ & 50$."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently waiting for the end of the week before I decide to buy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy central didn't pay Chappelle for a decade while still airing his show and reaping all the benefits of it. When he didn't want to do another deal, they buried him  and pretty much tried to end his career. They can go fuck themselves."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you made an argument for VIAC through CC is comedy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That whole chart looks like the sketch of an overly optimistic kid’s idea of a bike ramp.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy central is super woke, they won't be making any money in the future"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares are better imo. This stock is volatile AF right now so you might get IV crushed on those calls in case this trades sideways for a few months.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy Central is basically dead, every comedian talks about it. all they have is southpark"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Viacom! shit eaters!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this company is to have a future, they need to start a streaming service, but even if they do, they are late to a market that is slowly becoming polluted. There is a reason the hedgies liquidated this company opposed to liquidating some other company. You could probably make a nice swing trade considering it is very oversold at the moment, but I wouldn’t hold long term."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They should buy back shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine doing DD on Viacom and not mentioning CBS or Paramount+
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought the same thing. Bought leaps yesterday.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol good luck.

I only see it tanking below $30 by mid April... If not lower.

No new content announced, relies on old TV model for advertising income, and an infuriating streaming site where you cant even bookmark shows you want to watch.

Literally the only things VIAC has going for it is the Trek franchise and sports."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have chosen a very wired time frame for your graph. Change to a year and spot the difference. Stock is still overvalued imho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no shit, I didn't know that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love your plan currently have a couple TME calls. Thinking about cutting a few long term bets to jump on this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought about going long too. But they also more than doubled since January. It looks like they grew very quickly as well. The current price is the same as mid Jan.  So might this be a justifiable level?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Content and an ability to create it is going to be at a huge premium as everyone consolidates and goes streaming b2c — into a massive market that loves stupid shit as much or more than quality 

Short term I could see a bounce, long term — it depends on managements ability to turn that appreciating asset into something — or at the very least - not piss it away

If debt and management are quality — it should recover simply because real assets at a decent price are tough to find in this uncertain world — lot of money would scoop it up for even nominal gains"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I'm not the only one who caught that lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SNL is NBC property
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither is SpongeBob lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you can watch south park on it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It usually comes on Friday nights, and honestly was always better in the 50s when Lenny Bruce was on cast."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss Anthony Jeselnik talkin shit about them on his pod... the Jeselnik & Rosenthal Vanity Project....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And the crown jewel of intellectual property Inside Amy Schumer! lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Full retard mode activated!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MY MAN.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. I feel like it may be liquidated a little more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have a streaming service.... and it crap.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've had their streaming service for 3 years and it's doing fine, it generates revenue through it's base tier limited commercial variant too. Imagine buying NFLX at $50; that's the potential for VIAC in the future, they have little to no barrier of entry into creating tier 1 content, shows and movies, through Paramount and CBS two entertainment Goliath's. If it weren't for these huge blocks getting dropped this could have easily ran into the $120-$150 range EOY"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize they merged with CBS 12/2019 
 Looking at a year chart is only going to show you the increasing value of the combined companies. 
 Not even that.  Covid hit right after the merger finalized. 
 The current price is barely 2% above the merger day value, that means none of their streaming services and excess cash on hand for growth is priced on, currently. 
   
  Shorts always want to think a stock is overvalued because that's the big story on MSM, one day you're gonna realize that the over valued narrative that's being pushed is just a tool to separate you from your money.  Like any MSM finance narrative
  
 Now, had you said the stock was over valued, you might have had a point.  As it stands, your opinion is useless, based on nothing, and easily proven false."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not going lower than this, likely ever, yesterday had 10x average volume and it couldn't even retest $40 got slapped the minute it went under $44 and couldn't even get below $45 today with more than 4x average volume, when the short positions close this is going to low $50's"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*HBO has entered the chat*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can watch South Park on its own dedicated website. Have been able to for years.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but the best era was when Jackie Gleeson was  in the main cast, along with Lucille ball.... I loved when they would have Dezi Arnez on as musical guest."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you going to try and convince me the hot garbage on Netflix is better, NFLX is only going to get worse, by that I mean way more indie/foreign content that I couldnt give a shit about; plus, as more companies exercise their content rights upon expiry NFLX is going to a) lose a lot of premium content, for example the office got yoinked because of Peacock, similar shit may happen, or b) at the very least it may not be exclusive to NFLX, or/and more expensive which will lead to higher revenues from licensing.  

Just because it's not something you watch doesn't mean it's not something other people watch; if you don't know, that's where the entertainment market is moving towards several Al la Carte' content providers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$120 seems a bit too optimistic. Just below the prior peak is very likely though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"With personal insults you just prove you do not have any argument. Why is my opinion useless and yours superior? Why is my opinion based on nothing and yours on knowledge?
Do you live in a free country and do you know what it means to express different opinions and do you understand that those opinions can help you to see your argument from a different perspective?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t it also on Hulu? Or at least was...have no idea if it still is or not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NFLX is better because it has top tier content like Cuties.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Netflix is considerably better than Paramount plus. It's not even close
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I'm for sure not saying it bounces all the way back to ATH; but, intrinsically, this has the potential to be a $200 dollar stock < 3 years, reliant upon continued, quality content additions and subscriptions to P+"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You ignoring the actual financial points Is easiest for you huh? And focusing on the only thing you can argue against, ""my mean words"" shows your opinion is based on shit. 
 Did you argue technicals, fundamentals or just emotions?  
 Exactly. So go fuck off back to ""bear land"" with your bitch ass."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Taken off within the past year. HBO only place to watch it as far as I know besides CC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I remember whenever I used Netflix is spending too much time scrolling through tons of shit I wasn't remotely interested in... It's only going to get worse too, because an overwhelming majority of the 'tier 1' content Netflix has isn't their, Netflix pays Companies like VIAC subsidiaries CBS/Paramount/CC/MTV/BET etc... For the rights to showcase the content and gone are the days where Netflix will easily be able to retain exclusive rights when the companies it pays for content exercise their rights to purvey that content on their own platforms, and the cost benifit will be positive either way for companies like VIAC a) they get more revenue renegotiating exclusive rights contracts with Netflix or, b) the contracts aren't exclusive rights contracts and therefore appear as content on P+  c) this type of disruption will funnel  non-core Netflix user's towards these alternative platforms d) there's a strong argument to be made that in the near future people will have 2-3+ subscription services and Paramount+ is poised to be a frontrunner as that 2nd or 3rd option"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe at this exact moment in time, I'll not deny they're the #1 for sure, personally, I think it's trash, everything I've ever enjoyed on Netflix gets rotated off of to the point I'm over it, more than 80% of its content at any given time is trash that I'd never watch anyways; I'd rather pay less for something that has less content but all its content is stuff I'd watch. NFLX didn't blow up over night and neither will P+ but, it's ability to do what Netflix did in its first decade is exponentially easier than it was for Netflix and will be exponentially more profitable. Paramount is one of the major motion picture studios, imagine all the infrastructure and talent pools they're able to access, high grade A list acting; not the fucking C+ budget priced, who the fuck is this type of talent Netflix splurges on! They've already announced that certain movies produced by Paramount will be available on P+ 45 days after its theatrical release; 5 years from now P+ could be a behemoth with regards to content providers. Netflix is only going to deteriorate, with more companies retaining rights to their content for their own platforms and or charge Netflix a heavy premium which will ultimately lead to the content being more difficult to access on a consistent basis. And, foreign content is interesting, but, I'm not spending $20 a month to watch indie productions and foreign content... Sorry, not sorry!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#so you're saying its price could go up or down?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me helmet on backwards I cant c
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Confirmation bias. I love it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"sitting at 240 average...gotta say its more fun when you're down, constantly checking the ticker. Yall turned me into a gambling addict. Not just any gambling addict, one that finds pleasure in losing.Plus I'm from Canada, so I can't just ""break even at 240"" It needs to be at 250+ so I don't lose money from conversions

""got in at 300+ right before the big dip"" gang where you at?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It needs a catalyst. Might be today after their interview, POWER HOUR

Edit: Dear apes, HF might setup another massive short following the interview to shake out the paperhands, idgaf what happens, I HODL.

Edit 2: I went full retard, there are no GME personnel involved in this meeting, it’s just a board of ANALysts discussing the outlook of the company. Sorry fellow apes, never go full retard."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So buy more GME, ok got it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The MACD is still sitting below the signal line looking at the charts I can find, though it does seem to be sloping up so a crossover is possible, I would personally wait for confirmation though.


Also, I’m pretty sure your yellow line is the MACD and the red line is the signal line in the post, but I would explicitly mention that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So MACD isnt about McDonalds...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying Buy & Hodl?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV WAS RIGHT THEN AND HES RIGHT NOW


GME GOING THROUGH TRANSPORTATION BUCKLE UP AND HOLDDDD"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The past 2 months at the very end of the month it has shot up. Does anyone know if there is reason behind this? Options expiring or just coincidence? Hoping the same happens this month we are at the end of it. GME TO DA MOOON
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Matta'fact, I'm *43%* blind in my right eye. I can't even see you, sir."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh good, it's been a few hours since we've had a ""GME is going to break out"" thread. I was worried the unbroken 3-month chain of them would end. Thank you for keeping it going!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Clarifies my bias 🚀🌕
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im not sure TA means much for this stock, its heavily manipulated. I think theres some big players delaying this for reasons we might not ever know about"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, right after you posted this it went up $6, so you were right"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seeing how fast GME plummeted after $200 this morning shows how strong of a wall we’re up against. Even at $195 there was massive selling pressure just 15 minutes ago. We need a lot of volume to break $200 this afternoon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Indicators do not work with GME fella
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do people insist on wasting time doing technical analysis on a stock that's shorted 900%, is being heavily manipulated thru ETF shorting and hidden FTDs and outrageous options walls?

Isn't that inherently nonsensical as a predictive model?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technical analysis is stupid. Sorry. Your thesis could be right or wrong, but I don’t think sacrificing goats or looking into fires is the right way to make investing decisions"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This made me buy 5 more just now dammit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR: a single MACD crossover is signs of a breakout? Get fucking real, how does this shit have this many upvotes?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Love me some trash ass posts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I enjoy a quiet afternoon of picking dried dingleberries from my ape bottom hairs to sell on eBay
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GO GME GO!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,fuck yes it is gme 200c 4/1 lets do this shit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,no matter what happens ill continue to buy the dips. Bought two at 183 today. Hope for a bigger dip down the line so I can buy more than 1-3 aday
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We are the catalyst! Us holding and pouring our souls into this IS THE DAMN CATALYST.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We need to crack 200 then 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've heard a different TA prediction for a run up every day since we were down from the second peak and basically every time they've been dead wrong.  TA is bullshit, if TA actually worked then the market wouldn't function because everyone would just... Use TA and bet big every time"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid 🦍DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Impressive. Thank you for your service
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You know this sub is fucked when this shit gets 3.7k upvotes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I stopped reading at this is my first attempt at TA. So you have absolutely no idea what your doing and posting charts and a wall of text.... got it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,saw the title and said to myself “please be technical analysis using basic-ass astrology tools like MACD & RSI”. Technical retards _never_ let me down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Love it. Thanks for this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And it will happen soon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do love me some technical analysis, but GME is not normal, most of the rules don't apply here and technical indicators are a fart in the wind, GME breaking out is going to be the result of someone smashing their fist on a bed red buy button."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When will you learn that TA is BS? TA = BS. There is no way in hell you are going predict the future. Go play with horoscopes if you want to delude yourself. How come you ignore when you are wrong? Do you like to be insane? Who is ever manipulating the stock doesn't give a shit about what you think. All you are doing is diluting real DD with BS. You might as well get your diving rod out too and use that to tell us how GME is going to the moon for the 100th time. Can you not just sit back and let it do what it will do?

&#x200B;

Anyone can be right all the time when they ignore when they are wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am actually so glad you clarified what MACD was because after reading a million posts containing ""MOASS"" I just assumed it meant mac daddy (Like a big trigger) hahahaha.

It is also 4:30 am here in au and my ape brain is feeling like melted crayon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until we start seeing volume, I wouldn't get my hopes up too high."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shut up already jesus h
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was always of the understanding GME does the opposite of what TA says is supposed to happen.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think we will see breakout, if it does not match with the approximate max pain number from the option chain. Clearly the longs are bleeding the shorts via max pain number. Thats why we end always just or very close to it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm retarded, but I genuinely believe that Wednesday is going to be a pivotal point. Why? I don't know, I can't explain it, but a lot of the pressure against banks, HF's, Wall Street. Wednesday maybe the day of the MOASS, or could be a bump. Either way,  TO THE FUCKING MOON"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This got my confirmation bias hard af.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I will buy 4 more

Update: I could only afford 3 more...hodling at 57 for Valhalla"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the business strategy already. Papa Cohen seems to be keeping everything close to the chest. Rather than tell everyone his plans, he silently showing us. Competitors can’t get ahead of what they don’t know is coming. I love it"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol nope
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,no offense folks but the fact that this passes as useful TA and gets this many upvotes does not bode well for the ongoing status of this sub.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow apes it has truly been an interesting ride these last 3 months you wonderful smooth brains apes has allowed me to learn what 💎🤲 truly means.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"  I am going to repeat this message from here to eternity: Dates & DD don't mean shit. This is not normal stock. It is being manipulated to the nth degree. But the good news is they can manipulate it for so long and so many methods before it gets critical. Doesn't matter if ""all hedgefunds"" get in on it. All. Shorts. Must. Cover. Remember that. 

  I will just BUY, HODL and STAY patient and vigilant. Let the cucks wriggle and squirm as much as they want. £10,000,000 a share. I also treat everything until the squeeze as a distraction. Even the stonk itself. It is merely the vessel to Valhalla. May we all reach it's peaceful shores."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your similes are 10/10 👏🏻
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t read but I’m in
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People who do technical analysis give me a hard on from confirmation bias, even GME is a great abnormality."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your words and your pretty pictures fed my confirmation bias and I really can't ask for anything else.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun day, lets get that next jump"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Loved the post man! I wont be as detailed as you but in another note I've been tracking NOPECHART which showed a negative end of day result which we didn't see since the run up in FEB and it went negative about two trading days ago. I'm confident we are going to rip to the heavens.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No ape pattern. No Batman pattern. No obtuse crocked penis wedge pattern. Obviously fake TA.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course it will moon. Had to sell 5 of my 7 shares this morning, because dishwasher broke and needs replacement. So yeah, here’s your catalyst.  You’re welcome"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Awwwww shhhhiiiiiit.....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys of any of the matter when we have a dark pool, synthetic shares and shady options"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If i say that TA on a normal stock is reading tea leaves, interpreting lines in the palms of the hand and studying tarot cards, and on GME its pure astrology.

What do you say in response?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon soon is something I like.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone please get me a graph of the GME price... in combination with posts saying it's going to the moon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need 2 days for my paycheck, can we wait 2 more days please?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically what I'm getting from this is prepare to buy another dip. Gotcha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,A Robinhood screenshot technical analysis is true Wallstreet bets fashion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,G d it I’m harder than a fkn crayon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, I had crayons up my nose. What did you say?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lit thanks a bunch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only using Oscillators doesnt give you nearly enough info tho. but GME UPPIES i like
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Average down from 281 to 189 🚀🦍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No disrespect, but I would not bet one penny because of indicators like MACD or RSI..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,looks like you were right! I'd say it could try to consolidate 200 now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How hard is OPs dick right now? Glad I listened and got 15 more shares- good DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD. All I got from it though is a craving for some McDonald's
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have lent a lot of ETF to short the shit out of the stock! EXPECT FUCKERY!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR. When your done drawing charts with crayon, can I have them? I’m getting hungry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It really hard to do TA on manipulated stock. Just buy and hodL. Regardless good DD.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this so my wife’s boyfriend can explain it to me later.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD + yellow and red colors. So ... we're buying McDonalds now?

Ape confused. Wrinkles have been smoothed. Need dip to buy moar."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My dumbass thought MACD meant McDonalds :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought more now holding more. Shit this is heavvvy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"HODL THE FCKNG LINE! GIVE THEM NOTHING, TAKE FROM THEM EVERYTHING!! APESTRONG 🦍💪🏽💎🙌🏽🚀"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything above 200 today is good. 11k at 200 ITM on call chain.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,OBV is also +768k (ish)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could DFV $12 calls be the catalyst? They expire the 16th? Couldn’t that be some fuel amongst a few others to send this sykward?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Taking time to gain the reward is beneficial as it helps to save it when you reach it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"just broke sma and recovering from oversold too, long sma is on strong uptrend, we finna fly in aftermarket"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s it like to have so much empty space where a brain is supposed to be?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stimmies engage 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're using Robinhood for your TA?
  
That's like using Paint to do heavy photoshopping 😟"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If they do another short attack amd get it around 150 or lower I'm probably just gonna go all in. I'd sell everything else at a slight loss but it's ride or die.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think once dfv and others execute their 4/16 calls, is when shit gets real"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m a noob but, it doesn’t make sense to me that you’re using technical analysis when the GME rise to $300+ was not driven by technicals. It’s a hype driven meme stock. Sure the short squeeze was legitimate, but GME’s current stock value has to have far surpassed that by now. 

Or maybe I’m completely wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The success rate on these “GME is about to explode” posts is arguably 0%. No one knows when. Just buy and hold baby
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I like this stonk but every week there are a shit ton of these posts and we are still here. No doubt we will launch at some point but reading the same story over and over again, meh just keep hodl"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far no new retail or institutional buyers are interested, can't blame them the price is wildly inflated at the moment.

Until huge buys start happening there will be no spike, which means no squeeze (even though that's very unlikely given the SI).

Just don't see it anytime soon.  I think we yo-yo for awhile while bigger players and day traders make bank."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"my dumb high ape mind: something to do with mcdonalds and repetitive strain injury, gottit. Gonna average up and hooooooooooodllllll bayybeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“GME is about to breakout and this is why...” sign up for my free course today.

That’s all I can think about. Everyone who has made this breakout prediction up until this date has been wrong. But daily someone has a reason as to why the next breakout will happen and daily it doesn’t.

One day it will, one day it will be right, we will see. I’m not sure about most things as I don’t know a lot and won’t be doing my DD on this specific instance, but seeing these breakout predictions is getting awkward.

Not trying to hate, just not understanding the constant backing of these predictions when everything that was thought to be a catalyst hasn’t been a catalyst? 🤷‍♂️"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,McDonalds again? My BIAS is confirmed 😎
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm glad to see I'm not the only one looking at MACD (thought I was just being an old fart doing that)!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how am i supposed to read any of this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Call it TAUM “Technical analysis of a stock under manipulation” ... you’re a true pioneer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your colorful spell charts have no power here wizard. Ape only hold. (But seriously nice colors)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a former smack addict, this excites me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yus. Graphs and acronyms, I'm sold"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing TA on this is pretty much useless because  it is such a atypical situation
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD lines close to each other doesn't mean breakout is coming, it's just means that momentum and volatility are low. 

MACD is a lagging indicator, meaning it doesn't predict anything, you can use it to spot divergencies and that's pretty much it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi fellow apes anyone esle getting depressed long weekend coming up one less trading day what to do. 🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌holding strong🤠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought this was a casino?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like McDonalds Big Mac…. Wait we are talking about Macdonald’s right?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this aged well
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was helpful, I'm a simple ape so pictures always work. Thank you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a casino"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Q
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason it'll pop off is because it's my birthday tomorrow, duh."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All I understood was Big Mac. Ape want Big Mac
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll tell you what, one I started having sex with markers, I couldn’t believe I ever used to eat crayons. Living the high life Apes!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR:
Another Redditor deciphers why GME is about to rocket to the moon.  Red and yellow lines back up his case.  

Nothing will probably happen like the other 100 write ups but it gives hope to those who bought at $350 and above. 

🌈🐻💎🙌🚀🌕"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy the markers because I enjoyed the crayons. Take my upvote.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*When you learn about RSI and MACD and think ur a trading god*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me reading all these DDs saying the squeeze is only a butthair away, meanwhile I’ve been holding since January 

*War... war never changes...*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do fundamentals even matter when hedge funds manipulate the market like they’re currently doing?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could see the GOT DAMN y axis label on your screenshots. Got damn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to the casino sir,

Guy on a bar : “the kid thinks he got the numbers ,
(Casino) aka Stock market maneuvering expert : “hold my beer.”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If this holds I may become a believer in TA. I wonder how many times do you see this same pattern and nothing happens?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Am I the only smooth brain that heard Sr Mix a Lot every time I read MACD???
https://youtu.be/Y_fJ_4LrU1w 

I like the song AND I like the stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck did he just say? It gave me a headache.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not done buying shares at these levels. Can the squeeze wait a lil bit longer?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done on the explanation of two things I really put stock into....NPI. I really hope they don’t dilute with more shares.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🚀🚀🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you OP for using my MACD in your calculations.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He put a TL;DR as if i would understand anyways. Forgot to buy more crayons today because i put all my money in gme, someone donate me crayons im hungry"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the stonk will do what it's going to do. Just HODL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So buy and hold, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, a smooth brain ape relying on dumb indicators."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME To infinity and beyond!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So....puts?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I need to see a picture of whatever normal/not going to maybe moon is so I can understand the seriousness better. I’m not seeing any pictures of “this so what it is NOT” so it’s kinda hard for me to comprehend this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty clear it’s about to cup handle from the $220 spike just $20 left to retrace then spike
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another technical analysis using normal a metrics is like saying, “we all have a bunch of carrots, now if you look at how these oranges grow”

GME isn’t a normal situation stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, wasn't a fan of the OPs pics. 

Here's a better ""when in doubt, zoom out"" chart to show what they are getting at in the big picture. 

[https://i.imgur.com/Zfh3PcF.jpg](https://i.imgur.com/Zfh3PcF.jpg)

The big picture MACD is even getting ready to swing up, if not already doing so, to the signal line and RSI is also ready to head up off the 50 range towards 70. 

As we know, GME isn't behaving like a normal stock, but the indicators do look promising at this point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My ape brain can no longer take in any more DD or TA! I just like stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there. 🐈
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So we buy more GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Doesn’t a breakout catalyst primarily depend on bull HF and their play? Or other business action by GameStop?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think 99% of us apes are smart enough to understand most of that, butt fuck it I’ll hold gme to da moon🙌💎🚀💦🌚"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, bought more gme & ate green crayons."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Baby, breakout, go ahead and give it to me

Breakout, honey, take me through the night

Breakout, now I'm standin' here, can't you see?

Breakout, it's all right
It's all right..
.
It's all right…"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,tl:dr another month of trading sideways.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,but where is the salmon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So many words. So few lines.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🦧🚀🦧🚀🦧🚀🦧🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🧠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"you had me at ""got damn""

good night i love you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put a dollar in the ""GME is about to moon"" jar.   Should be able to buy a share soon!

Position: 101 shares"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just sold my entire portfolio and went all on for you man, lead me to the promise land"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"just sold off half of my portfolio, I'll be racing you apes to buy more before this shit hits 200+"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey I know some of these words!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are saying to buy more.  Done.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn your a smart ape! Dude I think you might be right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn't read just upvoted. GME10MILLI🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cant read but good post
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get RSI from picking up a Big MACD, got it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Watch out guys Im going to buy one more stock in 5 mins.

It might kick back GME to 10% lower right after my transaction complete."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could read =(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes follow the trends from the days of lore when RC was just announced to the board.

It looks like today there will be a test at the 200 resistance. 

Break through and regain it's support.

Fail and drop back down to 190's support.

Catalysts are inbound.

Not financial advice. Ape buy. Ape hodl. Ape win."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tell me more tell me more like do you have a car
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the coo should double all stock and immediately recall it if its worth what we think.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At the end of the day the team with more points usually wins the game
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's real simple an ape can do it.

Stonk goes up, hold.

Stonk goes down, buy.

It's like shooting fish in a barrel.

edit: my first award, I don't know what to say...  thank you u/duchessbune!  may GME bless you and every ape HODLing.

edit2: thank you kind stranger u/jxphillips15.  you're gonna make this ape cry.  and I was told there's no crying in HODLing.  or is there???"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks only go up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah when the MACD is flat like that it could breakout up or down. Depends on the support/resistance and volume. But this is GME and stonks only go up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He didn't get your joke
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There's a chance yes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*sigh* god dammit... OR SIDEWAYS.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Here hold onto this *hands you my 💎balls*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hold on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude.. this is my most loved, underrated comment ever. C’mere lil squirt, I take care of you. I c 4 us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jacked
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was able to average down from $253 to $211. It's never too late!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was at $75 average and managed to average up in last few weeks.  Buy high sell higher??!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Life's no fun if you aren't staring down the barrel of homelessness. Mansion or tent down by the river.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was at $130 / average this morning, but damnit, had to buy moar stock today......  moar.... moar... moaaaaaaarrrrRRRRRRRRRR"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, I learned the loosing part quite fast. Got in at 347$ but hold and averaged down to 171$. Can‘t wait for the rocket to launch."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate that I relate to this. Why do I like watching it so much when it’s down?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like ape need average down on banana🍌
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went in at 280 and just keep buying on dips so that my average is 213 now but i feel the same way.  Never have I felt so alive as I did waking up and seeing how much money I lost.  I never cared for gambling in casinos apart from poker, but now I see how great it can be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty risky to have a good sense of humor, be able to laugh at yourself, and also find losing money funny. One side of your brain ends up fucking the other over just for giggles."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,twinsiees
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got in near peak in Jan, then I averaged down on the dips. Then I averaged my way back up!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang on Canadian ape 🦍 the rocket 🚀 ride is bumpy but we plant all world flags on the moon at the “Lunar GameStop Tourist Welcome Center”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying shares isn't gambling, God I miss the old r/wallstreetbets"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Check into norbert's gambit if your concerned about high conversion fees
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Plus its a pain in the ass converting just to find out how many freedom bucks you have and how many shares we can get with them. I just leave most cash in the US accounts that way they dont rape the 1.x% everytime there is a conversion as well. But take your time and check that the CAD is up a bit before doing so.

Not advice, thats just what I do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats how you get white hair and wrinkles lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have more that 1k or so to convert look into Norbert's Gambit if you don't know. Turns it from a stupid percent fee like 2% each way to a 2x normal stock transaction cost fee that's pretty much static for any amount, but it can just take a little time to convert."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> gotta say its more fun when you're down

I couldn't disagree more lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Interview power hour?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Any idea when / how we can see what happened there? Will it be published tonight?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Catalyst: 

DFV doubles down again and posts gain porn"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock isn't based on fundamentals right now. Cohen or anyone else isn't going to increase their stake at this price. Longs aren't going to buy untill the price settles even if there is good news. The catalyst is whatever hedge fund moves first or runs out of ammo to keep shorting.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME needs some rocket fuel 🚀.... it’s take a few days . You at only looking at a convergence possibility, it could diverge as well but either way they are prolonging the inevitable..... we will wait them out!!🤘🏼🤘🏼 I have seen RSIs buried when HF drops a 🔨 😒 just to make it clear ape I am PRO GME!! I love the stock! Look into Phoenix ascending function by wyckoff.."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you miss the news this morning?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be careful in placing hope for that interview, I can see HFs setting that up like earnings.  Get everyone's hopes up then focus on negative spin when it doesn't meet people's expectation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would buy that dip so hard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't need no catalyst. We apes are the biggest catalyst there is.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Power hour is 1-2pm ET, the interview will take place after markets close. But, should be nice for tomorrow (;"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What time?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying there might be a.... Fire sale? Be still my beating heart
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IS there a link?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,APES DON’T PULL OUT!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,do you know where to watch it at??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either interview is going awful we’re getting another short attack lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm hoping for another discount. Got $500 to throw, trying to get as many shares as possible"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks simple jack!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want them to tank the price so badly! I have £1k waiting to get in a fire sale!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,going full retard is the way! the only way! ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|tendies)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like they just signed on a few prominent people as growth executives from Amazon and Chewy. 

Could be very good news"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idgaf if they setup a massive short. Give me those shares a discount. not fuckin selling

P. S. I like the stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You HODL?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So possible sale on GME? I'm down for that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you see mention of no GME personnel in the meeting?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late. You already gone done it. You went full returd
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a retard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly maybe the analysts are gonna say bad things while the hedgies sell it short
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I kind of hope they drop it again so I can average down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I REALLY hope they do...   Got my funds ready for the dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as this stock being not normal, any normal catalysts happening on the business side of GME will only lead to normal price fluctuations, like today.

The trigger for a squeeze would be somewhere within the Game of Shorts & Borrows.

Easy proof: there was ZERO business factor in the Jan gamma squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🧠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No it does not. And there are plenty of catalysts. Like 2 top-notch hires.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what time??? WHAT TIME GOD DAMMIT??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is correct I’ll edit thanks for that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I too learned something new today..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought RSI was what my wrist got whenever my wife was away...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought one more share today at 186.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Purely speculation: could be hedgies being forced to close out some of their shorts pre-month end? 🤷‍♀️ IDFK, just a guess."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i like this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"98% inna da left, pop pop"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"**not fun fact** if you suddenly experience the above phenomenon seek medical attention immediately. 

* not financial advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are obsessed with TA and it almost never pans out. If it were THAT reliable, don’t you think people who trade for a living wokldve scripted bots and dominated the world by now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a reliable pastime!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That should be a new euphemism for jerking off.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's arguable that these indicators provide ""some"" insight. They aren't that applicable to a stock as volatile as this. With so much manipulation it becomes even more unreliable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree but this stock is not the norm, it defies all odds. WHY because we are only buying and holding. A recipe that shorts never antisipated when they wrote nakeds at $19 then they did it again after the first run, this time the shorted it with a passion because the stock will never go that high again.

Oh boy!!!! Shorts this will be a monumental pile of pain if you cannot get out, just FLIP and go LONG while the stock is still CHEAP."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TA hardly works
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do, just gotta understand news trumps TA. People still buy on patterns, but if it's a bad news day, nobody is pouring in the cash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to use technical analysis for a swing trade is like trying to predict the weather a year out anyways.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cause if and when it goes up, OP wants to be able to take credit as a genius lmao. We been seeing the same TA nonsense for weeks now"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,THANK YOU
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is gonna hurt some feelings here, but technical analysis is backwards-looking confirmation bias, nothing more. It cannot be used to predict the future, only used to explain why the past-present occurred. Not to mention, there's a billion different patterns to ""explain"" every movement. That's not reliable or future-looking in the slightest lmao. 

We live in an age where a tweet sends stocks up or down far more than any trend lines do.

Technical analysis is absolute horseshit and that statement is hardly contained to $GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can give you an idea of how the stock is behaving and how “smart money” is looking at it. Right now, it’s behaving like a typical stock. Holding value and seeing a slow ramp into a sustainable squeeze is what we want - rather than a fast spike and drop last time. That  should/may/ideally allow the price to go a lot higher than the biggest spike we’ve seen so far. 

A not-so-volatile squeeze would be the MOAS here. At least, that’s my understanding."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol glad somebody said it. If you look at any day over the last month it crosses constantly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD and RSI are the two most garbage indicators, change my mind"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep reading this. Why $200?

The only number I want to see GME break is $350. RH shut off buying when we hit $350 the first time and GME was slammed when we approached $350 it early/mid March. 

So I am not getting too excited until we breach $350."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use RSI, MACD and VWAP. They’re helpful for intraday trades. Not reliable for swing trades. And for $GME - they’re fuckin useless."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how OP doesn't even mention his timeframe for his calculations. It could be like 5min and r/wsb wouldn't even know.

Hell, I just checked the 1D range and it isnt anywhere close to the oversold region."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Work
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not the way

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't DD. This is astrology. Although I do agree with some points it's not because of TA. There is no TA for GME. There are no indicators for momentum. Because of the apes holding, every direction it moves will be with momentum. This is a short squeeze it will either rocket to andromeda or plummet to the seventh circle of hell."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My confirmation bias is through the roof.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And everyone clapped
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sagittarius is in ascension.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please explain in great detail why someone else's calls expiring would be a catalyst for a stock price increasing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the squeeze price is $1,000 per share? People here say that anyway."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't the boost in share price today due to new buy ins? How else would the stock price go up?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People need hope to hold on to something this risky. Confirmation bias gives them more hope.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it basically just yellow line above pink line= good?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not sure i understand. Can you circle a bunch of things in yellow?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I need john madden to do all DD from now on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except in Aztec basketball, the team with the most points loses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My personal guess is that it'll go down little by little to like at least $160 or maybe even $120 before another rally of hitting over $300.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#Not at all.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤡
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Sir please place your jacked tits in the upright position, we are about to take off.*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Averaged down from 333 to 191
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,211 gang
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking hell are you me?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s quite a lot of perseverance  and money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged up from 118 to 250ish a few weeks back....only brought it back down to 235 last week. It is definitely more fun to watch the gains/losses when you have more shares though. Watching it move by a few cents and you get to see your shares jump by dollars is fun.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m down to $133 can’t wait to average 🆙 to $250.... wait is that the way🤔 pretty good deal at least 4 times profit to $1,000 minimum per share. Math 🧮 checks out I think 🤪"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Average  🆙 then sell Higher at the “Lunar GameStop Tourist Welcome Center” 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged up too but only because I have a gut feeling we are still at the base of the mountain here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least keep enough money to afford a van down by the river.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Averaging down is nice, but if you expect the moon, the difference in an average between say 130 and 180 doesn't much matter if you're adding to your position."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MOASS will lead to mo ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When it fell from 350 to 250 in that one second that day i couldnt stop laughing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,240 is after averaging down with this month's salary.. i was a 300+ gang from that last spike to 350...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,whos needs therapy when you have GME.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,its not really humor it was more like. holy shit lmao holy shit and then reading all the comments on wsb
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"im not just talking about stocks, its more like my mentality changed. It's boring when im making money, I like to be losing and chasing for a win. I have now turned into a risk seeker for the dopamine hit."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A good announcement gives the long whales a REASON to go nuts and buy. If the long whales just picked up tons of shares out of nowhere, they could be accused of market manipulation. I’m a retard, just my two cents"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m glad it’s settling at 180 then

Also: all these people talking fundamentals but can u explain to me why so many companies have doubled and tripled in the last 1-2 years.. how can a company like apple double in valuation over a year (64$ a year ago, now 119, or 2T) and people aren’t throwing the f word at them? Apple gained a trillion over a year and ur sitting here talking fundamentals? Get outta here with this shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's just one Amazon guy out of other Amazon/Chewy alumni already hired. The big news may not likely come until the empty board seats are replaced.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only way!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem, you’re one of the few people who actually wrote something for a technical analysis using the flair.  It’s ok, maybe not the best, but I would like to more technical analysis from you in the future, maybe adding some other technical indicators.  Maybe even look at a few different stocks, and see which one has the most clear technicals signaling up or down to then enter into either calls or puts respectively.


If you can consistently find good plays by analyzing the technicals, and can predict say 10-20% moves, you could hit a few ten baggers I would think."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good move
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You missed out buying at $203, then it's worth more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just thinking that if I were the DTCC I wouldn't want this to take off until I got my shit in order.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but every time it gets close to another catalyst they seem to do a massive sell and drive it back down drastically. I don't doubt that they're working on slowly covering their shorts and using the rest of their leverage over the market to mitigate their losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're still looking at this like a normal stock. None of that is relevant here. Last time the stock didn't lose momentum because of smart money or anything normal. Robinhood shut trading down. 

The last several weeks trading within a narrow band for maximum pain. That's been orchestrated and fought out by big players. There is no technical predictive view on that in these hour by hour analyses. 

MACD was primed to go weeks ago. Then what happened? Smart money? Trader sentiment? No. Shorts began shorting ETFs in rampant fashion to drive the price down.

If there's any predictions it should be on how low these scum will go considering the SEC is content eating their a**"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, wonder how they will react when it breaks 500 again I mean if all goes well the freaking MOASS could be tens to hundreds of thousands I mean they freaked out over 350 what would happen at like 5000 lol mayhem."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if this still applies because I'm a smooth brain, but late last week there was some DD showing the percentage of ITM calls vs puts for GME. $200 was a significant breakthrough where the ratio of calls to puts ITM was strongly favoring calls (something like 70% calls ITM). The more calls that are ITM, the more upward pressure there is on the stock price."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people are morons, they don't realize that just acting like an imbecile won't get them rich, it will get them working at Wendy's.  All the bullshit from these tards isn't helping their cause. They have no idea what is going on and when GME is up they are happy and when GME is down they are sad.  Even if GME moons they will end up blowing their money and then being broke and have nothing and still have to go work at Wendy's.

People pretend like it is a sure thing, then when they lose it drives them insane. They have no idea if they are even being played or not but all they can do is assume that they are special and the universe is trying to make them millionaires without having any real proof.

I bet they are already checking out Lambos to find out which ones they want to order. These people would get butchered in a real war. They better hope DFV, RC, and others can actually pick up the slack needed and not double crossing them or just gambling.

What amazes me is how people will believe so much shit without having any real proof of it. Someone shows an image and it 100% must be true of it reinforces their desire. Fucking lunatics IMO. I'm not saying GME won't moon, I'm simply saying most apes are actually retards and maybe if they learn to use their brains they might actually figure out a way increases the chances that GME will moon significantly. About 90% of these imbeciles seem to be able to only make irrelevant comments that only reinforce an unproven narrative(the narrative is not DFV's. If you bought in at 400 or 200 you are in a totally different ballpark). Some use TA like it's actually science when it's just BS justification, just a religion. A few others try to do DD and research but that is swamped out by the noise. All these imbeciles better hope the ""whales"" are not just corralling them for the slaughter but really want them to make some money(but you would think you would want some proof so you don't get eaten). No wonder why humanity is in such a mess, morons can't even have basic skepticism of their own beliefs."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have to eat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most disingenuous comment iv read in a long time, I’m good bro"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If it plummets people will buy the dip and then we are back to square one.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But at what point does it become a blind following that hurts more than helps? That’s what I keep wondering after seeing constant repetition of logical analytic insight... but this stock isn’t ever going to follow a normal stocks recipe for success.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's the X's you've got to worry about"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,>usually
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I don't think it'll go down past 175 anymore. It went back down last week and we rebuild and created solid walls where it will be hard to make people sell. This area is probably the new low 40 that we saw weeks ago. Traded sideways for a while and then boom again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thnk yu fr dis
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged down from 260 to 130..

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a private meeting, nothing will be brought to public either way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it is a closed interview... someone answered with a screenshot about this. I am not sure but it looked like a screen from a Bloomberg terminal...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that would be so fucked and amazing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Translation, whales need a smoke cover. Apparently it's illegal to like the stock just for the sake of the stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying a ton of shares isn't manipulation though... Anyone can dump millions into a stock anytime they choose.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They long whales aren't buying unless it is to take part in the squeeze and sell for profit to reload later.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,196*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is much more than double in the past year. Yes other stocks can get detached from fundamentals but the key is gme is a case where everyone knows why. It would be poor investing to get in at this price with the idea you won't sell if it spikes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, went full retard. Power hour is 1-2pm Mtn time. Never go full retard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the plan! Of course I had to post GME first cuz this is WSB and the GME arc, but I’ve been keeping very close eye on the TA indicators for AMC and PLTR respectively. 

Thanks for the positive feedback it really means a lot after the time I’ve put in to educate myself since getting into the market last December. Maybe I’ll post some more soon if time permits!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, you nailed it, it is a massive scramble to keep their heads above the water.

The beauty of it all is that they have the ""brightest"" and ""smartest"" with an arsenal of sophisticated tools and some serious $$ to pull it off but they cannot. WHY I AM SO SURE ABOUT IT.... the stock trades at $197. No SSR, they just cannot break it.

The thing that drives the market is dislocated with GME, greed and fear drives the market, it creates buy and sell, with GME there is only HOPE, BUY, HOLD, the physiological chain is dysfunctional.

Therefore I am so glad I am on the side where I know how much I can loose if it goes to $0, shorts have no idea how high this thing can go, we know how high... the hight I am willing to hold before I sell. 

NO one can force the longs to sell. Shorts on the other hand???"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock market goes brrrr. Then power fluctuates, breaker trips. Then announcements about risk, etc etc"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think it’s game over once we breach $350. That’s when RH was in the early stages of being margin called. 

If it’s similar to the VW squeeze we are looking at $30k/share. But that was only 15% short interest and the shorts were given a break. I suspect we will see prices greater than $100k. How high? No clue.

I don’t see how this doesn’t result in a massive market correction. I assume it will crash but, at a minimum, we should see a fire sale on tech stocks as funds are liquidated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, ok, I remember seeing a similar DD recently. Not that I disagree (or have the knowledge to argue my point), but I see a lot of chatter surrounding ITM options every week. Each time we approach those price targets we start to see a massive increase in puts. No rocketing happens and then a new “max pain DD” comes out shortly after explaining how long whales didn’t want to rocket yet to bleed the shorts. 

I hope we are correct but we keep breaking $200 and nothing happens haha."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Then gambling shouldn't be a priority
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You're right. I don't give a shit if you eat or not. Hopefully you don't have a family though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm just saying TA is pointless especially with gme
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah k you don't know shit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,just buy low sell high I guess
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Traded at 40 for a long time and I thought I learned my lesson. Said I’d still hold but couldn’t buy any more because losing any more money would’ve hurt too much. Boy was I wrong.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too unlikely too. Just paying $12/share to just own the shares outright is negligible if he wants to essentially maintain his position past the expiry date. They're so deep itm that he pretty much already owns 150k shares, the only reason he'd sell is to take some profit without scaring people since selling calls is less scary than shares, though he also has eight figs of cash so I don't think that's likely unless we double the week before."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You don't know what the fuck you are talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The key point in the comment you're replying to is the ""not selling if it spikes"" part. The price is currently too high/volatile for anyone (especially an institution) to make a reasonable long term investment.

Buying now is a play on the squeeze, pure & simple. Even though we all like the stock & are in it for the long haul - really we're all going to try selling at the peak (most of us will miss it) & some of us might buy back in later. 

That's fine for us apes with our own money - but far too reckless for someone to do with someone else's money."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"because on the off chance that actually happens, its most certainly not staying there, it's coming crashing back down to earth at a record breaking speed."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,“You are here by fined 10 shares of BRK.A”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets," Europe's top markets regulator fined Moody's Corp . for breaching rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest with its largest shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc .

The European Securities and Markets Authority said Tuesday that it fined Moody's units in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain €3.7 million, the equivalent of $4.4 million.

ESMA has special rules related to companies that own more than 10% of credit rating firms. The ratings company can't issue new ratings for companies in which such an investor is a board member or a major shareholder. The rules also require certain disclosures on existing ratings of companies in which such investors hold 5%.

Berkshire Hathaway is Moody's largest shareholder, with 13% of its shares, according to FactSet.

Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

""All the breaches were found to have resulted from negligence on the part of Moody's ,"" ESMA said. The regulator said it was crucial for ratings companies to ""eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference by shareholders with the rating process.""

Moody's had ratings on units of Powergrid Holdings, a U.K. power company, and Munich Re , a German reinsurer, in which Berkshire Hathaway owned 10% or more or had a director, ESMA said.

In 2015 Moody's rated a £150 million bond, the equivalent of $206 million, by Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) Ltd., the regulator said. Berkshire Hathaway was represented on the board of the unit and owned more than 10% of the capital or voting rights at the time.

"" Moody's Investors Service is pleased that this matter is closed,"" a Moody's spokesman said. ""We are committed to the integrity and independence of our ratings and to complying with all regulatory requirements.""

The largest part of the fine—€2.7 million—was for Moody's U.K. operations. ESMA said it found 206 instances for 65 rated entities where the U.K. unit didn't provide appropriate disclosure regarding shareholder conflicts of interests. The regulator found 72 such instances at 36 rated entities at Moody's units across France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

Now 40b or 400b that would make waves because it would bankrupt smaller financial firms and their backers. Sends a whole new message to the big dogs. 

Don't burn the system down and we will let you keep being wealthy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To determine accident, in this case, you can look at if their rating was the same as other rating agencies (no bias, so nothing to gain). You can  look whether berkshire capitalized on that rating (did they issue any debt?). You can see if it was a one off issue, or it had a history of happening. Sure you can't prove mistake I guess. But you also can't easily prove malicious intent, which is why they usually resort to a fine. 

I don't see why a % based fine makes a lick of sense. Let's say a random employee at a restaurant forgets to wash his hands and the health inspector notices. If he works for a mom and pop store, the fine is $100  but if he works for McDonald's, the penalty is $1 million? That could be 10 years profit for that location because of one random employee's mistake. How could McDonald's ever stand to compete in this case? Why would a health inspector ever inspect a mom and pop store for pittance violations, when they can make bank harassing conglomerates for when they notice the 16yr old didn't wipe down the counters?

If a big business like Amazon wants to start a one off grocery store, why should the fines in the grocery store segment scale way the heck up because the owner of the grocery store happens to run another successful business (aws) under the same umbrella company? 



If geico ends up committing a massive rule violation unbeknownst to berkshire hathaway, should the fine be 100x bigger simply because berkshire also passively owns other companies as well? Yes, the geico fine will typically be a rounding error on berkshire's balance sheet, but that doesn't mean geico isn't also trying to independently run efficiently and doesn't care about fines. 

The punishment for a regulation violation should be proportional to the crime, not proportional to whether the perpetrator of the crime simply works for a large conglomerate or small business. 

If the rule gets changed to what you are hoping for, it would just lead to lots of ""separate"" legal companies and absurd legal waste. Plus perverse incentives for regulators to completely ignore little guys violations and only go after big guys. Just absurdly inefficient. Plus, if you base it on profits, if amazon has a good year in aws  the grocery store fine would be big, if aws has a losing year, the grocery store fine is really small? How does that make literally any sense because some employee forgot to clean the bathroom, or the  grocery store forgot to submit compliance paperwork to osha?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either way 4b is a huge number for most. Yes the top companies could probably shake it off but most mid sized wouldn't be able too. 40b is a ridiculous figure that most companies would never be able to pay.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Absurdly inefficient"" when have these fines done anything to  clean up negligent companies. It's not even a slap on the wrist.

A cop pulls over a mom and pop shop owner and gives them a $170 ticket. They pay it and regret the fact that they lost a days profits. Same cop pulls over bezos he puts the ticket on some assistants desk and tells them to handle it.

Again flat monetary fines are rules for poor people. They literally do not effect the wealthy. If we want to see changes in the system there need to be changes for the punishments. Whether its through % based fines or sanctions people in power need actual punishments for fucking up. 

As for regulating bodies neglecting smaller companies and focusing on the bigger ones. That's not such a bad thing. Big companies should be under more scrutiny. They have more power, they should be more responsible. Maybe we won't have another 08. With the extra funding the regulators can have more staff and keep all companies, regardless of size under tighter scrutiny."

Do you honestly think it makes sense to charge mcdonalds 1m for a random employee not washing their hands, but charge 100 to a mom and pop store?

Do you think it makes sense to charge geico 100x the fine it normally would get, because berkshire owns a bunch of unrelated companies? Is this fair to geico in relation to its competitors who may commit similar rule violations? 

Do you think it makes sense to charge Amazon grocery store fines more or less depending on aws profits for the year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know. Thankfully, I’m not in Georgia anymore and made a long term career decision.  

At 7 an hour my rent was 410 a month, my cheap Internet was 25 a month, electric 45, I didn’t Own a car and took the bus to work for 80 month, and water 25 month. 

My take home pay every 2 weeks was 450 ish. 

Thankfully I was smart enough not to try to start a family or risk it at that wage.  I knew I’d set myself up fail.    

I don’t miss those days at all."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who really is paid that, though?  At my place of business you can have felonies and come out of high school and have a 1.5 GPA or less, it doesn't even really matter and be hired and trained and simply show up and you'll start at almost double Min wage.  Like, if your shit is really fuckd they may be obliged to low ball you but if you are a good human being but simply not educated you can do fine and make a living."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude I live cheap as shit and 14k a year is still pitifully low. I don't know what rent is in Georgia but I have to imagine 300-500 in rent minimum.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, living in a shack is affordable for the mimum wage worker. Problem is most things aren't price-adjusted to their income. A modern smartphone is still expensive, a reliable car even more so. Helst are is a pipedream, same for childcare or education. No way to get put of their situation unless they get lucky and inherit a large sum so they can get an education or start a successful business.



Aka the odds are stacked against them, as intended."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep! It’s about throwing the fucking book at them and telling them that if they keep this shit there will be more billion dollar fines. You’re right that the big banks could shove off 4bn, but can they do it every other year? Probably not.

And if they’re stupid or greedy enough to keep this shit up and they bankrupt themselves, well, they weren’t very good bankers were they?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Circling back to your McDonald's example let's say the fine is 1% that means mom and pop are making 10k... Hopefully it's part time. Whereas that 1 single McDonald's shop is making 100million. 

You're really saying charging 100/10k and 100/100m are the same punishment?

If I'm working the books for that McDonald's I'm going to recommend they not worry about alot of these little rules that just amount to monetary punishments. Don't waste time with health training. Bring sick employees in. You'll recoup that 100 bucks in no time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't answer your question because you jumped all over the place with McDonald's, geico and grocery stores. This is a sub for retards. Keep it slow. 

To answer broad spectrum though, yes. With adjustments.


A huge problem with modern society is people not paying thier fair share. It's seen as a badge of honor to skirt tax loopholes while maximizing profits.

Amazon could take a hit on all transactions for a month and still squeeze out those grocery stores. The same fine does not have the same effect.

Do you really think it makes sense to fine McDonald's the same amount as a mom and pop shop? It's going to effect the mom and pop shop way more than micky ds.

Hypothetically A makes 140k and B makes 14k. They commit the same crime. Thier victims are effected the same way. They are ordered to pay 1k. B is fucked while A is annoyed. If they were both ordered to pay 5% of thier previous years salary they would be equally affected.

Edit for your exact McDonald's example you would charge that store based on thier last year the same way you would charge a mom and pop store. So if that 1m was proportionally to 100 bucks... yeah... yes I would. Otherwise that McDonald's is gonna wipe every employees ass with that 100 dollar fine and it's a waste of time enforcing it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know but it's not like the law makers care about that shit anyway
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oh man. and here i am in a town where 500 bucks a month rent would mean that you have 3 roommates all paying an even share

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I..... Can't disagree with that.  Good points. 


I'd just rather burn one down quick and then point at its corpse while asking who's next. 


I might be impatient."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying both the individual mcdonalds location and the mom and pop are making roughly the same profits. You were advocating for the fine to be proportional to the corporate entity's profits, as opposed to the fine being proportional to the crime committed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's complete insanity. So if berkshire decides to expand into a new industry and tries to open up one restaurant, if an employee forgets to wash his hands, the restaurant loses 60 years of profits? Yes berkshire can afford it, but that segment of the business can't. They'd literally never try to open up the store in the first place, as the cost benefit makes literally 0 sense. Eventually a 16 yr old would forget to wash their hands. I'm dumbfounded anyone would think that's fair and rational approach to business law."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they don't give a shit about fuck. 

If only we could force them to live at minimum wage. But that has its own issues."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Smoothe brain problems, are you saying that your 3 bedroom rent is 1500?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah that’s basically the same thing... but they’ve been at this so long and may have so much wealth stored up they’ll call it, so we may have to burn 2-3"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Multiple times I said it would be based on the physical location. Monetary fines proportional to the crime are a fallacy. If we make different amounts they are not proportional. They do not effect us equally. That has been my argument from the start.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First if we keep Berkshire and amazon from expanding into other markets and forcing out other businesses that's not a bad thing. Just because they have capital doesn't mean they should freely expand into other businesses and force out smaller companies. The rich get richer? That's you standard for fair?

Second a restaurant wouldn't be getting fined based on its parent companies profits. Retail type outlets (physical stores, restaurants ect) would be fined based on the money that physical location made. 

You really think the current method works?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that it's 2k"

""The summer of red ink"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry if I misunderstood. It's a very common belief that it should be percent of profits, and almost everyone here is arguing they should have been fined more when nobody knows how much the European corporate bond rating division makes. The implication of all these arguments is percent of profits. Some people in the thread even flatly specified 10x moodys profits."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"
>Second a restaurant wouldn't be getting fined based on its parent companies profits. Retail type outlets (physical stores, restaurants ect) would be fined based on the money that physical location made. 

But that's literally exactly what you're advocating for. You want a percent of profit fine for all of moodys, when it was only the moodys European corporate bond rating part of the business that had a regulatory error. The fine is small because moodys European corporate bond rating part of the business is small."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh jeeze 3 roommates. 

Yeah I lived like that a few years back. That's why I went with 300-500 college rent was 300x6 rooms after was 500x4.

Now I have a 4 bedroom house on an acre and my mortgage is 1k. I don't miss the city at all. Still obviously couldn't imagine living on 14k a year"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you misunderstood it just means I did a poor job explaining it. 

I said rounding error but thats hyperbole. If it was % based and they paid less I'd also have no issue with it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would hardly call Moodys retail but nowhere did I advocate for it to be a percent of thier entire profit. I merely said a percentage of thier earnings. It would be a more standard model that would effect everyone equally and encourage better practices. I also advocated for sanctions as an alternative. 

Hypothetically I speed because 170 bucks isn't really a big deal to me. For a minimum wage employee that's like 1% or thier yearly earnings. If I had to pay thousands for a speeding ticket I'd probably drive pretty fucking slow. Instead the government has convinced me to slow down with a sanction. If I get another ticket I'll be ubering for a year. That keeps me in check until October when the record gets wiped clean. I'll be good for awhile but I'll slip up and start speeding. If the fine was % of my earnings and I had to pay thousands it would be more effective. 

Flat monetary fines are literally the lest corrective rules."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, i'm not personally in that situation right now. but i have a friend who is. rent is nuts. i'm glad i got into the market when it was down. its crazy. **median** house price is currently 975k with an average price up around 1.22M.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"
>I would hardly call Moodys retail but nowhere did I advocate for it to be a percent of thier entire profit. I merely said a percentage of thier earnings. 

Well you specifically said % based and a rounding error on their balance sheet, and what I thought you said is a very common belief. You also have literally no idea what profits the European corporate bond rating component of the business makes, and they don't publish their balance sheet, so how do you know if 4m was a rounding error for that segment of the business or not?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. That rent actually seems pretty reasonable. City by me has 250k houses renting out 4 rooms for 2-2.5k total for all 4 rooms.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Advocating for a change to systems vs one specific example. Obviously some firms could end up pay less others more. There would be rules on when a parent company is liable and factored into the equation. (McDonald's example they wouldn't be able to sperate thier ice cream business from the burger business).

FYI this isnt a new idea. You can look into it. The idea of flat fees is inherently unjust."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"250k houses! what a dream. its totally tempting to move to a city with rock bottom pricing like that.

i mean to be fair youre not paying 2k for a house, thats for the basement suite. but you're usually allowed to use the back yard a bit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I mean they're old houses not much to look at but where I'm talking about is where every young person in like a 2 hr radius likes to live or party so there's that. Bar on every corner and such. Right across one of the great lakes from you guys.

I went a little farther south, 245k for a 2400sqft. with an acre and a extra building thats 600 sqft

Cool concept if they can nail it. Small aircraft, controlled via AI, powered via solar panels, can take human passangers around regional airports very quickly. Goods could even be placed on empty flights used to reallocate planes across airports. Something likely unprofitable unless optimized out the ASS which is cool to see Palantir being the ones to make the purchase.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,!RemindMe 72 hours
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not buy back shares or acquire a smaller player in the gov space or something to that affect.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can. Been there, done that. Shredded the T-Shirt."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re buying a pipe dream. That’s just dumb.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its almost as if its a bad investment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the dd that sold me no eternal suffering for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. Thanks. I had to look it up and now I'm doomed for eternity. Palantard in?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, but Palantir is not a fund and it's too small and niche to behave as a holding company or conglomerate. This is really bad news."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you telling me that you have actually researched PLTR's business structure and the quality of the software it is offering and had bullish opinion, but decided that because the company acquired a minority stake in some startup, you are gonna pull out? I actually like the fact that they have proactive approach, PLTR is cash rich, I do not want the company to have 1 billion dollars just sitting in a bank. Also have in mind that Thiel is considered to be one of the best investors in history and is nicknamed King Midas by his colleagues."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long too and was doing some options on the side, but this news and the article below are making me stay away from it:

https://investorplace.com/2021/03/pltr-stock-suffers-from-no-competitive-advantage/

It looks like Cathie can't articulate Palantir's value prop, and SPLK is now investing more on R&D than PLTR is. And now we know where the money is going."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean you don’t need to own palantir, just own it through ARKK. That way if it goes tits up the exposure isn’t that bad"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s a ton if hype on AI right now, and 90% of it isn’t justified at all. So I’m very skeptical, although I would love to see something that would change my mind.

I would love to know what you’re referring to when you speak of her ‘nutty bullshit’?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"... touche. 

Well played.

If someone had just said "" hey rookie, here's some info. No biggie. Good question. Etc"" wouldn't be half the issues these users have.  Its their fearful attacks that mark them out as a problem and get defensive responses."

Its not my fault you have experience in portland. God that must suck."

Time for you to leave. Muwahahah"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... you technically did lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So... a merge?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, drones are struggling to get packages from A to B and you expect a company like lilium to make profits by 2024... give me a break. Their current model could barely take off the ground for 40 seconds with no load whatsoever"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh that's good. TY
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My bad, I thought this was r/investing for some reason. You are correct. This is in fact a casino."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea...Amazon was a real bust.

You prolly would have sold AMZN at $80."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It might happen, but if it does it's so far out.  Flying cars and jetpacks should happen first, and the best we have to show for it are shoes that kinda tie themselves."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 20 years
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,those who had shares were allowed to survive
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Share buyback is the move here. Way too many shares.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea, they obviously find some form of value in this startup, but we can only speculate in what aspect this value lies. I wish PLTR was more transparent."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you get into a lot of ""accidents"" in the near future, you may want to adjust your position."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not pull out, reduce the size of the position. Palantir is a long term investment which is currently burning cash at a fantastic rate. I would prefer it if they keep lots of cash on hand until such time as they are profitable because if they end up needing to raise more money in the future they will have to do so by diluting their existing shares.

 This investment seems unnecessarily risky since they don’t actually turn a profit  yet. I could understand making investments in companies that have some connection to their core business (like say a company that had invented a better database or something) but I am not impressed with them acting like a venture capital company buying in on someone’s private placement right before they go public with a SPAC."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Investor place is basically motley fool a.k.a. useless
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This article is complete and utter bullshit. PLTR has no competitive advantage over its competitors? Palantir software is so unique that the company basically does not have any real competitors. On some occasions , U.S government agencies gave the contracts to PLTR without following normal procedure( allowing differ.companies to submit offers) , cuz they stated that no other company meets their criteria( no one except PLTR can do what they want). Furthermore, BP said that PLTR's software allowed the company to cut its expenses by 50 percent and Airbus said that since using PLTR they were able to cut its production costs by 30 percent.Do you really think that their product is not valuable, take into account the fact that both companies are paying PLTR more than 100 million dollars per year combined? Pls, do not read InvestorPlace or MotleyFool."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://investorplace.com/author/larryramerdos/

Look at this man, I can't take a word he says seriously."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you od'ing on coke right now bro? 

Good question? It wasn't a good question. I'm not even sure what ""it"" was. Verbal Diarrhea. It's something alpha zero would say if you trained it to speak from reading wsb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR was a meme on this forum way before GME. Get the fuck out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"got 72 @ 26usd avg this is the pit of the dip, can only go up, tho its not a get rich quick stock so i advice against call options on this one. but soon its gonna pop have faith"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Brosephus...

I did preface the post with “a bit out there.”

I’m not suggesting this is gonna happen in 2021.

Also VTOL aircraft aren’t drones.

I am saying Fully Autonomous VTOL aircraft are more realistic than Fully Autonomous cars."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if the average driver was expected to fly a helicopter. Flying cars will never exist or be used the way regular cars are now because most people are incapable or unwilling to put in the time and effort to safely fly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoes that tie themselves... I see what you did there. We Palantards need this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not gonna happen. PLTR holder for life 😎
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was a great comment earlier talking about how this can reduce the amount of supply variables that one of its major contracts, Airbus, has to go through. Theil wouldn't spend that much money without a guaranteed ROI, plus potential to gain market share/efficiency with other similar companies if they commit to PLTR software (vertical integration)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have your reasons for it and that's OK. I was a firm believer not long ago and at some point had 1000 shares and options. I happen to know how the sausage is made and can tell you that their software is not magical. They have a charismatic CEO and great deals with customers and customer success stories to tell. I was betting on them to continue rising, but they didn't recover from ER and the lockup expiration, and seeing them squander their attention on other things is not a good sign for me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't care about the guy nor the publication, the details in the article are verifiable. Actually, Cathie stresses that this is a long term play and doesn't care about profitability now. This is not a good sign for those looking for better returns now. If PLTR remains a good investment, it's probably not for wsb tards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I might have lost the thread. But, this whole thing started with me asking about the company in OPs post. 


My problem could be, I've never done coke. 😂


Basically an ass hole responded to my question like a tasteless ass hole will. It was just a few questions. But, how dare i question something was kinda the gist. 
Since you joined in, I replied to you. Because your first reply was on point and well said."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your mom called . . . She wants her jokes back. Time for you to go home and let the adults play.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,9/11 on daily basis lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It would have to be 100% automated.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not that I'm denouncing or saying you're wrong. I just wonder what was the public sentiment when internal combustion became all the rage. Were people saying the public would just crash them into buildings willy nilly?
We still get crashes today. So what allowed us to get this far, and what's preventing us from going further?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Enter palantir backed lilium.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone in this sub once described Technical Analysis as horoscopes for men and it's all I can think about whenever I see a chart.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I finally see it and it makes sense. There is no rocketship! We are taking the handicap ramp to the moon! Seems more fitting.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Updated [graph w/ channel](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) as of 2:48pm**

It’s been testing the support since noon so don’t be surprised if shorts are fired and the price dips. It’s all part of the game.

**Update 12:58pm:** It’s broken the support twice since posting, but quickly re-entered the channel both times. CCI(20) dipped to -200 and quickly topped 230; volatility is picking up from the past hour, with volume up from noon as well. Usually GME has stalled out on low volume past 11am-noon so this is a good sign. Hoping to close around $190, last time we closed above $190 was 3/18.

**Update 1:12pm:** Volume has picked up and the [price has spiked](https://imgur.com/a/Qbob22C) to $195. A breakout point in the channel would be around $197-$199 in the next 10 minutes.

**Update 1:45pm:** With the support being tested multiple times and the quick shoot upward at 1:10, it was beginning to look like the trend within channel had been broken. However, it seems as if the support is still holding as it dips right now. Expecting a reversal and upward trend in the next 10-20 mins because of the very negative CCI. If we reach $200 today I expect a lot of shorts to be fired, possibly even closing red. Hold on folks.

**Update 2:07pm:** Seems like my hunch about a reversal was right. Closing in on 200! Let’s see what happens. Right now 200 is within the channel, but I could see the channel quickly becoming irrelevant if we break this milestone. After all the channel is just a rough estimate of where to expect the peaks and dips.

**Update 2:32pm:** We brushed $200.16 at 2:29, though I am surprised to see the lack of a major dip. It may be too early to say. A wild guess of mine is that with the recent liquidation of HFs and today’s good news, shorts may just be running out of bullets, considering today’s steady growth and lack of major dips. But who can say for sure. Definitely a significant day for GME.

**Update 2:44pm:** Now comfortably sitting at 200+. Volume will likely pickup and I don’t see the channel holding for much longer with the added volatility. Remember, we can’t save our friends in the 200s if you paperhand now. Patience!

**Update 2:47pm:** Currently [testing the resistance](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) for the first time today along the 200s.

**Update 2:57pm:** Looks like we’re staying in the channel still. Current descent doesn’t look too significant, wouldn’t worry about a large dip unless we fall below $195, a couple dollars below the support right now.

**Update 3:12pm:** Quick dip below support. Seems to be rebounding with $195 being a new floor of sorts (2:10-2:20 shows this). Market data showed a lot of buying pressure at $196. Whether this holds the rest of today or not, only time will tell. I wouldn’t dismiss the possibility of shorts being fired before close.

**Update 3:18pm:** Buy the dip and hold on! Wee!

**Update 3:29:** Last update before any remarks at close. This current dip seems to have little momentum, with $195 being a loose support. Expecting some upward pressure right before close if we stay stagnant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ready to buy more if it goes down. Quitting isn't in my vocabulary

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean what it's doing now? Sweet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The 30 min chart says it’s gonna break —-but which way?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t wait for this shit to hit $500K so I can become a gazillionair
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME?
Never heard of it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is great for looking at what happened and pretty bad at telling you what is going to happen next.  You can take any stock and find any particular shape in its price history.  Sometimes it moons, sometimes it tanks, and sometimes it flatlines.  

I code bots as a hobby; future prices are absolutely not baked into the shapes of old prices.  Or I suck at my hobby.  Both are probably true."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lines on a stock's hourly price history tell you literally zero about its future.  
  
But thanks for the confirmation bias I needed...buying more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You forgot that Jupiter is entering telophase and the galactic spheres will be under high tension. That, and its an odd-numbered month in an odd numbered year. Duh."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How do I read these tea leaves?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME follows nobody’s rules.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You jinxed it, gah!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch it break out after hours when I can do nothing about it 🙄
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Behave, she'll go when she's ready."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is horsesh.. wait, this is bullish about GME? yes of course I agree"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"holy shit bro, this is sick, did you go to like MIT and get a PHD to post this fucking dumbass bullshit?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is lit. Thanks for updates
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude just shut the fuck up about GME. Literally hundreds of new posts about it DAILY. There is nothing new here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I need to understand this to like the stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sorry, support is top of the channel and resistance is the bottom?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it's holding $197 let's go
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it broke out for a little bit, then got sucked back in"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro after 2pm mtn time it breaks out..... yes after hours.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seriously that was some STRONG growth today! Very bullish!! 💎🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had my wifes boyfriend check this pimple on my sphincter. 

He said it is technically anal cists."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just about lmao. I’m not trying to make any wild predictions off indicators though, the support line is pretty clearly there with the dips getting higher and higher at a semi-consistent rate over time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a self fulfilling prophecy at this point. Take RSI for example. No serious trader would enter into a position when a stock is over 70 RSI because that’s a sign it’s over bought. Well once enough people know that they’ll cut and wait for the dip. Well now people are selling because of the indicator so the indicator works.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It is. Especially for GME as its more options driven and the volume is in bursts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I always think of it as reading tea leaves. You see in it what you want to see and that can be dangerous. At the same time it can help you focus and think deeply about the status of things.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so when do i get my own crystals?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> horoscopes for men

Nah because at least with horoscopes the constellations actually exist. It's more like dowsing, where the person who is walking the field decides where the rods point.

Like horoscopes and dowsing it's all completely bunk of course - a glance at L2 will tell you more about what's coming than any technical analysis ever would."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it makes its own reality because people (and I expect machines) are trading with it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"its just dumbass bullshit people on twitter post about to seem smart. It's like Kanye West...he tries to sound smart and to idiots he does, but most people know what he's saying makes no fucking sense."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mostly right. A lot of DD I see using multiple indicators on this strange stock seems to be borderline conspiracy. However, I had marked the channel since 11:45 and it’s held within for the most part, so it seems to be a good guideline of where to expect the dips to bottom out. I would also check my reply below where it seems that GME held within the same channel the last 90 minutes of yesterday."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What're we looking for? Im a dumb ape so pls explain simply
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"WITNESS HIM, BLOODBAG!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not that serious lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its gme, anything's possible.  But a fat short sell might trigger stop losses and therefore a small sell down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you really want to see if you can buy at $170, I would bet we see a large dip today if GME tests $200. Otherwise I would buy now because this is the most consistent growth we’ve had in a few days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do it now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not doubting you or your knowledge but every time ppl try to guess what is to come, the stock takes a deep dive or it climbs up really fast. It doesn’t have any patterns and its artificially inflated but we both agree its gonna go up"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If its left alone, it looks like you’re right but I’m expecting a dip at any moment now"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i see. So, these are actually not some random bullshit lines, but there's actual thinking behind them. I see.... i'm learning. In the next few years i may earn a new wrinkle on my brain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you!  I'm sorry I dont do a ton of candle analysis, I see patterns and I watch rsi and macd and vwap mostly."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re trying to suggest I did that, that’s pretty easily disprovable"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Admittedly TA started by studying patterns and probability. It‘a similar to black jack. Would you hit on a 16 knowing there’s a 30% chance you’ll get a 10? Would you buy into a stock when it’s showing signs of being overbought?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TIL TA supporters have the same mindset as orks from 40k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't tell if meme but in fair testing scenarios it has never once been shown to work. Not unlike technical analysis - it's probably not the lines on the graph but the other information you know that may make you a successful investor despite also doing technical analysis.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,xoxo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We did BETTER than expected.... WE don’t know WHY... oh yea HODL!!!! If some HF stop loss execute make sure you BUY THE DIP!! We are coming for 3-400$ brother 🦧🚀🚀 😃 better?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, any sort of dip my man!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are. So stop telling people that the price is hitting $10k when you don’t actually know what you are talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In your mind serious enough to waste significant time on it. You seem bright, use it for good instead of interpreting lines in my palm.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly doubt we won't see 170 again before it really pops.
I'm in no hurry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same as well. We’ve seen plenty of green days turn red in the last hour with GME. I’m by no means predicting GME to stay in the channel the rest of the day, mostly felt like posting because the support line is pretty clearly there with consistent growth, and most days GME does not act this predictable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*It is* some random bullshit lines. There is no reason to think a previous trend will keep going.

It’s actually hitting 50k

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banks, institutions. 

Remember, 92.5 percent of gme shares are owned by banks, institutions and hedge funds.  This whole thing going on is them making money off each other.

Retail is 7.5 percent, I'm just along for the ride.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not so sure. Why would they spend however many millions to dump it down to 120 again knowing full well it would bounce back to 180 the same day
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Bat ears.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How so? Give us an example retard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking retarded...🙏🏼🤘🏼
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technical analysis means nothing for GME, because institutional investors can do w/e they want and break all resistance on a whim. TA works best for natural securities that have grown organically and actually has support and resistance that isn't artificially created by a few large holders, not for a short squeezed stock like GME. It's a ticking time bomb. 

The sell wall is also massive for GME atm, not to mention the ridiculously disproportionate puts to calls ratio this week. The banks are really trying to milk the retail investors with options. Never letting it get too high, and not drop too low so they can thetagang to collect premiums. Just buy shares and hold."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was joking lol

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the deal here? Since all the posts began about UWMC the price has only declined.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully we pull this up soon. I yolo'd 9k in 12.5 calls for April 16th.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on uwmc, but what is the outlook here"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,3800 shares of UWMC here...stock is so cheap and undervalued I'm thinking I might as well round up my holdings to 5k shares.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dip has been bought. I don't know if the Mortgage Department where I work goes through them, but if the market is busy like it is here then I am confident."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubled down (well 50%ed down) the other day at $7.80. Sold some May $7.50 puts for $0.90 today though.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What catalysts in the next few months do you think will trigger more attention and demand to rise this price?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well; I was ready to sell for a considerable loss, but I guess I'll buy more in anticipation for earnings. Living the ape life."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't believe it's selling for literally what it would be worth if you sold the assets and gave the money to shareholders.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought I was the only one buying the dip lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really don't understand why UWMC is dipping. Solid company, has good earnings and nice divvys."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was declining before all the posts anyways, the hype just forced a small spike, now it's continuing its downward trend"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dividend and a little reddit hype.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock is a steal at this level...I was pissed at first it didn't moon and make me 10k in a few days like my other meme stocks...but then I realized this is easy money even if it trades sideways for months.  Dividends, covered call premiums...yes please."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"im praying with you brother

those calls are down by how much?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dang it went that high?  I initially bought around 12 but I've already averaged down below 9.  Addicted to the covered call premiums and dividend....3800 shares and counting.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"May 5 Earnings, Congress (15,000 first time home buyers credit), Developments at HUD, and a few other things that I discussed in my prior DD.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here! I’m all in for this dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could I get a quick breakdown for this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me be clear. I got in at the low 8's and am averaging down. It's 7.83. It's all about your entry point my man. I see juicy returns as this is severely undervalued.

As for Eviction and Foreclosure moratoriums. We're not really seeing that right now, especially with stimulus. However, if it DID happen... That means more housing inventory in a market that has a severe undersupply of housing inventory.... As grim as it sounds, it may actually be beneficial."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have any additional information to elaborate that statement?

I’ve only heard people talk great things about their personal experience with them. 

Seems to have good profits. 

Do you just hate mortgage companies?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy didn't even read UWMC's financial statements. [They listed the amount that is already borrowed ($6.9B) under the lines of credit (the total available lines of credit totals $12.625B) as a part of their liabilities](https://ibb.co/g7S0qnw). OP is literally twisting the financial statements from UWMC to suit his own investment interests.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term I could see it returning to 9-10 eventually once the dump phase of the PnD runs it's course. Trouble is, there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now and there's a significant risk of pullback of the entire market to raise liquidity to cover losses in other sectors (just look at viacom). That makes looking at historical support levels (like 9-10 for uwmc) ... risky. Past price is not an indicator of future price etc. etc.

Combine this with opportunity cost (e.g. ignoring meme stocks, things like Viacom, discovery, apple seem to be trading at local minima), I wouldn't take this bet - but I do understand your argument. Good luck!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think any form of ultimatium is good for any business, hence I don't like UWM. And it's not going very well so I'm not alone thinking that :)"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and I will. I still have faith in the stock and especially the company.

""Derivatives
Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company enters into derivative instruments to reduce its risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company accounts for derivative instruments as free-standing derivative instruments and does not designate any for hedge accounting. Interest rate lock commitments (or “IRLCs”) on mortgage loans to be originated or purchased which are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as part of loan production income. Fair value is estimated primarily based on relative changes in interest rates for the underlying mortgages to be originated or purchased. Fair value estimates also take into account the probability that loan commitments may not be exercised by customers. The Company uses forward mortgage backed security contracts, which are known as forward loan sale commitments (or “FLSCs”), to economically hedge the IRLCs. Refer to Note 3 – Derivatives for further details.""

""Mortgage Loans at Fair Value and Revenue Recognition

Mortgage loans are recorded at estimated fair value. Fair value of mortgage loans is estimated using observable market information including pricing from current cash commitments from government sponsored enterprises, recent market commitment prices, or broker quotes, as if the loans were to be sold currently into the secondary market.

A majority of the revenues from mortgage loan originations are recognized when the loan is originated which is the primary revenue recognition event as the loans are recorded at fair value upon origination. Loan origination fees are recognized as income at the time the loans are originated. Interest income is accrued at the contractual rate, unless collectability is uncertain. Loan production income also includes the unrealized gains and losses associated with the changes in the fair value of mortgage loans at fair value, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative assets and liabilities and the capitalization of MSRs.
Loans are considered to be sold when the Company surrenders control over the financial assets. Control is considered to have been surrendered when the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; the purchaser obtains the right, free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right, to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement that entitles or obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity. The Company typically considers the above criteria to have been met when transferring title to another party where no substantive repurchase rights or obligations exist.""

""Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition - Sale of MSRs
MSRs are initially recorded at estimated fair value. To determine the fair value of the servicing right created, the Company uses third party estimates of fair value at the time of initial recognition. Subsequent fair value (measured for subsequent impairment purposes) is estimated with the assistance of an third party broker based upon a valuation model that calculates the estimated present value of future cash flows. The valuation model incorporates market estimates of the estimated market prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, float value, ancillary income, inflation, and delinquency and default rates.
 
MSRs are amortized in proportion to the estimated future net servicing revenue. MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment. For this purpose, the Company stratifies its MSRs based on interest rate. Changes in the estimates used to value MSRs could materially change the estimated fair value and any valuation allowances required. Management records a valuation allowance when the fair value of the mortgage servicing asset strata is less than its amortized book value. Valuation allowances are recorded as a temporary impairment to the affected strata effectively reducing recorded MSRs and incurring a charge to operations. Valuation recoveries are recorded in subsequent periods. When a mortgage prepays, the Company permanently reduces the associated MSR in the period of prepayment with a charge to operations.
Sales of MSRs are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a buyer, and a substantive non-refundable down payment is received. Also, any risks retained by the Company must be reasonably quantifiable to be eligible for sale accounting.""

""Premises and equipment, net
Premises and equipment is recorded at cost and depreciated or amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets. The following is a summary of premises and equipment, net at...""

First, you absolute moron: Holding Mortgage Servicing Rights are a hedge against higher inflation, because prepayments are lowered, and thus the value of them is heightened.

Second, you absolute moron: ""The Company enters into derivative instruments to reduce its risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.""

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And why are you accusing me of wrong counting? This is literally the finance guys at UWMC telling you that their liabilities are totaling over $9B.

$6.9B is the total amount already borrowed from the lines of credit (which total $12.625B). you can see that under the [warehouse lines of credit section in the 8-K/A](https://ibb.co/g7S0qnw). Tell me, did you even read UWMC's financial statements before investing in the company?

You are literally twisting UWMC's financial statements and spreading misinformation to suit your own interests. That's deplorable.

Therefore, warehouse funding allows the loan originators to provide mortgages at more competitive rates.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse_line_of_credit#cite_note-2) Unlike in other types of lending, loan originators earn more profit from origination fees rather than interest rate spread since the closed mortgage loan is sold quickly to an investor. ""

There is a **reason** that when Rocket had its Line of Credit increased, it was seen as a **good** thing. It was widely seen  as a sign of heavy loan volume, and that they needed more money in their credit facility line to originate even **more** loans to take market share, as well as get more revenues (and therefore net income).

[Revolving Debt - A Line of Credit with No Repayment Schedule (corporatefinanceinstitute.com)](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/knowledge/finance/revolving-debt/) \-  A revolving debt (a “revolver,” also sometimes known as a line of credit, or LOC) does not feature fixed monthly payments. It differs from a fixed payment or term loan that has a guaranteed balance and payment structure. Instead, the payments of revolving debt are based on the balance of credit every month. Interest payments are calculated likewise; payments are based on the interest rate and balance and are often computed daily.

Why don't you read this:

""In addition to warehouse facilities, we are an approved lender for loan early funding facilities with Fannie Mae through its As Soon As Pooled Plus (“ASAP+”) program and Freddie Mac through its Early Funding (“EF”) program. As an approved lender for these early funding programs, we enter into an agreement to deliver closed and funded one-to-four family residential mortgage loans, each secured by related mortgages and deeds of trust, and receive funding in exchange for such mortgage loans in some cases before the lender has grouped them into pools to be securitized by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. All such mortgage loans must adhere to a set of eligibility criteria to be acceptable. As of December 31, 2020, the amount outstanding through the ASAP+ program was approximately $75.9 million and no amounts were outstanding under the EF program. In addition to the arrangements with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, we are also party to one early funding (or “gestation”) lines with a financial institution. Through this arrangement, we enter into agreements to deliver certified pools consisting of mortgage loans securitized by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and/or Freddie Mac, as applicable, for the gestation line. As with the ASAP+ and EF programs, all mortgage loans under this gestation line must adhere to a set of eligibility criteria.

The gestation line has a transaction limit of $150.0 million, and it is an evergreen agreement with no stated termination or expiration date that can be terminated by either party upon written notice. As of December 31, 2020, no amount was outstanding under this line.As of December 31, 2020, the Company had pledged mortgage loans at fair value as collateral under the above warehouse lines of credit. The above agreements also contain covenants which include certain financial requirements, including maintenance of minimum tangible net worth, minimum liquidity, maximum debt to net worth ratio, net income, and limitations on additional debt, as defined in the agreements. The Company was in compliance with all debt covenants as of December 31, 2020.""

There is a reason I gave you the  UWMC Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, which you can find on Edgar, and that is because you needed to be spoon fed information. However, clearly you cannot read, so i have gone through the trouble of compiling yet more resources for you. '

I am not twisting financial data, or spreading misinformation. You are just simple.

Let me reiterate:  [Warehouse Lending Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warehouse_lending.asp) \->  Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its [origination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination.asp) to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.

Just stop, i'm not going to keep responding to you. You don't know what you're talking about, and what's more, you don't understand the industry you're speaking about.

Edit:  Honestly. It's just even dumber that you think that the line of credit to originate the loan on the mortgage isn't collateralized by the, you know, house before it's sold off on the secondary."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That one
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Best bet is to ignore the rkt fanboys. It's crazy how much time they spend bashing other stocks. Good luck on the investments.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,None of this shows that it isn't a liability. A line of credit is a liability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean this one?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A balance sheet is a snapshot on the exact day. In this case December 31st. However, these facilities are used ultra short term (a few days). Furthermore, their collateralized and sent off or sold directly on the secondary market. 

Much like a bond. You add to the assets and liability sheet on the -balance- sheet. However, it's net neutral. The interest is where you lose money. Here, it's actually not the same, except as stated it's  a credit for the ultra short term (a few days). 

I would really recommend reading this:  [Warehouse Lending Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warehouse_lending.asp) . It explains it in a clear and understandable manner.  I would really recommend reading it all, but this portion is a relevant portion:

Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its [origination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination.asp) to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.

The repayment of warehouse lines of credit is ensured by lenders through charges on each transaction, in addition to charges when loan originators post collateral.

As well as this:

Warehouse lending can most simply be understood as a means for a bank or similar institution to provide funds to a borrower without using its capital. A small or medium-sized bank might prefer to use warehouse lending and to make money from origination fees and the sale of the loan rather than earn interest and fees on a 30-year mortgage loan.

In warehouse lending, a bank handles the application and approval of a loan but obtains the funds for the loan from a warehouse lender. When the bank then sells the mortgage to another creditor in the secondary market, it receives the funds that it then uses to pay back the warehouse lender. The bank profits through this process by earning points and origination fees."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR is a long play.

His options expire in 2 days and Theta is going to eat his lunch.

He wants to sell when the option contract goes up a few pennies but the underlying stock would have to rocket to make up for the loss (in cash) his options gets due to theta decay. 

He's fucked."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't be that down on PLTR.

There is ALWAYS an oppressive regime that needs to hunt down dissenters on Facebook and Twitter.

PLTR is a solid long play.

Those 200 shares will be GOLD.....sometime in 2022 

My issue is not with PLTR long, it's that I have simply don't have enough capital to have this many long plays. 

I want PLTR  LEAPS which are getting cheaper by the day.

While this trades sideways those premiums are dropping.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know how options work?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think webull uses same order flow as robinhood so you will get shittier prices, Fidelity same order flow but only for options I believe ¯\_(ツ)_/¯... You can start by transferring stock and then wait for options to expire maybe, for me it took 2-3 business days and make sure fidelity will cover the fee's.  Not financial advice just my opinion FYI  https://www.fidelity.com/customer-service/transfer-assets"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I only deal wit BUYING CALL N PUTS nun else...which is wat he did here but kept going bacc to buy more of the exact strike price calls to average down..for an option expiring in two days he can get out n avoid theta fuccin him up potentially tmm or even thur
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do people like E*TRADE on here? Over never had any complaints since I transferred to them
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming that the price climbs in the 2 days. Or else he’s looking at a big fat 0
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well so far as the price keeps trading sideways wit exp approaching he will keep loosing money but he can still get out on Thursday wit a maybe 50% loss depending on wat happening tmm
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So 20% more loss. Yikes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it actually could’ve been worse but pltr has been trading sidesways not down so theta is not fuccin him that much rn

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kevin! What have you done to my tendies?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Karen culture can be traced to this scene
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Home Alone 2: The Great Apescapade.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone notice John Candy only approached her after she offered to sell her soul to the devil. It would be neat if John Candy was credited as Lucifer or the ""Prince of Darkness"" at the end of the film."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB still has the best internet memes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you knew this when you made this meme, but in case you don't, there's a fan theory that John Candy is actually Satan in this movie, and that Mrs. McAllister is actually ""selling her soul to the devil himself,"" as she says earlier in the scene. Legend has it that if you go to a crossroads and offer to sell your soul to the devil, he will appear and grant your wish. Mrs. McAllister is at an airport (a crossroads of sorts) and offers to sell her soul to be with her son on Christmas. John Candy shows up, and grants her wish. In true Faustian bargain form, her wish is granted, but her family actually arrives right after she does - she never needed to make the deal at all. Likewise, if you go to an airport, and offer to sell your soul to Satan, he can make GME fly to an incredible price. Unfortunately, you will have a bad deal, as GME was already going to fly to an incredible price anyway."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Brilliant...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So forget the rocket we on a school bus might take a little longer but we gonna get there yay!!!!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you DFV. Thank all of you apes!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Catherine O’Hara is a national treasures and should be treated as such
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay hear me out.    
Home alone cracked $476,684,675 at box office.    
Game stop has 69,940,000 shares outstanding with a float of 45,350,000, so that leaves you with 24,590,000. Now this is where it gets interesting...    
With that box office hit plus the IV that Home Alone went through and unrealized gains, based on the “estimated” gross (not taking into account the hedgies that said it wouldn’t make it) you would plug a simple calculation from here.    

HAGross/((GSSO-GSF)x10)=current share price     
Current share pricex10=new share price goal.    
Therefore the correlation couldn’t be simpler, fair price value is now $1930"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this stock approved by the American Dental Association?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buzz (Ken) your girlfriend (Vlad)... woof!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta be honest, I don't like this one... We're here for the squeeze not to cover our cost basis and make a long term investment..."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this account legit? I'm not believing it and it could give people the wrong impression as in DFV itself is posting stuff.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty good metaphor. Not nearly as nice as the jet would have been but there's way more party on the bus.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just glad it was you that made this mistake and not me. Because I totally didn’t almost do the same thing. Nope.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does he have two different Reddit handle?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My guess is everything will jump so GME doesnt look as successful as it may seem.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my perspective, this sounds like a “this is a long term investment” message, not a “the squeeze is still coming” message."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,at this point i averaged up so much that 40$ would financially ruin me. would still suck dicks behind wendys to buy more and average down again though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't believe some ape just stole DFV's OG memes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, obtaining his level of success would provide him ""third person reference to himself"" privilege... so not inconceivable ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Selflove is important
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s been his entire message all along
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV has always been a value investor that likes the company and the stock. It’s not his role to hype a squeeze, it has never been and it certainly isn’t now that he’s having class action lawsuits brought against him for the January mess. 

There are other investors that are squeeze-oriented and focus on that, you can find plenty of their DD. 

Don’t blame him for keeping up the same line he’s had for more than an year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly right.

He mentions that we are close to the fair price, which is the goal."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">cost basis

IT COMES DOWN TO PATIENCE AT THIS POINT IF DFV CAN HOLD IN MILLIONS OF  LOSS SINCE LAST YEAR I CAN ALSO HOLD TILL THIS SHIT  LANDS ON THE MOON"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dude literally posted his portfolio going from $50 million to $15 million. That’s the biggest loss porn you’ll ever see in his sub.

And then he doubled down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s mentioned in the meme, but you obviously completely misunderstood the context in which it was mentioned."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People under the age of 25 really shouldn't be allowed on the internet. Has a more tear jerking feel good family movie since Home Alone and its sequel ever been made. Don't think so.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh man. So many great movies! Candy died just a few months before I graduated from high school (early '94). Hit me just as hard as Farley's death just a few years later. God the time flies.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,and the bus is slower but accomplishes the same 🤔
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did somebody say R.V?!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"hell yeah, brother. Where do I sign up?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good God, my rent is gonna go through the roof."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good call. In my DD I go into how next week's mayor race is going to swing the city into a better direction.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a smallish city in ne wisconsin, south of Green Bay, north of Milwaukee"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I grew up in Plymouth, can confirm, we also called it Shebaghdad."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lived practically in New Glarus for a bit. 

But man Spotted Cow is horrible... Their limited edition sours and every once in awhile that IPA or APA was on point. But you're better off going to Madison and MKE for good beer."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IM ALREADY IN SHEBOYGAN.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a cheboygan michigan too. Spelled different sounds the same.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oops.  tweet from roaring kitty.  meme from roaring kitty.  lol at me.  note to self:  roaring kitty = roaring kitty.  (and i know DFV is roaring kitty).  im not even hung over or high.  do i need professional help?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was confused as well
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really into fat balls, but I like cats. Is he a cat?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He has 0.004269% of a share. Make sure you drag a wet floor sign behind you down the aisle.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I hope they don't stay trying for long in that case!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not what apes want to hear about now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wanted to highlight this. 

In DFVs original play a short squeeze was (basically) non-existent and he always vouched for the deep value in GME. 

If the SI% which is thrown around and the probably massive FTDs/counterfeit shares theory are correct, it doesn't matter if DFV says anything about a short squeeze. If we get to the ""cost basis"" (aka ~$500) a short squeeze would be inevitable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV's primary objective right now isn't to screenshot himself making nine digit profits, it's dodging the narratives that paint him to be a market manipulating cult leader."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess I’m just a retard right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right on the dotted tramp stamp
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Currently in se Wisco. I try to get to sheboygan a few times a year, as well as door county and boulder junction. We are so lucky with what we have in this state"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appleton, standing by."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeaa buddy! Thats where im at go pack! haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, why do we care about sheboygan?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now if it is a Saturday and we had had a few high lifes, it was Shavegas, if you were cool with bringing home a 3 🤣"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Living here I hear you. Spotted Cow was great, when i was 22, but good god, its a shitty light beer with 'some' flavor"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the fun fact!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is not at all confusing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you look at the account comment history - this is definitely a real DFV account.

edit: though I’m not sure if you were implying the guy above him was trolling or if the account is a fake"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's okay. :\]

You're what the French call 'les incompetents.'"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re in this sub, you need professional help just like the rest of us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He belongs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahah it happens, I didn’t know he had this account until he posted the eminem interview meme on here 🤣"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you just need to sit down, breathe deeply, and sip on some cool DD."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh you sweet summer child
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay I Believe You, but My Tommy Gun Don't"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, sorry. Hang in there."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not a cat, doesn’t say meow. Maybe a cow?

https://youtu.be/mXnJqYwebF8"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha no idea why people downvoted you, just look at his post history this is literally DFV’s second account."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He deserves the nine digit profit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, lemme explain it to you then.

Kevin’s mom represents the apes who are impatient and freaking out that the squeeze hasn’t happened yet. She’s saying that she’ll even sell HER loss porn to get to her destination if she has to. 

John Candy represents DFV, obviously, telling the ape to calm the fuck down...we’ll take a slower form of travel but we’ll get to where we need to be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TO PLUTO
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m down in Chicago currently but yeah I get up when I can (originally from Greenbay area). Lucky to have access to one of the best coast lines in the country IMO.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, its in the movie. 🤣"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking lost it at this lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I will say that the New Glarus brewery itself is beautiful and totally worth visiting maybe once but the beer really is nothing to write home about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are welcome. We also have a lighthouse but it is on lake huron.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sheboygan big town. Cheboygan small town.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shut up Linnie!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us! One of us!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this is the animated cow girl that sings im not a cat... 

Edit: not the version i expected."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cause he used retard in a negative context
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But what I got from this meme is that 'where we need to be' is the stock's fair value... not the moon, not $10k, $1k etc. My feeling is DFV is telling us not to fixate on a possible squeeze (missed flight) but slowly move towards the fair value which he thinks will be more than the current price..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah fuck I'm dumb.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the hard loss dude. I also lost a good amount on RKT/UWM calls. Thats why options game is a tough one... you are fighting against time, and time always wins. You 10x your risk gains/losses when you play with options.

Here is some helpful tips; 

\-If you like the stock long term, buy option LEAPS, and give yourself time for the position 

\-""Short Squeeze"" is not the norm, run ups and excitement are... always do your due diligence on everything, make sure it makes sense

\- If you buy an option that expires within the month, try NOT to hold it for more than a day. Theta will burn you before you make any profits

\-Don't believe everything a retarded ape tells you"

######edit oh there is no volume with DISCB"
2021-03-30 19:39:56,wallstreetbets,"ABCL DD First time post, but wanted to bring more attention to a biotech stock that I personally love.

ABCL is not a biotech company, nor is it a pharma company. They want to be both, they want to make data, make drugs, make new scientific discoveries, they want royalties, partnerships, research. This company has huge plans and is in the right spot financially to make it all happen.

Check out their earnings:

ABCL [(Link to Earnings)](https://investors.abcellera.com/news/news-releases/2021/AbCellera-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Business-Results/default.aspx) TLDR its fucking massive, its a phenomenal report. 800 million on hand with Little debt with the debt at 0% interest. *0. F'ing. Percent.* [(Link to pretty color ppt from earnings call)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/359178033/files/doc_presentation/2021/3/AbCellera-2020-Business-Update-(March-29-2021).pdf)

ABCL has huge potential to become a **massive juggernaut** as a biotech/pharma company.

Their antibody discovery platform allows them to rapidly discover therapeutic targets and push them into preclinical development. This is best demonstrated by the development of Bamlanivimab, where the antibody went from unknown to discovered product to clinical trials in **60 days. 60. days.** Typical drug development takes years on average and they had a covid drug in clinical trials by the summer of 2020 after starting discovery efforts in late winter.

Let me start a new paragraph and reemphasize this shit ***60. F'ing. Days***. Thats the definition of industry disruption, to introduce a new product that drastically improves and decreases development time is huge. I fucking snorted the crayons (orange you tards any other flavor isn't worth the time) out of my nose when I saw this, full disclosure I work in the industry and we can't fucking match this.

And since I know most of you can't read, here's a couple bullet points your partner's girlfriend or boyfriend can read to you tonight:

* ABCL 2020 Annual Revenue was $**233,155,000.**
* ABCL 2021 Q1 Project Revenue from one income stream AKA Bamlamni-60fuckingday-cumfasterthanyourpreeteen-vimab is a minimum of ***190,000,000, more likely over 200mil.***

Their projected 2021 Q1 revenue is essentially their whole entire year in 2020.

Now during the earnings call one investor had a decent slightly stoopid question of what about when COVID is over. Ladies and Gents sit down and shut up. COVID is projected to be endemic for the decade if not forever, it is here to stay. Which means COVID drugs are here to stay and here to generate money. The CEO made sure to point this out, also that ABCL is not a fucking COVID company. They many projects in different fields of therapeutics (oncology, animal health, nerve regeneration, etc) and they acquired a company called Trianni last year. A humanized mouse model company that OTHER companies will use for research and drug development.

&#x200B;

If my retard summaries above weren't enough check out the historical short volume data. If you wanted squeeze potential, ABCL might just have a bunch of lemons so find some fucking sugar, ice cubes, and water. Might just be drinking some lemonade on the porch of your 100 year old dilapidated Southern Style farm house porch  of a home that you bought with 5% interest with a waived inspection and no DIY skills to speak of.

# TLDR

I like the stonk. Not a financial advisor. Just a smooth brained amc holding ape.

ABCL 380 shares and counting avg 34.70."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, sounds good. But im gonna wait like 2 months for the hype to die down and for this to drop down a bit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the DD. I was surprised to see such a positive earnings. Most biotech IPOs have shit financials and highly speculative. I'm looking to buy in after it stabilizes a bit after the report.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Revenue was higher than expected but earnings was much lower.

The risk here is on COVID - where the vast majority of their revenue relates to. It is unclear to me how their revenue will fare once the disease is under control."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re just consultants.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,one thing I didn't mention is they sneakily dropped that they have a new COVID antibody 1404 that is in preclinical development with Eli Lily with a predicted clinical trial start in Q2 and they expect it to work against all variants of COVID. Definitely something to keep an eye out for
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah big part of why I feel pretty bullish even as a “bag holder.” Probably a good idea to see how it performs I like to watch a stock for a while before jumping in, note they IPO'd at $20, so its hard to see it getting below that and it definitely looks like there is a huge fight to keep the price low right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree a current strong reliance on a single source at the moment, but Covid isn’t under control. The industry predicts a strong international COVID presence in the near/mid if not long term future. Short term we can expect a strong revenue stream and for the future there should be more info coming out about other projects already being executed on."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s false, they aren’t consultants and they plan on manufacturing their own therapies in the next few years as soon as they can get facilities built."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Specifically about COVID-19, even though their process isn't about that particular problem:

Isn't the rollout of vaccines destined to moot all other COVID-19-related biotech projects? People aren't getting hospitalized after a vaccine, so it's one-and-done for controlling the biggest problem of the disease: lethality. Not sure if the post-vaccine contagion study results are out yet, but guidelines are already set for vaccinated people being reasonably safe in exclusively vaccinated company.

I just don't see a cash cow in fighting a problem we already seem to have the solution to. Forgive my ignorance."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just read up their site. It screams consultants to me, but wtf do I know."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Covid drugs account for only 2 out of 103 programs that Abcellera has under contract. They are fighting way more problems than just Covid. It just happens that Covid ended up as their first go-to-market, think of it as a proof of concept. 

To put it into perspective: Abcellera spent few months in early 2020 narrowing down the right solution for Covid treatment. In return for this 2-3 months of work,  not only did they get paid for their time but they received $198 mil in royalty revenue. Abcellera will continue to receive more of this recurring revenue for as long as their client (Eli Lilly) sells more of the drug. The potential of this revenue model is huge. Abcellera gets to share in the benefits of a successful drug without taking on massive investment risks that come with new drug development (those are borne by their clients)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While vaccination will reduce hospitalization, it will likely still be necessary to treat patients with Covid. Vaccination is not a cure nor is it a treatment and internationally vaccination rates even in the midterm projection are not going to reach a point where Covid will be “over”. And as the media fear mongers circulating variants, (for good reason) vaccine efficacy could drop.

Basically a treatment will be necessary whether it’s from regeneron or from abcellera, and vaccinated or not the sooner the treatment is administered to a patient the better the outcome."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure you can call them consultants, consultants that bring in leading technologies and data sets. The key differentiator is their revenue model - they get paid for their time AND they get paid for milestones (their client's successful clinical trials) AND they get paid royalties for as long as their clients sell the drug that was developed with Abcelleras help. The last part is huge.  It's a brilliant revenue model, what you're seeing in this ER is just the beginning, based on royalties from one drug only."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd love to hear more of your insight so if you could elaborate more on your previous statement it would be greatly appreciated. I also understand the consultant designation and it has truth to it but I disagree with the negative conations your three word statement gives.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. And If I recall correctly its lifetime revenue of a products lifecycle. So as long as a therapy such as bamlanivimab is sold, ABCL will receive a percentage (25? maybe more?)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Consultants provide a service. The only differentiator would be there attempt to partner with other companies. Coming from a dot com background their whole site is just a bunch of fluffy bullshit from my perspective. 

So they are seeking partnerships with established biotech/pharma in order to profit off royalties. These established entities typically have existing high quality R&D capabilities.

Therefore, whatever it is they offer has to be incredibly unique. I’m not seeing anything that stands out. Doesn’t mean it doesn’t exist. Just means I don’t see it from where I’m standing.

I see a company claiming they are going to change the world by selling consulting services to big corps. And if I want to make money, how does that make me money? How do you value that? They get some royalties? Do they own the property? What’s it worth?

And as one of those big corps, I’m asking myself why I’m not letting my own people work on this and why am I outsourcing this?

And as for the COVID nonsense, I don’t see their name up there with J&J, Moderna, Pfizer. 60 days, for what? Where did that go? Now they might start trials in Q2? A year too late?

Sorry, i ain’t seeing a reason to buy, at least not now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply! I'm going to address a couple points that I think could use some clarification:

Seeking of partnerships with establish biotech/pharma in the industry is a pretty standard practice. Abcellera is a young company and quite frankly if they weren't doing this it would be  concerning.

The key difference here is the high quality R&D capabilities. Yes companies like Roche, Gilead, J&J, Pfizer, Takeda, etc have great RnD but it takes a huge investment in time as well as money to produce drugs.

Abcellera's work is geared towards drastically reducing those costs, and as a result their partnership agreements result in revenue sharing rather than a consultant fee. This is also why in their list of disclosed partnerships you see Eli Lily, Regeneron, Gilead, Merck, Sanofi, Pfizer, Lyell, Novartis, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. You're right these big companies do ask why  would they want to work with Abcellera. The truth is the majority of these companies if they stuck to their traditional target discovery models would not need Abcellera. But they don't want to and Abcellera fills a space/need that might save them millions in time, money and infrastructure at the most cost intensive portion of their research.

This is the unique product/service they offer. In 60 days at the start of the pandemic Bamlanivimab was discovered and identified as a neutralizing antibody and taken by eli lily (among other antibody candidates) into pre-clinical work. A lot of other work like moderna's was based on SARS data from the 2000's, work that has had years to reach the point where it was able to be developed into vaccines for a different disease, LY-COV555 is all SARS-COV-2 for the disease target COVID-19.

As to how they make money or a stock holder money, that really is dependent on the negotiated partnerships. If they are all like how the current FDA EUA balmanivimab/etesevimab deal is structured then the revenue stream will be fairly strong.

As for the covid nonsense.

The Abcellera developed antibodies are not vaccines, they are treatments. Moderna, Pfizer, J&J drugs are not being used to treat active disease.

Bamlanivimab was already being distributed as a treatment in the US, its being distributed as a combo with etesevimab (eli lily partnership), and is in the process of being approved for distribution in the european markets with is expected to occur sooner than later.

The Q2 trial start is for a new antibody being named 1404 which is different from LY-COV555 aka Bamlanivimab. And the publicly disclosed statement on it from Abcellera durings the earnings call was they expect it to perform against all circulating variants in the world. At this moment in time we do not have that, it is a severe medical need that is projected to be necessary.

I don't know if its time to buy shares or not but this company has amazing work, its got huge potential and I don't think its  a company to dismiss. Thanks again for your reply!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I appreciate the lengths you are going to get into this. I’ll keep it on the short list. But right now, I’m an old skeptical fart that isn’t seeing anything special about it."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think people are afraid of mortgages b/c they know the market is in a bubble but this time is way different. The banks have effectively already been bailed out by the covid stimulus plans and even when we do have some foreclosures (which we will in the next several months) the housing market itself is strong and RKT and other banks will get their money back instead of having to sell for pennies on the dollar like in 08. At least that's my personal take on the matter.

I read that they may have some unsecured debt in addition to their mortgage port which scares me. I'm hoping someone else will do a legit DD on it at some point, otherwise I may be digging into that this weekend."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just think its a shot in the foot by limiting brokers on who they could go with, rocket is a giant. Gilbert basically owns detroit lol ill put my faith in RKT, if UWMC takes flight then ill give all those bulls a salute and congrats lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long RKT for their growth potential (digitizing the mortgage experience will get a lot more market share), but also that RKT is very careful with their lending. Their 10-K shows an average credit score of 756 for loan production and 740 for loan servicing. Their delinquency rate is 4% even with covid forbearance.

For a value play I actually also bought some PFSI, which is the 3rd largest mortgage company that no one is talking about. Their ratios are way better than UWMC and RKT, with P/E of 3.18 and almost trading at book value. Their loan portfolio is more risky than RKT though so I probably won't hold for a long time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they can both coexist. I know they're battling by UWM trying to reject anyone who does business with RKT, but ultimately there are going to be people (millineals) that want to do everything online w/RKT and there will be people (boomers) that want to deal with a real person (UWMC) for one of the biggest purchases of their life. Went ahead and sold a single UWMC csp to at least start the ball rolling. Either way I'm gonna enjoy the ride until July and then reassess."
2021-03-30 19:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Hertz could become the next GME because of all the Melvins shorting it Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.

Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.

# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short

Anybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)

13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.

https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a

A lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.

# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand

For most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6db

Gamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.

Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:

1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.
2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.

So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.

# This is not an investment

The stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It  HERTZ to say this but, Unfortunately no."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hertz was the og beta test GME.  I can see some retarted shit going down...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"## Stop saying ""next GME"", GME was an exception, it won't happen again

You cannot keep looking for a historical fuckery in finance keep happening months apart form each other. Fuck, even GME short squeeze has not happened and there are many tricks in hedgefucks books to delay or avoid it.

Do not ruin your good DD's with cheap next GME promises."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks that are ""almost certainly going to 0"" do not get short squeezed. Think about it: if you were short such a stock, why would you buy to cover, ever? The only exception might be if more than 100% of the float is shorted and the shares get called back, but that doesn't look like it's going to happen here."

I dont believe in the stock and dont advise investing but if enough people threw down a small investment we could maybe see something. Not GME by any means but something.

In the end everyones doing their own car rentals and Hertz is a starving fish in a small pond."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I actually liked GameStop as a company, I don’t give a shit about Hertz in fact I’ll short it with them."

Honestly... eventually something crazier than GME will happen.  I just don't know where."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Margin capital requirements force them to buy to cover. You use the share price as a weapon to bring their leverage crashing back down on them. This can go either way, long or short; fundamentally, it's about the obligations of players who borrow money to play.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, I guess that if all the shorts are massively overleveraged and get margin called, that's another way for it to happen. But this is also pretty unlikely -- sure, we know that Archegos blew up, but does that mean that we can presume the same thing will happen to everyone shorting Hertz? I stand by what I said: you generally can't squeeze shorts out when a stock is going to zero."

At IPO, they thought the company was worth 3bn. That means we’ve given the company 8x more credit than the SPAC after 1 year. These aren’t sustainable valuation levels IMO. I mean I’m not ballsy enough to bet the other way on this, and I do think they will remain market leaders, but the business needs to catch up to the valuation before I see significant room for growth.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s happens if Biden makes some deal with the Chinese to get cheap steel? Also the $3T infrastructure deal is years in the future even if it passed today it will take forever for these projects to start.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is the way! :)

Following the hype here, I bought a June MT call then and just sold that for tidy profit and also rode X from $14 to $23...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"China is massively cutting steel production in an effort to reduce their Carbon emissions in line with Paris Climate Accord agreements. In the coming weeks they are expected to announce a reduction in their export rebate on steel; buyers of Chinese steel expect the rebate to be cut from 13% to 4%, or even eliminated entirely. This is on top of already high demand for seaborne steel across the world."

2021-03-30 18:25:23,wallstreetbets,"$AAL - The American Airlines Degenerate Gamble - AAL Trade Thesis What’s poppin’ fellas, hope you’re all doing well. I’ve got a short little trade thesis that I can’t get out of my mind due to how odd it is, and was looking for some second opinions on it. Reposting this due to it getting removed yesterday.

&nbsp;

In my spare time, I’ve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I’ve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there’s anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn’t that crazy since it could’ve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I’m not entirely convinced that this isn’t a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it’s not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn’t find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&nbsp;

**I’m not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.

&nbsp;

TLDR : **$AAL 2021-04-01 C $26**"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This was also posted yesterday. It's much more likely to be simply covered calls than a YOLO with insider information.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I put a little bit of money in AAL and UAL.  It is not a crazy GME play to the moon sort of thing.  But, I think it is solid money they will come up at some point.  I mean it is the Airlines.  Just because people are not traveling that much now doesn't mean they will never travel again.  In all honesty if it did get to that point I do not think people would be worrying about stock anymore.  But, that is my opinion do your own DD.  But, keep in mind it is not a 2 week play or a 2 month play....more like a 6 month to 6 year play."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in too! Thanks for the DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Went in for 1 25.5 call and its already up by the time I got out of the buy screen.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TDA won’t let me buy the options. Says my funds haven’t cleared. But had no problem buy GME today. I’m cleared for option trading. WTF?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stewart Varney is the fucking worst.  She seems alright.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would let her color in my bed anytime
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,gawddamn boomers lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe his eyes are rolling because she's ignoring MOASS
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Owned
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's simple, if actors who pretend to be journalists on tv dont agree with your investment choices, or the decisions of multibillion dollar companies, it's obviously everyone else who is wrong. Did I mention that he's old and white so his opinion matters and no one else's does?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,She's holdin'.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That man is a cunt. Sorry America

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do I see some of these posts where the videos is like amplified in brightness compared to everything else lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Honest question: is there a different wsb-like sub that doesn't have all the GME stuff?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep rolling your eyes son, we’ll be rolling in tendies"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all the same with 90% of boomers, they're too stubborn and stuck in their old ways to understand the huge potential for rebound and exponential growth that GameStop carries. They don't get the gaming craze and don't see money in it, so when $GME blasts off to the moon, I and I'm sure a ton of other apes that grew up in the era of GameStop are going to shit on them. Let me tell you I cannot wait for that day. Suck it you old boomer farts!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Susan is great.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s her Twitter

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,even going bankrupt they were worth more than $5 just from liquidating assets
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking boomer thinks ""tech + brick and mortar = bad"" and thoughts end there.

""Bed bath and beyond? Short that into 0?"" No, that's different.

""Physical game sales are up year by year"" No, can't look at those numbers

Fucking idiots who have never played a video game trying to tell us how video game money flows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely nobody, including people in their 20s, have told me anything positive about Gamestop unless they're paying attention. I don't get the boomer hate. I mean I get what it is, but I don't get why."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But Shitron research said 5 reasons why it was going back to $20... I wonder what he is thinking now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Had to open it on my browser on mobile to get it to work
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah nothing will get it to play. Won't even start to load. This happens all the time to me with some types of links. It happens in every single reddit app.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The vid is in HDR, probably the cause. Prob taken on a phone in HDR capture mode"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so will his ass!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want bumper t-shirts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And this is the negative shit that will be reflected on the media. Not all the positive shit WSB has been doing. They will laser focus on comments like this. Keep this as an inside thought for now my friend.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also as a none-American it’s shocking but fun to see a dude high on cocaine on live tv talking about finance. We don’t really have that here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's famous though, he even cameo'd in the first Iron man with his tv show. And in Wall street money never sleeps

&#x200B;

Because of that I always assumed he was some really important popular analyst in the us"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not fair to make fun of how he moves, he can't help it. That's just part of being a puppet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We just figured it out before everyone else that’s all.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well to be fair, Gamestop has just been kind of a dying company for years.  I do think Ryan Cohen can turn it around, but I don't think the average person will really get it until they start to see some actual changes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't hate boomers and I don't hate people in their 20's who don't pay attention. What I do hate is a boomer paid to be in the know about the market and is too smug to admit he's absolutely wrong about it because he hasn't been paying close enough attention
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a boomer, and I love the stock.

Ok, this is simple, loyal customers who support a company, grew into adults, who still love the company, they may not even shop there much anymore, so now the love translates to buying stock in the company they love.

Buy Stock in things you love.

Diamond Hands Boomer"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because we are hitting in the market by doing exactly what they were told not to do by their financial advisors. Advice they pay thousands for.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,but shitron were not stupid enough to carry on playing. i have some respect for them for that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FACTS BRO!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn bro thanks for telling me!!! I’ve had people reach out before and say that and I was like I have no idea I can see it just fine! I have a iPhone 12 ProMax and was damn!!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats her insta? I wanna follow the Susan!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think if I send her screenshot of my unrealized gains of GME, she’ll side into my DM’s?. 🙌💎🦍"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,She probably likes loss porn more
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries!! This was super interesting. I didn’t even know this could be possible. 

I still don’t know how it’s possible lmao. 

Sick combo btw!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i was literally about to ask what TV you had since it looks so bright on my phone!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Winning take, I think.

To the average person nothing *has* changed, and I don't think either awareness or sentiment will move much more until there are concrete changes to something more customer-facing than upper management.

When I'm buying electronics the company's financials or internal politics only ever enter into my considerations if it's either a a stupidly niche/specialised product, or one my purchasing power only barely allows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own some GME from all this and love video games. I do not see how they will insert themselves with players like Valve and the Microsoft Pass. People keep saying they will pivot to digital, but they are gonna be boxed out by like 4-5 Shaq type players."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which is what makes it, if this take is right, a value play."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just as likely he's well aware of what's going on and is hoping to downplay things as he is connected to the HF's shorting it. It's like politics... they'll go on TV and give bold-face lies in hopes of saving their own ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking my kid to GameStop was an absolute treat. How can anyone hate on something that gave any child so much joy? I'm not a big gamer, but helped her grind Pokemon, so I want to save the company for the kids now having their own kids who get to go to GameStop as a treat. Damn the hedgies for trying to steal that from us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it 🙃
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want it tagged here when you post it bro 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe that’s why people say they can’t see my videos sometimes and they say it loss on desktop but not mobile? Crazy! I wonder if there is a setting I should switch! I literally record it from my tv and post it lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY 😂

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really saw that movie dozens of times, can't remember him"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,odd that the main concept of investing which is buying what the company will be; not what it was. That straight from the boring investing playbook.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if they're daft enough to think they can actually beat those guys at their own games (heh) right out of the gate. They can't, and they know it. 'Pivot to digital' is such a generic, ambiguous phrase it's borderline useless.

That said, the 'digital space' is nowhere near saturated. There's room for thousands more players yet, at the very least. One thing that comes to mind is fleet leases; develop the know-how of tech enthusiasts on the production floor (and product managers' offices), combine it with some deals with federal government and OEMs for discounts, then become known for actually educating America by providing hardware that school districts might actually be able to deploy (because maintenance and ensuring supply and uptime, etc. can be prohibitively expensive at scale).

Disclaimer: not involved professionally in any of the fields above, so pinch of salt and all that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the play here, is above and beyond selling games e-commerce wise. But it is a stream of course."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that the Ms pass is hard to compete with,  new releases usually don’t go there straight away. 

With Valve, they already had prior sales deals in place (I would assume for the Steam credits they sold) so being able to sell digital games through Gamestop could be in the cards as well (Steam codes). 

Now don’t quote me on specifics, this is just speculation as far as games go. They can still sell a bunch of things as far as E-commerce goes. Collectors editions, limited editions figures or anything else video game related could do very well in the e-commerce space. Since currently there isn’t really a dedicated online platform where you can buy all things video games (this week they started selling GPUs and immediately sold out obviously)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if their main focus remains on buying/selling consoles. GameStop should see a very good q2 if Sony can stock PS5s appropriately.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally, agreed either way. He's either ignorant or complicit and I'm not sure which is worse."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My sentiments exactly!

My kid who loved GameStop is 30 now, he is holding his own GME stocks now.

We had fun when he was 9, we are having fun in the stock market now...and damn the shorties."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't remember where in the movie it was, but I watched it a couple of days back and jumped when I recognized him. 

It might have been a clip from this, around a year before collapse of Lehman Brothers. Watch from 2:30, where he starts talking about journalists not knowing as much as hedge fund managers, but wanting to pretend they are 'in the room'

https://youtu.be/BVl9SQ-KVmE"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most folks aren't invested in the stock market though, nobody teaches you shit about it growing up unless it was your parents really. What's basic to so many of us who do invest is like useless trivia to so so many others."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is as vague as ""Pivot to digital."" Some weird cult like stuff here now. I was in for the short squeeze cause math, but the only thing I know for sure now is that major players don't have to show their hand like the rest of us do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Valve

>in the cards

*heh*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My opinion is that he's dismissive of the woman in the room. I can almost hear the mansplaining he's holding back, but he'll settle for eyerolls and knowing chortles. ""Well, well, little lady, aren't YOU just the smart little girl, looking at your laptop"". Makes me want to throatpunch him."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aw, thanks for the award! My very first! :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does it have to be cult like?

I mean, maybe they don’t take it this direction. Maybe it makes no sense to many. But I just feel like there’s a place for a gym equivalent type of place for gamers. Couple this with partnerships, and exclusivity deals on a few features that incentivize coming in to the experience.

If this was achievable, the number of hours people would spend there would further bring in more revenue. Paired with the whole friend crews hanging on the regular. 

This is speculation, but like I said, I think it’s something achievable, the bet in this case is that it is achievable, and there is a market for it. 

Remember, gamers are quite rabid about all the IPs that currently have the hooks in them, which, tbh, even though the perception of gamers is a more reclusive one, people would undoubtedly find common interests with others. And if things like that happen, those formed groups could potentially be spending a lot of time in this sort of place. Buying merch and more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just feel it is cult like. Your statement is what I am talking about actually. That isn't a business plan and I have yet to see anything from this new amazing board they have put in place that resembles anything actionable. I don't see a big revenue stream coming since what you describe is going to attract younger people with less money. I am in their target demographic for sure, but I don't know what I would buy from them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because you don’t know what you’d spend for at GameStop doesn’t mean there isn’t a market. The inverse is true too obviously though. 

And of course my comment isn’t a business plan…I’d call it a potential narrative. Like I said, I’m not saying it’s going to happen, obviously there is minimal indication that something like that would at this point in time, or it’s feasibility for that matter. 

Obviously if there was concrete proof of this kind of thing, it would polarize the stock in that, some would think it wouldn’t work, and others would think it would.  Which would be reflected in the price. 

But this is the idea really with any stock and future potential earnings and what not, and whether whatever proposed business strategies are priced in or not already."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I shouldn't have added the spending part. I should re-iterate they have lost money in the last 4+ years unless there was a console release. Their market cap is crazy high and they basically have to realize what you state to justify that price/cap. So if you like Gamestop that is fine, but very very unlikely to be a good investment. It contains to much risk and not enough upside given the current price."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was blow-back supposedly about privacy so this makes perfect sense from PLTR's perspective. IMO, PLTR is a long game anyway, you ain't gonna make money in a couple of days, well, not real money. It's also flagged as a ""reddit stock"" so it gets shit-kicked around, but that will eventually fade out. I'm holding 9k shares, and I'll clue you that covered calls are your friend. CSPs probably work too. I'm not giving in on PLTR and I don't give one fuck what some analyst/entertainer says. I didn't read the article..."

Will probably buy another leap too as shit is on sale."

a) he can be PM as long as he wants the job because there's no serious opposition, way too early for thinking about what he's going to do after.

It was my first meme stock, so I stuck with it and really didn't want to ""betray"" everyone by losing faith. I ended up selling it all at $36 to buy GME and it never recovered. My bad.

MEANWHILE I had 30 shares @$12.16 in APHA, and I sold at like 13 for GME. Sold some TLRY also, and 5 days later they fucking merged"

**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**

**MORNING 07:00-12:00**

First thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.

https://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd

Next we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.

https://preview.redd.it/q3zpnefo06q61.jpg?width=445&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=105c93ad369eb22f1fc9a3dda9fae387ddece542

Whoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.

**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**

https://preview.redd.it/88priavp06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0ffa27aa5b2950f90bbd91369ff900b002465bf0

Michael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart

https://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0

Using my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.

2 hours later...

https://preview.redd.it/pc771x6u06q61.jpg?width=1643&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a78ccd799c49944de9ec2e02960e800253fb79c7

look at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.

&#x200B;

**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**

https://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa

For those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his 🍆 chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY

https://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0

Yep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close

https://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf

And like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.

As Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?

**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both**

Tune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.

*\*Chat screens taken from Tyler Durden phone*

Edit 1: I can't believe I have to explain this, guys that was the actual screenshot with accurate timestamp from a GS's VP for BWIC (Bid Wanted In Competition) when they were liquidating Archegos, proving that like Hans Solo, GS did shoot first leaving the other IBs holding the bags.

Edit 2:  Well..., turns out all those smooth brained jokes wasn't so off after all. Apes this post is to highlight the difference of what a retail trader using TA sees and what a prime brokerage client sees and the resulting cause and effect on the price. Puts on K-12"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The idiots in here can't read so forget about teaching TA or fib retracements.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't teach anyone technical analysis you just stroked your ego though? MACD, VWAP and MA, how about explaining to the noobs what they are, what they mean, and how the work together to point towards a break in resistance or direction of momentum in a stock.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You talked about TA predicted the exact moment/price, but I can't figure out what moment you are talking about. Could you add values to the text so it is comparable to the chart, would help the beginners :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time I’ve seen someone post some TA trying to predict something in the future, it’s always been wrong. The only time it has been right is when someone like OP posts TA for yesterday. It’s easy to cherry-pick successful results that have already happened."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently im both lazy and stupid because nothing I do can match the screenshots.  Unfortunately, I cant even post a screenshot of what us wrong, but one thing I do know is I am unable to find the support/resistance indicator.  Also, I have no idea how to select a specific section of a chart for analysis, the entire chart has all the colored areas.  Do you have any recommendations or alternative ways of analysis?  I did experiment with alternative methods, such as MACD strategy, and it seems promising, but I have no idea if its useful for day trading or not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man.  Informative post about TA, showing it works, and progressive friends?  The perfect combo.  Tell Michael I said hey"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Noice

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the request was for more “T & A” but I guess TA works too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hhaha well done :)
 Dont anyone explain it to the idiots pls!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's cool. But the issue with TA and price action trading is that, either you naturally get it or you don't. There's a lot of intuition and mental models you have to assume apart from this.

Some people have it instinctively and some struggle a lot."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only one percent of day traders are successful, and most who are don’t beat the market. The real question is what differentiates them? Laziness and stupidity? Its a very poor explanation and shows that you don’t actually know what makes you different."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how 90% of the time when someone is serious about their TA they will still qualify it with ""this will probably happen"" because they still know deep down that TA is bullshit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is fake, you can do better via astrology"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah great except TA is horseshit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recommend ""a random walk down wallstreet"" to anyone believing this BS.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i tried the indicators on gamestop and I feel like unless a movement up or down has passed it all looks the same.  How do you tell what way things are going in the actual here and now?  Trying to figure this out as best I can

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're assuming he did it today, all he did was link some screen shots of trading view. His set ups were absolute nonsense. The spy was up a dollar on the day it looked like had 6 green bars into hitting resistance 3 times and hes like ""this is a buy set up yep!"".

This guy certainly is not a profitable trader and has little idea what hes talking about, using a TA that blips above a purple line for 1 minute is not indicative of anything. And I hate to shit talk him cause there are real things you can gain from using TA. But this is beyond non sense. 

&#x200B;

tldr: The line moved an inch above the purple that means parabolic break out!"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn’t look like VWAP is even on his charts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was really interested when I read the title and then the actual post is just total - look at my successful trades bullshit, with no actual insight or useful explanation of how the TA provides insight into the price movement"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah he didn’t touch on risk analysis/management at all, only what happens when he’s right. What kills pretty much any new trader is the inability to quickly cut losers. Also don’t trust traders with chart themes like OP, looks like hes used TV for week max. Also noob traders love to think they can predict when something goes down. I’ve only done this shit for 7 years, but its still so easy to spot someone who just got into it and thinks they are an expert."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD = Nonsense

VWAP = Nonsense

MA = Average of how it move

If I have to listen to andrew mo money talk one more time about how GME's vwap did x, or how were testing the 170 resistence. Its like hey dumb dumb we were 350 dollars 2 weeks ago and 40 2 weeks before that. If your such a progamer at indicators why didnt you buy in at 40 dollars? Cause you had no clue what was happening, just like you have no clue now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy doesn't know what hes talking about, this is not real TA.

Ideally TA should be to time trades. If you just watch wolf of wall street and want to be a day trader, you pretty much want to trade breakouts/breakdowns. And you're going to want to use real set ups and patterns, not VWAP (Very Wet Ass Pussy) touching a purple line."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a worthless statistic because most daytraders go broke in 2 years, you can't just keep losing money for 2 years and on january 1st suddenly receive the magical ability to make money.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Follow the white rabbit, you'll come across all you need to know
 But think about the basics, if you're steady at something for long enough, you'll get much better, and who is going to keep trading after 2 years of not profiting? Just makes sense right."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"haha well I know you're a retard, but think about it logically. of course you dont get to the 2 year mark and all of a sudden you're making money, this isn't a video game. 

think about this logically, when you're a noob, in anything, you're inherently bad, and need experience. so 99%+ of noobs will lose money. as time goes on you get better, more educated ect. so people that have been in for 6 months lose less than day 1 people, and people that have been in 1 year lose less than 6 months ect.

there's a constant rotation of people coming into the market and stay for say 6 months trading and end up negative at the end which all contributes to that 90% of people that didn't profit.

nobody said anything about most day traders going broke in 2 years either. its 90% of traders dont profit, its not 90% go broke. you can lose 100% or 1% you're still in that 90% that didnt profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I've practiced for years but I can't seem to get better at flipping a coin.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My teacher i guess you can call him is a pro trader. took him 5 years to become profitable. Said before then he had to keep adding money until he learned. Now he can take a 50k L and make it back in a few days. just gotta be disciplined to the max and take the small gains.

How is this even possible? Is this a common ""business model""?

How big is the SECs blindspot?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Through equity swaps. Basically the bank holds the security and pays the returns on it to Archegos. Meanwhile Archegos pays a fee to the bank. Bank diversifies capital risk into credit risk, Archegos doesn’t have to disclose positions and can avoid some taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody else remember when GameStop was first blowing up the professionals were complaining that retail investors weren’t responsible enough to trade in options and derivatives and thus shouldn’t have access to them
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is simply hedging with derivatives.

The real issue at the root of the problem is the leverage afforded hedge funds. It appear the are able to borrow beyond their ability to repay & are ‘gambling’ on the market with leverage.

Doesn’t matter how big/wealthy you are, if you are able to borrow more than you can repay it will destabilize the financial system."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder if this dude passed the level 3 options course on his platform.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does this mean I'll reach the ""max. profit"" number on my puts?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy derivatives, you’re not really owning any stock; but the party selling you such derivatives must delta hedge, most often by buying/selling sufficient securities to cover their derivative sales. 

In this case, my assumption is that Archegos went bullish on Viacom and Discovery among others (those are two of the best performing stocks year to date) by buying call options and CFDs. GS/MS who sold them the securities had to buy the underlying stocks to hedge. 

My theory is, upon realizing Bill Hwang’s position is vulnerable to various bad news (Viacom dilution, China stocks delisting potential) GS/MS sold their holdings and tank the stock prices, indirectly triggering a margin call on Archegos. This is not unlikely, given what happened in 2008 - when GS rug pulled their fellow bankers at Lehman by selling all their MBS holdings tanking the MBS/CDO market and created the Global financial crisis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did the stockprice of viacom and discovery tank then? I didn't think CFD's had any actual impact on the price of a security.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The UK has CFD accounts for retail investors. They're classed and regulated like gambling and they're clear that you're not buying the underlying asset.

This investment strategy is definitely not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's possible because the guy used Total Return Swaps on the stocks. These swaps gives a return that is based on the stock's performance and Hwang gives something back to his broker, either a fixed payment or something variable. 

This means that Hwang still have leveraged exposure, he just doesn't have to show it on his balance sheets."

Is it basically the same as how banks 'have' your money even if they've loaned it out (ie your deposite $10 they loan someone 10$, both of you believe you 'have' $10 then POOF! $20!)??"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,8 to 1 leverage.  8-1!  That's insane.  Just a small movement away from your thesis and you are  bankrupt.  You'd need to hedge everything and be market neutral for that.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The margin call happened just shortly after VIAC took a 20%+ dip (upon announcing they would be doing share dilution). 

It was almost certainly his overleveraged synthetic position in VIAC, plus that rapid drop in price, which led to the margin call. His position was no longer valuable enough to justify his debt ratio."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you buy CFD you don't own an underlying asset. But your broker hedges your contract according to his policy. If broker didn't buy any underlying assets, he would be paying you out of his own pocket whenever you take profit."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was shorting using Equity Swaps, that way he don't need to file for 13D with SEC. Btw this is not first time our boy Bill to stuck his dick in a cookie jar. He was margin called in 2008 with VW's short squeeze when he owned Tiger Asia Managment hedge fund."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I might be misunderstanding but I don't think it was him that did the sell off, it was his financial backers who loaned him the money for his margin plays to cover their own ass and hedged his contracts since they would be on the hook if it went bad. Don't know the specifics of how much was covered but most likely not enough. They probably didn't expect him to be so over leveraged. 

I want to know who at GS and MS knew to bail and why did they bail when they did. The timing is just too on point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom was tanking before this. Share dilution through a $3b new offering and owning a bunch of second rate streaming services will do that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes most, similar in SK. The disproportion in US is what is mind boggling to me.

“Sure, have a shitton and you don’t even have to report them to us. Do whatever.”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I say illegal?  
Bu it does seems to me highly unregulated and overlooked. Combine it with zero actual long positions to hedge and that does seem problematic."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's the same.

They are fabricating BS options and misrepresenting those as shares they have on hand to sell now. Artificially inflating supply to drive down the price per share. It's fraud.

Do you think that is why the [SEC has implemented the new change](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf) to have cash proceeds from outstanding term debt issuance reported, so they can see these shady dealings?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah. and if it tanks, you have to pay up. And that you should have some kind of hedging positions. Seems like they had fuckall."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny thing is that Citadel just talked about switching to this same strategy after the GME drubbing because it would allow them to hide their actual short interest so they wouldn't have to report those positions anymore. They were also talking about how it would help them reduce their capital requirements. So in other words shady investing where there is zero transparency and accountability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the world of high finance. :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Regulations are for poor people bruh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s the same as owning a stock with the only real difference being that you don’t need to disclose and can hide your positions better. Kind of ridiculous that this loophole exists.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn’t say it’s shady it’s just an option for them to conduct business. It’s just not a common trade for retail folks like us.

Some are very intelligent, and they are probably slightly more intelligent overall because they go to better schools, but most are lunatics and they are definitely very narrow minded and generally actually have less worldly experiences. Some thug on the street that has to be sharp as fuck to stay alive has far more understanding about how  life works then some trust fund baby. Both are closed minded though, but when the thug realizes he's a morn and starts to educate himself he surpasses the trust fund baby who's too rich to fail."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They think they know everything because when they invest 20 million or billion and see 2/3/5% returns it's more than most people will make in a lifetime.

Oh and most of them are assisted by AI.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Credit Suisse & Nomura are lenders.

Archegos is a hedge fund. They took multiple derivative positions, calls & puts, with varying expiration dates.

It appears they did not go long with shares.

Risky? Yes.

Irresponsible? Yes.

Unusual? No.

The problem is the amount of leverage they are provided by lenders. If you borrow more than you can payback, it becomes a problem.

Borrowing so that you can gamble larger amounts is risky business. 

The lenders should have required more oversight on how the funds were used.

Either way, mistakes were made. Hedge funds need to pay up."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait. This guy was caught up in the VW squeeze too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the contrary, he was long, he was actually attempting a short squeeze on Viacom and Discovery, among other plays.

The recent downtrend in some of  the Chinese stocks such as Baidu and GSX since the beginning of March were already a bad omen. What sparked the implosion was a $3bn stock offering by Viacom at their all-time high last week, diluting the EPS and thus signaling negative sentiment and a selloff.

He was levered and concentrated to the tits, so a lot of the positions had to be liquidated sharply, regardless of how well they had done up to that point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i dont really understand all this stuff but is it just a coincidence that goldman sachs were supposedly weary of him for years after the insider trading thing but then gave it for the taste of the honey everyone else was getting? i imagine they must have gone in cautiously with him.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I doubt it. Swaps aren't classified as debt on the balance sheet. Whats more is that these swaps are dealer-to-dealer OTC swaps, so it's a dark market with a lack of oversight. I doubt the SEC can draft up something that quick in response to this."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true. When you see this things you can only thing that the amount of leverage in the system is way beyond reasonable and that not only GME, but probably most stocks are ultraleveraged. Just look at the VIAC chart. Probably Archegos caused the parabolic movement by entering into equity swaps with different entities. It is just a pyramid scheme like the one Madoff run for years, he was leveraged until the point he could not pay if he got margin called, but he knew other would take the losses while he would take the gains if it played out well."

I mean, yes, if you would’ve bought the stock it’s the same loss.

Second point being as far as I know, CFDs aren't available for retail investor in US (I may be wrong here, I'm euro-ape), yet they are almost absolutely unregulated for institutions? That seems hardly balanced. 

So, illegal? No, I didn't imply that. Although - Unregulated? Yes, bigly. And that does seem not okay. I did say that and so far, stand behind it. But I am open to my mind being changed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you have 2008 as an example, did we not learn a thing? It's not just risk taking when you are ""gambling"" with securities and the ripple effect affects the whole economy. When you unwind positions this big, a fundamentally good company may see its stock price tank because of the firesale itself, and the cascade effect may be devastating for big banks not even aware of their exposure. 

And then you have the bail outs; so yes, taxpayer money may be affected by this ultra aggresive trading strategies, and when you have this kind of exposure, regulation is a must."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It should regulated, in some unregulated derivatives the banks could give them high % of leverage. Imagine someone like Ken Griffin to close his hedge fund and open family office (that means he invest his own capital only).

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it like owning stock on margin. It is marked to market every second of every trading day mimicking the stock price so it’s not like the value of your account is any different than it would be if you owned the stock or that you have to “pay later” any differently than you would if you got margin called. The problem wasn’t the structure of the instruments he used, it was the fact that the instruments are basically a loop hole around reporting so the different banks he used and market participants had no idea how much he had levered up and how big his positions in these companies were...or the banks did know and just have retarded risk management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting...thanks for sharing, not all of us are American 👌🏻"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe it's common in Canada, with Horizon's ETFs being the most accessible.

I feel for this poor family offices"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't: in a total return swap, the official owner is still the writer (the bank). Large holdings by banks were the only publicly disclosed clue that the stock was being targeted by high-octane speculation."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a Cashman costume ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For about three years into the next Bullrun and it will all be forgotten. Greed is a powerful drug
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It might not be huge here in America just yet but paramount plus and cbs all access are the same thing now. Also paramount plus has the rights to Uefa champions league which is a ton of European support
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've owned it since it traded in the $20s. Thanks though.

You're sarcastically questioning their content?

There's a basketball tournament called March Madness going on right now. I hear a lot of people are watching it. 

There was something called the Super Bowl a few weeks ago. Some people seem to be excited about a golf tournament coming up called the Masters as well.

As cords continue to get cut, they'll be able to bundle a powerhouse."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The government doesn’t tax losses lol. So no the taxpayer did not take a hit because they lost money. Like a lot of it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dodd Frank was passed after 2008 to maintain financial stability and prevent banks needing bailouts. It appears to be working and tries to prevent systematically important firms from going under and needing a bailout. And let other firms that no one gives a shit about take risks and go under when they blow up. 

What is a “fundamentally good” company is in the eye of the beholder. You’re on a sub that bid up the price of a company that until recently hadn’t made any money in 2 years. Certain Hedge funds thought it was worth less than this sub. They were wrong (at least in the near term) and that’s how price discovery works. If something tanks because of a big sale, other people will buy it. Like when GME tanked and then recovered."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,interesting  history... overleveregerd and no regulations
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, thank you. Wouldn’t the absence of reporting the positions mean also that it could be abused when dealing with several banks? If so, that’s when it stops behaving like owning actual stock, if it would be possible to us it as collateral with other bank. No?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So do you mean say each bank say knew his holdings with them and thought he only held 5% of a company not realising he was doing this with 10 banks altogether and essentially was holding 50% of companies without anybody knowing that he had 5% more in each of the other banks?

Sorry I'm really dumb but I'm trying to learn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is, also in EU. But the fact that in US it’s a no-no for retail and unregulated yes-yes for institutions seems weird. (Talking specifically about CFDs, I don’t know what the deal is on swaps)

Edit: also, thank you for your efforts you put into this sub."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you see what the ratings were for the super bowl? They were down in a year where no one had anything else to do. 

I’m sure paramount+ is going to kill it. They’ve got that 5th mover advantage."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t say. They don’t tax loses? Incredible. 
But the years leading to this, with all the undisclosed profits that they didn’t have to file with SEC because they were dealing with derivates. Was exactly with this function in mind - to avoid taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And what about the gains up to this point?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh Dodd Frank did nothing banks have continued activities through the 2010's and it's also been partially repealed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think anybody knows specifically what happened but it sounds like it is possible he abused the non-reporting aspect to gain massive leverage by banks that weren’t aware of other positions he had.

Or the banks were aware and just wanted to collect fees and be first out when it blew up. Sounds like Goldman and ms knew what was going on and were properly hedged and first out whereas other banks like CS and Nomura were completely fucking clueless and ate massive shit lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's exactly what Archegos did.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think anybody knows the specifics right now but that is a possibility.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And that with this mean his 'portfolio wasn't diverse enough'(i dont wanna sound like i know) and so lets then suppose this meant a dip in anything he owned that wasn't 'covered' left him to a big risk of exposure  especially if he had uncovered short positions because short positions can have infinite risk?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my bad, apparently CFDs are legal in Canada. Probably banned in the US because they offer WAY too much leverage and can easily bankrupt retail. 

Imagine if RH users could trade CFDs? There would be no loss porn here, only bankruptcy porn.

For the past year, there has been pandemic that has made large gatherings frowned upon.

I wonder if those two facts are related."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol they’ve lost so much money that if by some miracle they survived, they could write those losses off for decades. Pretty sure they’ve wiped out any past gains"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, nicely put (pun intended)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CS knew what was about to happen and tried to reach an agreement between the other prime brokers to prevent the stonks from inevitably tanking. GS said fuck that and got out asap. MS was next and Nomura and CS got left holding the bag
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, thought so! Thank you for that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ah yeah my numbers were just a generic balance to kinda get an understanding? im trying to understand how it is that went wront went wrong, im quite new to trying to understand all this but i find it fascinating something so huge could occur"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Funny thing is, as we learned recently, RH actually trades CFDs on their customers behalf so to say"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Super bowl ratings have been declining since 2015. It’s a trend, not an outlier. And cbs doesn’t have sole rights to the super bowl..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, well that's not how shit works. If i made a million dollars every year for the past 10 years, then i owe taxes for each year.

 If i lose 10 million dollars on the 11th year, i don't just magically get the taxes back for the previous gains that i paid taxes on.

This isn't about their money. It's about avoiding taxes. Are you being intentionally dense?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a lawyer, if GS agreed to the deal, then I would think CS might have an action for breach of contract (detrimental reliance). Could be an interesting play to try and recover some of the money from GS/MS for breaching the agreement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmmmmmmm? Link?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah super bowl 5087th. Who gives a shit.  Know who wins the super bowl?

Posts on r/WallStreetBets are \*highly moderated\* compared to other subreddits. We remove a tremendous amount of content every day.

Here's why:

* A submission should have been a comment in the daily thread (""Commentposting"")
   * **Text Submissions**: If your text isn't particularly useful, funny, long, or unique then it should have been a comment in the daily thread and not a submission. Submissions must add something new to the conversation.
   * **Image Submissions:** If your image isn't related to the markets and unique, then it probably doesn't belong on WSB. This includes posts like memes with simple captions, art, non-newsworthy screenshots, etc. If you have to rely on a comment or title, it's probably not a good post.
      * Gain / Loss  / YOLO Screenshots are the exception, and the minimum requirement here is a $2.5K change in value in options or $10K change in value in shares. YOLOs must be above $10K in options, or $25K in shares. Posts **must** include screenshot of positions, and comments **must** include rationale for why you made these particular trades.
* A submission contains misinformation
   * While we can't catch everything, posts that contain false or misleading information will be removed and the users banned. You're encouraged to demand the author for ""proof or ban"". If they can't prove a claim, tag a mod and the author will get banned.
      * Note: This only applies for things which are stated as objective facts.
* A submission contains NO-NO CONTENT
   * WSB is a big sub and to avoid us being shilled at every corner, we automatically remove content that mentions small cap stocks (Below $1B market cap), cryptocurrencies, NFT, and SPACs.
* A submission is purely political
   * Part of what makes WSB great is that we don't do politics here. No one cares about your political opinion unless it makes you money. WSB does not have an agenda or political goal.
* A submission includes advertising, self-promotion, fundraising or begging
   * Come on. I mean really. Make your money in the market, not off other WSB users.

You can find all this in more detail in [our rules](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/about/rules).

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with working at Credit Suisse?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,not gonna happen. CS is a systemically important bank under the too big to fail regime in Switzerland. This means that the government will step in and bail them out no matter what.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,google says CS is a buy? What are they smoking? maybe at the lowest of the coming dip CS might be a buy as they'll work their way up again until their next 10 scandals get them in trouble. But right now it seems illogical to buy CS.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rumors are that it's up to 7 billion. That's all their cash on hand or two years of profits.

Because from what I read, Viacom wanted to issue new shares to finance starting a new streaming service, with them losing 27% I guess that's no longer a viable plan. 

Then there's Greensil which had EU regulators scrambling and contacting banks to ask if they had dealings with Greensil and Sanjeev Gupta's GFG alliance and for how much (not entirely sure how GFG is important in this). I think Deutsche unsurprisingly is slightly exposed to this as is UBS.

Yeah to big to fail I get it, but Swissair was a fucking catastrophe for a whole region, hundreds of companies and a shitton of people (including my family and most of my schoolfriends families.

For example you buy TSLA puts for this friday at $600, and TSLA drops to $550 - you now can sell TSLA at $600 to the person who sold you the option. 

Anyway everyone is expecting them to go down, so it'll probably be difficult to make that much money on puts in this case unless they REALLY melt down"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many stock valuations are no longer even correlated to any kind of actual fundamental such as revenue or EPS. Even when they were, it was never a $ for $ valuation where revenue = market cap. Instead, stocks are forward looking projections of consumer’s expected outcome. If Income rises 10% and guidance is for increasing growth, the valuation might grow by 20%+ in anticipation of this event. 

With CS, their track record is to be schiesty as shit, so when the have dropped the first turd on the table, most of us wonder how much shit they are still sitting on. 

On the other hand they are TBTF, so right about the time everyone tells you CS is done for and only a fool would waste their money on it, grab a few Boomer shares and watch it rocket up."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the long run, it just makes sense. If they don’t get fresh capital from the top 5 investors, I am not so sure, the Swiss would support a bail out. Especially since so many small businesses go bankrupt and don’t get a bailout in the corona-madness. But Switzerland is not so much under lockdown like other European countries. It’s just really a hard sell to bail out a bank again... especially for bad risk management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s true, because the real journalists are actually doing the investigative work. They don’t have time to be on TV until they publish their stories. One example is Julie Brown—she investigated Epstein and revealed all the fucked up shit he was up to. She only went on TV after her story was published and Epstein went to prison."

Those are just the national ones I can think of. You've also got all the local journalists who are just covering local stories and trying to keep local govt accountable to people."

And then the idiots all act like he ""is manning up to his mistake"". 

Just look at the 6 months of his shows leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the man was as bullish as they come. He had no clue it was coming. 

He is a manipulative asshole who shells for all the typical Wall Street power brokers. That's why they like him. He does what they want."

AMC on the other hand....how that stock is not a penny stock is beyond me. That to me is still a meme stock. And it’s management is atrocious. It will be a penny stock in a matter of a year. Those guys are clowns.

NO SHIT DUMBASS.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to salvage his shit reputation.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"2nd Rule of GME: When Cramer says he likes this stock, sell GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Has Cramer been day drinking?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't care what he says. Jim Cramer still tucks his meat between his legs and does cha cha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, so we’re not retards after all?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All I heard was vodka
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please stop posting this idiot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ladies and gentlemen... we got him. 💎🙌🏻💎
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people care so much about what this guy says. I mostly see this guy as comedy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First class asshole. Who pays attention to him? He mostly points out the obvious and throws in some jargon to keep the apes happy. If he was an NFL commentator: They gotta win harder, and nickel back bootleg run the seam."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,is he high or drunk?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dudes deep in GME. Finally averaged down enough to be in green obviously 👍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this guy always this wasted and slurring his speech?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Apes strong! GME strong! Lots of bananas for apes! 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌🦧💎👐💎🦧
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only bears turn into Karen's over positive press.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He still pee's sitting down.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer is my sunshine, my only sunshine, he makes my portfolio green, when skies are grey"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh No, God No....No No Nooooooooooooo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bipolar.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It seriously sounds like he is having a stroke every time he speaks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now it's time to sell.

AND stop putting this dbag on the front page"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s it, time to sell!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US. ONE OF US.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold the phone. There is no way those words actually came out of Jimmy Boys mouth!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh dude... This stock is going to the moon. Maybe not today but really soon. #freestyler
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the contagion. Now he's got the FOMO.

GME $500 EOW."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like he might cry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He clearly had a banana for breakfast
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer looks like he's a ranting drunk trying not to shit himself.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock?!?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like his support will be the downfall of $GME.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know who this guy is, and I haven't been following this closely, but I'm getting Alex Jones vibes from Cramer. He can barely take a breath because he can't *not* talk. Just constant spewing of verbal diarrhea"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he is a prick🏌
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If Cramer likes GameStop that means it’s gonna fail. Fuckkkkkk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TLDR $GME = BANKS
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like he did like 4 lines before the show
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just covering his bases
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh god! His voice is just annoying 😵
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you can't beat em join em comes to mind.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, just stop watching that shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been lurking at WSB for months and now he finally decides to start to believe the bull case?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a front! He's trying to get us to think he likes it so we'll dump it! Haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course he did. Shorties get fd and they want to act like they known weiners. Which he probably does.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m playing both sides that way I always come out on top.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,End of the worl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"HAHAHAH Jim Jim Jim.... Booyaa, i guess"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How can people listen to this guy. He sounds like a fucking nutsack with a small air leak.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t like this. Something’s up....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,God damnit! Does this mean I need to sell my GME shares I've been holding for  3 months 🥺
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck this bald weasel.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,positive about gme..ohh yeah we take it. we love gme
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is a traditional Wall Street guy. I have mixed feelings about him because if it weren’t for him, I wouldn’t have started trading and learning. I wouldn’t have started in options and exploring that world. His shows and books were interesting enough to get me and my dad in market. So I am grateful for that. 

At the same time, he definitely has a MSM view on a lot of what is going on and makes recommendations based on some old world thinking."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cant beat em, join em"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that wrinkle brain coming to the moon with us?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,go f%@K yourself cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,exactly; if gamestop didn't have a plan why tf would you leave your high-paying job at amazon/ google/ chewy etc
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Even my ADHD can't keep up with Crinkle Cramer's ping-ponging at this point. Do you like the stock or not?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I say once we’re filthy rich we do that impossible to shut his puppet ass up for good . His voice manipulates so many sheep
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys still watch CNBC?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TBH, who cares what this channel and this guy think or say, we already know what they're about.  We about to leave these dinosaurs behind."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop watching Cramer and CNBC. At least don't take them seriously. They are a propaganda channel for market makers. He will say something different tomorrow most likely, but continue to push his agenda, just like how he mentioned banks again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a good thing I don't understand half the stuff he says
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"he's throttling, don't trust it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cohen:   During this first round of the Exec draft we select:....

Shitadel can have their phony plants back... tie them to something heavy when they ship goes down!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer passes the dutchie on the right hand side
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop is decent, gaming will in increase in the future.

Problem is people compare it with AMC which is bankrupt and worth less than 0."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do people listen to this guy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m still waiting on DFV to be added to the board 🦍🦍🙌💎💎🚀🚀🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the players show up and the math is right you can't deny how the game gonna be played,  not even lil Jimmy boy could deny that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crazy how like, we've been saying they have a plan for months and they've been public about their plan for what, over a year now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disgusting. Although it was all true, you know that snake is trying to save face."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[I’m starting to like this guy ](https://youtu.be/xddEOi7V4cc)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Typical fair weather fan
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are we really at reverse psychology levels of desperation?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He fliped the switch. Hmm, did his wife invest to make bail, + retirement money?                                          
Is he trying to get newbies in so when/if a fake squeeze is executed (with the people margin calling on his side) those noobs not knowing the fact dump? 
Idk my thoughts on the way he's approaching it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😎yes ❤️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"a testament to his relevance, or irrelevance in this case"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Christ what a two faced fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Come over to the light baby!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We don't care if your optimistic your too retarded for our gang and that's saying something.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What did he just say? All I hear is a murmer.

Nvm, I just gotta crank up the volume to hear what Cramer said."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Drugs. Just say no.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,2 faced cuck....total tool...anyone that believes cramer has no memory whatsoever
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He loses coherent thought anytime the word gamestop pops up. I am pretty sure he is seeing a therapist by now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$DISCA is the play.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets, What's he doing? ...  He's beginning to believe.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Besides the regular WSB diamond hander, it looks like slowly but surely more and more analysts / non-WSB people are turning the corner and seeing the potential in GameStop. First Jefferies, then Zach’s, and now Cramer (even though Cramer has been know to flip flop). I personally am feeling preeeeeetty optimistic at the outlook all things considered 💎🙌🏼🚀"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fake ass punk....🤘🏼🤘🏼🦧
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Maybe they have a plan” yea it’s called buy and hodl , we like the stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it wrong that I want to take Cramer's wife out to a nice steak dinner and then never call her again!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a man trying to maintain a grip on his shaky little pedastool.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F that relic. Two months late dude. We already knew this was happening.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No wonder... I saw it climb to 200 and then crash back down. Must have wheeled Cramer out the second it broke 195 to say something good about GME to tank the price.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't beat em, join em."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When the squeeze gets squozed.  Everyone should mail crammer a massive dildo. Just so he can quietly go fuck fuck himself.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lolz he finally did his DD AND admitted it 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And all the stocks on the screen are the huge sells they made on Friday for the $20B margin call
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy is obviously on one or many substances. No sane, sober person talks like this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow man thats deep. never thought he would say this. hahahahaha um gme to moon?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty soon he’s gonna be saying he likes the stock!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Mean Girls: You can't sit with us!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does Cramer sound like a “Castrato” that just had his nuts clipped...get that high pitch squeal Jimmy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh oh. Somethings up, SELL SELL SELL!! *don't actually sell please *"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he likes the stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the team... does he like the stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is Jim Cramer!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that lil shit bought in. lol he could not resist
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They spent months badmouthing ""Reddit traders"" and now they are nearly admitting that we were right all along. I sense that there will be an influx of boomers into finance subs, trying to learn the secrets of those who know more than the gurus."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer was just FUDing so he could buy the dip! Red dildos for Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't beat GME  join GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he having a stroke. Slurring all his words. Gameshtop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta hand it to them it’s a smart move to convince the general public. 

Act like Cramer is coming around now so he can say the run is over at $1000 before we really take off👍🏼"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it look like he's wearing a suit from walmart
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess Jim did take his losses from gamestop and is now with us to get the money back 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's going to act like he was with the retail investors the entire time.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Reverse psychology dad logic: if the old man thinks it’s cool then the kids think it’s lame and will stop what they are doing. Not that I care...I just like the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🐍

# AMC Executives Sell Large Amounts of Stock -- Barrons.com

BY Dow Jones \&amp; Company, Inc.  
— 6:59 AM ET 03/29/2021

AMC Entertainment ( [AMC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=AMC) 

AMC stock has rocketed so far in 2021 in volatile trading, and executives of the theater chain recently have sold large amounts of stock, after selling none last year. In fact, for three out of four of the executives, these are their first stock sales on the open market on record.

AMC stock has soared nearly 400% year to date, fueled by so-called meme trading. At one point, when shares hit $20.36 in January, they were trading at nearly 10 times the year-end price of $2.12. The S&P 500 index has managed to rise only 5.8% so far this year.

The four executives sold a total of nearly $3 million of AMC stock earlier this month. AMC didn't immediately respond to a request to make them available for comment on their stock sales.

The selling was led by Stephen Colanero, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, who sold 100,000 AMC shares on March 23 for $1.1 million, or $10.52 each on average. He now owns 108,879 shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's pitching GME because of who they're hiring? The price of the stock has nothing to do with any changes in the company.....really awesome way to misrepresent the situation entirely.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who da fook is that guy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For everybody who watched on mute because fuck Jim Cramer, I've taken the bullet for you and transcribed what I heard.

And I quote...

Jim Cramer: GUH"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No habla ingles
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's got some white stuff dripping off his chin 💎🤲🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember, the story of the frog and the scorpion. A scorpion is always a scorpion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer sounds alot like bobcat... you know the guy from police acedemy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if Cramer is ok with GME, is this the beginning of the end, or the dawn of a new era?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This dude is an obnoxious, unlikable twat"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This motherfucker right here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Poor guy has to keep making word noises until this all blows over
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,jim say it dont spray it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer isn't stupid guys. He's just not a fanatic like people on here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn! He is bullish, time to sell"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is it just me or does he look like GME is going to moon, soon?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he is optimistic abt the banks we abt to short the shit out of the banks like it’s 2008.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All I heard was “blah blah lbablg”. And yes I don’t understand what that third word was.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s tryin the ol’ reverse psychology

Whatsammatta Esse?? Don’t u know I’m loco?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His name is Creamer and the jizz that fills his ass belongs to the Hedgies. Creamer no friend of Apes. Never has been. Never will be.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That spineless bitch prolly realized how fucked hedgies are, bought his own tendies and is spreading the hype."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is legitimately way more retarded than anyone on WSB could ever be
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,In stock investing anal-ysts opinions are like farts in the wind sometimes it blows back in your direction
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like fozzie bear
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So. Buy more?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They'll all come around. The tendies are ment to be shared
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He sounds like the guy who would dub over Tim Roth's cursing from Reservoir Dogs. ""I'm *freaking* dying over here, Larry! I'm *freaking* dying! Hold my hand!"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wait long enough and the villain becomes the hero! GME to 50k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,""" if they are going to do something? "" wtf you mean IF ..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Plan: 🦍eat 🍌wait for 🍗
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooooom optimistic abooot gamestaaap
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Every 10 minutes this guy has a new and different take on Gamestop.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never listen to Wall St Boomers on TV. When they say they hate something, they own a shit ton of it. When they say they love it, they sold it a month ago."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Jim Cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy is such a joke, bashing GME for months, and now he is finally seeing what most of us already saw in December/January"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What accent is that? 😂 nobody understands what hes saying
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He finally gave in for a short time, but he will be pulled back by the suits paying his salary. He will be back to normal soon enough."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone else notice that his callers always thank him profusely when they get on the line? I don’t remember them gobbling his nob so hard until after he got all the Twitter vitriol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His ass couldn't take it anymore lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer sounds like a clucking chicken
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow he really sounds like Glen from Superstore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still hate him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just got light headed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure there was zero Cramer hate until all the communist GME normies joined the sub. Guys been giving market context for mainstreet investors for fucking decades get off his case
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn't want to go down in history as the biggest moron who didn't see this massive squeeze coming. I wonder how man more are going to turn as we get closer to the pop?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s such a lapdog
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is slowly turning to the Darkside. Or should I say, the ape side."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Plot twist Jim was the whistle blower
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer wears flip-flops on his hands too so he can do it twice as fast.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s nervous
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dat bitch moonwalking backwards 😭😭😭
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s more bipolar then my mom is Jesus Christ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does he always sound like he’s always on the verge of crying.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Maybe* they have a plan. ***Maybe***. 

&#x200B;

***MAYBE?!***"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they haven't hired me to keep their dev teams honest and lean in not sure how serious they are.

Also, u/savevideo."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shut it down, shut it all down"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer blasts his asshole with a shower head while sucking dick
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I am absolutely convinced that he went out and bought himself a yuge bag of $GME a couple of weeks ago. 😁🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp. Guess anti-Jim strategy means we gotta sell $GME now. Thanks a lot Jim.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Typical Cramer. Hop on board after things look good and trash them after they tank. He’s never ahead of the game. Usually he’s the kiss of death
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,G A C K E D
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer can cram it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s such a knob.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he likes it do we still like it?! 😝
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer really needs to learn that you can’t just even out alcohol with cocaine to look sober
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Even a broken clock is right twice a day I guess? Still a bitchass tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Had a stroke trying to give us props
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is a glitch.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s called hedging.  Whether it goes up or down he can say he ‘called it’. 🤓
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer somehow applauding gme makes me worried because it may plummet. 
On the flip side I am happy because if it dips, I get to buy more 🙈"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He is trying so hard to become a Jimpanzee...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how this guy went from hating to loving the stonk and wishing to be hired by the company in a matter of weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is still a snake, but holy shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FUUUUUUK Crymer...we don't care what he thinks or says 😤
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer been a clown boys
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he is talking up GME on this video because he is tired of taking a beating in WSB!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Next thing you know Cramer will be knocking on our Lambo doors trying to suck us off behind Wendy's
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how does he have a low and high voice at the exact same time??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I really don't care about this man's opinion. I find him to be an absurd talking head and I will never take advice from him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sus af
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer probably ran out of cash and is looking to score some tendies with us now so he can score some meth or coke or whatever the hell he is on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He will jump on any bandwagon. Has no balls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buaaaa se la esta envainando wuajjajajaja at least he acknowledges the facts, top executives from big corps are joining the proyect , if that doenst mean nothing not sure what does"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if Cramer knows 90% of his viewers are us waiting for him to say something stupid so we can meme it on here...

And the other 10% are people putting their grandparents to bed for background noise 

🤣"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tome to make bank ! Let’s gooooo!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,C.Y.A.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‘ I have to admit if they wanted to do something, they could’ essentially. Pretty profound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing about a Liar is their word is worthless no matter what they say.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing that’s fishy is Jim is intentionally trying to squeeze in Gamestop’s positive outlook these past few days here and there. You can clearly see the question is not related to gamestop. And this has not happened for the first time. I wonder...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What did he say? I can't listen to him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How can a speaking voice go through three octaves in one sentence?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he drunk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You apes finally broke him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer has webbed feet - pass it on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Petition to replace Cramer with DFV.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still no comment about the real reason GME and AMC are going to moon.   Fundamentals aren’t why.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s saying nice things bc he’s going to need to look for another job. No ones going to hire him if he keeps talking crazy lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You his old ass hopped in the GME trading recently lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is seriously going to be the undoing of Jimbo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These Cramer snippets remind me of Samuel L Jacksons character in the Robocop remake that progressively loses his shit as the movie goes forward and ends by just ranting 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he didn't. You hallucinated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far what are the big names and their ex company positions respectively?  

I got the amazon growth guy. Who's the guy from google?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone with experience tell me how many dildos you have to shove up your ass before you start sounding like Cramer? 

It's my biggest fear"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His voice reminds me of Glenn from Superstore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounded like was going to cry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he drunk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SHA1 of my theory on their plan: e564e744f60299a41a70554a186e6a853ee9b91e81945036601e1e391d8f0adf. Will post contents if it materializes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp.  The top is in.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Reverse psychology short position? Sounds fishy jimmy!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer more like Dum Namer. Got em.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s almost sad watching Jim Boomer become irrelevant
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He always looks like there's a toilet under there and he's been fighting that turd for a while.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The same fuckin shit he pulled in 2008. Once the jig was up he started taking the opposite position to seem credible. Bald fraud. Fuck him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen, it's Rick Berkeley in disguise."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kramer stamped it. Commence squeeze now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not too late to get out from behind that dumpster Jim. They are still hiring!!

www.wendys-careers.com"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He talks like Glenn from Superstore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he crying or is that just what he sounds like now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations to WSB for buying 1x Jim Cramer, Finance Actor Grade AAA.

The News Corp is currently reprogramming the opinions of your purchase and will be going live soon. Here is your operations manual."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is he saying? I don't undstand lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starting to wonder if this guy lost everything during his meltdown and may have actually bought some gme

Alternatively he's being told to hype gme, so that people trust him again...

Don't believe manipulators"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, guess I like him now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim cramer wears Speedos for work
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😊🥰
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Telling his number friends to buy them they for attack it so they sell low and have more to cover. Don’t bother with Cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It fucking **killed** him to compliment GameStop in any way.

#YOU LOST OLD MAN"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he reminds me of if louis ck got into stocks and was somehow worse of a person
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like he is buying the stock, shorty becoming an ape?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s a tweaking muppet
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK Jim Crammer. Go do some more blow of Ken Griffith's ass loser.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s a new world buddy. Embrace it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Cramer , now if you can only stop microwaving your fish in the office we’d be on par."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer looks like he coughs without covering his mouth
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The swedish chef because no one can understand him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The one thing that make me consider selling. An endorsement from this guy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is as useless as a canned good with the label torn off. 
And when you open it, it’s filled with poop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, I'm a professional. 

This is not financial advice"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What did he say I can’t be bothered to watch it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"IF YOU CANT BEAT EM, JOIN EM CRAMER. HA"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is the skip bayless of financial media. Fuck both of em. Idiots blowing hot air
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean GameStop does have Nintendo god Reggie for advertising and look at the online page for GameStop, they are still kicking"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiotic cocksucker must have closed his short position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy buy buy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s the equivalent to the loser’s applause at an awards ceremony.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it seem like he just had a stroke?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The HFs = Sauron & the orcs 

Cramer = Gollum 

DFV = Gandalf 

Apes = hobbits

GME  =  💍"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did Jim bet against Gamestop? He sounds frustrated.  LOL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does he talk like his jaw is clenched
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why every time Kramer talks it looks like he taking a hard shit in his pants be moving around and shit.😂😂😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like a fallout Ghoul.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When Jim Cramer plays GTA he stops at all the red lights
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First they ignore you.   
Then they laugh at you.  
Then they fight you.  
Then you win.  <-  (WE ARE HERE.)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He knows they ain't gonna fold, slowly but surely it's time to start saving face."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who cast Louis CK as the kingpin? This sadderverse is getting worse and worse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,they might i’ve have plan? i’m all in!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cocaine is one hell of a drug.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,God his eyes are deader than mine
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop is a bank got it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When you have been flipping back and forth your whole life it starts to get a big blurry as you become more senile and you sometimes forget where you are.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's trying reverse psychology.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,love u cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,can he speak in a more coherent way? wtf

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is long on cocaine
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not living in America I had never heard of this jackass before the GME thing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is Cramer the dumb version of Rick? Just as alcoholic, but a complete fucking moron?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"uhhhhh

you all did it!!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At work, what did he say?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like a defeated beta man when his voice cracks like that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,First decentralized autonomous web and physical based organization?!??? ??? ?? ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤯
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer should stop drinking at work

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does he sound like a clucking, I mean cucking chicken?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, what a biiiiiitch"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to the dark side lol.  Super smooth brain there, but he finally seems to be getting it. We know he can't just come out and say it.  Just don't go calling yourself an ape anytime soon, Jimbo."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer knows what the inside of his shoes taste like
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I DM him often and ask what his favorite color crayon he eats is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man some of these dudes are just simply clowns.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Derp.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,'Whats up fellow retail investors'
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that geriatric fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer legit sounds drunk in these segments. I’m kind of hear for it but he still doesn’t hold the door for people behind him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,whatever happened to the Brother Cramer award? Or did we realize that he's just a fucking loser sellout?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer’s choking on my dik
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock! He likes the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me kiss your bald shiny forehead ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|kissing_heart)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't what he's saying, Cramer is a literal meme at this point, he gets funnier by the day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t believe I’m about to say this, I couldn’t of said any better (or higher) myself"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see a bald Danny McBride play him in the movie.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer flushes the toilet sitting down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He drunk.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like he's being held hostage and forced to say something positive about gamestop. Bro blink twice if you need help.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer just called the top fellas!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when too big to fail gets its ass handed to it repeatedly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been replace by a reptilian ape... Only thing that makes sense...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This dude is seriously drunk? Does anyone else feel the same way? I'm being 100% serious. My stepdad, who is a raging alcoholic, sounds exactly like this at times."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fruit and nut salad speaks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish af on Cramers Alcohol - Blood - Level
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like an unstable Yoda...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He is too ugly to punch in the face
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Soft turd hath spoken.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's gotta turn it around at sometime to try and hedge how much of a douche nozzle he's been
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His sources tell him that the Apes are going to be victorious. He must begin a subtile change in tone over the next few weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My favorite Cramer moment was when he told GameStop to tell their investors the stock isn’t worth this much. Like yeah people with tons of their stock are going to say it isn’t worth shit, sure"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the voice of disbelief. Nice jobs retards. You broke Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn he sounds like my drunk uncle on Christmas
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dammit now I have to sell /s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro this guy is high out of his mind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer bought Gamestonk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole news media world needs to implode, so much FUD they have spread. All need to be roped. Honest, open non biased journalism has been erased ever since few men owned the monopoly of it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer and Biden having a public conversation lol I buy that on ppv
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful. See, the short squeeze was a technical rally. But, now, GameStop is going through a major digital transformation. I predict it will transform from a meme stonk to a growth company with legit fundamentals. And Jim Cramer seems to agree."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer waited to do his DD apparently.  Like, why the fuck do you think we are even here?  Short squeeze, fuck the hedgies,  sure, but this only started because they were way undervalued in a fast growing sector.

None of those morons did their DD, and doubled down again and again, because they couldn't possibly be wrong.  Are they just catching on now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, gamestop is about to nosedive, check."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is he saying this am a reading too much into it or are they pushing gme?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta say, at this point I reckon the whole US dollar is just a casino and your economy is the survival of the luckiest smoothest brains.

Bang your stimmy on red and pray for the best 🤣

I thought it was a novel talking urinal.

hmm... who wouldve thunk..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's optimistic about GameStop? Uh oh...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow my audio must be screwed up. All I heard was buy more GME and AMC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer going full Lou Holtz
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us! One of us!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please someone else tell me they see the similarity between Cramer and Trump, both in looks and mannerisms? Anyone?

Note: not political, I just think they look like each other."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet he chokes himself out at night listening to Dean Martin records snorting powder wishing he wasn’t Jim Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s like a creepy old uncle trying to get invited to a high school party
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck does this mean it’s time to sell?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we stop showing off Cramer? We are just driving traffic to his show, which in turn tells his team that he should keep doing what he's doing.

Don't we all agree that he isn't important to us?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So THAAAAAAT’S why the price went down today.  All makes sense.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer tips less than 15%.

Jim Cramer circa 2021"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't understand what he says anyway. His voice is like an uneven, mumbly, super-caffeinated ~~Yoda~~Grover voice.  I literally need subtitles to understand the guy

edit: Yoda is too sage for a comparison. He's more like Grover.. or maybe Gonzo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer on TV - immediate mute - All I now see him on tv is him crying ""I  like the stock, I like the stock"" but with a bad lip sync"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said that he is starting to like GameStop. **Cramer**, if you can see this, Welcome Aboard Fellow Retard!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a true autist
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, I’ll translate.  He said, “Herp Derp”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder why he was hired as a host when i barely undestand his words😔😔 oh btw english is my second language.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he'll open his asshole up to all of wallstreetbets
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was financial advice.  The one time there's financial advice and you missed it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember in Demolition Man that all restaurants were Taco Bell?

He just said that all stores will eventually be GameStop."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said Hedge Funds have the big gay
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said, to paraphrase, he likes the stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hardly know what he said because he speaks in a cadence of a lush
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah got phone showing mute off but still can't hear
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said something about gamestop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a shame there's not a lower volume.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said hold and buy more GME.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds better that way!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only volume I care about is the type which forms those massive green dildos
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the only way to stomach this motherfucker
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to be on our side so when they tell us it's over we know our best interests are in their hearts.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">apart of

I just have to point out that since you said *apart* you're essentially saying the opposite, since something that is apart of something else means they are not a part of each other.

...I'll leave"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dildo shaped Muppets are Muppets too!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Again, why are we posting this retard. It gets fucking annoying"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hire the muppet already and send him to the dungeon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You made me LOL, retard. Well done."

those are literally opposites"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Make it a dildo shaped broom and he must handle it in the intended fashion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is offensive to janitors.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The question is, what does the hazing entail"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Being a Janitor is actually a job with dignity and purpose... you  expect this cunt to be able to do a job like that?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The most accurate description I have ever heard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Most brilliant comment of today
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I died.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And sounds like the business version of Bobcat Goldthwait.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao!!!!!!!!!!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer looks like what he is.   A piece of shit

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude this was really good lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, he is never going to recover from that financially.."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Liger Kong
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hes still allowed to walk free? I thought he got Jeffry Epstein'd after saying good things about GME

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who should we cast as Jim Cramer in the upcoming movie? Steve Buscemi with a fat suit, a bald cap and a fake goatee would be good"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge King and that bitch Carole Gamestop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tiger King was already the business version of the tiger king. Cat business.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Some say Katy perry wrote the song Hot and Cold about him and his stock picks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You notice that too? Kind of like when he craps on growth stocks in the morning then tells you to buy Shopify in the evening
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes he is the Stephen A Smith of stocks. He's hype and hot takes not financial advice.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Dude switch side base on his position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine not having your feelings in investment. Purely valuating them on objective parameters.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today he looks at the stock price, tomorrow he looks at their quarterly report."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shitadel missed a cheque. Not Jim not happy

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the memes. For the memes.

I mean, if not for him we wouldn't have our slogan ""we like the stock""."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven’t listened to him since he made the Bluth company a ‘don’t buy’
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, but I do encourage averaging down. More shares is mo better!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guy, average down if you can."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just buy more at 483 next time!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">""is manning up to his mistake""

You can afford to make all the mistakes you want as long as it's not your money  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s looking for a Job. Wants to ride the Rockets with us. He’s realizing we’re way more his kind of people anyway. Once we’re all rich he’s gonna always be on our side next. $CUM stocks it is!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, a lot of people didn't know 2008 was coming, hence why it happened like it did









but I guess now that I made this comment I'm going to have redditors who were probably in diapers in 2008 tell me how obvious it was that it was gonna happen"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Verrrry fuckin true. This screech sounding fuck is a lightning rod for fuckery.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on banks is what the hedges are gonna do. Watch it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I thought for a second he breaks out in tears when realising how bright the future of Gamestop actually is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's how boomers convey their conviction because they're bad at lying and manipulating. I thank them for smacking me in my head and telling me to quit whining when I was trying to get my way when I was younger. Now, I can see right through their bullshit instantly.

 His tone is like, ""Listen to me, trust me... You hear the emotions behind my voice?! This is because what I'm saying is true and I believe it. Don't you? DON'T YOU? C'mon please? Reason with me here and believe me!"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like his voice ngl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the C-Suite of Gamespot is just handing over lots of retail investors' money to other C-Suites so they'll reciprocate in the future.  

What business plan could save Gamespot in any recognisable form given how game distribution is going digital?  it already has gone digital for the PC."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,low testosterone + whippets
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There has been increased whale activity around NY, possible due to the frequency change"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been that way since the incident

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape buy, ape HODL. This is the way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just heard ape buy.

Ape buyed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha. Oh man this is one of the best insults I’ve heard in a long time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of my finest recent moves was selling my AMC position at $13 and getting more GME a couple days later at $120-130
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And then there’s BB which shouldn’t be a meme at all but is also being walloped by AMC lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But their CEO got a huge multi million dollar bonus. That means they are doing good right? 🦍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the future GME will be evaluated at $1000+ on fundamentals alone, and everyone on Reddit will still be arguing over if the squeeze has been squoze, but we’ll be doing it from our yachts"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still think AMC has potential, but they need to just clean house and put in all new management.  I was figuring around $10 a share if they had a great summer, but most of the current rise is just due to the correlation to GME, and if it's riding high when it decouples, lots of people are going to be left holding while management spends their bonuses.  I've stepped away from it for a while, and may play it again midsummer if they're doing things.  They have avenues for growth and profit, but I'm no longer confident in the current management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish AMC holders could read this comment objectively and go and do some serious DD. I'm sure many traders have made great gains with it, but the blind holders are in for a difficult ride. The company is destined to fail, unless they fire their top execs and evolve their business model."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope so. I bought in at $339 like an absolute imbecile, and I’m holding with diamond hands. I also bought BB at almost $20 and that shit is below $10 now. Totally meme disaster stock IMO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $90 after the initial boom started to dip hard. I only did it when I saw they started hiring executives from Chewy and other extremely well run companies. The recent housecleaning only further solidified the decision in my mind. 

I know it’s not exactly retarded to invest in a company that has great assets but shit management right as soon as they start to change management, but that was the first sign something real is going on at GameStop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,20 shares of AMC at almost $13/share. i bought back in too quick. dying to dump this shit. it’s deadweight
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He really looks like one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's pointless listening to him, he's all over the place.

One day he pees out of the front-hole of his diaper like a good retard and the next day he shits all over himself again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He hasn't slept since '86
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Really because everything he says will happen the opposite happens
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao not in a million years
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re don’t want this snake
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's the reverse psychology 4D chess move he is making.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He in fact did, in his book who knows many years ago. He's like the Original Retard."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just found out the other day watching Sesame Street with my boy,  Grover and ms piggy have the same voice, blew my mind."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I truly think he's had a stroke and his voice is slurred.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds like an awkward 15yo who only dropped one of his balls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if that was intentional or not, but the voice of Yoda *is* the voice of Grover, so... yeah."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought he sounds a lot like Dr. Steve Brule from Brules Rules
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like cookie monster to me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause cramer is on a relapse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His voice might be the best thing about him....and you described it perfectly....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jar Jar?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds a little like glen from Superstore in this (and Glen sounds a LOT like Kermit the frog so similar green but way less sage)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like the stock, I do hmmf"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GROVER is so spot on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's caffeine and some other white substance
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's uncomfortable unless he has some buzzer sound effects he can fondle while he talks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I tried to listen to his podcast earlier in the year and could barely make it halfway through one episode. Not sure how anyone can pay attention to that guy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I forgot what he said cause i try to not remember what he says.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""They are hiring these really unbelievable people"" is what I am hearing.  I had to listen to it several times though and I could also be wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He speaks like that rooster dude from looney tunes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*""I can't understand what he says anyway. His voice is like an uneven, mumbly, super-caffeinated* *~~Yoda~~**Grover voice. I literally need subtitles to understand the guy""*

You meant to say cocaine, and not caffeine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your Spectrum of Yoda to Grover is amazing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please someone do a deepfake with grover using cramer's voice!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like the manager from superstore the show
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Drunk Kermit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Elmer F U D
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"essentially what he said....

took one for the team and was blindsided by bobcat Goldthwaite's ugly retarded cousin"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The is way ! this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said his pee is stored in the balls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,no
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep thats how he can play both sides saying. “I SAID SO”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is on point
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd believe you if even you said you had this for a decade.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved thanks

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like for real we keep seeing clips where he fights with others and wants to talk about gamestop, now this...
I feel like cramer knows it’s gonna happen and actually wants to tell everyone but his cnbc overlords would fire him if he said that on air. I feel like he keeps hinting at it.
Maybe cramer‘s secretly an ape"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always gotta remember the apart/a part opposite-day mnemonic:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like masterbating with a handful of croutons.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find him amusing, a dancing clown. I’m fine with it."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that's why he's crying whe saying it....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,underrated comment.  I'm sad about how fast tiger kind memes went away

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s not that long...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Go to his Twitter page he’s got tons of fans in the comments

Is it so he has an escape plan if it doesn't rocket?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only job he's going to get from us is the court jester position
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The issue is that Cramer claims to have some kind of secret insight into the market when he doesn’t. He is tool. His recommendations are either obvious or wrong. His only value is in defending the status quo for Wall Street.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">This screech sounding fuck

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this move but like $200s for my strike, good move fellow ape"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This was the way (sold off AMC at $14 for more GME bananas)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"With the vote happening at the moment my brother only hopes the price goes up a bit before may 4 so he can finish liquidating what he's got in AMC, he sold the majority to switch to GME but now he sees that there's no way that stock is good long term."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did that a few weeks ago. Went into all meme-stocks (NOK, GME and AMC) too late after the January spike and researched them after buying. FOMO was real ...

Averaged down NOK because it will be good - 2+ years from now. Sold out of AMC because, at best, they will get where cineplex already is. And massively added to GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ooh ooh AAH AAAH MONKE AAH OOH OHH OHH AAH  MONKE 🦍🦍🦍🦍

I am a bot, and this action was done automatically."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"$1k is not yacht money for a vast majority here though... So by ""we"" you mean those with 10,000+ shares?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I feel like AMC is for the folks who think GME shares are too high, and they wanna get in on a cheaper one. Blinded by price and unwilling to follow the core of the opportunity itself. Heck, even my close friends did this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said this further up but GameStop hiring execs from Chewy and other really well run companies a couple months ago was what motivated me to invest at ~$90. Until AMC shows a similar willingness to shake things up at the top of the ladder, I’m staying far away."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold mine at a small loss to buy more into GME and average down - it’s better there than in AMC, losses be damned. Tiny in the scheme of things."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what about a billion?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MSM? yh it's supposed valued at 175. I'm reassured
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but....that moment in time where it dropped a little...remember?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think part of his semi-coherence is his Northeast accent.  He's from Philly, and he's been in NYC for years.  People in the Northeast often have ways of contracting compound words and pronouncing certain things that throws off people from other parts of the US."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When he said whidmwah, I felt that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What language is this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just watched it twice and I didn’t hear a single thing wrong with what he said or how he said it.  Maybe it’s cus of where I’m from
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You know he's not even aware of what he was meaning to actually say
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you just call Cramer high functioning?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it is much more abusive substance than alcohol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe now that Rush Limbaugh is dead..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He self doses a combination of grain alcohol, pcp, ketamine, ddt, rogaine and testosterone."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who, Grover?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean he's ""the highest"" functioning alcoholic on TV"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he's definitely hard to understand. He swallows a lot of his words and his uneven pitch and tambour make him really difficult to understand, like when he runs out of breath but still keeps trying to speak. He also constantly breaks his train of thought mid-sentence and begins a new sentence without even pausing, which makes it even harder to understand him."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I have no idea what he said either.  sounded like ""they are hiring.""

something something, squeak."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said something like they're hiring the right people. Some big names from Amazon and Google. And those people would not join the company, unless there was a solid plan."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,English is my husband's 2nd language (moved here in early 20's) and watching Cramer is what helped him level up lol... if you can understand Cramer you can understand anyone!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I’m one of the only people to whom Cramer sounds crystal clear. But I think most other people don’t sound that clear
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he hopes Gamestop has a heavenly day.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, this!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha exactly! 

Btw I've never met you, but your name does sounds familiar."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. You're right!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was also on reddit yesterday
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,KP is also dumb as fuck. Listen to her on Star Talk and lose some brain cells.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uhhh, what?

I'm not much for mainstream anything, did this actually happen?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pepperidge farm remembers
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You get more stock to play with for one, and your average per stock being cheaper means you can radically increase bananas earned.

Your ‘in the green’ also happens sooner of course, so there’s a psychological aspect to it too.

It does of course depend on how many stock he has, and how many he buys. Most importantly though it’s only a strategy if it’s with money he can afford to loose, as with every investment. He may have one at $483 but that’s all he can afford; in which case just hold until lift off."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"oh wow. TIL dustin diamond died in february.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK, thanks.  That's idea sounds OK but I doubt there's a huge market and it only lasts until VR setups drop to a certain price point."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They think because gme is $200 a share, amc will too. That is pretty much all the real dd they did"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Better to buy fractional shares of GME than AMC. Price per share doesn't matter. The AMC movement never made any sense.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely coke or meth
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s Chris Berman Syndrome. He’s always talking until he runs out of breath and then keeps going for a few more words.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Although it'd be nearly impossible to confirm, there's a very good chance a majority of WSB GME holders made their first purchases of shares on or after Jan 22nd when this shit started going parabolic.

You are right tho, that there's still plenty whose average cost are between $15-60 and could be sitting on 1,000-50,000 shares."

It’s funny what you don’t even notice is different until you interact with people from other areas. I’ve always pronounce the days of the week “Mondee, Tuesdee, Wensdee” and so on. Apparently that’s a thing peculiar to the mid-Atlantic. I also say “wadder” the same way you do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,High functioning ...in respect to the average person doing Cramer-sized amounts of coke and meth.

I've been here since $35 (the first time). Rode the wave to \~$500, then rode that bitch back down to $40. Took it hard for a day or two, then realized there's no fucking way they covered. Hodl. And here we are, I've averaged up to a number I don't care to admit, and although it's still green, I know this stock has more in her. I'm not fucking leaving.

I have a monthly subscription for my dog's stupid expensive prescription food, through Chewy. Had a notification it was delivered on the 26th - but it's nowhere to be found. Emailed Chewy and let them know on Sunday the 29th.
Less than 10 minutes after sending that message, I got an email saying a new shipment was on its way. Immediately followed by an email from a customer service rep apologizing and letting me know they sent a replacement free of charge. Fucking rad, that's some of the quickest and best customer service I've ever gotten online. 

BUT THEN. The package showed up (on a neighbor's porch. They don't like me very much so they hid it for a couple days I guess). 

I emailed Chewy back and told them it was here, apologized, and asked them to cancel the new order if it's not too late. They replied (again, insanely quickly), saying it was probably too late to cancel, but ""we would greatly appreciate it if you took the time to donate the food to a local animal shelter or rescue.""

If this is the attitude and service that Ryan Cohen (and now more of his Chewy cohorts) are bringing to GME, I am all fucking in."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"After reading the DD about hedge funds abusing the MMs ability to create phantom shares for puts as a hedge I took a look at monthly maturities for contracts.

Pretty much every single monthly maturity has a put to call ratio of 3+ and they're all for under $10 normally around 60k contracts but 07/16/2021 has a ratio of 6.7 and 170k contacts for a $10 strike.

I am thinking they purchased these contacts as gme was approaching $10 to use the phantom shares to short gme and then execute the puts and use those shares to cover their shorts and then they just continue the process.

As these $10 are all going to expire worthless I am assuming they are going to have to start buying shares to cover the phantom shares they shorted? I am also thinking they don't have the capital to pay premium to create more phantom shares this way.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I'm pretty high, most don't have a ratio of 3+, still looks off though the ones with loads of $10 strike puts"

These numbers used to be memes, until they shorted the entire Russell 2000 and 90 some ETFs.

They can kick the can down the road over and over, but pressure and interest are building and there's nothing that can stop it.

Their goal isn’t to manipulate the stock price, it’s to manipulate the hype. When we get hyped up more people buy, even new comers. Then the next day when it’s red people panic sell because they’re convinced GME is dead. It’s literally a short ladder attack on hype."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't buy more until a deposit clears tomorrow.  But I will buy more...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bet you didn't know......

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I guess it is finally time to move GME to my safe long term securities account

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of you need patience, do actually honestly think they are just going to willing hand over the money to a bunch of apes. It will happen when it happens"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This shit is getting hilarious. Every morning huge gain into huge dip. You are witnessing the death throes of the hedgie.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Up vote the thread please :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is oddly the most Zen I have ever been about the stock market. Relax. Enjoy the short week. Set alerts. Don't obsess over every little up or down tick. Breathe. Await your time. Strike.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These guys keep trying to delay. They need more time to secure whatever funds they can so when this goes tits up they will still stay rich. Thats the only logical explanation for all the delay.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"# Alright, WE'LL GET 1 MORE!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Even with all the craziness somehow GME is the least risky play I see. Everything else just dying and gme just chillin like a cat on a couch watching bird videos.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GUYS ALL IT TAKES IS ONE MORE, JUST ONE MORE, WE ARE PUSHING UP AGAIN"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s gold in them thar hills
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone doesn't want those $200 calls to be ITM. The sales volume shows desperation sell offs every time we cross that line. I suspect this could be a catalyst if we can ever break through. But something tells me whoever is behind this has a lot of ammunition to keep us contained.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Stimmy shows up as a pre-paid Visa.*

Temporary constructs of a feeble ape intellect trying desperately to justify an existence that is without meaning or purpose. And all of them as artificial as GME itself, although only an ape mind could invent something as insipid as tendies. You must be able to see it, Mr. Ape. You must know it by now. You can't win. It's pointless to keep holding. Why, Mr. Ape? Why? Why do you persist?""

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys sideways trading is good for us. Brings down IV and helps option chains to form.

We need this for long whales to be able to use delta hedging for moon launch. Its ver clear longs are aiming for this. Even signalling their continued presence in opening and closing of the market, and only waking up if correction is needed. We will close close to where we opened the entire week. Im telling you. 

If you think ""big green"" is good and red is bad.... please understand that its not that simple. A big 40% spike in the green can actually delay the squeeze for us lol...you cant look at it as simple as ""we need it go up""

So many of you idiots are setting yourselves up for dissapointment and ""getting tired"" paperhanding because you're cheering the wrong things OR dont see good things happening because theyre different from what you expect.

HOLD! Even if it takes a year from now.

One wonders if Hwang was in the same bed with Citadel.

>Much of the leverage used by Hwang’s Archegos Capital Management was provided by banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG through swaps and so-called contracts-for-difference, according to people with direct knowledge of the deals. It means Archegos may never actually have owned most of the underlying securities -- if any at all.

If this whale tanked 7 ""in the money"" stocks covering his margin call, what were his losses in? Trading default swaps?  Perhaps giant leveraged derivative bets on a GME BK maybe?  Did WSB going long GME sink this guy in addition to Citadel?  What's the next shoe to drop?"

We need this for long whales to be able to use delta hedging for moon launch. Its ver clear longs are aiming for this. Even signalling their continued presence in opening and closing of the market, and only waking up if correction is needed. We will close close to where we opened the entire week. Im telling you.

If you think ""big green"" is good and red is bad.... please understand that its not that simple. A big 40% spike in the green can actually delay the squeeze for us lol...you cant look at it as simple as ""we need it go go up""

So many of you idiots are setting yourselves up for dissapointment and ""getting tired"" paperhanding because you're cheering the wrong things OR dont see good things happening because theyre different from what you expect.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">	GameStop's executive hiring spree continued on Tuesday, with the company adding a former Amazon.com executive and two alums of Chewy.
    
    Elliott Wilke will be GameStop's chief growth officer. GameStop (ticker: GME) said Wilke held a variety of senior roles at Amazon over the past seven years. He will start at GameStop on April 5.
    
    The company also brought on Andrea Wolfe to be its vice president of brand development and Tom Petersen for vice president of merchandising. Wolfe was previously vice president of marketing at Chewy (CHWY), while Petersen was a vice president of merchandising.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lots of folks hoping for a dip to buy in. But let explain something:

IF WE ARE UNDER $450/SHARE, WE ARE IN THE DIP!!!

If you're looking for motivation to buy, let this be that motivation for you. Just like real bananas, buy them before they ripen, or you might miss it, and end up with gross, overripe bananas.

I know my analogy is flawed, as GME is not, and never will be gross, but the analogy still stands."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Housing crashes and stock market crashes don't always go hand in hand. Actually, I think usually they don't. People just seem to associate the two since 2008 was the biggest economic crash since the Great Depression and it happened on the back of securitized mortgages.

2008 was fairly unique in that it was a market crash precipitated by housing speculation and a fraudulent housing market.

Houses are expensive now, but the housing market is very, very different from 2008. Mortgage lenders are still exercising discretion, buyers are more cautious, and the overall quality of existing mortgages is higher than in 2008. Millennials took the reins from Boomers as the largest generation, and they are mostly in their 30s now and starting to buy homes, creating a demand that outstrips supply, driving prices up.

What they are writing about in this article leading to a stock market crash might barely be a blip in your housing market, it might cause housing to stagnate for a bit, it might cause a housing crash, or it literally might not affect housing at all.

EDIT: I'd also note that housing is on a pretty predictable 18-year cycle, as far as investment fortune-telling goes. It isn't exact, but barring a huge economic event or global catastrophe, it's usually in that ballpark. The pandemic could have been a catalyst that set off a crash early, and it still might be, but it doesn't look like it at this point. We are still a few years ahead of the 18-year mark. If you see the beginning of the Great Recession as properly starting in 2006, we'd be due for a housing crash in 2024, but that can vary by a few years in either direction. If we hit a crash now, we'd be front-running the cycle by quite a bit, not that this can't happen, especially with how crazy things have been in the last year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The housing market is dummy nuts right now.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won’t happen in the same way. They aren’t dishing out loans like 2006 and there’s loads more regulation for the banks due to burned hands. 

Some places the market is collapsing (San Francisco and NYC etc) but firstly that’s always been expected due to insane prices and secondly more of a cultural thing as people don’t want to live in expensive shitholes just for work. Other areas are just going to benefit instead."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If I could find a wayyyy..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My guess is at some point last year they lobbied for more leverage with the banks because we were in the middle of the biggest bull run ever.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point but you have to remember that the western financial markets had MORE THAN A LITTLE leeway before the shit went down. Markets were still on record highs for days after the first couple cases began appearing in several countries in europe & usa states, while china was rocking 100k+. With everything that was known about the virus's long incubation period, people had plenty of time to short the shit out of the markets. I went out with large investments days before the crash hit because I was so caught up about the virus. I can't believe hedgies would be completely ignorant about what was happening in china at the time either."

Hordes of people were able to keep working, unaffected by the pandemic, and still consider buying homes while interest rates were at historic lows, and they got a few cash infusions along the way. I know my job wasn't affected, and I have a white collar job and work at home. During the pandemic my neighbor who does construction was still working and he installed a swimming pool and remodeled his entire backyard.  Most people were still working and still getting paid.

It isn't too hard to see why housing is going up. People were getting loans for sub 3%. If you were looking at houses for $400k at 4%, at 2.7% you can bump the price up to $470k and still have the same monthly mortgage payment."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Due to gov regulations It’s always been hard to develop and build housing in SF though which has  kept supply low and prices high.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, don't over-leverage, you stupid motherfucker."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This was a sketchy AF, formerly blacklisted dude jacked 5x to the tatas. Imagine the leverage on people with a"" clean"" record.... for now. We're all fucked cash gang FTW oh wait all my shit in the red and I never sell for a loss so looks like I'm going down with them when it happens."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a key point
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I submitted a post to wsb the other day reminding people about exactly this point and mods removed it in a flash, despite the post getting traction."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker lost all my monies. 

I invest all by myself, 30% gains 🤔"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But that always works out so well for all the people in the movies. Maybe they just need to find their soul mate, find their path in life, and bet it all on one last big game to get out from under their debt?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit 1.1 trillion in liquidity... fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pffft, zero concerns should be had. Between Papa JPOW and Mama Yellen things will be stable. There's always a few panicky big fish that think the sky is falling because of X but I don't see this being an issue with those two at the helm."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh gets political for this sub but 100% accurate. I'm cool with that 2nd half though, privatizing those items historically end up being beneficial to mid+ class and hurts lower class."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean that a rate hike will crash the housing market? It might. I doubt it would cause a severe crash though, but maybe a 15-20% that recovers over a few years. There are just so many people looking to buy homes now, and not  enough new construction. 

We might not see another housing crash like 2008 ever again in our lifetimes. If you were still employed and could get a loan, that was probably THE time to buy for generations (if you are talking about maximizing value for price). My buddy bought his house at the bottom of the market because he had a stable job in government. He paid 25% less for his bigger, nicer house in a much more desirable neighborhood than I paid for my house three years ago.

When I look at the monthly moving home sales average where I live, it is in the exact same range it has been in since 2009 started the recovery, whereas volume was WAY higher pre-2008.

I think what might tip things is a flood of foreclosures if a large amount of unemployed homeowners who have been delinquent since the recession started lose their homes when the moratorium ends.

That could put a lot of houses on the market and drive prices down.

But who the hell knows. Housing markets are also local. Some places never lose value, even in hte midst of a huge crash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait have people returned to variable rate loans?!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But aren’t the people with homes now locked into low interest rates? Or can they just change
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch! I don’t know how regular people make it out there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re on the seller side, if you have buyers, better hold their hand and prepare to be outbid."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow that last paragraph is my life exactly down to the penny. 469k, sub 3%, same mortgage, double the sq ft."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's no harder than other places in socal, and I know property owners that can't pay people to rent in SF (and previously rented for whatever price they wanted). There's also an insane amount of old properties and new builds."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*If I could reach the moon*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This hurts... Once you've committed to never selling when down mentality, you gotta accept you'll go down with the ship at some point"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is fuckery afoot. Everywhere. Your DD needs DD these days!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FedEx did it back in the day so why can’t we?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess that depends on your definition of stable.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought my house at the bottom of the '08 market crash, then lost it in the '17 Divorce.  Now I'm finally in a position to buy a new house and the market has gone insane.  I'm just going to wait this out and see what happens because I don't feel like having to decide on a house in 2 hours to submit an offer to find out one of the 20 other offers beat mine two days later."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rate hike vs 60 day loan locks...the 2.5% rate locks are expiring fast.  Housing prices will come down if the Fed doesn't inject that sausage into that juicy prime rate ass...

Demand is high, inventory low, building supplies are hit with shortages...it's a weird limbo market, if you need to buy you don't have a choice.  If you don't have to sell, you don't.  Rental properties can't move, cuz who wants to rent to someone who won't have to pay, and if you list with a non-owner occupier you won't sell.

This all goes away with the vaccination for covid...BUT... mortgage rates absolutely affect pricing.  2.5->3.5% is a big enough jump that it should drop prices a bit but inventory isn't going to jump either.  Should turn down the price heat a bit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Usually locked in for a couple years some may have variable rates to try to get better rates
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So freakin' lucky my wife and I bought our house last year right before Covid restrictions came down in March! Unbelievable. The sellers are probably kicking themselves right now for letting it go to us for the price that they did. I knew that they would feel uncertain about markets and be anxious to get it off their hands, and so we under bid their asking price and they met us in the middle. Now we have already seen $10k increase in equity in less than a year..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im on both. 😜 If you're buying go over market to the last comps. If you're selling, play hard ball. .
...

My team? That's gonna be money on both sides because you both probably need loans from them lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd give it alllll to apes......
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pineapple 🍍 for you. The moon wins in reply.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, it’s hard to tell. It’s a little like timing the stock market (though it’s more predictable than the stock market).

Might be you wait now and in a year everything dumps 20% and you hop in.

Might be you wait and in three years it only loses 15% in a crash, but in that time it gained 17%, and you still aren’t saving money.

It’s tough to predict. I bought my house in 2018 and it’s already up by almost 25%, but I bought then because I thought prices were getting high again and interest rates were historically low (they were) and would go back up (they didn’t, yet).

Still turned out to be a good purchase, but my reasoning turned out to be a little off. My area didn’t get back to pre-2008 prices again for ten years, so I basically bought at close to the 2008 peak, but after 10 years of inflation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd buy a house at today's prices, I just don't want to deal with such an insane seller's market.  It's stressful just thinking about it, and then you have that constant uncertainty if your offer does get selected that you offered too high and could have saved money.  When I bought my house in '08, I had 5 competing offers.  My sister just sold a house and she had 25 offers and it was on the market for 1 day.  I'll wait till things cool off for better or worse."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO about to explode
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"im kinda surprised by the weak price movement.  based on their projection for 2021, they have a forward pe of less than 10!

buying opportunity?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The funny thing several WSB daily threads didn’t even mention earnings release for today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Locked and loaded. Avg price 24.90 im not selling until im on the damn moon. Lets go bois.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Here we go now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$ASO🚂🚂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO just getting started with 10% today. If we can survive the lockout expiration tomorrow with minimal damage, Thursday ought to be fun"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder how u/Lcarn2949 's options are going, they went full retard yesterday and YOLO'ed their account. I hope they retire today, I bought a few contracts myself."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost 1 millions shares traded in the first hour.

11 million more shorts to go."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought in at 24.04 ridding this shit to the moon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm way down on my 30strike 4/16 calls bought  in at like 260 hoping this thing breaks 30 before then!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm highly irritated right now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"...was up 10% premarket and starts with +2% now?

Could they at least use some lotion? :("
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice boys well done!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like shorts might be losing control.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is everyone thinking this is a mid-long play, or is it just looking like an in and out today day trade ?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Here it comes.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,/u/aa13xx YOLO'd 100k of student loan money into them about three weeks ago. 4500 shares @ $24.16.  I wonder if they held through last week's dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seeing all of the same short tactics in play on this one. Ladder attack premarket to keep price from opening up 10%. Buy walls all throughout $25. RKT took a few days after blowing away earnings to squeeze. We will need to be patient.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great volume today though, already at the daily average.  Next few days should prove to be interesting"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,time to sell?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why yes it is. If you read the press release, you’ll notice that at the bottom in tiny letters it says “Shorts R Fuk”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Last that I saw was 37%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your fucking jacked to the tits, hope this works out well for the both of us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You holding over earnings call?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No idea.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"give it time, investors still want to hear the call at 10AM CST"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Price is already flying
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I walked in one yesterday, greeter said last two weeks busier than XMAS"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To all those in the threads throughout the week shit talking ASO, it’s up 10 percent so far today so I wish you a happy “fuck you”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They moved it up.  It was in apirl.

They knew it was going to be good.

Wanted to get it in before the shares unlocked.

Last chance to get cheap options."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens Thursday?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll let you know in about 5 min
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Loss porn so far bois!  This is the way!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in mid-long term. Tbh day trade is a bit riskier because lockup expires tomorrow. On the flip side, they did just crush earnings so it could moon"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Id be in and out the next few days
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,allow me to do an update post later
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ladder attacks aren't a thing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can see the 26.0 ask price with 72000 shares.   Then they disappear.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Next few days my ass.  Buy the rumor sell the news.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Narrator "" In fact it was not time to sell:"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MACD is still trending up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Any info on the lockup ending tomorrow? See my above comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TD is saying short interest was 45% as of 3/15 which absolutely fucking nuts
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just read that 70% lockup expires.... tomorrow. Anyone know about this? Thought about FOMOing in premarket and selling the rip but if there is a lockup ending tomorrow, then surely the shorts will just wait out the one day upwards momentum"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's Melvin capitals money anyway.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I may sell apirl calls if we get a good spike today.   Going to target 300% return from buy in yesterday.

Then if shorts get frisky tomorrow I will double down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you think we’ll see that continuously through the day?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Over$2 already
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Since they were categorized as essential every store I've been in has been packed. I think numbers are clear that its been not just the stores I've been in but all of the nation wide
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not a heavy hitter here, new to all of this bought a CC two weeks ago"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s also the reason it hasn’t exploded today
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably nothing. I just see Wednesday as a potential window for shorts to try to use to cover, but if ASO has good volume AND the price still doesn’t budge too much I think that will help solidify it in the high 20’s for the time being. Then again what the fuck do I know this market is irrational as shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think there's weekly options for a gamma squeeze, so Thursday will probably just be an indicator of where things go after the lock out. Hopefully it's mostly priced in with people anticipating the drop. If the price holds next week might have major movement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I only lose money anyways, why else would I be here?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They seem to have created a strong ceiling. Wish more people were buying in. Earnings report was amazing. Debt paid off. Over a billion in cash flow from ops. This thing should be $60.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Will ASO go higher or is it capped out near 26.50? Seems to have significant resistance here. Also potential share dump tomorrow from share unlocking.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wasnt time to sell lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lockup expiration will only hurt in the short term, if at all. It will make the stock more liquid and should help volume."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lock up expiration? PLTR PTSD incoming
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For SEC aso

In general, under Rule 144, as currently in effect, our affiliates or persons selling shares of our common stock on behalf of our affiliates, who have met the six month holding period for beneficial ownership of “restricted shares” of our common stock, are entitled to sell upon the expiration of the lock-up agreements described above, within any three-month period beginning 90 days after the date of this prospectus, a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think the whole 70% expires at one time, but would have to do more research."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,100% the earnings call is at 10am. Supposed to be more good news
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the truth,  it is not like up north.

Also camping equipment."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Market closed Friday too.  So we will have a long weekend and be happy or throwing the kid’s eggs around the neighborhood.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's what I said
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does lockup expiration eliminate potential for short squeeze? Shorts can just cover with the unlocked shares right? Unless nobody sells upon lockup.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the earnings was premarket? I may be wrong
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"theres also talks about entering cold weather markets, as of right now ASI is primarily in the south eastern region, heaving in TX, LA, AL, FL, GA, and TN.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oh lol yea i was agreeing with u
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,they released the numbers premarket but the actual conference call is at 10AM. There is more information to be released.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m really surprised that any fund that’s been watching this stock be manipulated all over the place would take a large bet from the house doing the manipulating that the stock would be any price.

Could it be interpreted as bullish in certain scenario? If the put is naked, someone is either pocketing premiums or buying GME at 175. Do I read it right? I'm new to options and I'm from EU so I can only learn options in theory."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So guys we are making sure we are gonna get some great loss porn right?

Now all we have to do is convince the guy who got all those puts to post here..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not necessarily a bet.  Evidence suggests that whales (both long and short) have been influencing the price through buying options to force MM to delta hedge in a desired direction.  Such a large OI of puts at a strike higher than the current price acts as a barrier of resistance, in the opposite way that call options act as ramps."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t someone also buy 30 mil of 12c not too long ago?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP is misleading or ignorant.

Does not state puts bought or sold.

States it was a bet today - on top of it being impossible for there to have been options volume already today, there was no (exceptionally minimum) volume on this strike for days. This play finalized a week ago. Has been discussed

They’re either hoping enough of you don’t know how to look these things up or need to watch some “how do options work” videos on YouTube.

Edit: sorry for the hijack.  Correcting Misinformation from any motivation, naive or otherwise, should be encouraged IMO. We cannot just have aggressive titles then leave out the literal important bits and change other bits. Mistakes happen. No need to be emotional. Do your dd.

I did when I started mine and RH fucking canceled it without saying anything as to why. Had to wait for it to clear first. Process took 2.5 weeks for me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone paid $75 to be able to sell it at $250 anytime between now and April 1st.
So they really only profit if it goes below $175 on expiry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's simple. When you buy an ""in the money"" put option a moneymaker needs to leverage your bet. You could basically see an ITM put as an alternative way to sell a 100 shares to keep the price down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s confusing about it 🤨
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Price has to drop 15$ for it start printing. And then it doesn't really print that fast because the premium was so high.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it on iBoRroWdeSK? Did it say when the shares will be used amd for what too?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had the cash and wrote the put naked, then yes it's a way to have a break even of $175. Gonna be on the hook at $250 but you got paid $75 to do so.

If you bought the put then your hoping for lower than 175 anytime between now and April 1st."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,After the board overhaul and with the shorts being dumped yesterday? What is your reasoning? All of retail sells after the news they have expected to come out for weeks?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s more than likely that this is bullish - put != bear, call != bull unless you’re taking about FDs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No it’s a put so to be ITM it needs to be below 250. Probably below 170ish to break even
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means you hold.

And snicker a little at someone who is going to undergo a serious wallet-vacuuming."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How about a reverse iron butterfly

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheap? Even 400c for April 9 are $4 premium.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,transfer will take a few days. Squeeze will take several weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so the stock is trading $185 let's call it. 
Right now someone agreed to sell it at $250 a share.
That's way over what it's worth right now right .
So to compensate they had to pay $75 to sell it at $250. 
So effectively that person only makes money when the price goes 250 (the strike)-75 (the premium)= below $175 (the break even)

So that was the person who bought the put. 

The other side of the transaction assuming they own no shares (naked)
They agree to buy the shares at $250 anytime between now and expiry. 
For agreeing to this, someone paid them $75. 

So let's say it goes to $300. 
Someone isn't going to let them buy at $250 when it's worth $300. So the option isn't exercised. The buyer loses that $75 premium they paid, the writer gets to keep it. No shares trade hands. 

If it goes to $100. 
The writer received the $75 we talked about originally but now receives gamestop at $250. Their effective breakeven is $175. 

The buyer of the put paid that $75 and got to sell their shares at $250. Despite the fact the stock is $100.
Shares do exchange hands in this scenerio. 

Hope that helps"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone paid 75$ x 100 shares (premium) for a put contract that gives them the right to sell 100 shares at 250$. They only profit if the stock goes below $175 however because 250-75=175. If the stock does not go below 175 by the date, this put contract will expire worthless."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's why the shorts are trying to keep us at the 180ish range right now.  By the end of the week they want to be able to push us below 175.

> GameStop Corp. said it has tapped Elliott Wilke, an Amazon.com Inc. executive, to be its chief growth officer, effective April 5, and hired two former Chewy Inc. executives. 

>The hiring comes after the videogame retailer recently added Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen to its board. Mr. Cohen had urged the company to shift away from its bricks-and-mortar centric business model and instead focus on e-commerce and other technology-driven operations. This month, the company's board tapped Mr. Cohen to lead a committee dedicated to transforming the retailer. 

>Mr. Wilke held various senior roles at Amazon, including in Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry. He will oversee growth strategies and marketing, focusing on customer loyalty and expanding the company's use of customer insights and metrics for marketing, GameStop said Tuesday. 

>The company said it hired Andrea Wolfe, who previously served as Chewy's vice president of marketing, as vice president of brand development, and Tom Petersen, previously Chewy's vice president of merchandising, for the same role at GameStop, both effective March 29.

I’m also stoked about Andrea Wolfe. The influx of Chewy employees is amazing for their digital e-commerce focus."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I were Amazon's Beff Jezos, I would consider a buyout merger.  If he could somehow get the same drive for Gamestop into Amazon, 30 bil in market cap bet would be easily recovered.  Assuming a buyout of around $400."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The market is wide open for a new-user friendly retail store in gaming PCs. If you don’t have a friend who knows PCs it’s so much work to learn everything you’d want to make a purchase comfortably. If GameStop could come along and make their UI less intimidating than places like NewEgg or Micro Center, so many people would shop there."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cohen is getting GameSpot's shit together so after the squeeze they have a legit company that will thrive and survive. If this would have squeezed in January everybody would be out by now and the company's hype would slowly die. This has at worst transformed into a growth stock.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there is any new peeps in here listen up.  news on a stock, any good movement of the board from experienced staff will garnish an increase in stock price, the fact that it shoots down so much is a so blatantly hedge funds shorting still.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. It’ll grow but at what cost? When I worked there my training covered more about coworker suicides than my actual task. That’s a fact.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is incredible news, could this be the actual chewification of GME? These execs are getting loaded left, right and centre on to the new development of e-commerce. Ryan Cohen ain't playin' Jim Cramer, you cuck!"

AND crushes their producers outbidding them/  burying them in bad reviews as soon as ""Amazon basics"" finds out their product is succesful... Is that where were headed? From the moon straight to hell? I mean if it's about growth as the dudes title describes he'll def be good at that... but Shamazons growth has been truely detrimental to literally everyone involved including themselves...Their own CEO had to step down because he was suck a greedy prick they couldnt continue being as succesful with him in the news... am I missing something?

How much success did Amazon have by focusing on books when there was hardly any competition? How is Gamestop going to become the 'Amazon of gaming' when there is tons of competition?

I realize there wasn't a lot of thought put into this in the first place considering you're comparing a company with a single focus to Amazon, so I could be asking a lot."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What can they do that amaZon can't tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, Amazon certainly cant get their gaming shit together as they've basically aborted their attempt."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but GameSpot is trying to become steam which is already the major player in the market, and unfortunately is not public. Steam is by far the best platform for digital game content and gme will never take that from them. 

They are not a good long term play. Only value is from hedges being dummies. After the ride is over, gme will eventually go back down to what it is worth."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The Amazon of Gaming"" already exists and it's called Steam, Epic, GoG etc. If it was so easy to create a one-for-all platform I'm sure one of these companies would have already achieved it in the past years. I seriously doubt that gamestop can do it now out of nowhere. Console games will also be moving to digital only so all there is left for gamestop to sell is accessories, consoles and merch.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I believe in the squeeze and I believe in a bullish future for gme but they definitely will never be the ""Amazon of gaming"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have they stated they want to be the Amazon of gaming? Not sure what they could bring to the table, there's plenty of places to buy gaming hardware. Amazon works because you can buy *everything* on it. Best Buy works because they have a wider focus on all kinds of tech from cameras to TVs to drones to gaming. Gamestop focuses only on gaming and specifically only console gaming. They ignore PC gaming which has exploded the last 12 months, even with new console launches. Idk. I'm not begging for them to go under but I don't know how they'll pivot to be relevant with a narrow focus in a dying market, especially once their stock frenzy dies down."

It seems interesting that if the media's crying about GME dying and being worthless was true, these kind of people would stay away from working there. Why would this guy leave a company like Amazon if GME really was a pennystock company grinding around 4$/stock? He could go to ANY other company and they'd welcome him with open arms. Why then go to gamestop? He sees value. He just might like the stock."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can bet your ass I'd support GME after the squeeze. I'd buy back in for a long position without a doubt.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But people have been calling GME a long term play and predicting these kinds of moves for months now. I understand that actually seeing it happen solidifies the belief but acquisitions of talented executives like this has been foretold for a while now and was expected to happen
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The long term play has always been the backstop. You can do no wrong by buying and holding because this company's future is so bright. In addition to that, there is the short squeeze situation which is a whole different animal."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is my thought exactly. GME could very well be the early days of Amazon again. Buy now and just hold em long term.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, for popular items, they'll merge listings for different sellers and give you one at random, so you might get a legit one and might get a fake one.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop has already expanded into pc gaming man. Have you not seen any of the news?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop USED to focus only on gaming and specifically only console gaming.

Maybe renting individual games with a digital code set to expire after a period of time, instead of having to sign up to ps now or gamepass for just one game. Try and get an exclusive deal to get demos going again for people to try (I really liked trying the ff7R demo and it made me want to get the game).           
Set up a game calendar so you can see what's coming out, and then click on it to see all released news/trailers for it and related games or games from the same developer, and customise the calendar so you can easily see which games you want and set reminders. 

Just try to make it a place that when you think of games, you think of them. Not about news or articles or reviews, only the actual games and the buying of games, and official news by the developers."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I reference to this, I went digging deeper after initially spreading news of the upcoming interview. It seems it is a private event available (possibly paid) to those with access to Bloomberg, but the claims in the initial post about the one in October don't line up, and there is no information other than the screenshots:

**Upon deeper digging I could find no public record of the 21 Oct 2020 interview referenced in the WSB post about a new Third Bridge interview tomorrow**


The OP's claim (see WSB link at the bottom) that that Oct 21 interview was where the Microsoft partnership was announced was incorrect, [as Gamestop released a press release on Oct 8.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)
Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any details please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So everyone has been talking about 'the mother of all short squeezes' since GME is (or was) oversold.

Except everyone who's in an oversold position has been playing a shell game for months trying to hide that fact.

If they actually did a share recall for voting purposes, you basically are yelling 'STOP' and all the shells stop moving, and you start flipping over to see which shells really have GME under them.

If you *know* you don't have enough GME shares to put one under each shell, there's going to be a mad scramble to get some by everyone who's been playing the shell game.

It appears that WAY more people are claiming to have GME shares than actually exist, even now."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think a lot of people will just take there profits and run. But every day that passes there will be more and more GME longs.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Plan?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No this dude came up with it first, back off"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just trust him bro, dude's gonna knock this out of the park with perfect timing."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks in general? 

No one ever can determine the true peak. I’m sure there are indicators that can point you in the right direction but I don’t know them. 

This is not the stock to be learning exit strategy’s though."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are playing with volatility that has potential for 10-100xing and you wanna ""find the peak"" I usually recommend giving yourself a conservative estimate and a liberal estimate. On the conservative estimate (for example 5x up in value from your average buy in) you sell half of it to cover your initial, and some decent profits, and every 20-30% it goes up you sell 10-20% more to cash in on more profits while simultaneously riding the wave and keep doing this until the whole thing crashes. If it hits your more liberal estimate of what the absolute peak should be, you sell everything.

You'll likely make way more money than if you sold everything early, and you'll likely not end up a bagholder from trying to find the absolute peak and missing completely. Not fun being stuck with worthless stocks that were once up 10000%, having secured some profit always makes it sting less if you mess up even though unrealized profits also suck to lose.

Obviously you make wayyyyyy more money if you manage to find the bottom and sell exactly at the top, but if that was easy..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume is the best indicator but it's not fool proof. Basically, volume starts falling as the price gets too far away from it's perceived ""actual"" value. If the trend is downwards, people are holding their cash and waiting to buy at the bottom, and if the trend is upwards, people stop buying and wait to sell at the peak. So at the peak you'll see a decrease in volume and a significant divergence from the volume weighted moving average. Then there will be a burst in volume as people start selling. 

Of course, there are many other factors at play and actually timing the peak is impossible for GME. Milton Berg has basically built his career on timing the market and his company has thousands of indicators that they track. Trying to do what he does but with just one crazy volatile stock would be insane. Here's a good video with him if you're interested. https://youtu.be/zmP_uiNeiZk"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's an exit strategy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s an exit strategy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No idea. Too much to be determined in the next couple months to put an accurate value right now. 

After the meeting in June everyone can start pricing the company more realistically. 

The real question is how long it takes us to get back there. This squeeze is going to affect the true value of the stock for quite a while i imagine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just pointing out DFVs apparent propheticness. His OG thesis was that GME was a good investment and that the bearish, GME going the way of blockbuster sentiment was wrong. The squeeze was just the cherry on top. 

Not trying to disgree with what you're saying tho, just saying holy shit the man was right. He was right about it all."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wrong. A company does not recall shares. That isn’t a thing. You as a shareholder can recall your lent shares before a shareholder vote. Or your broker can recall your lent shares if they vote on your behalf. There is no such thing as a company recalling shares.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was thinking of GME specifically as a start lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No problem man. All apes here together. All I know is that voting allows them to add 500 more shares which basically doubles the float. They can not do this until may 5th so it shouldn't affect the squeeze but we will see. Good luck in the markets!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of misinformation in your post
 
1.	While yes, Sherman had to fight an uphill battle to change the company, he doesn’t need the board’s approval. And short positions don’t prevent the CEO from making changes.
 
2.	Hestia Capital has a long position in GameStop, not a short position. Them owning about 3.3 million shares is how they were able to get a board member in the end.
 
3.	Kurt Wolf is their member on the board, and he has experience with technology companies. He is a strong advocate for the switch to e-commerce, which is why Hestia wanted a board member.

I did my research"

In connection with the Proposed Transaction involving Parent and the Company, Parent intends to file relevant materials with the SEC, including a proxy statement.

INVESTORS AND SECURITY HOLDERS AND OTHER INTERESTED PARTIES ARE URGED TO READ THE PROXY STATEMENT AND ANY OTHER RELEVANT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE FILED OR WILL BE FILED WITH THE SEC, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS OR SUPPLEMENTS TO THESE DOCUMENTS, CAREFULLY AND IN THEIR ENTIRETY WHEN THEY BECOME AVAILABLE BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PARENT, THE COMPANY, THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION AND RELATED MATTERS.

And here's the proxy statement

>HOUSTON, March 26th, 2021 – Microvast, a leading global provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty vehicles that recently announced a planned business combination with Tuscan Holdings Corp. (Nasdaq: THCB), today announced the intial delivery of battery systems to French bus manufacturer SAFRA in Albi, France. Microvast will provide SAFRA with three standard certified battery products for its full electric and hybrid buses, as well as for the refurbishment of the bus fleet over the next three years.

 

>Microvast collaborates with SAFRA to propel the electrification of French bus market

 

>Last October, Microvast was nominated as the battery supplier for the full-electric bus, hybrid bus, and the retrofit bus of the French bus OEM SAFRA. Under the framework supply agreement, Microvast will supply up to 2,000 battery packs from Microvast over three years, starting in March 2021.

 

>Key factors in the selection of Microvast were its standard and certified battery pack offerings that fulfill the technical requirements. The Microvast battery packs can be flexibly connected in serial and/or parallel to reach different voltage and energy levels.

 

>The high level of standardization and modularity can accommodate various project demands. Furthermore, Microvast battery packs are expected to be certified with ECE R100.2 by June 2021, so that the vehicle can conform to the ECE regulation.

 

>With the planned launch of SAFRA’s e-bus late this year, Microvast will further expand its footprint in the French e-bus market. Meanwhile, both parties are exploring further opportunities in the fuel cell bus and bus retrofit business. Since Microvast has the complete vertical integrated capability of battery design and production from material to turn-key solution, it can continuously upgrade its solutions by developing new high-performance cells to fit into the standard module and pack products."

Just tried to do a spread on Fidelity and it turns out you need $10k in that account to do any trades that will have the effect of creating a spread.

But this is my fuck-around account so I'm not planning on dumping $10k in here yet. I'm still too poor for that.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely impossible 😤

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad bot.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pls don't ghost me like that Carrie I'm too fragile
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, we've been hanging out like once a week for the entire pandemic in person or on zoom and then she just never replied to my last text 3 weeks ago 😭. It was sudden and unexpected."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I did twice and radio silence 😭 my only hope is she's literally posted nothing on any social media either so maybe she's just hunkering down for something.  Or she's dead... (I check news though for that every week 😬)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the plan anyway!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently that's a thing that exists. Sounds super boring.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Closing is on Thursday!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont use reddit so I’ll just post the note here for Carrie. 

Dear Carrie,

This is ~~your friend~~ u/rat_fucker_sam. This rope I bought and used was because of your mean words. Hope you’re happy that I’m gone.  Never change. 

With ~~love~~ *ambivalance*,

-u/rat_fucker_sam

Ps - ktos sucks 

Pss- buy soxl 

Psss- fuk your calls/puts

Pssss - bye"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is after it ripping up to 320 from 220. I was like bro... the fed is never letting the SnP go below 3k again. “No Parker it’s going to 150” 😒
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I had it in December /January
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had high fevers for 4 weeks until the test became available and since my friend is my doctor he fudged a few things to get me the test so I could tell him how the process goes. 

But then it was inconclusive because they waited too long, and when he reviewed the notes he just said “im not ordering a new one because you definitely have it and at this point it’ll be false” so I don’t know 100% but 99.9%

Edit: it was awful, I really thought I was dying"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it sucks. Already have had 6 quarantines from exposure this year but none of my kids caught it. I sort of thought they all got it from me and were asymptotic but maybe not
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a kid. He or she has a 99.999% chance of being ok.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Thanks. So many this year got it and seems to be as bad as when the flu hits. Honestly when it comes to kids I’d take this over stomach flu outbreaks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I live in the north pole so you’re the south bruh.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it’s been burning me for the past 2 weeks but i refuse to let go. I swear the minute i sell it’s going to reach 25 or something.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all got the cum trees tho?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I still have really high conviction it's why my dumbass didn't sell any in January except a few options, but honestly I bought in expecting to hold it for a couple years. It was being valued like legacy tech but has big potential in the world of IoT and EVs. But these apes rushed the process and are now bag holding and impatient. I don't know how many of them really understand what the company even does."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,exactly. except he only wants the tab so as soon as he got it he left the can on top of the cabinets so now I gotta get the ladder out to get up there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,On the contrary without gravity all tits will be up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Poor rats, I wouldn't wish that on anyone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t believe it. You hated mine and his friendship so you “took him out” 😭
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RH is just my gamble account. Between my husband and I we have 3 trading accounts so long term shit is in etrade
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RH gives my level 2 options. Apparently Fidelity knows I’m retarded and won’t give me access.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It had fallen to 20.08 when i put a market order in in Fidelity and it got 20.09 as my value :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets, which broker are you using?

True story."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he is bullish on semiconductors for the mid-term then he hasn’t been doing enough DD. There’s a reason why it’s having trouble right now with the likely possibility that it’ll get much worse. The next 6 month will basically decide if most of the tech sector will die or not. Worst part is that people are going to expect it to be resolved by May due to what is being said but realistically the needed remedy doesn’t usually come until July at the earliest.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That one. Gross. I had to aggressively clarify to my kids that he doesn’t represent this community when he was on tv.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did have those bonus points, but already lost them. It’s sad, really."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Today Timmy was cursing the Canadians!! True story.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You forgot the _ too right???? 👉👈🥺
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Noooooo!!!!! Change it back
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, yeah, with as volatile as they can be and the relative rarity of big *spikes* Pharma seems like a good industry to be a permabear in. I wonder what Martin would say about that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but no desktop app and reeeally shitty graphs! 😭😭

I may go back to RH for options and just manually input my positions into Fidelity to watch them with that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's ok, I can take it. It's obvious - the thread has spoken."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#☹️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d never. I tell them just get Reddit and talk to me there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you sent multiple text after that to see if they are okay? They could be really busy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I have a friend that legit disappears sometimes if she’s got major stuff going on. I dunno I don’t know your relationship but I wouldn’t take it seriously if nothings changed/happened. I’d give it a few weeks personally then call or reach out in a “I’m worried” way

I had a full blown phase, but the music never wore off."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I SHOULD buy 2 2022 🤔 and sell my SPCE shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried not being short?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the way you think!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm I used tda, and I kept refreshing it until they let me buy a few sometime around 10am, thats the main reason I got a good price was that I couldn't place an order until the dip had done dipped"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No I think with it in that eft it means something 🤔 it’s too unexplainable
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll PM you with more info.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,With me it would be the opposite. I would never know it’s a date until after. I am a champion at missing cues like these. For 9 long years my bff in school was in love with me. I never knew. She never said a word. Till 10 years after school when we met at a friend’s wedding. She chose that time to tell me how oblivious i was to her advances. I didn’t know what to say. I just said “it’s the pleasure of my lifetime that i can count her as my best friend”.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah you dove in too. Mine was a little further back but I had plugs and really long manic panic red hair

It’s been in the financial and economic news and largely ignored by retail for the past 3 weeks or so even though it’s the real reason why all your AMD, AAPL, SOXL and other positions have been tanking to shit. The bond yield curve wasn’t even the main factor for the QQQ crash to people who really know the semiconductor industry from the bottom up.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol something said to wait 😂 so nothing. might see how tomorrow goes. Still considering selling these blown up SPCE shares so I have at least 2 grand to play with. I’ll either average down everything at 22/23 or let it ride 🤔

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinky 🥴🥴🥴
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Because people should be doing their own damn DD

Perhaps I was somewhat unclear. I can understand your frustration with people who are used to being spoon fed information that they could find on their own. And I wasnt asking you to post it because I was too lazy to look it up, I was merely confused as to why it needed to be a private message.

>If I post it, it’ll probably cause people to overreact and sell off shit that aren’t actually related that I’m in right now that will get dragged down with it.

That being said, I don't think sharing it with this group of 10 to 20 people who some of which have had an interest in semiconductors for some time now, would cause a major sell off that would affect the rest of your investments. (or perhaps I'm wrong and u/richtofin115 is a much larger whale than I first thought) 🙂

In the end, whether you choose to share it or not doesn't matter; I will do my own research, not because I don't believe you, but because I take pride in my ability to make decisions with an open mind and not just agree with the most popular opinion (even though I have before, because it IS the path of least resistance, after all)"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work for a company that has incredibly strong ties to the automotive industry. Tomorrow’s infrastructure bill could be huge for EV. Here’s why:

The number one thing that is stopping electric vehicles from going mainstream is the charging stations. It’s pretty much a chicken and the egg scenario.

On one hand, you need charging stations to charge a car when you are on the road. However, these are very expensive for the OEMs. They recoup these costs by selling more EVs. But to sell an EV you need the charging stations.

Additionally, most OEMs tend to use their own proprietary plugs, adding to the complexity of this problem.

Thus, if we solve the problem of EV charging stations, we solve the problem for EVs going mainstream. I’ve been hearing that EV charging stations are a big part of tomorrow’s infrastructure deal."

But then they also spam GME headlines about new board members and stuff, as if they are investing in a regular, fairly-priced stock that will rally on good news.

It can't be both. You can't be betting on a short squeeze and also be betting on a fair valuation, as those two things are in conflict. I feel like most of these people don't even know what their goal is anymore."

Essentially, they would take two canoes, and lash them together one on top of another. Holes would be cut out for the head, arms and legs. Then they would put the criminal inside, with their head and limbs hanging out. They would then force feed milk and honey to the prisoner (to induce diarrhea) and smear honey on their faces and limbs. Then they would put the boats out on a calm lake in the hot sun. The insects would get attracted to the honey, and the diarrhea, and lay eggs. The insects, and larvae would then eat the prisoner alive.  Sources say, one of the prisoners took 17 days to die.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn’t look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated. 

Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market. 

Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos’ implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).

Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‘first day’ news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:

* “How Archegos’ $20 billion decision led to banks’ share prices tumbling”: CNBC;

* “What is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?” WSJ;

* “Archegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know”: Bloomberg;

* “Goldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call”: Bloomberg;

Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.  

Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.

Back to today’s markets: Ten-year yields have quietly climbed north of 1.7%. Maybe the inflation story will surface again"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do I have this right about the hedge fund domino-effect 

Market/ economic destruction might be unravelling. Here is how: (short term debt cycle & long term debt cycle)

Because of low interest rates funding investment with credit is very lucrative
-> 
hedgefunds get over-leveraged
-> 
Over-leveraged hedgefund get margin called.
They are forced to liquidate. Which means they sell a lot at once driving the price dratiscally down  (like seen in the blocktrades from our boy hwang)
-> 
This is bad if a lot of funds are over-leveraged. Because the total amount spend drives the market that is either paid by money or credit.

If you spend more someone else income increases. That means if someone spends less someone else’s income decreases. 

Credit is volatile.  if borrowers get margin called credit is wiped out. Credit wiped out equals less spending. 
-> 
Here you get a downward-spiral where one persons spending equals another persons income (over and over again) Less and Less spending will drive the market down."

My portfolio is down around 16% since I started investing in earnest this year, (after first GME boom) but I got an e-mail from Sofi, a broker I forgot I ever used, reminding me about an annual meeting for Carvana, a company it looks like I invested $10 in a year ago, likely to take advantage of some promo Sofi was running at the time. Well, like me Carvana is down about 20% for the month, but that $10 of stock has still grown 425% for the year. Rough times we're in, but patience, AND forgetfulness, pays off."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like the last 6 weeks decimated almost everyone. I sure as hell got rekt.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like you're the fucked one
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Name checks out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,me too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're really feeling that way, buy VOO or VIG or something. That shit doesn't go up much, but it does go up. More importantly, it doesn't go down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😩
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT crew is less annoying because at least the stock moves in some direction
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol ok, PLTR crew is annoying, right. Like there's no other annoying gang in here right now..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA hype train is done
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Work is fuk

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll be profitable soon (5 years minimum). Hang in there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have elected the way of pain
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats what this sub is about. It was never about buying and holding shares until you die. It wallstreetbets not wallstreetholdshares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn thats thicc lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We been making money shorting the rips on it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly yeah, i just wish payday is today so i can buy more 🥺"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you need the money, sell. Else keep holding and pray. That is what I am doing right now ($BB, $NOK, $PLTR, $GME Ape)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR doesn't have meme status anymore. If you want short term gains, I'd sell and look for a better play. Otherwise, buckle up for a slow growth back to $30+."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering the stock hasnt been around that long, you've probably had your shares less than a year. Sometimes u think its gonna be a short gain, but it's a long game instead.  If u can afford to hold, hold. If you need the cash or dont want to risk more and think it will keep going down, sell.  If it were me, I would hold at least a year, unless I was confident I could make back that 35% quickly making other moves (which I have done before).  But one time I was down on GPRO and seriously did not look once in 6 months, logged it and I was up 100%.  Try not to panic!  It's only money!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, PLTR is one my strongest conviction plays. Most tech is down anyway and there isn't really bad news. Apr 14 demo day is near so if you really wanna sell it's best to wait a little more"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell if your losing sleep over it.  Plenty of other stocks out there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would probably hold but it could take a year to recover

If you’re not diversified then maybe selll (70%+ all in pltr)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,S not even begun.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because Netflix makes show about space which brings awareness to space stocks

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,**GUH**
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are down 35% **so far**
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's volume.  A few people can skew the numbers.  If the volume is higher than normal then maybe a sign
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Photocopier?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know, my tech stocks are down more than 50% from ath"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agedlikemilk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because people have lost so much money in February and March there's no way for the bubble to pop now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because historically April has the best stock market returns.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Bought more under 10. Tenish seems to be the bottom resistance.

2021-03-30 13:11:59,wallstreetbets,"Trading Tools Not Financial Advice

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses too tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

Save a copy to your google drive and then there is only 2 inputs - Simply change the date (UK Format) to the 1st of what ever month we are in and change the Ticker (yellow boxes) everything else is auto

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow nice, thanks for this. I did see some articles on atr on trading view but didn't really understand it as it was too complicated

is the monthly atr reliable for day trading or should it be tighter?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I didn’t come here for “realistic expectations”.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks 👍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice thanks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,don't set stop losses
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I trade stocks not tools
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi no problem. If you day trade you would want to calculate the daily ATR to find out the average daily range. I am going to share a more comprehensive sheet I'm working on which will calculate Monthly, Weekly and Daily ATR"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am also an uneducated ape.

To make sure I understand: 

price going up + ATR increasing is bullish

price going down + ATR increasing is bearish

ATR decreasing/staying low is sideways?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. ATR is the average movement in the stock price over a given time frame. A daily ATR of 2% means the stock moves up or down by 2% on an average day. Therefore if you wanted to trade such a stock on a given day and was expecting a move from $2 to $3,  your probability of winning on that trade is very low because that would be a movement of 50%"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm just dumb but that makes no sense.

If I'm trying to day trade for a 50% return, why would I even bother spending a microsecond on recent past data? 

The only way you're making 50% in a day is being ahead of the game on some big positive (or I guess negative with puts) news for a company that sends its stock to the moon. How is ATR going to help you?

On the other hand, if you're taking a longer term approach, and you've got a stock slowly gaining and ATR increasing, you could be more than 50% sure that the volatility will continue upwards... no? And vice versa?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a hypothetical example you obv wouldn’t be expecting 50% in 1 day. ATR can increase regardless of stock increasing or decreasing it’s just a measure of the average % range the stock moves over a given time frame. It’s not an indicator to get bullish or bearish on a given stock. It’s a guide to the average expected movement in the stock over a given time frame

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you. I needed that. Seriously.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,John has a bunch of ties to huge companies throughout the world. BlackBerry is one of many mobility companies he courted during his Sybase run. He didn’t just lose those ties after he brokered the deal with SAP causing Sybase stock to rocket. The security technologies he has been pushing guarantee he’s been developing even further ties in the security community as well as the auto industry. I expect to see him broker a similar deal for BlackBerry merging with another company once the auto security tech takes off in the next couple years.

Steel has been doing well too, particularly $X recently FYI"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're specialty is deep water drilling, they just released a new safety system and are making efforts to be 'greener' also, my current focus is it's squeeze potential the volume it's been averaging is less than half it's usual volume and when compared to  70m+ shares that are shorted that's like twice the average volume and 4x the average it's been at for the last few weeks, it's been hard to borrow which I'm pretty sure means there's a lot of short volume that's still left uncovered."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It went to 4.70 last time they started covering, so, that's like ~47% increase from where it's at now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm very interesting. Any reason in your mind why it’s not a good medium term reopening play too? Either way you may have co cinched me to get some RIG!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a decent medium play too, I have a really small account and I'm kinda planning on funneling some profits from this into VIAC; the Upper monthly Bollinger has a price target ~$6.30 which is almost double where it's at, looking at recent historical data aside from the covid dip it has traded between where it's at now and low $7 range; I'm not trying to get too greedy and it's literally 99% of my portfolio, so, I personally plan on diversifying a bit after it runs up. My break even is aroun $3.60 so I think I'll start taking profits around $4.20 depending on how the price action is going at that point if/when we're there."

2021-03-30 09:10:26,wallstreetbets,"$ABCL Reports 1,908% Increase in Revenue (YOY) ; Peter Thiel, A Board of Director! **Long time lurker, first time DD post! Started my Trading career in Dec 2019 because of a moronic post here about $ACB and Coca Cola starting a CBD drink due to a video of a blind guy! We were true Autists back then!**

**ANYWAY...**

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company’s platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.


**PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**

https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors

“AbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what’s possible,” said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19 

https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-agreement-us-government-supply-300000-vials

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

**U.S. Halts Distribution of Lilly’s Bamlanivimab Monotherapy, Citing SARS-CoV-2 Variant Resistance**

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.genengnews.com/news/u-s-halts-distribution-of-lillys-bamlanivimab-monotherapy-citing-sars-cov-2-variant-resistance/amp/

But with the arrival of recent variants like the South African one and the UK variant, Bamlanivimab seems to no longer work effectively but AbCellera and Eli Lilly has found a solution to the problem. 



**ABCELLERA AND ELI LILLY SOLVES THE VARIANT ISSUE BY COMBINING BAMLANIVIMAB AND ETESEVIMAB**

https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lillys-bamlanivimab-and-etesevimab-together-reduced

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow, just realized their headquarters is 2 blocks away from me.  Thanks for this, I’m in!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I read between the lines, it looks to me that 91% of their revenues are from the covid lily deal (despite 103 contracts with others). Great for 2021, but what will happen when this is over?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Here’s the real DD: the CEO is a force of nature. Do not bet against this company unless you hate money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gonna need you to do a TLDR and might as well add some emojis at the end so I can really get the message
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent DD! Thanks for doing this. I kinda think I like the stock!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm this company does seem to have some really nice prospects with a solid cash position. 

I like the discount after earnings too, looks like prime time for some leaps 🤙🤙 To bad there aren’t further out expiry’s"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol q1 revenue from bmav should be reemphasized, projected revenue is min. 190 mil. 2020 yearly revenue was about 230mil, so q1 2021 will be about 1 years revenue. Bullish AF."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This one has been really sliding.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"sheesh, I nearly bought puts because of the DD walrus did.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The banana stand is down the street
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I’m in Van as well.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their hq is going to be much bigger in the future. They want to hit 500 employees in the next year, up to 1k in the next (7?) with their own manufacturing facilities in Vancouver."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There was a reason they IPO'd when they did. Good for everyone with stock options.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is because bamlanivimab is the first drug they co-developed that made it to market under the new revenue model (where Abcellera gets royalties). They have another 102 contracts at various stages.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't overlook the 71% growth in their up front payments from partners. Strip out the COVID-related revenue and that's still a huge YoY growth. With bamlanivimab sales not costing them any more money to get (ie: pure profit from this point out) and buffering their bottom line to tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. If your $100M revenue costs you $90M to get, that's great. Their $200M revenue expected in Q1 will cost them nothing. Then think what happens if any of their other 102 programs in the works gets to market too.

They said they have \~$800M in the bank and earned $0.52 per share last year. Point me in the direction of another biotech company that's profitable, has a compelling growth story, and has cash on hand equal to 8 years of operating costs. Can't believe this guy is flying so low under the radar.

Disclosure: Long $ABCL."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely great question! This was raised on the earnings call by an Analyst.

The answer they gave is somewhat vague but understandable in their current position. They said that with the publication of their capabilities of developing a world class Covid-19 Anti-body in such a short amount of time, it would be inevitable that they would get other big companies to collab with them in the future.

One such example is Regereron. The project they are currently working on is undisclosed and is said to have a massive impact on their balance sheet. At this stage as a new Public company, we can only believe the management that they fulfil their promises down the line.

One other point mentioned was that even with 100+ projects their teams were not utilised 100%. So, even $10 mil from each of their clients or collaborators can yield revenues in the range of $1 bil per year. Add to the list that they don't have much expenses and can therefore have a bigger net profit margin than any other pharmaceutical or Biotech company. 

As I mentioned earlier, my main factor in investing here is Peter Thiel. That man rescued my portfolio, so I have a big trust in him!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What do mean over? Rich countries arent even all vaccinated yet, the vaccines probably wont help for new variants so I think they will be busy the next five to ten years. 
Ps. I have no position or intention to buy now(AH and morning will spike immensely) but will keep my eye on this!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,True but they also IPO’ed at 20 just a few months back. The jump straight after IPO was probably not sustainable in the short term

2021-03-30 08:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Spy-When to Buy. This isn't financial advice and I am not responsible for you blowing up your account.

TL:DR: I am going to BUY end of Month APRIL call contracts after 1-2% drop from 4/1 open. YOLO Stim money. 

Rule one of forecasting:  

***PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T A INDICATOR OF FUTURE RESULTS.***

So you all saw the Graph telling you April is the best time to buy as it shows a 2% gain on average. While this is true what is left out is why April is higher. The reason April is higher is because it is were a lot of the bounce backs have occurred in April while March tends to suck.

I went and pulled all of Spy from 1993 to 2021 and this is what I found.

Spy mostly ends up back were it started between open and close but has large swings between days.

The months with the highest ratios being positive tends to be April and November for the data set as shown below.

https://imgur.com/a/ok7lAu1

As you can see from 1993 through 2020 April still had some red months but is it is mostly green dildos. 

Here is the actual Avg % gain between the first of the month and end of the month from 1993-2021 excluding outliers like the crash of 2020 in march and the recovery in April. Anything outside of -9% and 10% was an outlier.

https://imgur.com/a/H6EGgLS

Included is the avg % difference between the months lowest point and opening price for the month.

https://imgur.com/a/7xn5s9A

For the most part April stands a really good chance of being green but don't buy any options until SPY is below what ever it is going to be on 4/1 by 1-2% as current option contacts by the end of April have to move 1.5-2% for you to just break even. 

April tends to only increase by ~1.5% by close on 4/30.

 For you smooth brains this means you are likely fucked if you buy EOM contracts the first of the month. So wait for red day and then buy and enjoy the ride. 

If you time the lowest price in April the likely max price change you can get by the end of the month is 4% but there are years were it went up 8%.

This is what I am going to throw my stim money on and see what happens."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t spy going to take a shit when the market crashes ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY is typically always stable it's almost impossible to lose money on it if you hold. I typically trade SPY credit spreads when the market is STABLE.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Instructions unclear, wife's boyfriend still cummed inside her after I tried to time it to pull him out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct but it doesn’t tend to take a shit in April. It tends to do that latter. 

Only times April was negative was mostly back in the 2000-2003. 

As the feds have the money printer and the Congress is looking at adding another 3 trillion and another round of checks it likely won’t happen next month. 

April could trade sideways but never has it gone but a few dollars from were it started."

\- about 70% of people I've asked have said smth along the lines of ""I look for an expiry date i like with low enough IV across the board, then kinda just wing it on determining strike based on the break-even"" (for buying options) or ""I look across multiple expiry dates for really high IV to sell those options""

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said they use spreadsheets, build sensitivity tables, and/or monte carlo simulation scripts to find an optimal trade

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said ""literally just YOLO""

I'm building a tool that will automatically figure out the optimal strikes and maturities to buy/sell at, after you input your price target.

e.g. This is not my view but let's say hypothetically you think TSLA is worth $520,  with +/-$200 at 95% confidence interval .... what puts at what strike(s) should you consider buying to maximize ROI?""

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is retarded for sure
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What fuck is FSD?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy moly, the balls on this guy. I hope you make money on this but I'm expecting you to go broke."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is retarded for sure but also smart af. My TSLA PT for 2021 is 1200 EOY. By 2023, they would be done with much of their battery production goals from battery day, the cybertruck will be out, the semi will be in production, the India plant will be ready, new factories will be announced, Austin and berlin will be finished, berlin will offer some of the most modern manufacturing methods for the MY along with their paint shop, their new shanghai extension should be ready, dojo day later this year, etc. There are many reasons to be bullish for tesla over the next few years and you will have the added benefit of selling PMCCs once your calls hit a high enough delta. 

So basically, I have full confidence that you will be successful In this and I love you for being this ballsy. 

Positions: 106 Boomers shares and DCAing"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly it just looks smart to me. Maybe I spend too much time here. I was thinking about getting $900 calls for summer of this year myself simply because Elon tweeted that Tesla will be bigger than Apple in a few months, and because of the Toyota rumored partnership"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh no.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you need a couch, there is a landfill not far from here with a few nice ones!"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,grab some yota stocks for that merge 👀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So.... do you like having your heart ripped out of your chest when you open your broker app and find out that the stock plummeted 50%?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is retarded. All options are retarded. Market makers will always win as you are gifting them your expectation in advance. You are not really competing against the Big Boys: just against your fellow ape traders.

When you buy shares, they don’t know if the share actually exists and what will persuade you to sell them. Drives them mad. Now you really ARE competing against the Big Boys.

Starve the beast. Do not buy options."

Thank you OP.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy gets it. Love you too boo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is mainly a bet on FSD and Tesla being able to ""solve"" it - at least in the sense that many people will be willing to either fork out an extra $12-15k up front or pay the $199-ish monthly subscription - by Q3 2022. There's a chance they also get regulatory approval by then due to their fleet, they'll only need like a couple weeks to a month to get enough data to turn in. FSD is a fucking game changer, ppl don't think Tesla can do it (or are behind say Waymo lol) and I think they can do it, are about to do it, and are gonna make a shit-load of money off it. At the same time though Tesla will be growing at 80+% for back to back years and revenue and profit margins are about to rocket. FSD will be solved, Berlin, Texas and Shanghai will be killing it... I don't know what's going to happen but this also feels like a dip so I went for it.

As far as Elon’s deleted tweet though I bet that was a misplaced response to “when will FSD be level 5” or something like that. No chance Elon thinks the company will triple in three months imo. I clearly am on board with your options play though brotha, let’s gooo"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only sane post here. Tesla needs to grow 20x to be worth 400. 😂

this is a boomer thread do i write lol?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They called Einstein retarded...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would consolidate if I were you into one of them, like the $900 strike... keep 50% in dry powder - CASH - not TSLA shares - and average in to the $900c position every time you’re down 30-40% by adding another contract from the dry powder. Just seems easier to manage. 2 years is enough time... I would also cash out once you’re 100% on this YOLO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you know with that 250k you could have just kept it as margin on something super safe and sold weekly puts like 3% out of the money for tesla and made 10k per week at the current demand for puts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's got 50% more to go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty fucking retarded. So retarded that it may just work.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is in fact SO retarded that I’m honestly ashamed I was clearly not nearly retarded enough to think of this first
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right?  I don't understand how they could possibly go bankrupt at this point, but they might not have a much higher stock price than now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Elon can take us to mars, he can surely take us to the moon? So I predict Elon makes Tesla cars that can fly to the moon by 2023. This is a solid bet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing holding me back from doing this is being so close to transition to long term capital gains. Fuck.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the kind words and award. God bless you retard and Ill see you in your Space X roadster in the parking lot of the church of Papa Musk.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why no wait to buy those Leaps when Tsla is at the bottom.  I think it still has a way to drop.  These are going to hurt if it goes down to $500s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,regulatory approval? LOL what you smoking dude? they wont even allow manufacturers to replace side mirrors with cameras and you think they're gonna allow some dodgy car with software to drive itself?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> This is mainly a bet on FSD

Is someone going to tell them ?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be concerned about what happens when the EV credit sales dry up. That's been the only thing keeping em afloat for a while now

but yoyolo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They will grow 10x by 2029
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought that but I was also like there’s no way he’s betting that far into the future so I second guessed myself.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you forgot r/vegetagang
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Prob most helpful reply I’ve received. 🙌
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All’s I’ve been hearing is other car companies will be making more affordable and better electric cars too (because of European regulations or something) so TSLA is going to free fall in these coming years. 

Though, these are stock experts on the news so they may be wrong. Godspeed OP."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, another option is to buy good companies that are down 30% in three months right before they start killin it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy cocaine and buy more options? I like it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like this, first time I’ve made this type of move and picking a strike price is hard, so I decided to do like an upper and lower bound with focus on the middle type of deal"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve sold puts, and will in the future as well, I’m in the market for growth right now though not income"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He might get there lol. I think he's been selling stocks that plummeted to buy ones that held steady, which then plummeted. Rotating his money from one loss to another & missing all the bounces."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can only get so retarded that it turns into genius, it’s like a videogame where once you hit a certain negative number of stats it turns into 9999. And the physics of the universe is maths right? So, it’s entirely possible."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might still have some time, I just didn’t wanna wait"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was considering holding some back and waiting but I hate missing dips so I just did it to get it done. If it falls more I'm not concerned, the numbers will speak for themselves soon enough."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where have you been.
Tsla might as well be the gov’t for all the scrutiny they get = none.

That’s literally the last thing on earth I worry about is Uncle Sam crashing the party with oversight."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All in good time friend. And by “in good time” I mean in three weeks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right as credit sales dry the Shanghai Model Y starts ramping, then Berlin, the Y prints money

Edit: obviously though the 3 is what’s keeping them afloat, the Y is for those margins"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So $200 stock then by 2029.   They have all the possible growth already priced in.  They are valued more than the top 9 car companies combined while selling a fraction of the cars at barely a profit.  You would need insane growth and profitability to justify today’s existing price let alone any increase in valuation.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He went full retard. He is his own wife’s boyfriend.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This needs to be a thing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla isn’t just cars. Also the other car companies don’t have Papa Musk. I actually think this is a totally safe bet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love reading articles like that. I also love “Tesla is behind on fell self driving”, CNBC in general, business insider, TSLAQ, all that nonsense creates opportunities"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That range you selected won’t make a difference in terms of danger about worthless expiry until a couple months before they expire. So for the next 18 months or so you really only need to focus on one leveraged TSLA position ... managing 6 or 7 nearly identical positions is just a waste of time and complication in terms of averaging into a position..

Edit: you’ll thank yourself later if you just focus on the 850c position and dump everything else... remember keep enough dry powder! Reason: 850c is intrinsically $200 more valuable than the $1050 so as we near expiry it’s literally worth $20,000 more per contrast if you’re sitting on those 850’s. Do it right man!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the income is 4% per week (theoretically you'd end up with 750k if it lasted a whole year like this) I'd count it as growth. Good luck finding a stock to do that much weekly growth. On the other hand if those calls print, of boy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The wsb circle of life.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The catalysts over the next month, if rumors and internal hype are any gauge, seem pretty massive. 

“Probably in the next couple of months” is a big departure from the sandbagging stance Elon has taken over the past 1 - 1.5 years."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are an inspiration and a scholar. Thank you sir
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The run up it had today suggests you timed this perfect.

Also, if it runs up enough between now and Q3you can sell higher calls for the same expiration at a crazy high level.  The call you sold will be ore expensive than the one you bought even though the duration is longer on the bought calls.  That guarantees the profit and if you get it to expire between the strikes you keep the sold call money and sell/exercise the in the bought call.  

Best of luck!  Wish I had the capital to follow you.  I think this is risky as hell, but its a risk with a thesis and appropriate payoff for the risk."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, then explain how the insurance companies are going to act? 

and then: ""baby in road, car in other lane, what does the FSD do?"": A)kill occupants B) kill baby C) kill peeps in other car. What do YOU want it to do here? and then, subsequently, how do you deal with auto cars and manual driven cars on the same road? Will it always be the manual drivers fault? or did the FSD make some kind of decision that put itself there? 

Again, this slow rollout of FSD: is not a technology issue, its a litigation issue.

**NOTE**I cannot wait for FSD to be market wide, offers an opportunity to ditch the 2nd car in our family, not to mention my daughter and friends will be safer...etc. so i am not bashing the tech, just do not think this will be sorted in a year.**NOTE**"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m doing nothing but waiting now but I like the advice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until you get exercised at a fat loss of course. The plan is to hit these calls, sell enough to exercise the rest, then sell the wheel. Now isn’t the time for my money to generate income but it will be in a couple years"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sayin the FSD beta V9 that’s coming in a few weeks is in essence “feature complete.” They won’t be able to say that for a while but they’ll still be able to monetize it, it’s game over from there"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hugs and kisses :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’ll just make a law making it legal, immunity.
Literally where have you been?

Tsla already has killed people.
The gov’t wants this to happen.
FSD is coming whether it kills 1 person or a hundred.

You think USA’s top priority is saving lives you are the crazy one here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but on the other hand it's tesla you'd get stuck with on the puts, it'll probably go back up. I hope for your sake musk tweets out something spicy and the stock spikes again, that'd be some great anti-loss porn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This Toyota rumor lines up nicely with FSD becoming more valuable than the physical car. Look into some of Toyota’s recent releases about their new joint venture of Isuzu, it’s highly likely this is Tesla’s payment to get into the fiercely loyal market of Japan without the barrier of import duties.

Plus Toyota gets the clout associated with “taking steps to EV adoption”... lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So we think that insurance companies are going to bear the responsibility of the software and hardware? Could be. And no...I do not think the feds give a rats ass about lives, but attorneys do. And would you operate a vehicle without your control that could make you responsible without insurance coverage? So if we are assuming the law is to have insurance companies hold the bag, and customers are protected and tesla is immune to their mistakes...yea that all adds up. And that's how this guy's DD reads. So we just hope that the money that the underwriters stand to save by FSD incentifies the coverage of what amounts to the consumer beta tests...still think this is a more than 12 mo problem. 

I do need to see what came of the cases where the Tesla fucked up....but I am pretty sure the insurance and tesla hide behind that the driver is responsible. So just like a normal traffic accident. But true FSD means you do not need to be responsible...and that's the point I make."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like selling puts, like I’m gonna do it, but Step 3 of my plan for getting rich is to focus on capital appreciation before income generation. I’m not focusing on income until I have enough capital to make the income substantial"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wholemarsblog shitting on that rumor this AM. I'm doubting anything comes of it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People already are operating Tesla while asleep.
Your point is mute. It’s already happening. The world will adjust. 

Just like it did when the government told everyone they had to live inside, stay six feet apart, and put on a face diaper.

You have too much confidence in common sense, decency, laws, logic, all that jazz.

They’ll just put the standard boiler plate warning that ultimately the driver must remain alert and ready at all times, problem solved."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I totally get it. I only brought it up because put premium on tesla is bonkers and completely out of the norm compared to other tech stocks for options that are unlikely to come into the money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm doing something similar by putting part of my income towards shares, part of it to use for wheeling stocks, and part to straight-up YOLO on $CUM and $SEX FDs. I was about to buy a house but then learned about theta and decided to focus on that. I think I could live a modest life with 100k to use for writing options."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They shit on the idea of Tesla producing drive train / vehicle, but sounds like Tesla installing their software platform and infotainment is still in the realm of possibility IMO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess that's why they call it a casino. 

We both want the tech. I just think there are more hurtles. 

Time will tell. 

RemindMe! 360 days ""what happened with tesla autopilot"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fa sho, lots of opportunities, $250k in cash right now is not my best bet though"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i've seen a few fresh writeups of it this AM. Must be something of a solid rumor.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with both your points. I don't want to jump in or drag this out since y'all already hashed it out. I think the main thing to take away is if you consider u/AruiMD point, ""They’ll just put the standard boiler plate warning that ultimately  the driver must remain alert and ready at all times, problem solved.""

That's the main takeaway. Tesla will tag/sell it as FSD but have regulatory fail safes in place, i.e. having to touch the steering wheel to remain in FSD or what have you.

The multiple catalyst upcoming for this play and considering his price points, I think this could print. I did whence a bit at the calls above a grand but who knows at this point. Personally, I would have kept it under a thousand after considering this recent dip, then again not 3mo ago TSLA ATH was $900 so idk. I'll definitely be following this play and wish I had the means to make a similar one"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too.  I've been waiting patiently for $18.  That's where I feel this stock is a decent buy.  I intend to sell $18 strike puts for $2+ to get a cost average of $16.  That feels safe enough for my tolerance.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,karma points duh

You:

> its financials are BS but they keep promising positive EPS sometime in the future...

Me: All companies do

You're truly and honestly an idiot.  Alex Karp and PLTR aren't trying to make daytraders rich, they are trying to revolutionize their software which breaks down the barriers of departmental data siloing.  If you've ever worked for a company larger than Wendy's you'd know that this is an incredibly important and large hurdle to overcome.  That's what they do.  How will it make money?  Because every company over 200 people needs this.  Not everyone is a moron, some people actually understand that AI is the future and few players actually have the technical competence to integrate it into useful software.  PLTR may be one of the only players in this space in a decade and they already have military level clearance.  They are lightyears ahead of the competition and anyone who gets that doesn't care that last quarter they only made an adjusted $0.01 per share.  I'm sorry that it doesn't fit with your return schedule of 50% in 5 days yelling ""DIAMOND HANDS APES"" but PLTR is truly a rare elephant.  Also fuck you."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like GME a lot. Like I really love the stock. It goes up and down and then up again (that is when I buy!).
I also like it because it makes hedgehogs pp go dull and sends Djim Kreamers cholestrol levels through the roof.

However there is a solid case for RKT both in the short and long term. With how things are shaping up in the market recently.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s Cramer showing us his damn bottom teeth again waiting for someone to buy him some dip and put it right in there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pros got margin called and shit in pants. That’s not exactly taking control
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The ability to manipulate a stock every which way does not make you a pro. It makes you the problem. I'm here to fix that problem.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All your base are belong to us
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,WE ARE THE MARKET 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who’s Cramer?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If ""Pros"" can have their control taken by gas station employees making $300 contributions, we're they really ""Pros"" to begin with?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile, in the real world... the “pros” are having to close out billions of dollars worth of positions, tanking stock after stock, because of margin calls and changes in the IRS financial requirements now that the pandemic is being properly tackled. Whereas retail investors are returning to work, getting Biden bucks, receiving some necessary tax breaks, still buying, holding, and watching the price of their meme stocks steadily rising above their “professionally predicted price points”. 

L O FUCKING L"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately gets margin called
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO. Do they not know that we bought the fucking dip?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Loathesome creature. Be gone.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The Pros are taking back loss porn today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL!?

RETAIL IS HERE TO STAY! 🚀"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find this so ironic in light of the Archegos Capital melt down that just happened. This is what happens when 'the pros' take control, LOL."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally he acknowledge us as “pros”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is basically offensive to all five senses. 

Looks like a tool

Sounds like a fool

Appears to be covered in a thin veneer of gravy that would make him sticky

Probably smells like network producer dick which as you can imagine tastes like entitlement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Cramer puts ketchup on his eggs, he only uses the watery pre-ketchup at the top of the bottle"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking back control by leveraging yourself to the hilt and having your entire book liquidated, bringing down telecom and GS and MS prime brokerage."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer takes a shower with a raincoat on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just a stupid narrative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer has 'I BELIEVE IN YOU' written in big, bubble letters in his diary."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure what he means is that they've decided on a market manipulation strategy to best hurt retail
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol pros. They're your cunty older cousin that cheats at monopoly when nobody looks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So that was posted on Friday morning and a few hours later a 15 billion dollar hedge fund blew up because they leveraged themselves up to the eyeballs, losing a total of 80 billion for various investment banks, who all ran for the doors, trying to one up themselves who can throw the other one under the bus first.


Great to see normality is back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i love how they are trying to turn this into us versus them… they are us. get fucked.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer crams Krispy Kream creamers (say that fast 5 times)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He can control deez nutz
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So he's saying openly that there are groups of people that are so experienced at **controlling the stock market** that they're qualified as professionals at it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cramer makes me want to pull out his teeth and feed him steak
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"what does ""taking back control"" entail? getting your lunch eaten by retail and having to cry to mommy to get a bail out?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How does Jim Cramer still have a job?  Who wakes up in the morning and actually listens to what this clown has to say?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer the type of dude to close a drawer with his hips.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This sententious cunt is still pissed that the proles are doing something besides following his instructions.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are giant block sales what ‘taking back control’ looks like?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So “pros” are losing billions and that means “taking back control”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Cramer, he’s a fraud and a hack, I am still waiting for one of his “predictions” to come true. I have not seen anyone in this business who is wrong 100% of the time, never ever right, about anything."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This mofo is so far up Citadel's ass if Ken Griffin sneezes you can see the top of Cramer's head in Ken's mouth. 

Griffin has Cramer spouting all manner of bullshit on command.  If Cramer refuses (Which he doesn't want to refuse anyway), Cramer's TV career goes poof.  Cramer will say whatever K.G. instructs him to say.  

If these Hedgie mofos had control, the stock would be 50-80 per share and bloody stay there.  Control my eye!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The class warfare is so naked and brazen. Might as well read ""Nobles take back control from pesky serfs""."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did this article come out after Bill Hwang torched his fund? Because that would be peak Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And hedgies get margin called now who has money in stonks lol.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t that statement a proof he’s actually working against the retailers ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, I'm just gonna say it. This Cramer guy is not a very good person.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the picture, he’s actually grunting in code. Low key.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a damn scary headline. Taking anything away from retail investors should be a headline they dont want to make a positive. Just shows you how blatant it is nowadays
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dwight taught me showing your teeth is a sign of submission for apes. WE ARE WINNING! 💪🦍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It for sure looks like the Pros are back in control... taking massive risks and crashing the market with bets on companies like Chinese Education Technology and Discovery Communications...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet Cramer haven't shat a solid dukie, since January."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this even mean? The margin call absolutely cucked investment banks but all the people that bought gamestop below $50 when he told us to sell are up 300%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ENTIRE MARKET:BLOOD RED

PROFESSIONAL TRADERS: this is what we call a pro gamer move😎😎😎"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys realize that Cramer thrives from attention and publicity. And that when he thrives, the narrative he promotes gets strengthened.  


Lose the obsession with this guy. He's become irrelevant. Don't make him relevant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Statements like this really do make me legitimately angry. How is this whole ""attack the little guys"" approach to everything not being completely rejected and denounced by at least most of the THREE HUNDRED MILLION ""little guys"" in this country??? The way we have let all the money funnel upward for so long makes me sick. There are so many people that do everything they can to jack up their own best interests, only making it worse for any of us who try to do something to try to help ourselves and/or fight back with whatever limited options we have to do so.

Every single person that isn't considered a ""Pro"" or whatever else should be appalled by stuff like this, whether they've ever traded stocks or not. Hell, this kind of thing should even anger some of the ""Pros"" themselves if they actually care about things being un-American and undemocratic. Then again, I guess that's to be expected in an oligarchy.

P.S. Just for the record, I'd have used the term ""middle class"" instead of ""little guys"" if we still had one."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya it really takes a PRO to fk things up as much as they have.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The Pros"" LMAO they aren't exactly good at doing their job if they lost control to begin with. Retards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I feel like Cramer is to us what Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton are to a lot of other people. Is there some reason to pay attention to this guy other than that he's famous?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So he admits we are in control. First step is to always admit you have a problem.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer? Skinny guy, looks like Gabe? Yeah I banged him"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did he do an extra-big line before delivering that quote?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All this tells me is that the Hedgies have now become the retail investors 😂😂, and we’ve become the pros!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did he recommend any stocks? Need to know so I can short
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He’s right, I’m taking over with my 5 shares. GTFO"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,“Pros taking control” then proceeds to get margin called like a bitch and dumped in the gutter
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are they! Fan-fucking-tastic 🤩
Thank Jesus these wrinkly big brain savants are saving all of us smoothed brain apes from ourselves. 

OH THANK YOU LORD!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just want to poke his eyes out with a stick.  Oh yeah, and imagine him sitting in front of the bathroom mirror dying his beard.  He probably dyes his pubes, too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He meant, that retail traders are becoming the pros now. It is a bit of a typo in the headline."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Reddit should troll him on his CNBC show by buying advertising time. 🤣😜
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,retail DAY traders? that's not us guys

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t 2 hedge funds just go bankrupt? 😂 *troll music intensifies*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer's sunken eyes are the result of him wishing he was Kramer on Seinfeld for 3 decades

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He high from too much crayons?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This headline is so cryptic!  The assertion of ""Pros taking back control from retail"" is akin to declaring that hedge funds are exclusively AGAINST investments for the betterment of anything!  Naturally, retailers always believe in something and go long that investment, so they put money into something to see it succeed. If pros are taking the exact opposite, how can Congress see this power as legal? These so-called ""pros"" want everything to fail.....how is this good for America??"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is that kid in school who reminded the teacher to collect homework.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's that word they like so much again.

Control.  Its always been about their control.  None of this is new. Now that we are taking our control back, they want to quash us.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He needs a speedball sandwich 🥪 Cramer looks a little TIRED! 🤔😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Watched this dingus fly off the handle in that YouTube video earlier today predating the 2008 shenanigans. No respect for him whatsoever. I reckon he does do all those horrible things people say he does.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly Jim, wtf is a ""pro""?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on lube!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is the kind of kid who can't seem to get that square peg to fit in the round hole. ...No matter how hard he tries.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer does that mean more margin calls?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guys... we're pros now!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It means massive sell offs because if you don’t want to play by their rules they’re just taking the ball and going home.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh.. The Habsburg jaw.. The sign of inbreeding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Next from Cramer - how it’s retail’s fault that the market crashed. They forced bankruptcy upon major HF’s and ruined the market for retail investors not invested in GME who were just trying to make an honest buck.

It’s amazing how anyone could see this situation and twist it to where GME investors are the bad guys."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Cramer, WE'RE NOT FUCKING LEAVING"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last I checked the pros are ex-criminals that lose billions while retail has most of their money in GME.

Retail keeps buying GME while pros are buying ViacomCBS and Discovery.

Retail keeps buying GME while pros keep shorting GME.

Retail owns the GME float and pros are failing to deliver.

Ape going to moon, pros staying on Earth.

Headline doesn't make sense.

Brb .. buying more GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes Cramer, the Professional Market Manipulators and Professional inside traders versus those simply buying and holding a stock.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure don’t look like it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets," It's pretty startling how no other financial themed organization tried to get in on WSBs charitable movement. I'm not sure how many more nails we can put in this coffin. All the money that is being spent on articles claiming their sham is in one piece doesn't seem to be fooling anyone, or making us care about their plight. Talk all they want about who's after who, but no body is going to cry after all the garbage they've pulled."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer would be a cheater in CS:GO!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer turns off the n64 while he’s ahead and had a blue shell chasing him right before the finish and says he won.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering if there was any implications for him after that video leaked? Anyone knows?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This article headline is clickbait specifically targeting WSB. It functions by challenging the fragile egos of WSB. Clearly it worked since you idiots posted it and upvoted it to the front page. I’m sure CNBC loves your ad revenue, especially as you morons laugh at them for being so ‘dumb and out of touch’."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Deliberately shitting pants = power move
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing is that there is a bigger audience in retail buyers than the 1%.  For him to rally for the 1% tells you a lot about how deep they are in his pocket.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They aren't pros, they're cons"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">I'm here to fix that problem.

The market is fucked and has always been fucked, but stuff like this is cringy. You aren't some hero taking back control from the 1% by buying 10 GME shares. If anything, you're helping them, at tiny, tiny level.

Hedge funds and 1% investors own like 85% of gamestop, so when you spend all your time pumping it on WSB and getting new traders to buy in, you're doing exactly what they want you to do. Which, as depressing as it is, lends credence to Cramer's point.

The fact that they've convinced you that you're hurting them, as you work for them for free, is legitimately one of the most amazing moves I've ever seen the hedge funds pull off."

Since last week Jim Snake Cramer had started this narrative of ""young investors"" are leaving the scene, based on nothing and something that he totally pulled off his ass. (if by young he means retards, wasn't that fuckface Gabe Melvin too young when he started his shady business?)

Now delusional Cramer is carrying on with his fairytale, we have left, and the pro is taking over.

I guess he managed to block almost every one on twitter, and after receiving no more messages he concluded that we left."

Retail colludes to get a movement going, and other HF and big money are 100% jumping in on the ""dumb money"" wave buying shares and calls and forcing a move in the market.

History has shown that a lot of them especially the ones in control don’t care about people’s money so no, they are not level headed or invest on peoples best interest, they are greedy and reckless because they either with big or go home, it’s a rigged casino and if they win they take it to themselves, if they lose they have reserves hidden and still be rich."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, roped me in to this"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay... you are taking this way to literally. I know a few people that are in the 1%, albeit closer to the 30-50M mark not the B mark. They're mostly normal people like anyone else, but they either were born into it or made some really nice moves in business and sold their companies. I don't want anything bad to happen to these folks. I think most of them know they didn't earn every dollar they have, even though they tell themselves they did. It's all just the bs people tell themselves to sleep at night and get through life. There are absolutely some members of that group though who are just greedy - and their time to pay the piper is happening now. Am I doing this alone? No. But as a group of investors and small fund managers, many of these people have fallen and will continue to leverage and fall. A new 1% will rise up in their place, and the hope is if enough of them fall, they start to learn some lessons as the rules change. This is a movement, and the 1% has lost control many times in the past and will continue to do so. They're humans and they're not showing signs at improving under the same system - thus history repeats itself."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The spilled hot coffee lawsuit was justified. Any coffee hot enough to FUSE LABIA TOGETHER is too fucking hot. Plus the original person wanted to settle with McD for just the medical costs and McD said no.

It's been an open secret on Street that there are a couple funds quite literally trapped in their GME short positions- unable to escape due to lack of liquidity and available shares.  They are content bleeding out through interest and praying that WSB sniffs out something else to let the price collapse because the unrealized losses are more than they can afford.

&#x200B;

They are a time bomb on the entire market.  The reason this sub has been so preachy about ""time being our weapon"" is because they lack an escape hatch at this price point and will incur bankruptcy level losses.  Their positions are simply untenable.  GME was supposed to get delisted at the end of all this, it was a slam dunk play.  Everyone on Wall Street signed on for the free short tendies, some of them naked, and went back to watching homeless people fight.

Some of their short positions began when GME was a single digit price, they will go to great lengths to avoid eating a big fat retail dick - and we have certainly seen that with our own eyes."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What a load of horseshit. PR to stop retail traders. Archegos shows it is the over leveraged hedge funds that pose the risk. What is needed is more oversight of hedge funds. Start with an audit of their books and see if what they reported is their actual positions on a certain day and whether their trading was on the market or off the market under the table.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If retail traders pose a systemic risk to the financial system then the financial system is already fucked and being kept aloft artificially.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  And add that anyone who said it or believed it should never be allowed anywhere near a financial market again.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Retail traders pose a systemic risk to rich people. They're used to having no competition, and bending financial rules to fit their own needs.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They unironically treat us like children with things like stopping our purchasing power and telling us how to buy and sell. It is weird.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know about you but if i had even 1 billion dollars I'd be content for the rest of my life and my family would be too for about 100 generations. Never mind that i'd be content looong before i even got to 1 billion anyways. A couple mil so i can comfortably enjoy the rest of my life without working and im set. Meanwhile these greedy pieces of human shit go 5x leverage on 16 billion dollars because they can never have enough. They'll never be satisfied until they have every dollar and everyone else is dying in the streets. 

But yea, we're the problem. The idiots who make a couple bucks and donate it to apes as a meme or put the money back into the economy while improving our lives and the lives of people close to us."

Fucking laughable that the mainstreams have been trying to fabricate this imaginary narrative that retail traders buying and holding positions with their own cash has any effect on market health.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"very well said. It's crazy I have a lot of ""smart"" friends or family who just ignore this or pretend everything is fine and that GME going up is just a magical thing with nothing behind it. I mean yeah.... I sound like a conspiracy nut sometimes explaining it but a lot of it boils down to just blankley trusting the market or not. It's like..... do you not remember 2008? And all these other financial crashes. Walstreet and big money have lied before you think they just all of a sudden stopped? REALLY? Now whose being fucking naïve. I mean hell.... had a buddy link me a fucking CNBC article the other day. I have seen with my own eyes CNBC blatantly lie about GME this entire time. It doesn't take that much research to see this thing.

So fuck it. I might sound crazy at times but this whole thing just seems plain as day to me. Yes....... it helps GME is actually transitioning into a real company again. Yes this has gone on a lot longer than I expected. But I personally vastly underestimated Big monies power to manipulate the market. But I am here for when it comes crashing down on top of them and await the payout. I will not rub it in the face of those who didn't invest I can see why. But I will no longer feel guilty about not telling people and them missing out on the gains. In my eyes.... they have had their chances it's not my fault they too naïve to see what's right in front of their faces."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the difference between being a customer and being a client. Unless you have megabucks you're just a faceless customer. You are guaranteed a basic pedestrian level of service and nothing is assumed about your knowledge level, risk appetite or activity. They lump you in with the huge basket of other customers who all have different understanding, risk appetites and goals, but who do not offer enough in trading commission to warrant any further attention or service. Because they want to focus resources on the megabucks, you are treated as the lowest common denominator in that basket, ie someone with no experience investing who needs handholding and protecting from their own actions. Any wild or non-conformative action from this bucket of traders is seen as risky, volatile, not considered or thought through, you must be throwing your money away on wild impulse - if it is seen as a conscious play there must be a ringleader with institutional experience 
or a wannabe out with ill intent trying to 'stir up trouble'. You can't take large risks with your own money without being vilified or belittled due to stereotypes about the motivations and experience of retail investors.

If you're a client bringing millions to the firm per year, you are treated as an intelligent, rational and measured human being, regardless of your past wire fraud. Managers at the firm will support your extremely leveraged position and meet with you to discuss options and strategies. You are assumed to be a good actor who makes reasonable decisions and can be trusted with billions in loaned capital, even if the compliance department barred the firm from taking him on as a client for years because you were too much of a risk."

Got kicked out of his house for wanting privacy in the room I paid 1 bedroom apartment levels of rent.

The fact that she had paid back the full amount borrowed, plus some of the interest factored in, but assuming the ruling survives appeal, there's beginning to be precedence."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, in most circumstances, that student debt is rarely dismissed in a bankruptcy case in the US.  However, there are potential legal arguments (only occasionally applied to date) that, if embraced more by liberally construing judges, could open that up to broader relief even without statutory change.

TL;DR: fuck the system, it needs to change one way or the other.  Also try not to go bankrupt with student debt for the foreseeable future."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're right...I seem to remember student loans being on the short list of debts that are not discharged in bankruptcy (unlike mortgages.) That shit will stick with you forever. Like herpes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What European country doesn't buy vaccines?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I am aware, but we also live in a world where saying ""I am self taught at a library"" will rarely get you as far as having a degree from an accredited institution unless you have solid documentation of work you have done yourself. Even then, I still think people should be able to receive higher education even if not directly tied to a career. I believe that an educated populace is a strong populace."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dunno, i think those are quite universal and standard the problem is previous generations took it to a whole different and unsustainable level."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is also the issue of increased global competition. The 1950’s-70’s were really good for Americans because Europe was still rebuilding after ww2 and Asia wasn’t a huge player yet on the global scene. Quite a bit of manufacturing was still in the US. Not so much anymore.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So I want to make sure I understand. She fully paid off her *principal* on the loan and was trying to get the *interest* (etc) cancelled with her bankruptcy? That makes more sense than someone who only put maybe 5k towards their 50k principal.

I didn't see anything on whether it was allocated as interest or principle, but I would expect that it would be a combination of both principle and interest because in my experience that's how payments on loans are generally allocated; you're set up to pay a combination of interest and principle to streatch the payments out farther."

I thought I understood this and now I’m concerned I don’t."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the problem was he never sold out (tax loss harvested) in December... Had he zeroed everything out in December he wouldve been fine

He was likely sitting on large, unrealized losses which got realized in 2021, but you can't retroactively to take those losses..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I might be wrong, it’s been a while since I dealt with this crap but I believe futures are the only security where wash sale rules don’t apply, so don’t try to get cute with mixing stocks and options or mixing account types (e.g. taxable and IRA) to get around wash sale rules"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this article meant to be a scare tactic? Or can this actually happen?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Happens more than u think
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This article is misleading because he did it in different years, which triggered his unique tax situation. If it was all in the same year, he would be fine and just pay taxes on his 45K gains."

I buy 1 share @5$
Sell it @3$ (2$ loss)
Rebuy @4$ 
Sell @5$ 

This leaves me at a 1$ loss right? So what does wash rule say i have lost/gained. Forgive me retardness but never something ive had to worry about"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What if that money was in a Roth IRA like I have isn’t their no tax implications if you leave it in for at least 5 years does anybody know the answer to that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please correct me if I'm wrong but wouldn't this only apply if you hold shares through the end of year? If he sold all his positions in December, the wash sale losses should be realized in the same year."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Always look for loopholes...legal approach to circumvent the wash sale and reduce taxes 

>	Let’s say you own an exchange-traded fund (ETF) that is closely correlated to the S&P 500® Index and you end up selling that ETF at a loss. You could then use the proceeds from that sale to purchase a different ETF (or multiple ETFs) with similar but not identical assets, such as an ETF that tracks the Russell 1000® Index. By doing this you are able to take a loss on your current year tax return and still remain in the market with about the same asset allocation in your portfolio."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what if you sell a stock, but then buy an option? ... asking for an ape"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The comment section shows no one understand how this works
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I legit panicked because I haven’t done my taxes yet, and this sounded exactly like what I did last year (but $21k starting, $270k in TOTAL gains, -$3k net not including wash)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought the wash sale balances out in the end? As in it only actually matters if you are trying to make moves near the end of the year.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fun fact wash sales are only for losses... Uncle Sam wants his profit on all day trades even if you are still holding a similar security at end of year

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about options and wash sales? Since these expire and aren’t a stock, wouldn’t wash sales not apply?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically it's a tax rule that says any similar trades you do on a security 30 days before or 30 days after get rolled into one ""wash sale"". 

One way you can get a tax bill like that, is if you closed at a loss in December, then in January, reopened that same or similar similar position ( this triggering the 30-day wash rule) meaning that loss you had last year, just got rolled into that purchase you made in January. 

Becareful of that 30-day rule. This mainly affects open positions end of year or January of next year. Close out your positions, and wait atleast 30days before you take a new positions to avoid this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he just rolled his gains into the next year without selling them as others mentioned. I traded like an ape last year but sold all before the end of the year. Had a bunch of wash sales but didn't pay much or any capital gains because of previous rollover year losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Timely article.... damn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To sum it up, if you’re scared this will happen to you; sell any stock if you’ve been moving in and out of last week of December. This guy didn’t do that so the differed losses accumulated were rolled into the following years taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow.  Dude got wrecked by the wash sale rule.  He had to have had all his profits booked, but none of his losses.  Imagine starting an account with $30k and having millions of dollars of profit booked, but really only have $45k, and all those millions are getting taxed because you didn't wait 30 days when leaving a losing position before buying back in.  Should have sold out all his positions in December."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so the TLDR is that this is clickbait. The bottom line is that if you sell any position and wait 30 days you will be taxed accordingly. Just do it before December, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like if this guy had sold all his stock before the end of the year, he would have been ok, even with the wash sale rules, as the cost/losses are rolled forward into the cost basis of the next purchase."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I understand this correctly, you have to wait 31 days from the initial investment to exit your position for a loss if you want it to be deducted?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kek. The wash sale rule is basically a ""this exists so you don't fucking money launder you little shit"" rule. Selling securities with an intent to generate a loss, to lower tax liability and then buying that back later is basically money laundering and tax evasion. If you engage in this shit, and get fucked by a magnitude order diff tax bill, that's the IRS basically going ""I fucking told you it was a bad idea but you didn't listen, well buckle up cowboy and bite the sheets."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Simple math for apes. 

Sell and repurchase same stock less then 30 days = no loss claim for you and you owe IRS

Sell and wait 30 day to repurchase same stock = loss claim for you and you owe IRS less

Al capone-ape wish he had paid IRS"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This man’s commitment to loss porn is astounding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What in the actual fuck is this?!?!?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So even with wash sales, if you go all cash the last 2 weeks of the year you should be safe, right? The risk is just having a loss carry into the next year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was his 60K job that tripped this dude up

if he had not had that 60k job he could have easily claimed he did daytrading for living and gotten Trader Tax Status.  Then wash rules would not have applied"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Electing mark-to-market accounting fixes this (Section 475(F)).  Sounds like he qualifies for trader tax status with that amount of trades.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why it's easier and more straightforward to not have gains and just claim the losses ($3k a year) for however long.

...but if you ever sell for a loss, the IRS doesnt care and looks the other way. So if you daytrade for 10k in profits but lose 5k in profits...the IRS still thinks you made 10k."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why 💎🙌🏼💎🙌🏼 are important. They can’t tax what you don’t sell.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is 1 time that being a Canadian works out. Investing income and losses can be classed as regular income and all losses deducted from gains so you only get taxed on the Net Gain. But we pay double the taxes and everything cost more. (Except Healthcare.  See note about double taxes)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think i remember seeing something like this posted a while back. ..

&#x200B;

edit- it was either in here or on the tax subreddit. but i swear i saw someone post their 1099-xxxxx with this on it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you trade up to 2 mill a day :/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems needlessly convoluted.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, the article called for more regulations on retail traders. We will be safe soon!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I recommend to read again. Or - even better - read outside of Reddit about Wash Sale Rule from the IRS and then take a deep reflection on your personal trading behavior.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"assuming I understand it correctly.

You buy $100 stock. it goes up $5 you sell it (gain $105 Minus your cost of $100) you pay tax on $5

Simple enough.

You buy and sell the same stock constantly. you gain $5 10 times and lose $5 10 times. mathematically you are even but because of this literal bullshit rule each of those $5 gains counts as income and you are not allowed to DEDUCT from them each of the $5 losses. so to the IRS you have a $50 gain ($5 times 10 positive trades) and you are now allowed to counts the $50 loss ($5 times 10 Negative trades)

So even though you have NO MONEY you have ""gains"" they count and tax you on."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is what happens for tax purposes:

You buy $100 stock. You now have $100 basis in that stock, which is used to calculate tax gain/loss.

You sell for $105. You have a $5 taxable gain (105-100=5).

You buy the same $100 stock again. You now have $100 basis in that stock. You sell for $95. You have a $5 tax loss (95-100=-5).

You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100.

As long as you sell and then wait for 30 days before rebuying the same stock at any point in the year, you will realize the losses.

The problem is when people accumulate huge losses that are disallowed by wash sales, and they never wait past the wash period during the year. The losses carry forward via increased basis to the next year, but will not be able to offset gains made in the current year.

Important to note that the losses are not “lost”, they are carried via increased basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I read the article a few times and I think I get it.

When you buy a stock and sell for a profit, you have a profit. Simple. When you buy a stock and sell it for a loss, and don't touch that stock again for 30 days, you have a valid loss which can counteract your gains. Cool.

When you buy a stock, sell it for a loss, and buy back shortly thereafter, you can't book the loss. The loss is not counted. Instead, your cost basis on your 2nd purchase is ~~lowered~~ raised by the amount of your loss. So if you bought 100 xyz for $10 each ($1000), sold at $9 ($900), have a $1 loss per share ($100), and rebuy at $8 within 30 days, your official cost basis is now ~~$7~~  $9. You can't book any loss yet. You have a new entry and your cost basis (despite buying at $8) is actually ~~$7~~ $9 ($8 ~~minus~~ plus the $1 loss from the last trade).

However, when you sell your 2nd trade, you can book your profit or loss just fine, IF YOU DONT TRADE THE STOCK AGAIN FOR 30 days.

The guy could have avoided the huge tax bill if he simply sold any time in December and didn't rebuy the same positions until 30 days later. All of his losses would have become valid losses. He held until January though, or repurchased within 30 days, or likely every day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What I wanna know is why this doesn't shut down corporate high frequency traders.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How to avoid problems:

1. If you've been day trading a stock, sell it before year end (shouldn't be a problem; if you're day trading then you're probably selling every day).

2. Find a different ball to play with in January. Throughout the entire month of January, don't buy anything that you day traded in December. This ends the 30-day countdown and allows your gains/losses to all apply to the same tax year.

3. If you make big gains, stop gambling for a bit. Bare minimum, set aside enough to cover taxes. People have been hosed by making big taxable gains in December, then losing it all in January.

[Edit: This should go without saying, but I'm not a tax professional. If you're moving a lot of money around, spending a few hundred to get advice from a tax professional is good insurance.]"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure this person traded and made a ton of money, but realized his gains on the way up, thus owing $800k in taxes on those gains since he sold and they were realized. However, in the end, he blew up his account to an overall profit of $45k. Basically - if you sell and realize your gains, say $2M, you OWE taxes on ALL realized gains, even if you lose it all and break even, or in this case 45K overall profit.

\*I may be wrong, but something like the above could happen with a new trader. Something to be aware of."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy in the article filled out his own tax return on Turbo Tax. Basically in trying to save money on a professional he messed up how he filed his taxes due to incompetence and not knowing the loopholes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They sold at a loss in December and then re-bought in January. The loss in December was disallowed and added to the cost basis of new shares in January.

End result is a ton of unrealized losses pushed to the next tax year, taxed for 'gains' this year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s more likely that this dude entered his shit into TurboTax wrong and it’s giving him the wrong answer. 

As a few other comments noted, this scenario is mathematically possible but he would have had to realize some massive, massive gains and then huge losses afterwards while also re-entering all of his positions too soon. And then, not exiting those positions before year end as well.

Is it possible? Sure, but I find it quite unlikely."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the article is written so any high school student could understand it and it literally answers your question.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If the future is the morning of April 15th and your running late to your H&R Block appointment with Greg who has called you 27 times since January reminding you it’s tax season because you can’t find your sons SSN then yes this is in fact from the future.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,3k is just the total tax deductible loss amount. He can make 100k this year and sell some to book a loss of 103k to essentially pay zero tax on 103k of income. Even then it would take nearly 8 years to make it all back... it all depends on how successful he can be trading each year lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,traded 45 mill for checks notes 45k... guy made a return of 0.1%.... when almost any stock is up 80-100% from the dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t necessarily need to be an LLC especially in a state like California that charges you for the privilege of being an LLC even if you lose money.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have watched videos and read posts about this, but still don't fully understand (brain to smooth). 

So trader status + mark to market seems like it would've negated all wash sales and this guy (possibly) wouldn't have as big a problem? Like each trade would've been treated as it's own trade.

I don't yet qualify for trader status and thus mark to market if I'm understanding right. Is this something where if I don't qualify for active trader by years end it's basically ""too bad, should have waited a month before buying back in to stuff""? 

Do people actually plan a strategy around this rule or is this just an extreme case that most swing traders don't really have to be concerned with? I have no problem just dumping everything years end and trading other stuff for a month if that ""makes it regular""."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure he could just close all positions before the December, and chill for a month. All his gains and losses would settle in the same year.
That’s what I’m planning to do this year if I lose most of the money earned on GME in January"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You and me both. I’m going to call around tomorrow and see an actual accounting professional. I’m getting a bit anxious seeing as how I just hit the day trader amount this past January and have made fuck tons of trades since then. Should make for some fun conversations given how accountants rarely have a sense of humor about these things.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should speak with a tax professional.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, one of my bffs is a CPA—you don’t pay tax on wash loss disallowed, you’re just paying on the net gain. Still a hefty sum but what I expected. Threat averted"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What it’s starting to seem like is you basically add wash sale disallowed to net gains, then tax that at your income tax rate. 

If this is right, a) that is a simple concept that nowhere explains in quick, actionable English, and b) mega fuck"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"you owe income taxes on the full 39k gains as your wash sale disallowed prevents you from claiming any losses to offset your gains. assuming you are the ""Average"" tax payer expect to pay around 20-25% of that 39k in taxes (in addition to your regular income taxes).

&#x200B;

you should speak to an accountant if this doesn't mean anything to you.. and file your taxes on time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You would owe taxes on the 39k based on your income tax rate assuming those gains alre a day have the wash sales deducted.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,would think this would hit any short-term options strategy but turbo tax never did anything like that to me. :/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think your taxed on the two added together. But maybe not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,See if you qualify for trader tax status. You never have to worry about wash sale if you qualify.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe you will be taxed at your income tax rate the sum of the two, so 92k. Basically you had a net gain of 39k, so that’s obviously taxed BUT 53k of your losses that got you down to a net gain of 39 are disallowed, so you have to pay taxes as though you actually earned 92k... if you sell those securities in 2021 (and don’t repurchase within 30 days) you will book a loss of 53k then assuming the price doesn’t change. So in 2021 you will have a far lower taxable income and essentially make that money back, but you have to fork it over for 2020 first. The only thing I’m not clear on is I believe there is a 3k tax deductible limit for reported losses. So... if you make 53k this year you can book that old loss and get all your money back (because you won’t have to pay taxes on any of your gains this year in that case). I think you just need to avoid booking it if you are going to have total loss of over 3k, cuz then you can’t tax deduct it. 
I’m not a professional and this is not financial or tax advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just pay tax on the gains, that's it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You pay taxes on your economic gain, which is your net capital gain (the 39k only). Wash sale rule is about disallowed losses. Bunch of people in here and even that article don't know wtf they talking about."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only sensible (and correct) comment in this entire thread.. congrats
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure he can, in his 2021 tax filing. Now through prob is coming up for 800k for the tax bill, ouch."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beware making large gains at year end then losing your gains in January, you'll still owe the taxes on the gains for the previous year with your losses being in the next tax year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Zero time. You need to set it up the year before
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Read up about wash sales
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Happened
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think both. I think the guy they were talking about made a shit ton one year and then lost it all on weekly FDs a few days into the next tax year. Extremely unlikely for the average person but still important to learn the tax rules.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true. Bunch of noobs in here don't  know wtf they talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they actually end up having to pay ? Because in his case it’s kind of a bullshit rule he wasn’t actually trying to manipulate tax losses
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let’s say you’ve been day trading a stock and you make the following trades in the last 30 days of the year.

Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

Trade 2: Buy @ $45, sell @ $90 = $45 gain

Trade 3: Buy @ $80, sell @ $60 = $20 loss

Trade 4: Buy @ $65, hold through 12/31

While it looks like you have a realized net loss of $25, from a tax perspective, you actually owe tax on the entire $45 gain from trade 2 because the $70 in losses from trades 1 and 3 would be disallowed due to wash sale rules. Instead the $70 loss gets added to the cost basis of trade 4. So cost basis isn’t $65, it’s $135."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale rule will disallow the $2 loss and add to your $4 cost basis, which would be $6 cost basis. Ultimatley still at $1 loss but you sold it all, so now it can be written off.  The guy in the article probably still held onto the washed positions over into the new year.  So his cost basis is now ginormous. If he sells them this year, he may have a huge loss for large tax writeoff, but unfortunately he can only write off $3k per year.  He should have sold it all before last year ended."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not tax advice (not putting this disclaimer for shits and giggles, I have my personal reasons, do your own fucking research):

If you rebuy the same shit (or almost the same shit) within 30 days (that's the rule in Canada at least, pretty sure we copied it off of the USA) something you sold for a loss, that loss is considered a ""wash sale"", aka you didn't really want to be out of the position so you should've just held. Your fake ass loss can go fuck itself."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash rule says profit of 1$  i believe
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re not allowed to declare a loss if you bought back the equity or similar within 30 days. So even though you are down 1$. IRS sees a gain of 1$ because your new cost basis is 4 bucks not 5 and that you sold at 5. 

If from what I’m reading is correct."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy for $25 sell for $5 

Buy back in at $4 sell for $10 (within 30 days) 

This would completely negate the $20 in loss and leave you with $6 in short term capital gains"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoping someone with a great understanding in this area will chime in for you and me both. I can’t wrap my head around it either.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect example would be buying a Meme Stock at say $250 a share x40 and then it drops to 100 and you decide to close the position. You now have a loss of $6k BUT if you Fomo back in your remaining $4k at say $40 a share you now immediately negate the loss and say you sell again for $39 this time you are now able to write off $100 not $6,100"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Following.


Please help us great apes!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks all for clearimg that up. Turns out i shoulda done more than glance over that rule. Gonna go look over my trade history lol...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sale rule says you have a loss of $1 on the tax year you sold the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash rule would still say you lost $1 total on the two trades combined. What changes is what taxes you owe on each individual trade.

Here's how the taxes would look without the wash rule:

Trade 1: You bought for $5 and sold for $3. You get a tax write-off of $2 for this trade. 

Trade 2: You bought for $4 and sold for $5. You owe taxes on your $1 profit for this trade.

With the wash rule applied, they remove that tax write-off from the cost basis of trade 1 and add it to the cost basis of trade 2. So now the taxes look like:

Trade 1: You bought for ~~$5~~$3 and sold for $3. You made $0 on this trade, and neither owe taxes on it nor can write it off.

Trade 2: You bought for ~~$4~~$6 and sold for $5. You get a $1 tax write-off on this trade.

In both cases, you ultimately lost a dollar and would ultimately get to write off that dollar loss. But without the wash rule, if you sell trade 1 in 2020 and don't sell trade 2 until 2021, you're effectively deferring paying taxes you owe on *another* dollar you made in 2020 somewhere else until 2021 without paying penalties, which the IRS doesn't want you to do. As such, they don't let you claim the loss until you ""prove"" that you've ""really"" sold the stock (which they define as having divested it for a full 30 days)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing.

But take this:
>I buy 1 share @5$ Sell it @3$ (2$ loss) Rebuy @4$

The IRS says you have no losses but you bought at $6. That $2 loss gets added to your cost of $4."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,do your own research but i believe they dont care about it being in a roth ira unless you buy the same stock in your brokerage accounts this could be completely wrong tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think wash sales rules are for taxable accounts only.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sales in an IRA are [permanently disallowed](https://finance.zacks.com/ira-rules-wash-sales-9068.html).
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trade different stocks/ETFs last month of the year. Although I believe the SPY and SPX are considered fundamentally the same asset.

Individual stock are even easier.

I wonder exactly how this works with Options on the same underlying. Is a Jan 2022 $30C the same as a Feb 2022 $35C or are the consider different because different Exp and strike?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. This is way too complicated for a normal person to understand before trading. IRS.....................sigh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you could have a 20m tax billing using this article formula? Just kidding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No not necessarily - vanguard hit me with a wash sale in the middle of the year because my etf to etf trade wasn't substantially different enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For individuals, this loss is limited to $3,000 per year, or $1,500 if married and filing a separate return. 

Corporations have more rights than individuals in this sense. They can write off infinite losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They apply
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good example. You are technically up $100k but your Proceeds would have been $2.1M with a cost basis of $2M and a Wash Sale Loss Disallowed of $500k and Realized Gain of $100k

Hence Realized Gain $100k + Wash Sale Loss of $500k = $600k Gain for the tax man.

Gotta be wary. It also only applies on a per share basis which can also make a big difference as some stocks like GME were 3 to 4x more expensive end of 2020 than earlier in the year ($15 to $20 compared to $4 in the summer). Will be worse in 2021. Someone is going to get completely hosed on GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about.  The wash sale rule was created to prevent an end of year tax write off if you are at an unrealized loss (but realized gain) in December and try to get clever by planning to sell in December and rebuy in January. 

The 500k loss would not be allowed to be claimed as a realized loss (offsetting other realized stock gains) when doing doing taxes because that loss was rolled into the new cost basis of the stock when repurchased. 

For smooth brains: The new cost basis of the stock when it is was bought back within 30 days would be 800k (100k @ $3 purchase price + 500k wash sale loss rollover). 

Meaning if that stock is sold for $900k.  Taxes will only be owned on the 100k gain.   ($900k sale - 800k cost basis)

The 500k loss incurred did not disappear forever because of the wash rule .....

Edit: also taxes are not paid on the 500k cash from the loss sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last 31 days.

Or just make sure you don't buy anything you've sold at the end of the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I think he got screwed because he held through end of year. Why do you say 2 weeks tho?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guy didn’t know how to do his taxes. The article states he did them on his own on Turbo tax. 

Even with a job if he spent 4-6 hours a day on most market days working on his trades he can still file under Trader Tax Status. That article is FUD so retail trades less. The wash sale rule can help reduce your tax amount if you keep detailed notes on your trades.

Not tax advise BTW."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok can we dumb this down a lot to just see how it works

I buy one share for $10

I sell it for $15 (net gain $5)

I buy it back for $10

I sell it for $5 (net gain $0)

Within 30 days I buy it again for $7 

The selling for $5 is a wash sale correct?

I then sell it for $5

Now my net  was $0, I lost from there $2 so I have a net loss of $2

However wash sale eliminates my $5 loss from counting so IRS is going to claim that I have a $3 gain??

Or am I missing how it counts? It seems like why the wash sale happened it should have counted at the end..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've read so many articles, and still don't know if I'm fucked.

I have -10k for a NET loss, but 25k in ""wash sale disallowed"" on my statement.

Does this mean I'm going to fucking OWE taxes on 15k? Or was the wash sale disallowed subtracted from my cost basis, and whatever is in my Net column is my tax implication?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like both the US and Canada have wash sale rules and both allow the capital losses to be added to the cost basis on the buy side. So when he finally sells he can get that big capital loss in the sell year.

Canada allows for the capital loss to offset against capital gains from the previous three years and future years cap gains. The IRS doesn't seem to do this and can only apply to current year or future capital gains; or to $3,000 per year of other income.

The Canadian side seems nicer here. But maybe some accountants could chime in if I made some mistakes.."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Net gain/loss makes sense if you are trading frequently.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> This is 1 time that being a Canadian works out. 

ZZZZ

Here tax is automatically reduced before you receive your gain when selling stocks and also loss is calculated in on your next sell"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re wrong. Capital gains are counted as 50% of the total amount and then added as income. Wash sales also 100% apply with pretty much the same wording as the US.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you trade on fidelity or TOS I believe it alerts you when a wash sale has occurred
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly.

>You buy and sell the same stock constantly. you gain $5 10 times and lose $5 10 times. 

Here is what happens for tax purposes:

You buy $100 stock. You now have $100 basis in that stock, which is used to calculate tax gain/loss.

You sell for $105. You have a $5 taxable gain (105-100=5).

You buy the same $100 stock again. You now have $100 basis in that stock. You sell for $95. You have a $5 tax loss (95-100=-5).

You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100 and made $5.

As long as you sell and then wait for 30 days (BOTH DIRECTIONS, before AND after) before rebuying the same stock at any point in the year, you will get to realize the losses.

The problem is when people accumulate huge losses that are disallowed by wash sales, and they never wait past the wash period during the year. The losses carry forward via increased basis to the next year, but will not be able to offset gains made in the current year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"and this is total bullshit. Just another rule to screw retail traders, while hedge funds and their algos are doing this millions of times of day without any ""wash sale rule"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck, I did this in elementary school with chocolate bars.

My friend and I were selling chocolate bars in school for a school fundraising event, and being the smoothbrains that we were, figured we could buy it all ourselves. I gave him a dollar for a chocolate bar, then he gave me that same dollar for a chocolate bar. Rinse and repeat until we both *technically* sold all of our chocolate but only had exactly $1 to show for it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do people day trade then? I don’t understand
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. The losses are rolled into the gains as if the stock cost you more. 

Basically I FOMO and buy 100🚀shares for $30. I miss my exit and sell all 100 for $25. I have a $500 loss. 
Three days later 🚀 looks like it will go nuclear again and I buy 100 shares at $20 for $2,000. Due to wash sale for tax purposes my cost is $2,500 ($2,000 + $500 loss from previous sale). Let’s say I sell the stock for a profit at $40 per share (4,000 total). Due to wash sale my profit from 🚀 is $1,500 ($4,000 - $2,500). 

The wash sale rule can actually help you if you understand it and have the time to keep track of the sales."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that is bullshit: fuck the IRS dude. That can’t be true, and if it is true, then it is completely asinine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When that happens to me, I buy a stock for 10 dollars and sell at a 5 dollars loss, if I rebuy that stock again when it hits 10 dollars I will find out that they took my loss and it actually shows I paid $15 dollars per share rather then $10 because they attached my $5 loss to it.

If anything it's a good deterrent for buying and selling the same stock at a loss in a short period of time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Exactly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is all correct except that your loss is added to your cost basis, not subtracted."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not correct.  The problem is you make a bad trade and lose money on a stock trade.  A realized loss.  Let’s say $100 loss.  However, you decide that you just had bad timing and believe the stock will moon.  So you buy back some portion of the stock.  Doesn’t matter how many shares.  But don’t realize you rebought within the 30 day Wash Sale window.  This instantly no longer allows you to use the loss against your gains.  So with your new stock, the price goes up and you sell for $200 profit.  In your mind (and your net balance) you have a net profit of $100.  But for the IRS, you owe taxes on the $200 profit, not $100.  Keep repeating this with the same stock and your taxable gains can be huge even though your actual balance shows minimal gains or even a loss."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but the IRS is a dick about giving people the daytrade status and will fight you on it. llc is easier.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, even owning an LLC in California costs $800 per year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you would automatically qualify for professional trader status if you create a business entity and trade through that.  Could be an LLC as suggested above, or maybe S-Corp?  Then you can petition for MTM accounting with no problems."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they’re suggesting this because you could just let the LLC go under and not be on the hook for the taxes? Only in the event of getting an $800k Tax Bill though (or something similarly life ruining). I would assume you’d pay diff taxes under the LLC as well.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will do, thanks for the info"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not exactly. Theoretically you can always take profits and not fall under the appropriate criterion of a wash sale. Alternatively you can offset this by intentionally taking losses elsewhere to adjust your taxable gains. Or donate like 25 laptop batteries to a group of third graders.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true.  You can write off losses you just have to be careful they are not being pushed into the next year by wash sale rules. The losses are there in the new cost basis just don't count until you don't trade that stock for 30 days.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, what the IRS sees is:

>Trade 2: Buy @ $45(wash rule triggered, $50 loss is added to $45 cost  to total $95), sell @ $90 = $5 loss

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe that is correct. Wash sale effectively changes your cost basis; it does not nullify your loss entirely if you sell again.

Buy for $25 sell for $5.

Buy back in at $4 (within 30 days). Your cost basis here is adjusted to reflect your wash sale, so your cost basis is $24.

Sell for $10. You realize a $14 loss."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Incorrect.  You would be able to write off the whole $6100 if you stop trading that stock for at least 30 days. The issue happens when the transaction are across years and the loss is disallowed in 2020 and pushed to 2021. 

Using your example if you sell the second transaction on Jan 1st 2021 the $6100 loss would show up in 2021.  If you had sold on November 30, 2020 and not bought that stock again then it would be a loss in 2020. 

Wash sale rule doesn't take away the loss it just delays when you can realize it until you stop trading that stock for more than 30 days."

Man no womder tax attorneys get paid so much. Dipshits like me think they have it all figured out.....


Edit:nvm, i just realized his profit of 45k was unrealized, so if he would have sold those positions b4 year end and not rebought,then his 800,000 gain would have been cancelled out qt that point with what i assume as 735,000 loss.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Across different trades, yes. Each trade is a single event and attributes to your tax buckets. If I am not totally wrong you have a bucket for interest, stocks, options and other (ETFs and certificates).

Gains received on the capital markets less than 801€ are free, everything else is getting taxed by 25%. That's usually less than your income tax rate. 
These taxes cannot be calculated against personal income tax or any other category.
Losses can be taken to the next year or if you move to another broker they are kept there as well.
Only if you request the losses from Broker A to deduct the losses from gains at Broker B, then all the losses are set to 0 at Broker A. (So think about you made -5k loss at Broker A but have gains of 10k at Broker B you can request from Broker B the losses to declare them in your income tax report to get some taxes back paid at Broker A. But remember, only if it is the same tax bucket.
Usually, if you trade with any German Broker you do not have to think about these rules as systems are properly set. 
When it comes to ETFs, it geht's really difficult... but biggest joke are the non deductable losses greater than 10k in options trading. That is just generating tax money for the German state out of nothing...

So far only losses so I am not affected by this rule anyways ;)

there are tricks to make money and avoid wash sale rule"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as you don't re-enter it in January.

As far as I understand wash sales just prevent you from realizing your losses. They don't really go anywhere, they just get added to the new purchase. The fuck up is selling at a loss in December and buying in January creating a tax issue."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not an expert but I don’t believe the answer is necessarily always “yes”. The 30 day period basically extends into the new year. Examples, if you sell a position at a loss December 10 and buy back January 5 then you committed a wash sale. Or if you sell the loss position December 29 then buy back replacement shares on January 25 then you still committed a wash sale and can’t realize your loss on your previous year’s taxes. 

Also remember the wash sale rule takes effect for replacement securities purchased 30 days after OR BEFORE your sale of the original at a loss. Example, if you buy 10 shares June 15, then sell those for a loss on December 20 but also you purchased 6 replacement shares December 5, then you can only realize the loss on 4 of the shares purchases in June on that year’s taxes. The rest of the losses would add to your cost basis on the 6 shares for your future potential tax burden. So to your point, yes, you would need to make sure you exited any potential replacement share positions too (your entire position)... and then of course not buy replacement shares within 30 days which includes rollover into the new year.

Also, remember that your holding period from your original security will be added to the holding period of your replacement security which at some point could eventually change your tax percent on any potential gains made."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if all that happens in the same year, it's not a problem. when your tax year ends, you have to report on your gains/losses as of that moment. due to the wash sale rule, losses are deferred. so you pay taxes on your gains and then the next year you'll be able to claim your losses and...wash out...the taxes paid. tax law changes so it's still not a good idea because your tax rate may change year to year but you still have the same cap gain treatment as anybody else

the real fuckery comes when you sell in your taxable account and buy in your IRA. as far as i've read your losses are obliterated"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">I buy one share for $10

>I sell it for $15 (net gain $5)

This trade is done and has no effect on future trade tax implications.

>I buy it back for $10

>I sell it for $5 (net gain $0)

You can claim a loss here for $5 per share.

>Within 30 days I buy it again for $7

>The selling for $5 is a wash sale correct?

The rebuying of the stock within 30 days triggers the wash sale rule.  The $5 loss gets added to your cost so as far as taxes are concerned, you paid $12. You made $5/share this year and own stock at $12/share.

(1)


>I then sell it for $5

>Now my net was $0, I lost from there $2 so I have a net loss of $2

Yes. Then you get $7 loss you can claim against your $5 gain for a loss of $2.

But these too last points don't really matter. So lets go back to (1).

At this point, lets say you don't take your losses, the wash sale is still in place and your losses are disallowed.  So the IRS will say you made $5/share.  That loss you took on that trade cannot be used against your gains.

TLDR: If you want to use your losses, take the loss and make sure you don't buy back share within 30 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it says disallowed, you should also see an adjusted gain/loss and an adjusted cost basis for your remaining position. The adjusted gain/loss is what you are taxed on.

I cannot tell from your post whether you had a pre-adjusted 35k loss or a 10k loss that got adjusted into a 15k gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assume the worst. Not because of anything you said or anything I know (because I know nothing useful here), but because if you expect the worst, you can only be proven right or pleasantly surprised.

Not financial advice. (It might be emotional advice, though. I don’t know.)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah all my GME tendies are cooking in my TFSA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re supposedly not allowed to day trade in the tfsa but... from what I hear they practically don’t enforce it unless the amount starts sticking out of the ordinary

Edit: also you’re not allowed to write puts in either tfsa or rrsp which really sucks"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, you cant get 3:1 margin in a TFSA.   
3x the tendies with Margin."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stephen harper the god who introduced this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Moving there if I ever find out how to gain. I only loss.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depending on the province, state and incomes being compared, and also taking into account sales tax, it can easily be more than double."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you are claiming the income as a Capital Gain and Capital Loss. But if you have a high enough trading volume you can claim it as Business income which subtracts total losses from total gains and yhen you are taxed at your nominal rate for the income.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was my point. In Canada this guy could have claimed the gains and losses as business income, and oaud on the net gain"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He obviously wasn't doing his day job as an insurance broker 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's basically reinvesting his profits, and then losing those profits along with the taxes he was supposed to pay on em....1000 times..right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He had slightly more capital than is required to execute day trades that often. He started with 30k capital requirement for endless day trading is 25k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But wouldn't it still be an actual loss arithmetically?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here this is the only way I was able to understand it: 

https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/a-primer-on-wash-sales#:~:text=The%20wash%2Dsale%20rule%20was,or%20after%20the%20sale%20date).

Most people probably aren't in danger of it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, I am new to trading/investing too. Had to learn hard way about day trading rules. Bought a call option once for like $20. Got lucky, option went up to over $1000. Couldn’t sell as it would have been my 4th day trade in 5 days. Lost my $20 as I had to let it expire as stock went down again within minutes (outside of 24hrs rule to hold your stock). So, in the end I paid $20 for a lesson learned, which could have gained me $980 if I had known the rules."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or contact an accountant/ fiduciary to let him / her have it explained to you. Not financial advice: just avoid selling a stock at a loss, then buy back same/similar stock because of FOMO, and sell at a gain within 30days of last sell. That’s how I understand it, but I am just an Ape."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically, just don’t sell at a loss within 30 days of buying your stock. So, basically 30 days before or after (60 days total or 62 if you want to be super safe)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would be so much more helpful if there was a warning that it WILL occur if trade is executed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I was wondering why my cost basis was so high on AMC. I literally never bought it at the price it says, I figure it's a good thing if I end up being net green at the end."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically to be safe, don't trade anything in December that you need for tax purposes, correct?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, people think you lose more money because of the wash sale rule, but that's false.

when you're totally out of a position, you get to claim exactly what you lost in total"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what the fuck is the point of the rule?  It just makes more taxes to be paid this year but reduces next year's taxes?  Why not just... Tax gains and deduct losses?  It accomplishes the same exact thing with fewer steps and makes less paperwork.

Oh, I know why.  It's to fuck over poor people who don't fully understand tax law and don't have cash on hand to cover significantly higher than expected taxes.  If it forces them to liquidate, it forces them to take more losses.

The whole fucking system is retarded in the worst ways."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is you sell dec 31 and dont trigger a wash sale by buying in Jan, then the loss is realized in the prior year right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100.

What happens if you then sell at $95, and again buy back at $100? Are you allowed to carry on both losses or only the last one?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost $200 on GME. if I buy again, then i sell all in october. Would I just use my actual profit / loss then because by year end it will have been over 31 days?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So more or less u cant compound ur losses but u can compound your gains?  An could i use a loss from another stock to write off my gains for a completly different stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So... The 30 day waiting period aside, wash sales are also okay (in terms of having enough money to pay the taxes incurred) as long as your net gain is bigger than your accumulated losses in adjusted cost basis?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if you're a foreigner trading on the NYSE... I wonder if it applies.
Edit: Through a foreign broker. ie. Comsec International (Australia)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but one question, does opening a new position of any amount in the same stock wash all of your loses? If you had loses on 50 shares but buy a half a share back that counts as a wash for the entire loss?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it's not. It's to prevent rich fucks from selling all of their stocks that are down, negating tax liability, then buying them back.

It's *literally* a rule that only serves to prevent the 1% from dodging taxes. And you are wrong that hedge funds aren't subject to the wash sale rule, because they 100% are. 

Retail traders are almost never affected by the wash sale rule, because even if you trigger a wash sale, it raises your cost basis. This only fucks you if you are a complete moron and do some really dumb shit at the end of the year, or like take losses in a tax-advantaged account and gains in a brokerage account.

I swear to god you guys will get riled up about absolutely anything and claim it's manipulation to screw over the little man. In this case, it's the *exact* opposite."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6GKVe7uXWQ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's kinda like what the hedgies are doing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because people here don't understand the rule. The loss doesn't disappear, it gets added to your cost basis when you repurchase the stock. Thus when you eventually close your position, your adjusted cost basis reduces your net gain by the amount of your original loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It didn't help at all, that end result is what you would have had without the rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya but what if it goes back down after that an you buy back in dont you NOT get the wrtie off for the first 500 loss?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gah thank you, I should correct that. Not sure how I got that wrong. I'll do an edit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except the cost basis should carry over each time, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s what I meant just wasn’t as clear as you’ve put it here 👍
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Question. So I lost 35k last year but could only apply 3k on my 2020 taxes.  Say I gain 32k this year. Can I apply last years loss to this years gains minus the 3k leaving 0 gain or loss?  Or can I still only apply the 3k?  Or am I completely retarded and can’t do any of that. 😅
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right. You need the 475 election. You can do it as a sole proprietor, but you'll be under more scrutiny by the irs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh ok that makes things interesting, thanks! I had an LLC in another state but I'm not sure it is still legit as I don't live there (or pay taxes there) anymore. I'll have to look into whether or not I can still use it. It would finally be good for something other than uber lol (Nevada makes you register as a business to do Uber). 

And I think it'd be even better for taxes unless it's different for this kinda thing. As far as I know you don't pay state income taxes.

Edit: might not have been an LLC. Sole proprietorship? I don't know. Crayons."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Corporations are People (see Citizens United), doesn't this violate equal protection?

/s ... ?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s because in order to choose mark to market accounting where you can avoid wash sale rules you have to be designated as a trader by the irs. This is easier for LLCs and corporations because a trader by their definition derive their sole income from actively trading the market day to day and profiting off swings. You can also then deduct qualified business expenses such as a home office or trading software which a regular investor generally cannot do. However the flip side is that M2M accounting is calculated using the appreciated value of all your stocks and gains at year end even if you haven’t sold them yet. As always talk to professional. 
There’s risks to picking mark to market accounting since you will be accountable for all the capital appreciation of your stocks at the end of the year even if you haven’t sold them. You also have to choose M2M the year before you start trading in this manner. Finally you will need permission from the irs if you wish to opt out of M2M as you will be permanently locked to this style of accounting from this day forward. Source
https://andersonadvisors.com/trader_taxation/"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you get more than 1 LLC? I think I'll need at least 4 then..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i just read that you could have 2 separate accounts even if you're not an LLC.

One account would be designated for long term investments.

&#x200B;

But what if shit happens and you want to liquidate an investment before the 1 year mark in the long term account?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is it possible to have humongous gain, and only disallowed losses if you close all positions in the same year? 
If the loss is disallowed by the wash sale rule, then this loss is added to the cost basis of the new purchase. So when you sell it again, you’ll realize much bigger loss which will include everything previously disallowed. I’m not a PhD in taxes, but it’s the only way how this rule would make sense."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Or OnlyFans
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Couldn’t agree more. But that would make gamification- and therefore our losses- way less monetizable ?that a word? for eg Robinhood
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought washed things were good.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> You’d think with the influx of app traders that there’d be a pop up that says, “you’re about to trigger a wash sale tax. Do you want to proceed?” I know it’s on us to become fully educated before we do this... but you’d also think the apps would wise up to the best interests of their customers.

I don't know why you think a simple pop up would significantly prevent anything, isn't the same shit done when you enable options on a shitty broker like RH? Do what you initially said and become fully educated before you jump into this instead of relying on companies to hold your hand so you'd be able to blame someone else when you get fucked."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No it doesn’t
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"let me get my fooking helmet on.

wash sales - ( 111,740.29 )
gains / losses - ( -127,011.86 )
yes thats not a gain so i should be good giving it out for free?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No that just means you can’t deduct the 53k from the 39k gain
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,in RH i was trading spreads all year last year my gains last year were about 1/80th my proceeds. :P
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can’t see how that’s the case haha. If so the wash sale rule wouldn’t mean a thing. This guy in the article had a net gain of 45k, and his tax bill is clearly not based on 45k of additional income."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disallowed losses are _effectively_ adding to your gains though, if you can’t book the loss then that means you gained more. Also yes _long term_ you will be taxed on net gains, but this is about a particular year. Check the article, if you are only taxed on a net gain _in a given year_, then why does this guy owe 800k on a 45k net gain? The answer is because he had millions in wash sales and the losses were never realized in 2020. Adding those to his net gain gave him a taxable gain in the millions, for which the tax burden was 800k."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have lots of trades last year, I just did last day balance - first day balance and my gain reported on tax statement is fairly close to that number. If you trade normally and not doing risky trades where you can lose all the money overnight, the total gain even with wash sale should be close to the expected gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, you can't use losses in 2021 to offset gains made in 2020, and get a refund? Man I've been living under a rock for ages.

Our northern neighbor at least get to write off any cap gains in the past 3 years, that's why I've been assuming the same."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well he can also offset any gains up to 800k. So hopefully he has a baller year and realizes like an 800k gain, then he can book the total loss and break even by not paying taxes on his gain. But ... more likely it’s going to take him quite a while, still a LOT better than 3k per year"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So Scott's tots was just michael Scott's ploy to cover his gme gains? He belongs here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to sort out what happened here. Is the problem that he repurchased the (or many) stock at the end of 2020 and didn't sell it before 2020 (or if he did, repurchased in 2021), therefore he was unable to realize the loss because technically he hadn't taken a loss yet (per wash sale rule)?

I feel like there's an important detail missing from this article because as it's written, he shouldn't have a gigantic bill."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">	The losses are there in the new cost basis

This person knows what's up. Cannot write off the losses, can factor them into cost basis"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, basically you can do whatever you want but come DECEMBER 1st you better make sure you book some losses on what youve been trading that year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, yeah. 

But you gotta know the rules first before acting like ape. I’m new to this stuff too, and probably / most likely did some wash sales too.  But at least not in the frequency this dude did. 

But well, the more you know..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"IRS settles all the time.

They are looking to get money not ruin people's lives.

If their goal was to ruin lives, 98.2% of the people in the service industry would be in prison."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,A lot of people would never be able to acquire that kind of money to pay it off
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t want to offend you, but it doesn’t seem like you actually know what you’re talking about. it seems like you’re just typing off the cuff. Are you a financial tax lawyer?

It seems a lot more reasonable that accusing someone of wash sales requires proof that they are actually doing that to evade taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah so if we just close all wash sale positions before end of year it will all “balance out”? The guy in the article likely was holding lots of wash sales through the year?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You would need to be out of the position for 30 days prior to year end. So basically, you would need to close trade 4 in November."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is incorrect. Each disallowed loss is carried forward to the “replacement shares” on each successive trade. So under wash sale rules, Trade 2 can’t be $5 loss because the disallowed loss from trade 1 got carried forward to the cost basis of trade 3 (which then carried forward to trade 4).

That’s why the subject of the article had a $1.4M gain on his tax return. All of his profitable trades were taxable but all of his losing trades kept being carried forward under wash sale rules."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but you cannot buy back until 30 days later. For example, if you sell on the last day of December, you cannot buy back until Jan 30th. You'll have to do research and hope that the stock you want to buy back in won't sky rocket within that period, else you will miss out on big gains.  But better that than to have a $800k tax bill I suppose."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Either close out Nov 30 and don't trade those positions in December, or close out Dec 31 and don't trade those positions in January."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This assumes you're trading the same stock:

Day 1: buy for 5

Day 2: sell for 4

Day 3: rebuy for 5

Day 4: resell for 6.

You have a $1 loss from the first two transactions and a $1 gain for the last two. 

Except that $1 loss doesn't count cause you didn't wait enough days. 

Rinse and repeat, multiple times a day over a year, and all those $1 losses don't count whereas the $1 gains do = end up with a massive tax bill despite not being better off."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Example: You lose 3 million but gain 3,045,000 but you cannot write off the 3 million so you're taxed on a gain of $3,045,000"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,See my other reply just now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TD Ameritrade allowed me to buy lower then after the position was closed they adjusted (increased) the cost  if the wash sale rule was violated. I’m not 100% sure though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Schwab does the same, which I never understood exactly what it meant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the right answer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So no more trading after Thanksgiving.  Got it.  🤡
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where it can hurt you is if you make a big profit on one stock, then sink those profits into another stock and lose that value w/o realizing the loss. For example:

Trade 1: buy stock A at $20k, it moons, sell at $100k
Trade 2: buy stock B at $100k, it tanks, sell at $30k
Trade 3: stock B keeps tanking and stabilizes at $10k 2 days later, rebuy there and hold.

So you've made a total investing profit of $10k for the year that's currently re-invested in stock B. But because of the stock B wash sale, you still owe taxes on the full $80k you made on A because you haven't ""really"" sold stock B yet.

*edit: On further thought, I think this could actually happen with all one stock as well. I was thinking the profit stock would have to be different from the loss stock, but if you initially sell for a profit and then rebuy in under 30 days I don't think the wash sale applies there. So only the second rebuy would be washed and you would still owe taxes on the first trade's profit in full."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> So lets say it then goes to 3$ and i sell. At that point it would be a 3 dollar loss, now realized, if i do not then repurchase? 

Yes. Or if your only repurchase after 31 days.

I'm curious what they mean by tax bill. Does he owe $800k or does he owe on $800k?  It doesn't make sense he'd pay $800k for $1.4M of profit.  The numbers don't add up in the article."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah as long as the wash doesn't push your losses past your claimable date. I know there's some weird stuff where.yoi can apply this year's taxable advantages to last year's taxes, if you haven't filed yet... Not sure if that would apply here. But for simplicity, let's just say dec 31."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh should have known, sorry OP"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,..like you can read
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok thank you! Avoiding the tax man is my number 1 goal in life.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s not erased
It’s supposed to carry over into the next transaction..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Better way to write it - losses here are reincorporated into unrealized losses (cost basis takes on the loss divided by the shares).

So you have no realized loss...yet"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok but it doesn't end there. 

If you now sell for $20

Do you get to count just the $3 as a loss despite actually losing first $4 then $3 more ie total of $7

So if you later gain $4 IRS says you have a gain of $1 despite truly being down $3 still"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So in your case what happens after you sell PLTR that you bought at $23?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What If u sold the stock, then within 30 days bought call options but didnt' execute it ( no shares) - is it still a wash sale?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so basicly it only fucks you if you sell losses ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So I created an LLC specifically for daytrading both Froex and Stocks and my brother and I have an internal MTM agreement (mark-to-market) meaning the way we’ll get taxed is based off of every single trade we put out. Mark-to-market meaning the position it was opened at and sold will be how it should be taxed... Is this a way to get around the wash sale?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The RH summary is basically this (rounded):

Proceeds: 200k

Cost basis: 235k

WASH SALE DISALLOWED: 25k

Net Loss: -10k

Looks like somehow this influenced my cost basis, and I should still end up with a 10k loss? (Be able to claim 3k per year in losses)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that part I just learned last week as I tried to start my first wheel... 🎡🙃
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you allowed to purchase calls/puts in your tfsa/rrsp?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Literally...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In Canada, the volume if his fay trading would have qualified as business income."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure glad I wasn't any good at day trading. Wash rules are retarded.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But your daytrade margin is only 4.5x times your balance on rh... so the story still doesn't line up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say they have 10k invested into a stock, then sell at 5k. That's a 5k loss. Without the rule, they re-buy the stock(within 30 days) at the same price or even at a lower price, lowering the cost basis, but also being able to claim a 5k loss in their taxes.

Not only do they get to claim 5k loss on taxes, but now their cost basis on the stock is lower from their initial investment."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I accidentally triggered a wash sale on GME and it feels like I'm jumping without a parachute sometimes.

I don't even day trade."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So for most who bought and day traded gme you aren't in wash?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent even for the smoothest brained ape. My mom read it to me and now I will totally wait 30 days between eating the yellow crayons.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So at the end when i have to pay capital gains tax i could still deduct my losses from other stocks in my port an that would shave off some gains tax i would have had to pay right?    It doesnt have to be a loss from that one perticular stock correct?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in that example, the person bought stock for 1000, sold for 800, then bought back in for 600 (200 left unspent from previous 800) and then sold for 1000 which results in final 1200 sum if you add that 200$ that was unspent on buying back in.

That means the person started with 1000 and improved to 1200, 200 capital gain total, as the article states. There must be more to it as that seems like a standard capital gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice so is that a wash sale 

Edit:
Was kidding with this one"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just fcking sell it and open a new account lmao. This is stupid.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Open a spread next time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it count if you just let an option expire?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell at the loss but just don’t then go and buy the same stock within 30 days before or after. This rule was made to prevent people abusing the tax loss harvesting system. Supposedly 🙄
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Don’t sell shit for a loss and then buy it back in under a month, especially in December."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have a position that you want to harvest losses on, you need to not buy that same position for both 30 days before and after the sale date.

Specific example, if you sell a position with a loss on 12/31, you need to not buy that same position in December nor January to avoid a wash sale."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell things for a loss in December. Just don't buy them back until February (this is overly simplified but a safe rule).
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read up on tax loss harvesting. The purpose of wash sales is so investors don’t just dump all their losing positions at the end of the year to claim the loss, then buy it right back the first trading day of the next year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, BUT it is 30 days in either direction. For a 12/31 sale at a loss, you need to not buy for both 30 days before and after."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Works the exact same way. Your cost basis was 105, you sold for 95 = -10 net gain. You buy back at 100, wash sale is triggered and your -10 loss is disallowed and added to your new cost basis, which is 110 even though you bought at 100."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule has no effect on the total losses or impact of those losses that you will eventually realize. The rule ONLY affects the timing of when you might be able to use those losses for tax purposes.

Yes, with some special exceptions that will never affect the average investor, all gains and losses are pooled for tax reporting."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's just a us tax rule, so I doubt it, although from Googling it looks like Australia has their own wash sale rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rule is applied on a share-by-share basis.

If you sell 100 shares, and then immediately rebuy 50, you apply the rule to 50 of the 100 shares that you sold. You would realize the other 50% of the loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It seems to hurt average traders with limited capital that need to get in-and-out of trades quickly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the actual fuck?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then it's still net zero but with more hoops, so what's the point? Like I get the purpose is for the government to realize less tax reductions because you aren't allowed to claim the loss, but by adding it to the cost basis they just delay that loss in taxes until after the next time you realize gains. So it washes out, so why do it? I just don't get the point.

EDIT: I guess it represents tax revenue *now*, which is better than tax revenue *later*. And if you do buy back in immediately, there's also the chance that the price never recovers... but since your cost basis is increased, isn't that just am even *bigger* loss claim next year?! What are they hoping for, that you'll die in 30 days and never realize the wash?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He should be talking about the taxable amount based on that gain (put in 2k cashed out 4k but only pays taxes on 1.5k instead of the 2k gains because of the wash sale ""backlog"" adding to the cost basis).

But he got lost in his own example."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can make an LLC on Nolo for less than 1000 (I wanted mine in a jiffy because I daytrade too much so it was 700-800? So that's the worst you'll pay). It just saves you so much of a headache come tax time. That's really the whole point.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Corporations have more rights than people. Go figure. Especially when it comes to ""tax sheltering."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect summary. I know that a lot of people are saying you just need day trader status. That is true. But the IRS is a dick about giving it out and they don't bother LLCs as much. They are especially assholes if this isn't your full time job, and I imagine for most of reddit, this isn't their full time job. And M2M is helpful if you don't have any capital appreciation, because you sell everything off at the end of the day (some daytraders are very serious about not holding anything, so M2M really helps them). You can be an investor under your name, a trader under your company's name. If you make enough that going the C-corp route makes sense, you can even deduct retirement contributions and Healthcare contributions. The real benefit for the LLC is having an easier time circumventing the IRS scrutiny so you can get M2M easier. If you don't do wash sales, then this might not be worth it. But if you do daytrades frequently, it is almost inevitable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,username checks out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They lost a lot but gained a lot and wash sold the losses making the IRS ignore the loss and only look at the 1.5 mil ""gain"" when the real gain was only 45k. If they were smart they would have just lost everything and not had to pay taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't really know shit either but I think the point is to prevent people from using dips to offset taxes by claiming a loss and immediately rebuying to maintain a position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">gamification

This is a meme to attack apps like Robinhood."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a discussion forum, man. I’m not blaming anyone for my fuck up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there any brokerages that do?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it does. Have you ever bought something you sold at a loss within the last month on Fidelity?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disallowed losses are losses you cannot deduct off your gains. It cannot add to your gain. It can only reduce your gain so you pay less in taxes. In OPs case in the article, he is not allowed to deduct those wash sales against his 45k net gain. He will owe taxes on the full 45k.

You have no clue what you are speaking of."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say you make 100k in 2020, sell, and immediately rebuy. You'll owe taxes on 100k. Then say Jan 1 2021 you lose all 100k. You can only write off 3k per year.

If in 2020 you lost our 100k you gained, there's nothing to write off. You just made 0 that year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bingo.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This happens when people don't understand the market and taxes the proceed to write articles.

I would love to see his tax form.  My guess is he/she bought and sold the same securities multiple times with losses.  These losses never would have been realized and would have just kept stacking.  So he had all the gains with none of the losses to cancel it out.

Think about GME.  Buy and sell 200 shares multiple times a day with losses and your cost basis would keep increasing but never count against the gains. He started with $30k and had net gains of $45k so had $75k in his account.  If he was using margin could be 3 to 4x that in daily trades so up to $300k that he could buy and sell daily.  I could see gains of $800k if you can't count your losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the way I am understanding the article, he basically day traded with the same stocks over and over again all year long, hundreds or thousands of times.  In order to realize his losses, he would have to go 30 days without buying those stocks.  I'm guessing he almost never went a week.  That probably carried over into the next year, right up until he started doing his taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you’ve ever sold a stock/option at a loss and then bought a share or option on the same symbol within 30 days then you too have triggered a wash sale
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there any source for this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, he will need to use that 45k gain for a good tax lawyer to help him navigate it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense taken. I am not a tax lawyer, I don't know anything. Not accusing someone of anything. The article states the poor fella was hit by the wash sale rule and hence the predicament. Also a wash sale is not ""evading taxes"" or something to be ""accused of"". Simply it just means that your basis is adjusted upward on your new purchase and you are disallowed the loss. It's actually a real informative story because a lot of folks are not familiar about the 30 day rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But doesn't the wash sale adjustment get applied when you re-open the position? Or is there something special that happens when you close a position that was previously opened as a wash sale?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, you're right.

>Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

>Trade 2: Buy @ $45(wash rule triggered, $50 loss is added to $45 cost to total $95), sell @ $90 = $5 loss. 

>Trade 3: Buy @ $80(wash rule triggered, trade 2 now becomes: Buy @45 sell at $90, $45 gain. $50 loss from Trade 1 is added to $80 cost to total $130) sell @ $60 = $70 loss. 

>Trade 4: Buy @ $65(wash rule triggered, $70 loss added to $65 to total $135), hold through 12/31. You have disallowed losses of $70 and gains of $45."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Yes, but you cannot buy back until 30 days later. For example, if you sell on the last day of December, you cannot buy back until Jan 30th.

Bingo bango.

If you really think it will take off, you can buy an call option outside that 30 day period. like The first friday after those 31 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Others in this thread have said the positions must be closed by Nov. 30. But I have not verified that outside this thread. And you definitely cannot buy back in until Jan.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"what if you buy for 5, sell for 4, buy for 4, sell for 3?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t the wash sale rule make your Day 3 buy have a cost basis of 6? So only if you hold that position would you not be able to realize the loss on day 2. By selling on day 4 aren’t you effectively closing that position with a gain of 0?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is only accurate if day 4 is in a different tax year than day 3
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this in my tfsa for a week before I wisened up and started reading rules.

My accountant is going to hate me next year :(

Needless to say, lesson learnt!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I’m not sure how it works. Then it said I had 1 round trip.  And something with 5 round trips they will consider me a day trader.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,By selling

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So if you exit your positions before december... these losses will all count? Or am i as retarded as i think i am?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you're holding onto that security after the repurchase, they're just unrealized losses still? You'd have to sell those securities that you repurchased to get the actual realized gain/losses for the tax year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I ever get to realize the original loss? By the article it seems not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not an accountant, certainly not for the USA, but I believe the $4 loss gets folded into your second purchase. So they treat it like you bought at $27 and sold at $20. 

The reason for the rule is because people were selling and rebuying whenever their stock was down, to lock in a tax loss, yes it would cancel out when they eventually sold the stock for money for real but that could be decades away. Basically getting a free loan from the IRS. The IRS didn't like that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any call purchase within 30 days will be a wash on your previous loss. The loss needs to be added to your call’s cost basis. Your call’s strike price and expiration do not matter.  You cannot count on your broker to flag it, but per IRS rules it’s a wash sale. A deep in the money short put as it’s considered substantially identical at that point. If you sell the put at or out of the money most accountants will say that’s OK. There is no number specified in IRS publication 550 though. Another thing that people forget or ignore, wash sales apply across accounts and across spouses and corporations. So if you sell in your personal account to harvest a loss. Then later buy in a Roth within 30-days it washes your individual loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options and shares don’t conflict with the wash sale rule its only for shares of the same stock, so yeah you should be able to do it that way"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To me it seems like you could've reported 35k in losses, but since 25k of that 35k is wash sales you can only report 10k in net losess."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think for most people the net loss should be normal. The article describes special cases where he made huge profit throughout the year and didn't withheld tax on that and somehow managed to lose it all near the very end of the year. If you trade normally, this shouldn't affect you.  Net = WashSale - (Cost Basis - Proceeds)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can do level 1 and level 2 only which means buying calls/puts and selling covered calls. 

You can't do any strategies that involve selling one of the sides ""naked"" ie: no spreads, wheels,..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think yea everything but selling puts, as long as it’s covered eg no naked calls. Should double check tho to be sure"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeh it doesn't make any sense. Why have that rule for retail, while hedge funds and algos can do that shit without penalty?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yee fuck that noise son
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and also the 'dangers of free trading' tagline is of course dogshit since the same situation would occur with any broker.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you have a margin account and meet PDT requirements then you can trade as much as you want, you don't have to wait for T+2 cash settlement"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he would have to trade his whole account (including margin) around 300 times a day to hit 2mill in volume
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But doesn't that just leave them with the same stock and a 5k loss at that moment? I don't see why the 30 days would matter.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Simple solution... Don't sell for a loss.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"HODL is all you have to do , thus avoiding the wash sale stuff"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah I’m pretty sure we are
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, that's Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule.  Also a good rule to study up on if your platform doesn't keep track of it for you like ToS does."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,After your Edit. FU and well played.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that’s the Day Trading rule for retail investors as we are. Really, read up. You can only buy and sell the same stock/option at the same business day (24hrs +1min ) four times within 5 business days. Business days excludes weekends or holidays."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly can’t answer that question. I don’t know, so before putting up some bullshit- anyone else can answer that?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. All that really matters is the tax year.  Which is why the wash sale is really fucking stupid and for simplicity should only apply to stocks rebought within the month of January if you sold in December.  Because it was put in place to avoid tax shenanigans, the only time that matters is Dec-Jan."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you not be able to buy a position on 12/30 then sell it for a loss on 12/31? Just don't rebuy the same position for 30 days and you should be able to claim the loss, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then their buy in price for the next year is so much lower, meaning it has significantly more room to run, meaning when they do eventually sell it (assuming it's an overall gain) then they will pay taxes on all of that gain then.

It's literally the same calculations with extra steps.  Who gives a shit if they claim it as a loss on their taxes this year if they claim it as a bigger taxable gain next year?  It makes no god damn sense."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah thank you for the clarification. In the case where you did buy within 30 days prior though, when does the loss get realized? Say I add one share to my position on dec 15 and sell everything for a loss on dec 31. You are saying that’s a wash sale and that loss won’t be realized in that year. When does it get realized? Since I no longer have any shares to adjust cost basis on?

Edit: I believe I’ve found the answer. If you sell everything on dec 31st and do not rebuy within 30 days then you are fine no matter what. But if you sell only a portion on dec 31, the loss will be added to the cost basis of any shares purchased within the last 30 days. But if you sell _those_ then it’s fine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh so you are allowed to keep carrying over, it does not seem that bad then, assuming you do sell and stop the whole wash before the end of the year.

Thank you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This makes sense, thank you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesnt, as a wash sale raises your cost basis, therefore it doesn't actually increase tax liability (again, unless you do something stupid)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They are hoping that you won’t cash out on position for a loss and then go long for 10 years thus forcing the IRS to give you a 10 year interest free deferment on your taxes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and it's the same outcome with extra steps."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I understand this correctly... As long as I sell for a net profit after the adjusted cost basis, I will be good?

e.g. if I bought 10 shares at $15 (10 x $15 = $150), sold at $10 each ($100) for $5 loss each, and bought back 10 at $8 each ($80), my adjusted total cost basis would be $(80 + 5\*10) = $130. My adjusted cost basis per share is $13.

So

1. If I sold before the share price reaches $13, say at $10, my taxable amount would still be calculated like a gain: $(10-8)\*10 = $20; i.e. I owe the IRS taxes on a technical net loss.
2. But if I sold at $13, I break even and owe no taxes.
3. If I sold above $13, say $15, I pay taxes on $(15-13)\*10 = $20, but I also covered my initial cost?

Is item (1.) the thing that happened to this day trader, or am I not understanding this correctly?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro. You use too many words to say what you want to say but only saying what you’re saying because youre saying it to say.

Yet someone like you thinks having a pop up screen would do anything, so *you can* at least blame someone or something when shit hits the fan, just like you are doing now. ""Man, why couldn't they give me a pop up so I know what I'm getting into (yeah, like you guys can actually read and not randomly click the colorful buttons) and can be responsible?"" As I said, you want them to hold your hand like a little bitch."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I didn't see any notification regarding a wash sale, that was on the fidelity app. I do get warnings about potential good faith violations before trying to sell too early, it would seem wise to have the same for wash sales."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Always get the good faith violation warnings. But my Fidelity only identifies the wash sales after I make them :/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean the article literally says he may owe $800k in taxes, which is clearly larger than the $45k net gain. It seems that nobody here knows what they're talking about."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just imagining michael Scott loss porn from SPY puts, gets margin called... I DECLARE BANKRUPTCY"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"His tax bill is 800k, so his gains had to be multi millions, but ya still easy to believe"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So he rode the price both up and down, taking several small gains and losses along the way, but always within a short time period. End of year, he's realized significant taxable gain, significant *dissallowable* losses, but only a net difference of ~45k. In other words, he acted like a high frequency algorithm, but since he's a normal ass human being (aka not a qualified trader), IRS says ""Fuck you buddy.""

Whatever problem wash sale rules are designed to fix, this clearly isn't it. What a fucked up system."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Important to remember it’s within 30 days on both sides too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a joke about how basically every waiter/waitress doesn't report cash tips. Which is far more illegal than accidentally owing taxes due to stock trading.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to believe our country is stupid enough to stick this guy with a bill that large for more or less no reason at all. It is clear the wash sale rule is out there for a reason, and this IS NOT that reason."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk but the way Im understanding it you could close on dec 31 and be fine as long as you don’t buy again in Jan
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to close positions by Dec 31st. The person who said Nov.30th was not correct.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And not repurchasing or trading that same ticker for 31 days.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule only disallows claiming losses on open positions.

If he had closed all of his positions before EOY, he'd have only had to pay tax on the net gains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell on december 20 and buy back the same stock on jan 5, that's still a wash sale. If you buy a different stock in jan, thats tax loss harvesting (good thing)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $4 loss in the PLTR example is added to the cost basis of the $23 PLTR you subsequently buy. Now you've got PLTR worth $27, and if you sell below $27 you get a loss or above $27 a gain.

If the guy in the article sold everything by 12/31, he'd have been fine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The article is click bait crap and designed to advertise the need for tax professionals.

At the bottom of the article there is one sentence that tells the truth “The loss in the wash sale will be added to the cost basis of the next buy”

Meaning if you sell everything then you realize all of the losses along the way.

So if you lost 5, then 5 again, then 5 again, then gained 10, if you don’t sell that final stock that gained you 10 then you have officially gained 10 for tax purposes.

If you sell that 10 gainer then you realize all the losses and have your -5 for tax purposes.

So if you’re not sure about your wash sales because you bought and sold the same stocks over and over again then just sell all positions before the end of the year.

Your tax bill will be equivalent to all of your gains/losses for the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think once you sell your position in that stock and don’t repurchase for 30 days
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that's unexpected. Especially that last part across all accounts.
Wash sales are complicated"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The Forbs article used Apple stock and Apple options as an example of similar securities and stated it could apply. But I need to look into this more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct. And the $25k should have been added to the cost basis of your remaining position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm thinking so too, from what I've read.

And the -10k is very close to my actual incurred losses, so I'm willing to bet the wash sale rules inflated my cost basis (but then disallowed losses in about the same amount)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's right, and it's ""normal"" in the sense that most people lose money, at least on this sub. u/better_with_syrup, you're not going to be taxed on losses."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So like this: https://old.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/hji1dv/some_guru_said_trade_like_a_sniper_me_i_said/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I sell stock A at 20k, where my cost basis was at 10k. That's a 10k profit.

I sell stock B at 5k, where my cost basis was at 10k. That's a 5k loss.

I rebuy stock B **after** 30 days, so it doesn't go against the wash sale rule.

My net profit is 10k - 5k = 5k gain. Because I sold at a loss of stock B at a 5k loss, I only have to pay taxes for 5k, instead of 10k and I still have a position in stock B.

Essentially it's called tax loss harvesting, where investors will sell their losses towards the end of the year to offset their gains. However, because of the wash sale rule, you have to wait 30 days to buy back into the same stock, otherwise, you can't claim losses on your taxes. This is why I assume the guy in the article got screwed. He made 45k profit total, but because of his selling within 30 days, he can't claim any of it on his taxes and got a huge tax bill.

**edit: changed within to after on the rebuy**;"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What amongthewolves said. Essentially, you already loss money on the stock at the moment. Why not sell now, be at 5k loss to deduct from your capital gains and then buy back the stock? The end result is exactly the same except now you can deduct 5k from your capital gains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was trying to average down. I was selling for a loss of less than $100 and then bought back in although I'm a grade A dongus and managed to average up lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I see is ""sell by year end"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected. Thx
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"there are ways to get around this don't resign yourself to thinking you're screwed over because itll be your 4th trade in 5 days. For example say you have the $10 call on stock XYZ expiring Friday, but you can't sell because it would be the 4th trade. Instead of being forced to hold overnight, you can sell the $11 call expiring Friday. This essentially locks in your gains and then you can buy back the $11 call and sell the $10 call the next day. LMK if you want me to explain further"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't it only apply to margin accounts? If you have settled cash, you shouldnt have to worry about it.

I think.  I'm kinda dumb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what I’m foggy on too, would love an answer."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Thats exactly what the rule was for. Otherwise if the stock drops say 5%, you could insta sell and buy. And book in the losses and get a tax write off for 3k or whatever. So they make you wait 1 month."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can do that. Just don't buy it again for 30 days afterward.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"1)  3k loss can offset income as opposed to other cap gains. So you can come out ahead. 2) deferring taxes owed is better. Let's say I have 50k due this year. If I have 50k of losses to artificially harvest, I can just offset all those and maybe not owe them for years or decades. That's worse for the government. With stepped up basis at death, I could potentially even never pay them (although I think Biden is getting rid of this rule)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Ah thank you for the clarification. In the case where you did buy within 30 days prior though, when does the loss get realized? Say I add one share to my position on dec 15 and sell everything for a loss on dec 31. You are saying that’s a wash sale and that loss won’t be realized in that year. When does it get realized? Since I no longer have any shares to adjust cost basis on?

If you close the position and keep it closed for 30 days there is no wash sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, it would have to get realized on Dec 31st. I'm not sure why buying 30 days prior matters."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ty
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I don't get, it's just extra steps. The benefits I can think of for the IRS are 1) less losses claimed on Dec31, so simplified accounting (for now!), and 2) tax revenue *now* is better than tax revenue *later*. It's the same tax revenue, but they get to nab it earlier.

Also, think about that fella in the article: He'll pay $800k in taxes this year. Next year he'll get to effectively claim $800k in losses via increased cost basis, but with an $800k tax bill due *now* he'll have to liquidate everything to pay up... there won't be a next year for his portfolio. So they get to limit your actions, claim taxes *now* instead of later, and if you fuck up, they... end your trading career? Eliminating a tax revenue stream? I guess I really don't get it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've got it and are on it. 

The day trader in the article did that x1000 and ended up with a realized gain but all his losses tied up as adjusted cost basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why use less words when more words confuse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol the article is sensationalist...it's what sellls. he does not owe that. it doesnt matter if his wash sales are 1 billion dollars, you only pay taxes on your net economic gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word ""bankruptcy"" and expect anything to happen."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh honestly glossed over the second half of your post. Was just curious on how trustworthy the IRS could be.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hm, ok. Nov. 30 seemed right to ensure the 30 days has passed before the tax year closes. It might not be a law, but could be good practice in my opinion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Liberty or death, ramen or lambo 🚀"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh 

So maybe i was too broad in my solution. 

If you keep positions open but dont trade in it at all for the last month of the year so the 30 days goes by, would that solve the problem?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in a just world he would get a huge tax refund next year to cover this right?  But since they only allow a 3k claimed loss, I'm assuming he's fucked?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"One caveat on that which the article says

1) yes sell by end of the year
2) Can't buy any of them back in the first 30 days of the NEXT year

The wash sale rule for 30 days carries into the year for purchasing those assets back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok this makes more sense. I traded a SHIT ton of spy last year and didn’t have any wash issues in my taxes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I see, makes more sense now. Misleading article scaring me away from investing the $0 spare dollars I have."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s exactly what happened, assuming you sold any positions with a wash sale added to the cost basis before the end of the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not in a tfsa
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s risks to picking mark to market accounting since you will be accountable for all the capital appreciation of your stocks at the end of the year even if you haven’t sold them.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so set up a corp and then trade like normal?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is how you know the story is BS.

If you have margin turned off, no instant settlement, you can say trade with no limit, but you have to wait for the funds to settle which takes 2 days, no way to trade more than your account balance.

If you have margin enabled you have a margin day trade limit dollar amount.


This story is fake, it’s designed to scare people into consulting with tax experts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i've been day trading for four years with a margin PDT account and have never been limited in the number of trades i can take

i use td ameritrade

i have heard that they will close your account if you do something extreme like HFT with your account but i average over 20 trades per day (lots of scalps) and have never had an issue"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you were trying to average down you didn't need to sell.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And wait 30 days to reopen a position
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, thx buddy. Will go and smarten up on this topic to avoid $20 lessons in the future. Appreciate it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t lock in all of your gains  though, only some."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I figured it out, wash sales apply to buying a similar security to replace the one you claim a loss on.

So buying on 12/30 is not a replacement purchase, so no wash sale is triggered.

The ""30 days before"" is important to specify so someone can't get around wash sales by simply buying the same amount of stock right before selling the stock. For example, buy 100 shares AAPL on 12/15, buy 100 replacement shares on 12/29, then sell your first 100 shares on 12/30. The wash sale would trigger and apply the new cost basis to the 12/29 shares you are holding.

Also, wash sales are done intelligently. If you buy 200 shares of AAPL, sell 200, then rebuy 100; you get to claim losses on the 100 and the other half carries over as cost basis.

In conclusion, the only thing to care about is if you are making many wash sales and carrying a large cost basis to the next year while realizing fake gains this year. This is how you get stuck paying heavy gain taxes in 1 year and having many losses to claim in the next; like the guy in the article."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with that though? Rebuying would reset your cost basis so you can't claim the same losses in the future.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to understand also, but I think the idea is to stop this scenario:

I am heavily invested in 2 stocks A and B.

I buy A high at $100. A is way down at $20. 
I buy B low at $20. B is doing great and sitting at $150.

I want to realize gains from B, but it is also the end of the year and i want to try and minimize my taxes. But i'm also not really wanting to sell my A stock because i think it will recover. 

In a 3-d chess move, i sell B and realize those huge gains. I then sell A, realize that sweet, sweet tax write off and then _immediately_ buy back my position in A.

I just offset my capital gains on B, but i'm also still long on A.

(Wash rule aside) Of course if A moons now i'd have to pay that, but maybe it won't and so the reality is i just skirted real capital gains on B at the sake of potential gains on A. The idea is basically minimizing real gains at the ""cost"" of theoretical gains. 

If i could do this i'd basically be getting a tax free ""loan"" on my A stock ""losses"" for as long as I hold A. Or if A tanked further, id use it for further write offs. I'm keeping more money that actually should have gone to taxes and i'm tying that money up for as long as I feel like. 

Anyone know if i'm way off here? I think the key thing is most people are thinking of this in terms of a single stock, but this is about avoiding taxes from one stock by using another as a pawn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only logical reason is to prevent retail investors from day trading.  The industry doesn't have to follow these rules, these rules only serve to bankrupt retail investors that didn't know about them when they started day trading.

They only put you in prison when it's clear you hid money or you are actively trying to avoid them. Though even that depends on the sums involved.

You have to be extremely unlucky to be put in prison for ignorance as a normal person.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be able to buy in Jan 1st, then maybe that is why they suggest Nov 30th."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope.

Wash sales disallow the loss from being claimed, because they adjust the cost basis of the open position. Essentially, your previously realized loss is incorporated into your unrealized gain/loss from your current position.

Unrealized losses can't be claimed on taxes, so you have to close the position (before year-end) in order to get the tax benefits of your previous losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. If he sells everything right now he'll have a massive 2021 loss (let's say $1M) that he can apply to all his 2021 gains (let's say he'll make $10k this year) but can't have more than net 3k of loss for 2021. So his 2021 income is reduced by 3k, then $987K of loss gets carried forward to 2022, applies against his capital gains but not more than 3k of net loss, carry forward to 2023, etc etc.

I think the ideal treatment would be letting him extend his 2020 tax year to activity over 1/1/20 to 3/31/21 so the gains and losses cancel out, and then shorten his 2021 year to 4/1/21 to 12/31/21."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i have a 100k account with margin and buying power of 400k, i can take a 400k trade, close it, take another 400k trade, close it, etc. i have never hit a limit on trades with td ameritrade in years of trading every day with margin.

i don't trade with full margin very often but there are some days where i've done it more than once.

i have racked up high eight figure annual trading volumes on a low six figure account, so an 800k reported income from wash sales seems plausible to me if someone has no clue about the wash trade rule and they trade excessively on a certain ticker all year.

fwiw the worst i ever had to report was 90k income from wash sales. that sucked but i made enough money that year to easily cover the tax hit. it's possible for someone to lose money on the year but still have to report income from wash sales. that's when it really hurts"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a limit even if you never reached it.. This person had a 30,000 account and supposedly traded millions with that each day."

However, I've not seen too many posts drawing attention to the price of the golden arches being used to gauge market confidence. America's favorite drive-thru restaurant is FUCKING HUGE, and world wide, and even if Hedgie's blow up the market with financial fuckery, investors can always trust in the ice-cream machines working! **THAT DOESNT MEAN BUY IT NOW!**!! It still falls like everything else, BUT let's see how it compares to the overall market...

Below I've provided a comparison to MickeyDee's against the S&P 500 going back to 2015.

[Edit: Added a Yellow Question Mark because Ape's like more pictures](https://preview.redd.it/qn1gcag0j2q61.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=e258647aa0a0080dd90d4d1a8d0239bf850e6a3e)

By the comparison you see that when MickeyDee's rises a significant amount, outside of it's given trend, we see the market dip pretty soon after, usually within 2-4 weeks.

Some people that finished high school argue that it's due to investors not being sure of the economy and wanting to hedge their bets. Think of it like investing in gold when shit hits the fan, only it's the Golden Arches.

And something about investors finding cyclicals, but I still haven't found my wife's yet.

If you zoom into July you could also argue that it did/didn't predict a slide in stocks, but it doesn't stand out as much as the other 4 times so I left it out.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People just need to be paid more. minimum wage is so shit even the better mcdonalds wont pay it. I really think the store near me that pays min is much worse than the store above.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starbucks and McDonald's will eventually merge, what's the prop bet on the new name?  Anyone?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the 🌈🐻 are only getting warmed up more dips bigger dips and so much red you'd think you were in china
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,7 layer dip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,McDip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like dip and chip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"no, ths last dip was identifying that there is a bowl of sip on the table. 

the real dip has yet to come methinks. 

the retards have now picked up their checkers and are about ready to plunge them red and black discs into the 7 layer dip and pull up some griffin beans."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to WallStreetBets!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure COVID bought us more time before the 🌈🐻 crash.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"One off ""*witty*"" comments are the BEST!

You're also probably just assuming that the above post shows that stocks peak right before they drop ( Great OBSERVATION You Made Batman!) and you sure as shit can pick damn near any stock to show that....

But, if you take more time to look at the chart then it took you to come up with your witty take, you'd see that McD's shoots up weeks before, not the day before, everything goes to hell, and there's even a case to be made that when McD comes back down to it's original trending channel, it can signify investor confidence returning in the market....

But hey, if you're here reading these shitty posts, you're just as dumb as the rest of us. Welcome Brother!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,bring me that 4 for 4 baby
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Off at 10am right? Just want to make sure you’re working the busy shift

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i deliver for uber, and when i pick up an order from fast food places they’re busy af and these kids busting their asses while i make tripple their wage just sitting in a car listening to music. poor bastards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure why you're being down voted, but you're 100% correct. In the past, most McD's franchises have been forced into paying minimum wage due to extremely high franchise fees by corporate McD's and the forced low prices (that are also set by regional corporate McD's). Recently McD's everywhere have began raising there prices across the board and improving on quality. They will eventually dig themselves out of the hole they are in and be able to provide quality product and service comparable to chik-fil-a."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My first job in high school paid like 30% over minimum wage. Why does ANYONE work at freaking Mcdonalds for that pay?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks as though you may have spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The touchscreen you've mentioned saves less than one job. It is more about convenience and speed for the customer. It would only eliminate a job in an extremely high volume restaurant with multiple touchscreen ordering stations. Even then the job would be just be moved to another part of the restaurant. The ""automated cooking"" you mentioned is nowhere near possible at this point and honestly not worth mentioning. Your entire comment seems condescending towards quick service restaurants as a whole and there is probably a lot that you do not understand about those businesses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,A strong contender no doubt.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just when I go long on grizzly bear futures and toonies...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard the reason was its a bitch to clean so employees don't always bother and just say its out of order.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen it in Florida after it was discontinued elsewhere. I agree it was one of the best things on the menu.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much. The first option I bought was a $10 RKT 33c at the top earlier this month. That shit expired worthless. I had no idea how overpriced it already was. But good news is that I'm jacked to the tits on shares at 24.30 now, and a couple 4/1 calls to boot. This shit is about to pay me back."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I lost $10k on $400 GME calls expiring 3/19. Never play earnings, you’ll only lose. Have November 800 calls though *wink wink*"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The Boys from amazon prime. It is an amazing show. The most believable representation if superheroes were a reality.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The Boys. A superhero series on Amazon Prime.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you can fucking google it but I'll explain. Basically they are options that expire that very same day....can potentially make huge profits since they are so cheap...but since they expire that same day usually you will just watch them become worthless in a manner of hours.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are limited time contracts that let you buy 100 shares of stock at a set price if and when a stock is above a certain price.  They do not give you any stock, you have the -option- to pay additional money to buy up the stock once the conditions are met, until the option expires.  If the conditions of the option aren't met, it is worthless and nothing happens.

Options that seem impossible to reach (eg, requires the stock to double by the end of the day) can be bought for very cheap, which can make you a ton of money if the impossible happens (stock quadruples before the day ends, so you get to buy stock for only the doubled price stated in the option.)

It goes deeper when you write options on the stocks you own to sell to other people to get a stream of income, (if the options conditions aren't met, you keep your stock while pocketing the money that the option buyer paid for the option, but if the conditions -are- met, and the option buyer decides to exercise, you have to sell your stock to them at the agreed price) but overall it's just one extra layer to gambling on the market."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I went in with practically Monopoly money (disclosure: I have 36 shares long HAS that was bought for me years ago) and haven’t applied for options trading because if I’ve lost 10% in long positions in 2 months so options would just let me lose the other 90% in 2 weeks. I’m better off just sending money to others here directly and cut out the middleman.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just look for stocks with good fundamentals that have taken a nosedive recently. Have a look through the option chain, look for a strike price that is over the current price. Now check which strike has the most volume. A lot of good contracts can be had from anywhere between $5-$50. The price for a $5 contract would be listed as . 05 as it represents 100 shares. Don't worry too much about that though. Just look for low price, sell high. Start off small with one contract to get your feet wet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Look for something that downturn buy a bunch of options for .05 or cheaper like 100. Even if it trends up 5 mins later you can double up. If you wait around close to strike could net thousands.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up credit and debit spreads. You offset the cost of the option by selling another option at a different strike. There's all sorts of strategies for this. Avoid options with high bid/ask spreads if you can though.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy a call to speculate, buy a put to hedge.
Hedge: protect a position from going tits up

Speculate: lock-in a price expecting to go up.

Example: I buy a call for amc at 4$. Stock goes to 10. I make 6 minus any premium.

Stock goes to 20 after execution of call, you buy a put to protect your nuggets. Up 16 because you got in at 4. You buy a put at 16. Stock goes back to 4 but you close your position and lock in those tendies. 

Hope this helps"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"as someone who just learned and have put some money into them.... what I've figured out is that you don't want to diversify when you play options, as more often than not, they expire worthless.... (unless you buy deep ITM). Pick a really good looking play and play it. Set risk levels to get out when it starts turning the other way. Mathematically there's like a 1/3 chance you get any guac at all.... so if you are only playing a single play, you can get out at a lower profit and your account will be green from it. If you play a wide range across multiple stocks, you have to let your winners really run or else your losers will drown them. 


Also the bid and ask prices can screw you over badly. If the options market for that particular stock isn't busy enough. Try setting your own buy and sell levels for some extra gains. It really adds up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,buy ntm calls on dips in big names.  pretty easy.  dont buy puts.

The blowup has prompted questions about oversight, particularly because Archegos amassed tens of billions of dollars in stock bets without disclosing its positions to other market participants."" 

Eheheh I love it when HF get sucked into their own 💩"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My theory is that Hwang's brokers were looking at the overall market conditions and they no longer liked the risk to reward ratio so they margin called his ass before he lost all their money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this hedge fund's defaulted margin call made banks have to unwind like $20 - $30 billion via block trades... It was a family office, so all the money it had was this dude Bill Huang's money. I heard earlier that they think he was leveraged 7:1. Let's run with that. Assuming the lower end of the aforementioned range, that means he was worth about $3B.

Three. Billion. Dollars.

And he was levered 7:1.

If I was worth $3B and someone asked me what my risk tolerance was, my answer would be ""fucking ZERO. I am rich as whale milk and all I need to do is not lose all of my money. If it could make a tiny bit over inflation that's fucking wonderful."" I'd be knee deep in top-grade bonds and ancient, boring companies with good dividends and strong balance sheets. And this fuck could've just done that and been insanely rich for the rest of his life, but instead he decides he wants to be in a position that if shit goes south by 12.5% he's tits up.

What a legend. Someone get that man some crayons."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What’s so funny about Archegos is that Hwang went balls deep in CFDs, one of the most degenerate, if not the most degenerate, financial products around. For the uninformed US retail traders, CFDs are they’re like options without premiums or limited losses. 

Hwang probably looked at calls and thought “not risky enough. I need unlimited losses.”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">  Still, the industry is arguably much better equipped to handle such meltdowns because of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis that forced banks to hold significantly more capital as a buffer against losses. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

normies will never understand finance....

There are two sorts of financial laws for big players:

1) the laws that are so generic that if you applied them, the economy would stop functioning

2) the laws that are so specific that you sidestep them by literally by changing the title of your Word document and creating a new office that does the same thing as the old one but with a different name.

Literally nothing has changed since 2008, it's just that the old fuckers got fired and the new fuckers will be afraid to get fired for a few years or until they get 10+ millions, whichever comes first.

But don't worry, if THOSE new fuckers get fired, a brand new generation is ready to step up and repeat the old mistakes."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How did these bank's Risk Management departments let them get so exposed? Jebus wept ...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There was one fund margin called (Archegos aka Bill Hwang). Not multiple. Why is that so hard for people to understand here?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't US fund is greensill capital? They filled for bankruptcy recently. And credit suisse was involved with them, not archegos."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. This is just the beggining. Other funds will start to unwind forcing others to unwind. This is the way of the market
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No one ever seems to pay for all these financial crimes.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Crazy leveraged asians
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To answer your question, yes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I will admit i am a common smooth brain. After reading again I see where I misread OPs article from Yahoo. My bad lol but I do agree we will see more margin calls in the future and do think (while unlikely) it is possibly another hedge fund has been margin called without public notice being made yet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just gonna break in here and say something. I have read several articles about this and up until just now I have been waiting to find out who the other unnamed hedge fund was. 

Thank you for clarifying that I am a retard."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"first of all, let me thank you for taking the time to ask me that question. yes i am."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s honestly dumb. The bank literally stated that Hwangs family fund would have little impact but the unnamed hedgie  being margin called could result in substantially loses. Yet everyone is focusing on old Hwang while this big US hedgie gets a sentence of mention.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And then use all the money to adopt gorillas instead
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And then we short that gofundme page and have the hegies pay us!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So fuk. 

Goldman left the tab for other prime brokers, now they fuk. 

They gonna fuk back on goldman. 

Lots of fuks getting fuk. 

Citadel get fuk and rek. 

GME -7 beta go moon moon boom boom."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooooo! Hedgie long value drop.... soooo ... hedgie value closer to margin call? Banana owed worth more than banana owned? So man want banana back now!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Difference being the amount of leverage Archegos was using versus the amount of assets under Managment. Citadel won’t be affected
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But on the surface he looks calm and ready
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this going to affect the market? Dumb ape gotta ask smarter apes for guidance 🙌🏽

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“We haven’t seen anything yet, but we’re sure the tits are on the other end of this colon:”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct. Dodd-Frank repealed prior exemptions that allowed Family Offices to have outside clients other than employees, therefore regulators are less concerned about a family office since they will never manage public money.

Reporting requirements are also much more loose for hedge funds in general when it comes to derivatives, OTC products, and short stock. Those tend to be reported after the position has been closed. Having to report something that isn’t legally required is just more busy work. Ain’t nobody got time for that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Any chance of vacation on Grand Cayman with a new offshore account and perhaps a contract for difference domiciled on the Isle of Man or perhaps Luxembourg?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s six sigma?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Levered to the tits with bermudan swaptions on whale milk.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow that guy is full of shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey this might work: each WSB eats as many red creyons as can be found and there will be no more color red so the market is fixed and green
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, true. We will need to ask him durring his AMA."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are for desert. Or the entree. Or the appetizer. But always eventually. And always the last one you eat.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kind of like an inbreed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did this guy max his charisma or what? If I'm wealthy and trying to get someone to invest for me, or a brokerage offering leverage, I don't think my first choice would be someone barred from managing money for 5 years after pleading guilty to insider trading."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know that. His fund got blown up like a WSB Robinhood account. 

I was addressing how he got his own fund in the first place."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,10 shares AMC?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Archegos was reported over the weekend as being Asian. This article referred to a US hf. Rereading it, it is probably the same one. Asian, but registered to do business under US  governance."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But we are not really seeing that yet, do we? If other HF are being margin called because of this we would see the effects very soon, no? So far the market doesn't seemed phased at all."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No Thank you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have their own KAREN! Lucky fucks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Since when was losing your own money a crime. If that’s the case then lock me up too

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean maybe, but seems like no at this point. At least not on the scale of Hwang.

It takes quite the autist to lever up 3-5x with over $10b and get margin called, even for a hedge fund."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wallstreet tends to cover the ones that pay them.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"May just be, in my modest opinion, the best GME Reddit reply of all time."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Lots of fuks getting fuk.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,“Unnamed hedgefund” wonder who that’ll be.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity most def sending this guy a letter
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,“Guh”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No way to pay. ..'guh'
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the reason for the domino effect is the declining shares because of the huge liquidations. $VIAC and $DISCA are already down 50% if other huge HF would be margin called because of their own big positions you would expect the price to fall even further and  other shares starting to tumble as well. Yet yesterday both stocks stabilized and the wider market didn't care at all.

&#x200B;

I am not saying this will not have further ramifications, but if this was such a huge deal for the wider market, I would have expected more unwinding to happen faster, no?

&#x200B;

I also wonder if $20B  to $50B is really so much in HF terms. That is about a week of Powells QE in March 2021."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Say something and you’ll never go to heaven
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Six sigma balls lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Six Sigma is a lean initiative. It cuts out unnecessary work from a particular task. It also improves overall cost inefficiency. For instance, I need to move this money across town to the bank. 
Think of ways to improve the process. Let’s take a more efficient route to avoid the most traffic lights. Let’s use a bigger truck. Can we use smaller lighter shipping containers to maximize the containers per haul? Is there a better way to stack the money inside the container? Let’s remove this process because it has no value.

Do you get the idea?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Of that there is a strong possibility. Maybe that's why they keep doing the same routine they are to stupid to do better.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Y’all remember that band hatebreed? lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, it’s ridiculous how they allowed him to leverage that much with his history of fraud."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,4 PLTR and a 6 pack?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, Bill Hwang is Korean, but is based in NYC along with Archegos."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's US dumbass. Based in NYC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the first one he blew up was called Asian Tiger or something?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, thank you."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He mistook leverage for genius.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My favorite line was “so fuk”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Archegos.  Not sure the confusion on this now.  Citadel is a massive Market Maker too.  As long as GME has run its fantasy to think Griffith hasn’t hedged out at this point using the cash that the MM side of the business generates jf he had too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s another Asian hedge fund. This has nothing to do with GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Market bloody like shark week that’s my cue to buy the dip! 🧠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now mind you I'm  baby boomer, last of my kind, but I don't scare easily.  I've seen some money come and go to these guys before."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Especially the part about...""We will no longer be monitoring your account for losses. You're on your own homie."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“The blowup has prompted questions about oversight, particularly because Archegos amassed tens of billions of dollars in stock bets without disclosing its positions to other market participants.

Hwang’s family office did so by entering into derivative transactions with banks that gave him exposure to companies without buying actual shares.”

Probably 70% of hedgehogs. This is where shit might go down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re raising money to repair our ageing FD’s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That did not clear things up for me...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the implications for stocks is, rather than just going up for no reason, stocks will go up when costs are cut."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I personally liked “Citadel get fuk and rek”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea mb it is indeed Archegos.

“The blowup has prompted questions about oversight, particularly because Archegos amassed tens of billions of dollars in stock bets without disclosing its positions to other market participants.”


This was my main point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It has everything to do with hedgefunds and the market, I don’t think this is a GME thread."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Says in the article the 2nd one is a US hedge fund
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,In a “short” time frame. Thursday will be a shit show
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you feel brave. I'm keeping an eye on some of my options and swing trades but otherwise plan to avoid the PMSy bitch entirely. You don't know if she's gonna make a Sammie or stab you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You got me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's an unrelated method for continuously improving processes. He means they should put some fucking efford in.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m saying the banks are cutting the fat. Hedges that are over burdened will fall. They will sell off more blocks. Those prices will take a hit. This will overburden others that are now passed there ability to maintain the new rules. Do you see the snowball rolling now?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Uhmmmm
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree it has more to gain just don’t sell be prepared for sub 15 and you will be fine.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t have any more damn money.
How can I buy more when I’m BROKE!

All in baby."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember those days, I’m ready because I did buy more.  I’m all in right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,In 10 years maybe you’ll have your answer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What potential? For enough retards to gobble it up to 40 again? It’s a good company, but I feel it’s overvalued for sure and a long term hold."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technoking Elon, The God Emperor of Mankind, and Empress Cathie the 1st of ARK Prime has a nice ring to it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Baby steps
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Be glad, you’ve lost a lot less than the rest of some of us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get it right it’s for GME, AMC and PLTR bro."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What charts are you looking at? I’m calling the PLTR floor at 19.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Corner handys 1 tug per PLTR share, you do the math."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s been red for two months across the overall market, don’t worry this will rebound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If I can average 1% gain per day (haha!) That's double my money in 2-3 months, 10x return year-over-year. 

To make that baseline, I would need to hit a 10.4% gain in two weeks. 

I bought these two shares at $21.85 on Thursday last week, so I would need it to pass $24.14 either this week or next, which I think has a high probability given all available information.

As long as I can buy back in below that number again..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I bought them last week at $21.85 so I'm still up some
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We will see who is right soon enough
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That won’t get me very far, I sold my hands last week for the nth dip.

I have feet, but I’d feel dirty about it.
I heard we only need 1 kidney though..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,lol. Gains and PLTR. You make me laugh.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought around $23...  it bought a decent amount.
Stings a bit at the moment but I have hope."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,pltr to anything in the teens won't happen...lowest it will go is 19.99 for 1 second before it bounces.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How big is your mouth, can you fit 2 at once.  If so you are laughing!  Mostly gagging, but still laughin!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry; it'll hit $27 this week or next before it goes back down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously can’t read a chart trading at $21.64 rn so we will see soon enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I have principles"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today was a good day.

MARA was good to me.
Just exited at $44, back in the green."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you have no clue what you are talking about if you think pltr is gonna hit $15....TA is some of the dumbest shit...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell those too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,11-16-2020 look at the chart wise guy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deal!

Wait, no I’m up today.
Hold that thought."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"and?!?!  TA is dumb af dude...look at jan-27th, I think it will go to $39 before $15....good luck though with your charts lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stay broke 😉😘
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,no where near $15 ..you're wrong and you're telling me to stay broke??? okayyyyyy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Time will tell won’t it?? If I could bet you personally I absolutely would and let you name the amount 🤷🏻‍♂️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s closer to $15 than it’s high isn’t it ???
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it won't break $20 ever again, unless the whole market tanks ."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So your discounting the S&P rebalancing from Tesla that will take place soon.  NIO TSLA PLTR so many more way off their highs... trade and see.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey, good luck buddy ....i bought some 22.5 weeklies...calls of course."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I expect the market to have a temporary rise on the quarterly pension fund buys and then sell. 😘

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR still a thing?, Cathie would be proud of ya'll for not letting ARK look like fools and allowing this stock to tank to the prices it belongs in."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's like Loss Foreplay
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just bought 400 shares at $21.60, if it dips more, I buy more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should convert those to at the money calls, say for November, because as long as PLTR gets back to like $25 a share or higher you would have better returns"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once it hits, $0.00 you win a prize"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn’t you dollar cost average in?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,💎🤚
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re doing data analysis on how many retards will buy into a company they don’t use and know nothing about
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you missed the IPO days. There was PLTR option gain porn daily. This is a 5+ year hold anyways so I never worry about the short term fluctuations.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s hilarious AF, since I barely researched the company today and went all in.  Now. watch it drop to $10."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hwang in there!

Originally bought at 35. Averaged down till 27.
Will continue to average down each time I reach -20%. At least until I have funds...
I frankly hope that we will stop the fall at around 20"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Avg down easy right now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s PLTR so it prob will. I thought the dip was at $23 where I bought all my shares. This stock is gonna rip up though when market changes over. I think tomorrow may be a slow bleed again and then weds is our big Green Day, Thursday takes a little back bc closed Friday."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good point, shares are definitely fine but the amount of options holders (myself included at a point) that lose money on this mf is hilarious"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow going to suck a dick again. Weds will be just meh and Thursday going to be down with no volume.  This week already is determined to blow. If the entire Nasdaq doesn’t start to turn around next week then I guess sub 20 is totally going to happen.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$3.50
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am. I’m not considering the dips as a lost, and the covered calls are just pure profits."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I will buy a gazillion shares at $3.5. I guess I’ll just keep holding mine at $28

Only problem is, A M C took advantage of all of the hype, you’re literally paying 6 X the valuation for a company that never had near the amount of short interest that GME had, you might squeeze it back to 12 or even 14, but it simply doesn’t have the dynamics to send it further. I hope you all prove me wrong though, I’ll be watching from the sidelines. God speed soldiers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, ""un-researched FUD"". This comes straight from the company's SEC filings. You can read them all in the link at the bottom, but you'd probably just prefer to follow sentiment blindly. Not really sure where I've ever referenced a motley fool article either, but whatever. 

I'm not saying that the vote to release another 5 million shares is definitive. What I am saying is they've already released another around 3.5 million shares in the last 6 months. Most of us realize that a stock's price rises with demand which is tied to supply. Take GME for example, it was shorted to 140% of float, and float was around 45 mil (almost 10x less than AMC today, but closer to 2x less four months ago), it didn't take much demand for the price to rise, and for shorts to cover because there weren't that many shares available. Now, we look at AMC, there are roughly 404 mil shares float, with 11% of that volume shorted as of 3/15. This stock peaked in January when there were only 100 mil shares available, and a significant amount of the stock being shorted, it peaked again around the time retail was receiving their stimulus checks. I personally don't see how anyone could hold this stock knowing the intentions of the board members, and the potential for this bubble to pop if they were to release another substantial offering, but to each their own i guess.

How are they always following the same trendline? The answer is ETFs. Okay take $AMC completely out of the equation, the stock falls to $0.00. How much more power does that give the HFs to short the ETFs $GME is in? 

&#x200B;

I wouldn't be so quick to spread FUD on $AMC. It is inadvertently helping the HFs everyone is SUPPOSED to be against. Right now, $AMC is helping spread attention, but take one out of the equation and the house of cards falls, and not in your favor."

Their cash flow is already limited & the people at the bottom are suffering for it while he's getting big bonuses... Optics of it don't look great. As for the stock price, tf did he do to contribute 😂. Went up mostly cuz retail investors on reddit as far as I know. Don't totally understand the whole diluting shares thing, but I feel like that had something to do with my 80% gains dropping to 0% in 3 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean there are people in this thread about AMC denying AMC is currently trying to dilute shares and payout bonuses. So I mean, FOMO is real. It causes bias and people to see what they want and act on emotion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they did... Parroted opinion about the execs, check. Plus they were in at 2500 and it tanked 567? What the hell price point did they buy in at?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they keep diluting. I think gme is a better stock if you are banking on a squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never said I was ""big on GME"", It just makes for a good comparison since they're brought up simultaneously here, and said to ""squeeze"" for the same reasons. 

Big shocker here: Nearly all stocks follow the same trendline, especially those that are grouped into the same industry ( like entertainment, or meme stocks) **most of the time,** with the exception of certain factors like negative news, additional share offerings, lawsuits, etc. that impact the individual stock. Have you asked yourself why GME is up 10.5% now, while AMC is down 1.5%? Maybe the market is factoring in the impending dilution?

&#x200B;

Most people know that the market is comprised of mainly ETFs, index funds, hedge funds, etc. The idea that HF's team up and push one stock goes to zero and then all go and pile on another is laughable, you think they don't compete against each other too? You think they don't have access to short interest data, and understand the metrics of why a stock might rise or fall?

&#x200B;

I wouldn't be so quick to accuse others of spreading FUD, I'm only trying to bring attention to the actual factors that will drive the price up or down in an attempt to warn new investors of the repercussions should there be further dilution.

&#x200B;

With all the time you spend on here defending AMC in every bearish comment, I'm not convinced that you aren't working for an institution of some sort that seeks to gain by keeping the price inflated. That or you bought in at $20 and are desperate for some sort of confirmation bias. I've already made my money on this one, and I'm moving on. Good luck."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, I was looking at an X .01 abbreviated chart and mistyped. Fucked for sure if that passes, I highly doubt retail is organized enough to vote against it, or if they even have the amount of votes required. Institutional investors hold AMC's debt and want a return on their investment long term, the only way for them to get there is to sell more shares, cover debt, and do a buyback further down the road. There is little upside to the short term here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At 88% retail holding, it would take a literal act of God for that to pass, but lets ignore that. Not one single person that has received a voting form is voting yes to the 500,000,000 shares.

&#x200B;

Also, where are you getting ""release"" from? It is to add 500,000,000 shares which WOULD not enter the market until a later vote. This vote is just to add them, an additional vote has to take place to put them on the market."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Theta gang all the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you turn that much money down? I wouldn't.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are people in here that are even worse. They think a shareholder vote, to which AMC holders are voting on as we speak, means that the shares have ALREADY been diluted even though the outcome won't even be announced until May 4th. One of the dangers of relying on random Reddit users instead of reading the documents there selves.

&#x200B;

I also saw a bunch of people who said they would sell GME the moment any additional stock options were announced, but I'm guessing they're still ""Diamond hands"" after a bunch of Reddit users told them what they think the 10K is implying.

&#x200B;

Case in point, everyone is full of shit. Don't listen to Reddit users for financial advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They don’t have that many shares outstanding compared to some businesses. Apes are just going to keep buying these shares and holding. Might not have a major short squeeze but gamma squeezes are likely with a wild option chain.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some GME not as much as id like to have tho. Soemthings better than nothing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"--Maybe the market is factoring in the impending dilution?

Then they would be as foolish as most of the people that post the dilution has already happened, because markets don't usually speculate on what happens in a month, but retail investors do! Dilution and equity offerings are typically signs of GROWTH to most of the market, it means partnerships or other company based incentives, but it isn't good for stockholders. Most look at earnings, fundamentals, and annual data. Both AMC and GME are not trading on the fundamentals, one is a theater that risked bankruptcy during a pandemic, the other closed business on very few locations still allowing foot traffic and STILL had to close almost 700 locations; needless to say, none of us are trading fundamentals, it is ALL speculation. Just look at what happened to $GME  when the ""considering additional equity options"" was mentioned. That didn't seem to affect the stock or sentiment all that much, it also isn't being parroted as fact widely, because we all want to believe that Cohen would rather ride bankruptcy than cost us tendies, lol, get real. In fact, with all the big promises Cohen is laying out they would be stupid NOT to introduce shares for equity on those projects, i.e. you lose, Gamestop wins.



--That or you bought in at $20 and are desperate for some sort of confirmation bias

Actually, I averaged down to $9 and some change from $12. Yes, every negative sentiment towards YOUR opinion is obviously a bagholder OR some institution trying to rake in money...even though institutions typically trade class B and not class A common stock on the open market...anyway."

2021-03-30 03:46:51,wallstreetbets,"QQQ Priced for Perfection Can Only Go Down Short Term Greetings boner biting bastards,

I've been wondering for the past couple weeks what the bull case for the nasdaq 100 is. Let's see if you smooth brains can handle this next level vaccine boosted (both doses) thought process. 

**Booming economy leading to inflation**

This should be obvious. Pandemic goes away, everyone goes out and spends lots of money, prices increase to meet demand, inflation ensues. Some are arguing this will only be temporary, like Papa Powell. Papa is so against real inflation he's said he's gonna let inflation run hot for a while, maybe as high as 2.4% this year.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio)

But you know what? Powell doesn't control interest rates (kinda but not really). And if the bond market starts to feel like yields are not getting enough bang for their buck, Uncle Sam will have a hard time finding buyers at the next treasury auction. If interest rates rise and depending on how quickly, the Nasdaq will have a real pullback since all these unicorns won't have access to cheap money anymore.

**Pandemic 2.0**

Just when you thought it was safe to kiss grandma, new variants are making covid cool again. Brazil is seeing an uptick in deaths among younger patients as a result of new variants. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift)

Parts of Europe are going into lockdowns again because of poor vaccine rollouts, pussies. Lets imagine covid doesn't go away as planned and continues to cause problems. This would lead to another general stock market pullback. Maybe not as big as last year, who knows? But all indexes are priced far above pre pandemic levels.

**So what's the bull case?**

I'm asking you, what's the bull case? Perhaps I'll be able to figure it out after my third covid vaccine

I'm bearish on TSLA also, but guess what, QQQ can rotate out of it if they want to and momentum takes it that way. Rotation out of tech would cause some downward pressure for QQQ, but it's offset by growth in other areas. There's already talks of stimulus round 4, with a massive vaccination rate.

AAPL sales have already proven to be fairly pandemic resistant.

Look at AMZN's quarterly sales numbers:

Consistent growth, every year with massive holidays spikes, so yes people are going to buy more stuff. The same is true with MSFT and cloud/team subscriptions.  


It sounds to me like you're assuming the world is either going to a) completely stop or b) people are going to suddently stop using large cap tech products like they have literally never done before. I find it far more likely we see middle to upper-middle class people who have been able to refi and buy homes at the lowest rates in history, who have been unable to spend discretionary income on anything due to shutdown and are sitting in their houses on a shitload of cash:

“Retail growth trend will continue”

I don't have a landlord but I have to pay crazy real estate taxes. I don't have any asshole immediate neighbors but I need to keep my house and yard looking good. My appliances are nice but when shit breaks, I need to fix it. Etc.
I think plusses far far outweigh the minusses thus I own a house.

This morning, $HGEN released their great [P3 topline results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005301/en/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3-Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19) showing a 54%(!!!) relative reduction (Lenzilumab vs. standard of care) in the studies primary endpoint (ventilator free survival through day 28) in the mITT population - which was **statistically significant**. The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on 88.56m volume vs. 32.15m float). This is still a GREAT entry point imo and still below the February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased... I expect the price to rise a lot this week.

The next step for $HGEN is EUA application and (hopefully) approval. This is the big ticket and when the stock will really 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Other updates worth noting today - Humanigen announced that they drew the $25m loan from Hercules Capital and suspended their ATM agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-8k-2021-march-29-18715-40)). They also announced an offering of 5m shares ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-424b5-2021-march-29-18715-832)). $HGEN is gearing up for Lenz production.

Things to look out for in the coming days/weeks are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA application and approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Originally posted Thursday on r/stocks:

Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered® anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID – patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don’t matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here’s a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What’s also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn’t target the virus – it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: “GM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.”… “Our findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds”

Here’s another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‐CSF might be a key feature of SARS‐CoV‐2‐induced cytokine storm in COVID‐19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I’ve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN’s Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results – with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab – a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF – recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab’s chance of success
4. Here’s a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: “Aware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement”
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH – this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab’s efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It’s all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID – getting worse**

As many of you might’ve heard, COVID isn’t going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it’s new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it’s looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here’s a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here’s an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

**Partnerships**

1. Humanigen was the only micro cap company chosen for **Operation Warp Speed** (an initiative to facilitate and accelerate the development, manufacturing, and distribution of COVID-19 vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics) -> [Source](https://ir.humanigen.com/news/news-details/2020/Humanigen-Announces-Cooperative-Research-and-Development-Agreement-with-the-US-government-to-Develop-Lenzilumab-for-COVID-19/default.aspx). Humanigen in collaboration with BARDA to increase manufacturing capacity
2. License agreement with KPM Tech/Telcon RF Pharamceutical company for Lenzilumab production in South Korea and the Phillipines. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20201103005167/en/Humanigen-Executes-Licensing-Agreement-for-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-in-COVID-19-with-KPM-TechTelcon-RF-Pharmaceutical-for-South-Korea-and-the-Philippines)\]
3. Partnership with Thermo Fisher to scale up manufacturing. \[[Source](https://www.fiercepharma.com/manufacturing/humanigen-thermo-fisher-reach-agreement-to-scale-up-manufacturing-monoclonal-antibody)\]
4. Partnership with Emergent Biosolutions for development and manufacturing. \[[Source](https://investors.emergentbiosolutions.com/news-releases/news-release-details/humanigen-and-emergent-biosolutions-announce-contract-0)\]

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here’s a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling – US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn’t include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN’s market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock’s low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS – CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don’t have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don’t want to downplay this, I think it’s very promising and I’m very bullish on it, but I’m admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There’s 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I already been waiting 6 months bro
2021-03-30 01:56:04,wallstreetbets,"PSXP, the hidden strangle bet. One day I was looking for long term value stocks, doing some basic screening, high dividends and low P/E ratios. Simple.

I came across PSXP, which has a extremely high distribution of roughly 12%. I looked deeply into the fundamentals of this company, finding it great. Extremely undervalued. They have strong relations with their General Partner (Phillips 66), and no sign of that ending anytime soon. They are a cash machine, with a safe distribution. There is no reason that it shouldn't have risen to about $55, where it was Pre-Covid. It is currently at $30. The units are really cheap. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

&#x200B;

[1 year chart for stock price](https://preview.redd.it/3nmz6depg1q61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6485fac7902bd05637626096b481c2c1801d29c)

That's when I realized about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which unfortunately, they own about 25%. They are overleveraged about this, representing about 13% of their adjusted EBITDA. The problem with this is that the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) is currently under disputation whether it should be shut down, with most people agreeing that they will shut it down. DAPL took out 2.5 billion in debt, and PSXP will be forced to take their fair share of that debt. The lowering in cash flow, more debt, and potential fees for operating the pipeline without an easement, would most likely bring in a cut to the distribution, and the stock will lose value.

Doing more research, I found the pipeline is currently still operating. There is a court date April 9th, which will determine whether the operator, Energy Transfer, can keep it operating. If it is forced to close, PSXP will probably reach to the low $20s. Naturally this seems like puts are the way to go.

However, there is still a chance that they could keep it open, and the Environment Impact Statement still has a year until finished, so the opportunity for them to keep it operating for even a year is huge. This would probably carry the stock higher, especially without the worry of an dividend cut. The price would most likely exceed $38, potentially as high as $50.

I used to own, but I'm selling for a small gain. The natural bet would be options, in a strangle like pattern. The opportunity is too good to not play. The options are also really cheap, allowing huge upside. For me, I like APR 16 options and MAY 21. $35 and $25 calls/puts is what I will be doing personally. I already have various positions. I also have been trying to get $40 APR 16 calls for $1 per contract. The upside is huge and the return on investment could be easily 100 times on those.

[My current positions in PSXP](https://preview.redd.it/zaytype2h1q61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de4fb49bcec6ae5e6a49404802f85b643ceaf7)

This option profit calculator contains my current positions and my hopes. I feel like this is a bet that something will happen, which feels like almost a guarantee. However, if they push the court date back, or its a wash, I will probably have a hard time selling the contracts. But I feel like its bound to move.

***This is not financial advice. Please trade and invest at your own risk. I own various option positions in PSXP.***"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This is actually really solid DD. I had to check I was in the right sub...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trial was originally scheduled for Feb 9, 2021, and delayed to April 9.  


What's stopping another delay? (Source: [https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/STANDINGROCKSIOUXTRIBEvUNITEDSTATESARMYCORPSOFENGINEERSDocketNo11?1617069557](https://www.bloomberglaw.com/public/desktop/document/STANDINGROCKSIOUXTRIBEvUNITEDSTATESARMYCORPSOFENGINEERSDocketNo11?1617069557))"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice DD! I’m in. Do you have sense of the potential impact on ET?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People don’t realize the safest way to transport liquid or gas in large quantities is by pipeline. There is a reason why you don’t have a tanker of water shipped to your house and a continuous gas line that always runs. I like PSXP the only thing is this dividend is taxed as ordinary income so keep that in mind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You lost me at DAPL, that debt is too scary for me"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha thanks! I really did my research into this one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still some risk obviously. But I figure that it has potential and is an asymmetric bet in my opinion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing, however it was delayed to discuss with the new administration. This is one of the risks with this, because if it gets pushed back, your taking a loss on those options. However, I find this very unlikely because now the administration has been filled and I do believe they will go forward this time. Not to mention the more they push back the court date, the longer they can run the pipeline.

""The United States Army Corps of Engineers  hereby seeks a continuance of the February 10, 2021 status conference for fifty-eight days in order for the United States Department of Justice to brief new officials regarding this case."" There is totally still a possibility they could push it back. And there is not much warning if they want to do it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I read ET’s prospectus. It would be “adverse” if DAPL shut down. Maybe another strangle opportunity there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep totally true, some people are fine with that, especially considering the size of the distribution.

On the note of transportation, totally agree, pipelines are the way to go. That's part of the problem, because if the pipeline gets shutdown, they would be forced through already made contracts, to move the oil in the future, which would be expensive through trains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that's why you also buy puts. Because right now, with the odds probably DAPL being shut down, the stock will hit the low twenties."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think ET is not in a bad position, I mean they are the operator. The reason I choose PSXP cause it would be the MOST adverse for PSXP to lose DAPL, they would be forced to cut their distribution. ET already did that, and while it would effect them, I would see them dip on the news then keep chugging along."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Nobody’s gonna play the game if they let certain players get away with cheating.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought it at $26, $25, $24, $23, and $22. I didn't buy it a couple of days ago when it hit $21.18 because I knew if I did it would just continue to drop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"100 shares at an average of $25. Every single time I have purchased (3 occasions) it has dropped at least 5% almost instantly after my order executes.

But I’ll fuckin’ do it again!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why the fuck is it this way?  I see markets relentlessly going up, but any time I buy anything it’s immediately red and choppy for months."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, honestly, I like Tesla's, but I hate how much they try to keep the owner from repairing it themselves. It also doesn't sit well with me how your mileage depends on what software package you have."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stocks only go up. This one isn’t. So it’s defective at the moment.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fact that it’s a bad company that’s bad at making money. Fix that, and it’ll moon!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought that was a joke. Like, rocket, moon, etc.  Didn't realize anybody actually bought in just because of the name.

I wonder if any of them can explain what the company does."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What do they think it does? TBH I don't see why it's a terrible pick long term tho IDK about moon landings
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is in the business of mortgaging and digitization of mortgaging ; improving the customer facing side of things. The company makes a shitload of money but stock price doesn’t really reflect that. Now also RKT is considered by some as a distraction scheme from GME. Given the fundamentals of the company and the seemingly ongoing fuckery with this stock  I don’t find that last theory very plausible.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They are the most well oiled loan making machine on earth.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Naw he drives a green 96 Ford Taurus

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I are you sure? I distinctly remember it being a Dodge Neon...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not posting about it all the time , I actually first saw RKT during GME, so you are right about that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote for Futurama reference
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didnt post anything about rkt before GME. 

NOT ONE THING. 

EVER.

Then gme happens and bam, this other meme stock, rkt it's suddenly like, a sure thing, according to you. 

Lmfao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the way I see it. One month after GME first wave, RKT comes. I think they just chose it because of its name."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No , that’s not true. I discovered RKT during GME it’s rise fall rise . I’m also not saying RKT is a sure thing."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao and you thought that was a coincidence.  


Oh wow"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I also didn’t say that at all.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck off troll
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not a nice thing to say about your mother.
2021-03-30 01:38:31,wallstreetbets,Yolo but not really. Let this fall under $22 a share and I’ll buy another 1050 shares.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It seems like I’m buying even more 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s pretty much our sentiment. Pretty much lambos or Wendy’s.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"100% agree, it’s been battle tested not to fall below 22"
2021-03-30 01:18:21,wallstreetbets,Today was brutal.. but it's coming and shorts will be the ones paying for my house that I'm looking for 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 1 share at $24 and wish I would have bought a meat lovers pizza instead with that money.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone point me in the beginning direction? Idk what you guys are talking about with shorts, positions and all the other nonsense words you guys use"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These comments get me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is hilarious
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,at most as well!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,By the time RKT is done you're going to love Dan Gilbert's meat so much
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We all can! I've decided.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No didnt you know any stock eith any shorts is a squeeze now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There's about a million other stocks besides GME.  Live a little.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't even know what that means but I'm laughing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have other stocks but I'm not taking advice from some flat broke economist
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,\*loud confused laughter\*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, i gave no advice, so don’t worry about that."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rockets a good girl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The 20m shares was put up for sale off market and didn't really have anything to do with the price dump
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, RKT did what RKT has done since it’s run to $40."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I moved all my gme off rh also :-)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its kinda ironic because my etrade was originally my rocket play and gme was my robinhood but after vlad fukked us in gme I pulled out and then etrade fukked me on margin for my rocket so here ya go vlad

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"no I used a full months pay ahead of time to buy more shares, so I get to eat ramen all month until next month.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Any ideas for us girth lovers?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it may look bad, but if you have love, deep deep deep love for that sweet sweet sweet $RKT it all looks good.  To me it looks amazing on a technical basis but thats just me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, sell CC's on your shares, this increases your capital girth for those needing to fill in for what they can't make up for in length"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It's meant to be for memes and degenerative gambling. Investing in long stocks for slow growth gains isn't them.
2021-03-30 00:56:35,wallstreetbets,$BB YOLO because MarketWatch can kiss my gorilla ass for spreading FUD before earnings 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I yolo 2k on $10 call for this week 🥲
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB will go up. It’s definitely a long hold with a crazy upside to come. John Chen is guiding this company the same way he did with Sybase. I will stay for the whole ride happily.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LET'S GO BB! I'm stoked to the tits on this rocket ship!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its been a while since I saw a BB post get traction like this. We got shoved in the dark ever since GME/AMC 

😩"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So should I put 10k into this bitch?

Edit: guys I did not. Sorry I overslept and bought GME instead."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I forgot about BB.... Is it a good time to average down? I'm fucked."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB was the first stock I ever bought. I think you will do well getting it this low.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold apes will will get you at $25 we’re coming for you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this. I’ve had BB since last year. At one point I was up $50k and rode it back down to about break even. Really hoping to see a bounce back in the near future!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have so much BB... but it seems like I still need to buy more.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m bagholding at $16.38, feel free to stop by at anytime"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold is the bottom line. BB has growth potential that could lead the tech market
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 1100 shares. Might buy more depending what tomorrow brings. GL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"checking the google machine... it says EPS expected is 0.03 and Revenue expected is between 245.11M to 247.87M depending on source.

last quarter  BB reported 0.02 and Revenue of 224.00M.

Last year same quarter BB reported EPS 0.09 on 291.00M Revenue.

That said, banks/institutions/HF all see to have the inside scoops days before on everything, and this stock has been on the decline these last few days - maybe they know something?  Maybe its just a correction?  Maybe its because its a meme stock and slightly high in price?

I might transfer some money around and take a chance and jump in tomorrow, or buy a call."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canadian here holding 1375 shares.

And typing on a blackberry phone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB is coming good. They are bringing the fight now and ready to compete for their slice of security market. Price is artificially low...

Good deal!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubled my longterm position in BB also, bringing my total basis down. 

&#x200B;

BB is a good stock and a good company."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now is the time to buy, I wish I could get more. If it's this low in a few weeks I will be buying!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re up now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did you sell your GME or did you just have another 460k sitting around to invest?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude how did that work out for you? Its like Eddie Mush bet on that horse to
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda odd that most people have an avg well above the current price. No manipulation going on here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve got about 40 years. Maybe I’ll break even.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like I'll have enought time to buy up more shares. Between my two accounts I'm at 45 shares. I'll continue buying more since it's still cheap. I've been looking at calls too. I told my buddies that BB will be long hold.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Real question: is this a good stock to buy or not?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubled up at that exact price too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there any good DD on BB? 🧐

Because I haven't a clue how they are staying a float anymore."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we know what time the earnings are to be released ?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bubba, you know a security always gets shorted right after.

Tho, it's still a great long play."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just have a quick question about options. And yes if you want you can downvote me. 

If I believe a stock is at its lowest point but will take time to move up and I mean move up a ton so long options sound like the best thing to do or just buy the stock

I am 20 with a 40hr work week making 25$/hr. And about a year with minimal investing experience when it comes to options. I’ve just started doing hours upon hours of research. So I’m starting to understand it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since your post BB is down almost 10%. How the hell did I get into this with 3k shares, I still don't know."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. At least when it was a meme the way otm call premium was good and took a 25% loss (of value) down to only like 20%. I'm sure by the end of the year even if it stays in the 9s I'll recoup the value loss in selling calls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,780 at 17 hope to have 1000 shares before our BB lands on moon to fuel up so it can leave the Galaxy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been averaging down almost every day the past 2 weeks to the point that it’s now 35% of my portfolio
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m waiting for this GME thing to end so I can bury my balls into some BB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm with ya with 1420
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im the retard that bought in at 18
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just lol’d at this one buddy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I yolo'd 3k on $10 calls. Weeks ago. 😭
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed. I grabbed 10.5 C
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm Canadian so it feels like my patriotic duty to yolo on them. Bring in earnings I guess.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I made money on GME and on APPH (because tomatoes) but not BB. What kind of upside down world is this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB and NOK should consider a merger or a collab of some kind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does BB do now that the ""crackberry"" fad is long gone?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Last guy who YOLOd 6 figures online, did great the next day. So I’m in on BB now


I've seen far worse rationale for buying in. Makes as much sense as most anything else."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yes!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't worry too much. Many people will be left feeling empty after GME and looking to reinvest their earnings. 

I'm in on $BB and looking forward to everyone tendies going into $9 shares"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a great time to average down. I have a few hundred shares at $12 and was thinking of doubling down when the market opens to lower my average. Glad to see others who still have faith in BB here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,9 is a great price to average down at tbh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm stuck at an 18.70 average.  I can't decide if I double down or leave it be.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the phase you were looking for is “I’m jacked to the tits in BB.”
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boo hoo, I'm down 4.9% total. Plus I'm buying this juicy dip. 😁"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn I was down low with my 165 shares I been averaging down since January from $15/avg. $12.01 currently. BTFD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$18 what up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long play, not earnings IMO. I really don’t see this moving an inch. Even if they blow earnings out, which they won’t, it’ll pop for a day, if even that. Options play for me would be selling the put. Looking to get another 100 anyway for selling more CCs for... THE REST OF MY LIFE!!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,maybe it's maybelline
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently it doesn't look bad for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,\~ same price but 690 shares... would like to even it out at 700 for luck!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">this is going tits the wall

I have no idea if that means good or bad."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boo hoo, I'm down 4.9% total. Plus I'm buying this juicy dip. 😁"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol a 4% unrealized loss hardly compares to what happened to that guy's YOLO.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These fluctuations are all short term BS. We're holding a great company.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, $10 seems like a solid average.  I'm at 13 still trying to work my way down still.  I've dumped so much money into already though that it barely moves when I pick up new shares."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today was your chance to get out alive! This is not financial advice, I just can’t stand that piece of shit BlackBerry phone. I do hope you fuk the hedgiez but at the end of the day,  the blackberrie is such a piece of shit, I can’t even wrap my head around it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😭
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not selling GME until Ryan Cohen transforms it. Even then I'll just think about selling it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh boo hoo, I'm down 4.9% total. Plus I'm buying this juicy dip. 😁"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cost Distribution on WeBull shows the average as $17.47 😳
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the top DD posts on this sub. Rebranding, FB settlement, patent sales to Huawei (potentially more), BB IVY deal with AWS. Push for wide spread adoption for BB endpoint security. Theres a lot of potential, we just need to see a sign showing they can execute"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options let you use little capital to place a bet. So instead pf buying 100 shares (can be pricey, like tesla) you can buy 1 option contract. Lets say its 5k 

But if it doesnt workout u can lose half the bet fast"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Annnd it’s back 😂 Rodeo is easy for cowboys
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Start selling weekly OTM calls and recover the losses. Atleast thats what Im doing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same! 

Buy high, sell low. That's the way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm at $18 myself 😥. Afraid to cut my losses now because it will shoot up if I do.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,With you buddy ✊
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too. $20.59. Will just have to hold it a bit longer. Sticking to initial plan. DGAF. Have enough time.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"24,30 ! Good thing i just bought a single share ahah"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged down to $14. It'll go up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,HA $19.69..... fuck.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,681 @ $12.20 usd.  Down 24%.  These things happen.  :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Averaged to 12.70, this is the best part of wait and get paid."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,5 @ 14.66 lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down $5,315.04 
I’m looking forward to upward trajectory"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i mean, technically, you weren't wrong. GME just had more apes [or whoever is really drawing the strings] behind it to shoot the price up again"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did the same. 

I usually invest my monthly savings in index funds, but decided set aside a small amount to gamble on the meme stocks (guess I am not completely retarded). So I bought 250$ GME @56$ and 1000$ BB @12$.

Wish I had put it all, or at least the larger sum, into GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought a billy today too. Only at 350. Picking up another after earnings plays out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,got me hard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,380 at 13.40 as of now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just hit 585 today!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Losspocalypse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And ur scrite chafed why we lube with talc
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🪦 rip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A good earnings report usually has the opposite effect on stock price.  I'm going to wait and see if it dips even further.

All my stonks are red, so I'm pretty fucking retarded"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cyber security suites and operating systems for automotive. Most vehicles produced today run BlackBerry’s QNX OS and bull cases for BB usually predict that self-driving/autonomous vehicles will need a well established platform that puts particular emphasis on secure communications and real-time data analytics
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t help it. I was born a fomosexual.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lockdown has changed a lot of things for sure. Meme culture in stocks is something no one ever thought of lol..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you haven't sold yet then you assume it will hit 18.70+ again at some point. If you believe it'll go 18.70+ at some point then you might as well get more when it's half off!

This is just the way I think and is by no means an endorsement of or for buying this or any stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It wasn't that long ago when people memed how Amazon took...15? years to turn a profit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m on the next train there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I should apologize now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings is tomorrow, so.. Expect a discount day..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same boat bro.   I'm at 681 shares.  $12.20.  We're down 24%, but still decent. :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,honestly idek at this point
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please post gain porn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment right here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hangin with the boys 😎
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A Man of the people, if you will."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm at a 2% profit with the current 8% drop.

Hoping it doesn't go lower...."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Since when is short selling or buying puts a bullish position? That’s literally the opposite lmao.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you basically YOLOed over $580k into GME a few weeks back (currently worth $1.9M) and now about another half million into BB eh. I aspire to be like you some day lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I wasnt knocking you, i follwed you in."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, I will have to dig more into this. Thanks.

Although, not sure if they can get away with selling too Huawei. Can't see Canadian Government allowing the sell to China. At least not in this political climate."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Already used all the money I had available for investing😓 sooooooo waiting for those GME gains lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m trying but I can’t figure out to Ameritrade format for covered calls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The premiums are pretty shit though. :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy high, sell higher, don't come off the weed"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not going to sell. I refuse to sell for a loss and would rather hold it for years than take away more than half of my original investment lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Flawless strategy. I sold rocket at 21.85 for 700 shares last week. AMA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"sell please,"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's how I feel about ocgn. I bought high and have leveraged down a bit but still not enough. My share count rises and my losses grow larger and larger everyday. I refuse to give up on it. I know if I do it will skyrocket. I have faith in that vaccine and what I've learned about them. It's not a loss until I sell and gme has taught me to hold.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Take one for the team bro pls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1600 @ $15 - Where's my membership card?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah at this point I believe in both so I'm holding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeahhhhh I started buying BB back in jan and I dumped way more in to BB and just bought 3 GME at first in the 30s lol. By the time I was a full believer the price was much higher but whatever I'm already up plenty so it's hard to complain
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was torn at buying UWMC or BB this morning as they both dipped. 

UWMC dipped harder, BB still might dip more after earnings because everyone eats crayons at earnings."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm anticipating a climb tomorrow followed by a dip on Wednesday after earnings. It's a long term play for me anyway so it doesn't really matter what it does but it'd be nice to pick up a few more shares while the price is still depressed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously never heard of Mama Su or $MUney
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,...This sub existed before lockdown and DEFINITELY had a meme culture
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I take this as an endorsement to buy significant amounts of bb. Thank you for your financial advise.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You got it brother
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No need to focus on these small percentages in the short term. We're holding a great company at great prices. This will be evident soon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The patent sales for their phone related software is already done afaik
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No I meant SELL otm calls not buy them. If you have atleast 100 shares then you can sell call contracts and make a little money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can try looking up on YouTube. I'm sure someone has posted how to do it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea coz of less volatility 😔
Unless you have enough to sell multiple contracts you wont have a good margin."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,10@27 for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Łôèłęœŷn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just YOLO’d $5000 into because the DD here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 @ 13.30 checking in...yay!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I was totally right, I have the final 1k in powder I can hurl at this meme roth and it's gonna go into BB as soon as I see a spicy entry tomorrow."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah i keep averaging down on uwmc and bb and its pretty much my portfolio now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooooh my bad. Yeah I know I still can’t do that unfortunately because I have just under 100..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So what do you buy them for? Im in a similar situation. I dont see how you can profit off them. Ive got about 500 shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 20.60. 

Jesus did you grab the tippiest top?

Also, I bought on the way up. I coulda profited but held strong bb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,60 @ 10.60..... gonna buy more today as it’s under $9
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you're going to be freakin rich one day!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. The loss shouldn't be terrible then. I'm bag-holding 300 shares of Canadian version of BB avg 21 lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you still believe that BB is worth investing in and you really are close to 100 shares, it might be worth buying the remaining shares you need to get to 100 so you can start selling calls.  Just pick an OTM price target that you'd be OK with exiting your position if that happens to hit. You may only end up making a couple bucks a week on it, but it will eventually add up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't buy the contracts I sell covered calls for a premium. Since you have 500 shares you can sell 5 contracts. You can pick the expiry date and the strike price. The longer the expiry the greater the premium. But you cant sell your shares until the contract expires or you buy back those call contracts for what ever price it is at that time.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, also holding 100 NOK @ 6.60 I am a certified retard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck this whole thread makes me feel smart with my 100 @ 11.05

But i am not. lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it’s not but between all my “meme” stock losses they add up😂 but yeah that sucks.. if you felt like you needed to add to those shares you could always average down lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$BBEH

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need to know what they're selling ahead of time, geez. Post earlier next time please."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What platform or site are you seeing this on?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What in the Atari type platform is this info coming from, not that I think it’s in accurate, but damn 25 year old graphics."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I the only one that doesn’t fully understand the screen shots? So it the floor for VIAC around 46 since that’s where most of the block trades were
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like their plan is to unload slowly instead of in one session. Maybe several weeks of this. At least it protects the broader market from plunging
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Toss a block of $FTCH my way tank that sh*t some more
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How bad did I screw up buying codiagnostics at 9?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow - that’s some fallout from Japan
VIAC ? 

Really ? 

That stock wasn’t even close to full value... 
LOL ! 

I wonder how many US HF’s are using that Leverage Loophole (5/1) ???"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the laugh 🧠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m still YOLO short VIAC DISCA and AMCX — anyone else? upvote this if yes, write back if yes, write back if no.

** I know half of you geniuses will downvote assuming it’s the opposite of “upvote for yes”. So I spelled it all out lol

Edit: 4 downvotes already 😂"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Which one?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes they are glad no GME in that cluster fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They need to liquidate or come up with cash on their own, they aren't doing this because they want to or don't like the stock, they are doing it because they have to cover big-dong-hwang's option positions as they are essentially assuming those positions, so they are selling this stuff to hedge out that risk... Of course there will be some risk they are willing to hold on to, but not much if the rumors of how bad Hwangs trades were are accurate."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Factset- I get it for free courtesy of my college.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol i feel like with financial products the quality of the data/platform is inversely related to the quality of the GUI - Robbinhood vs Bloomberg Terminal 

this is factset btw"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That *was* their plan: Archegos's Prime Brokers ($GS, $MS, $CS $NMR) supposedly got together last week and decided to slowly liquidate their positions but then Goldman decided to go against their gentlemen's agreement, buy a load of puts and dump shares on Friday, then Morgan Stanley did the same thing leaving $CS and $NMR with Billions in losses since many of these stocks fell over 50% from the liquidations."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Valaris
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could the sell be more related to poor performance by their new discovery+ streaming service?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't what gs did the exact definition of insider trading?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they've released any numbers yet. Next earnings call is in may I believe. I can say beyond a shadow of doubt, the news they release for subscriptions will be positive. Reality TV will always be in demand, and they really do a lot of it. 
It's all due to the margin call on that hedge fund."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really. Insider trading is if GS had specific non public information about the company itself such as non public earning reports or some future product release. But in this case the non-public information was just about the changes in ownership of the stock itself which the company probably didn’t even know about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but the real question will be whether people want to pay for that as a separate service. Lots of homes already have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu or some combination of those. Add HBO Max on top for some households, it gets to be a lot. CBS All Access and Discovery+ can't be doing that well. All of those services also have some amount of reality shows in their library."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I share some of your sentiment, I hate subscription services, I hate cable more.  But people who watch the brands on Discovery+ already, love it.  Discovery makes good money already.  They are green all the way back to ten years.  They are going to appeal to their market, and then more.  Do you watch any of their shows.  They have some of the craziest reality tv shows, and people just eat that stuff up.  They are going to have exclusive shows and extras that can only be had on Discovery+.  It will work.  Which is why I took my shot already and bought calls.  Hopefully my DD is good and I didn't fool myself, lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They sat at ~$20 for years and only started gaining exponential growth in January.  Almost seems like a regression to the mean regardless of the reason for the price drop.  Where is the value that justifies a bigger price? DD?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got rid of my cable subscription around 2016 so I don't know what's on their much anymore. I believe they turn a profit with their shows but I'll be on the lookout for their numbers whenever they get released. I hope you make a profit at least.

Continued shortages and supply/logistical problems have caused the costs of many basic materials like aluminium to spike up and often double/triple, meaning that there's possibly some significant price inflation on the horizon. 

Steel price is up 190% from last year

Several materials needed for solar panel production like glass and polysilicon are in short supply too

The price of shipping a container across the world has gone up from +-$2000 to $8000-$12000

And that's not nearly all of it, stuff like wood and ofcourse semiconductors are also suffering significant shortages


I feel like this stuff is what's mainly affecting stock prices, and that these things in addition to the suez canal situation are what's causing the somewhat dissapointing market.

**Case for 🐭📞s:** On Wednesday Orange County (Disneyland) is expected to announce an upgrade from the red tier to the orange tier.

**What this means for the 🐭:** Theme park capacity for when they reopen will go up from 15% to 25%.

**Is this priced in?:** No, the last park news that was announced (initial reopening announcement), DIS hit ATHs the following trading day. They are currently well below that number.

**TLDR:** 🐭📞s are the way

But more than anything, I just want a single butterfly, just ONE to land on my dick. Every evening after work I coat my my penis in different concentrations of sugar water and I head outside, waiting, searching for one sweet fluttery suitor. Most nights I don't even see any. On the few occasions I do, they're uninterested in my high fructose member. 

I've decided to cultivate my own brood now. I'm going to grow them from caterpillars.  Watch them delicately complete their metamorphosis.  Whisper to them gently and softly as they evolve. And, eventually, I'll release them, waiting with bated breath in the hopes that one of them lands on my nether regions. It will have no idea what it's done. It won't understand the importance of its seemingly meaningless brief rest. Like a sacrificial lamb being lead to the Lord on the proverbial stone table. 

And in that moment I imagine I'll glance down, sighing a sigh of immense relief after weeks and weeks of fruitless attempts. Ill watch those beautiful, colorful wings close, then open, EVER so slowly. As if winking at me and saying ""hey, pal. You did it.""

Then I'll snap a photo for all the retards here that believed in me, and also those that didn't. And in that moment, I'll know. Everything is going to be just fine."

He had such a knowledge of the dark pools that he could even keep the ones he cared about from debt. The darkpools of the Farce is a pathway to many analyses some consider to be unnatural. He became so rich... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his money, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his underlings everything he knew, then his underlings memed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from debt, but not himself."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Removes stress of PDT, but made sure I still stuck with my strategy and didn’t get trigger happy cause I can buy/sell as much as I want now. It does make it “easier” in a way and gives comfort, but can also be easier to lose money if you aren’t disciplined, patient, and not taking quality setups so you decide to just buy and sell because you can."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know, is the future going to happen?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no.

The decline was rapid... too rapid. So I have been expecting a bounce back at some point. Losing so far. 

On the other hand, valuations for a lot of tech companies were (and still are) absurd. 

Only time will tell."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The funny thing is DC made all those characters first (except for Spider-Man) when Jack Kirby got pissed at Stan Lee and left Marvel for DC. Kirby created the New Gods at DC and Stan Lee stole all the concepts. 

Look at Doom Patrol - mutants led by a crippled professor in a wheel chair. Sounds like a huge XMen ripoff right? Except it came before Marvel’s version and it was Marvel that stole the idea. 

Marvel was just better at telling the stories in movies."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s excessively mediocre for 4 hours. They had that flash scene though, that was pretty good. It was much less of a piece of shit slog than I expected. But yeah it was still bad and also cape shit pls go."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see your point. What they don’t know is, yields might effect one or two sectors like tech or financials. Dollar (DXY) is what they should be keeping track of. That effects EVERYTHING market related. Almost at $93. That is not good for the stock market, at all."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"man, fuck hot chicks, man. man."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its a profitable company with room to grow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is too funny. Guys listen up. RKT will never be a thing and it’s not going up. And if it does, sell immediately. Because it’s a fucking mortgage company and we already went through the RKT saga 5 months ago!!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a profitable company that does everything right and it's undervalued right now. The squeeze people on RKT are idiots but most of the people buying understand it could 2x by EOY based on fundamentals alone. 

Downvote me for saying fundamentals if you will"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to be patient. No time tables.

remember money means nothing it's about the friends you made along the way"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok. I’m gonna go against the grain here and give some confirmation bias. 


PLTR is 22$ now. You need it to do 6% within 3 days. 

After that 23.24 crossing of 6% (ish), every cent PLTR gains gives you 743 dollars. Ever dime gives you, 7430$. And if it goes to 24$, you get 55k. 

I mean you are leveraging 743X here. But- anything is possible. If I’m these 3 days pltr gains 70%- you officially become a millionaire."

2021-03-29 23:29:55,wallstreetbets,"National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

Edit: I'm for $GME going up and did well myself off of it, but everyone commenting ""GME hodl"" on every single post, no matter how unrelated, you are ruining this sub and helping to reduce the same kind of content that led to the sub discovering and getting on board with $GME to begin with. Dont kill the golden goose over one fucking egg."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If China systematically dumped stocks in the US trying to crash the market it would probably work, but only in the short term. Buyers would step in and buy the assets that are now undervalued. Nobody would see aapl trading at 4x earnings and not buy it. The stock market is not the economy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you but every major event of the last 12+ months can be thought of as a national security risk and we haven't done much about it (30m Covid cases, 550k deaths, civil unrest, grid and infrastructure failures) and we (collectively) haven't really been able to get those rooted out"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thankfully the stock market isn’t the economy, so you’re right that over-leveraging should be looked at~ but ur also retarded~"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This type of economic intrusion is already happening, but it isnt something new. The US did it to the Americas with the Monroe doctrine, and now China is starting to take on that role. They are sending huge fishing fleets to central america under threat of calling back loans made to countries as part of their belt and road initiative. Right now China has a lot of countries under extreme economic pressure because they came with cheap loans to invest in infrastructure. I believe China is also the largest owner of America foreign debt. Debt is the largest market in the world and it's not even close to number 2. China and Russia are collaborating in refining an alternative to the SWIFT system which facilitates most international bank transactions and which the US closely monitors to enforce economic sanctions and track threats to their national security. They are also trying to replace the US dollar as their reserve currency. What OP is discussing is already under way. Another rename is Hawei and 5G. Look up Nortel networks and how the canadian government and the company basically allowed Hawei to become the front runner in the 5G race for no other reason than political miscalculations and poor managerial decisions. 

There are other examples, but I'm tired of typing. And I'm sorry for the lack of links but if you google any of what I wrote it's really easy to find legit sources. 

TLDR: Western economies have allowed China and other state actors to gain dominance in the economicand financial systems worldwide for a while now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it wouldn’t be hard for a rogue government to inflict tons of damage on our financial system with comparatively little capital. Since they aren’t motivated by financial profit they wouldn’t mind sacrificing all the capital they “invest” to cause maximum damage. They wouldn’t be bounded by the ostensible psychological restraints of rationality hedge funds are subjected to.

Also, rogue governments are now well aware that since market makers apparently don’t hedge their calls, with enough capital they could force a gamma squeeze that takes out a number of hedge funds and then their prime brokers. Should the rogue government obtain good intelligence about the positions of over-leveraged or over-exposed funds, they might be able to place a clever domino. 

This is actually fucking ridiculous. Both enforcement and intelligence agencies should be figuring out how to anticipate this. If they don’t then I would reasonably expect an attempted financial attack of this sort within the decade."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good thoughts, thanks for sharing.  I've been dwelling upon this lately with the whole Suez canal headache we've been having... Given that all-out warfare between nuclear superpowers is extremely unlikely, we're surely going to be seeing more economic warfare like you suggest, and I worry that it will be extremely effective on the US.  I mean hell, Russia sat around in our government's computer networks for months before we realized, who's to say that can't worm into, say, the Fedwire and grind the market and the economy to a halt?  Seems to me that the US's international rivals would love to erode trust in the dollar to the point that it is no longer the world's reserve currency."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Large scale economic attacks don't really work, not for states. Every nation's economy is heavily connected to their neighbours as well as the global market. Someone like China crashing the US economy could end up hurting China more than the US. The global economy is so hard to predict, there's no telling what sort of fallout it could cause.

I think that ultimately, anyone who wields enough economic power to cause something like this, also has enough at risk so that it's not worth trying. It's a similar reason as to why no one goes to war with their neighbours any more (barring ideology, I guess)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the simiple solution is to require more transparency.

If the global stock markets could be manipulated it would be a powerful weapon, seeing how people have tried with varying degrees of success to manipulate the market for positive gains, I would suggest that a bad actor in this space would be equally challenged in trying to intentionally ""kill"" the markets. the system is too open, resilient and has so many inputs, variables it would make targeting effects very difficult, but not impossible. also there is always a cost. in a competition environment where cyber effects can achieve more precision, and at far less cost, would a weaponized hedge fund be worth it?

PRC still claims Soros was responsible for the Asian financial crisis. the 2007 financial crisis -which no one wanted, fucked over the entire world by an incalculable sum.

The real question is will the retail investors get sacrificed to make that play happen or will they also be “saved” and or actually see a payout of sorts through the federal government for playing the game legally. I’m of the opinion they will still somehow try and kill off the retail investors too much generational wealth will be spread in any other scenario and so I’m pessimistic about/hoping for it.

In this scenario, their play would be to knock down the US as an economic powerhouse to level the playing field. Yes, it would likely hurt them in the short term over the next several years, but in the long run it would give them the opportunity to surpass the US.

If you combine a market crash with our continuous money printing and inevitable devaluation of the US dollar it seems like everything could be playing right into their hands.

Not to get political here, but this is exactly why we absolutely cannot downplay the CCP as a threat to the US. Even more alarming is all the ties to the CCP by many of our politicians (on both sides) either directly or indirectly. Politicians can be bought off. They can be used as pawns each playing a small role. I doubt they would be working to purposely collapse the US economy, but if it’s a seemingly insignificant role they get paid off for, each role can be combined into something much larger."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The biggest issue China has with exerting military power abroad is that they're laughably behind the US militarily. Despite the posturing and media headlines that would have you think otherwise, China is still very much a regional power that can't exert force far outside it's territorial waters/neighbors. 

Their Navy is a coastal defense fleet, competent enough to patrol their waters but not at all capable of patrolling oceans like the US. Similarly their fighters and bombers are just bad copies of either US or Russian equipment from a generation ago. China is technologically 20-30 years behind the US, and honestly about a decade behind Russia in a lot of places as well."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I for one welcome our Chinese overlords.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Myanmar is a weird political situation.

My understanding is the military junta is actually anti-China (or at least thought the democratic government was still too cosy). However they were one of the communist nations that has recently come out supporting the military on its most recent parade day.

At the moment China doesn't seem to want to act hypocritical by calling for democracy, but Aung San Suu Kyi is the better choice for them in the short term.

I imagine as with everything they're sticking with long term goals of continuing infrastructure investment there and owning that when they default.

It isn't as simple as ""military junta good for China"" though.

China has favourable options with both nations that don't require military intervention.

From my understanding anyway (I know politics isn't allowed, but it does help to understand the realer risks/opportunities in investment out there)

I'd agree with your other points but there's a whole bunch of stuff in the way for China to realise it's long term ambitions for the throughput it's after for their population.

When considering air superiority, the F-35 says ""Hello.""  

Err...the J-20*. 

As for airframe reliably, the DO of ACC was quoted as saying something akin to fixes to the F-22 Raptor's oxygen problem are coming back in April of '20. That would be eight years after the problem was identified. They J-20 does indeed appear to suffer from a slew of it's own problems as well.

Every organization's most valuable resource is their people: 1.4B > 330M.  

While I'll concede they're behind the US militarily, they're potentially capable of accelerating more quickly. The US has long held supremacy and its senior-most leaders (SECDEF/4-stars) have been pushing an agenda of, to paraphrase, ""Get better/faster/stronger or lose the next fight,"" since the days of Gen James Mattis (ret).  

This approach seems wise. It injects humility into the most dominate military power. A military that has been preeminent for most living humans' entire lives. That being said, those leaders are saying what they're saying for a reason; I'd wager it's not just motivational. 

To see the story from the other side, I'd recommend ""Unrestricted Warfare."" Things get lost in translation but China has been watching hard for awhile."

It has brought the market to a blazing standstill. If you have the money the Chinese do, you can outrace everyone, pay way too high of a price, afford to hold the property long-term even if empty.

The result is an extremely fast moving market for overpriced properties. But, paradoxically, an extremely shallow market for local residents who are pretty much excluded from the buying pool.

We have such limited inventory that prices have skyrocketed as foreign investors move in and cut off the locals.

Trying to buy a place right now is a fool's errand. They often sell before even seeing the MLS.

It is a bizarre situation with no upside I can see, other than for China gaining a serious foothold in local politics in Florida.

I really do struggle to envision a shift like we saw during WW2 in today’s time’s. But when you’re the biggest, baddest dog on the block, it’s easy for complacency to set it. This sort of discredits how much technology is in a F35 compared to a WW2 fighter, but the greater point still stands.

A good example of how difficult these kinds of missions are for major regional powers is to look at the Russian intervention in Syria. Their Navy barely made the trip from St. Petersburg to Syria, and once there they still managed to take casualties on a pure support mission against a technologically inept enemy, that wasn't being supported in a way to directly challenge them. And the Russian military has a lot more experience running these kinds of operations.

and that combined w some social factors like friends leaving and parents not getting why my performance went down (last time I vent to them lol) led to a real shitty time. but I found a great therapist and things got better brain wise and socially I was somewhat making moves and my job I was feeling better about and things were finally looking up, I have a journal entry in feb 2020 saying this like man I’m starting to feel stoked again. and then covid and everything just fucked it up. 

anyways tho after typing all that I’m like ok I’m back for the first time in 9 mo in my apartment and where I was living (and I guess still do live), I should hit my therapist up.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this sub ain’t the place for this but I’ll agree It’s good to enjoy life. I’d like to share some unorthodox ideas I’ve come across this last year that have helped me to enjoy life. I’m a retard. This is literally not financial advice. I apologize to WSB for filibustering. I have a TLDR at the end, peace.

Heidegger talks of this idea of “throwness” and not choosing birth. On the other hand, we are free to define ourselves because of this.

Nietzsche admired the Ancient Greek god Dionysus, since he was twice born and twice killed but lived passionately regardless. Nietzsche believed suffering and joy alike were meant to be embraced, that the thrill and passion of life held meaning above these. He claimed a human would rather will itself to nothingness than surrender his will entirely. Life only needed to be affirmed by the living for a single moment for the whole experience to be affirmed. He seemed to think we could just “choose to live” even if we don’t choose to be born. Some interpret Nietzsche to mean reality may ultimately be power (in an abstract, creative sense). Any experience we have empowers us and reality. Reality and our own existence is thereby endlessly empowering and generative in some way or another. We experience this power as energy, as our senses, as our abstract thoughts, and so on. ‘Tis everywhere and is everything. The greatest humans love humanity and the world for this reason: it is mutually empowering.

In the films of Stanley Kubrick, he juxtaposes birth and death frequently. In between these bookends is life, which is erotically linked to sex. The abyss of nihilism is ultimately positive: a void for endless potentials, a womb. A being should engage with this void as a phallus does a vulva. A lesson from him I take is that we should expect suffering and joy alike, but ultimately they both empower us to live intimately and live more.

TLDR
Hell, read/watch/listen to any philosophical, artistic, theological work. I’d argue they all arrive at the intimate and powerful connection of the human experience to reality. It is unconditional. You only need to be conscious to enjoy that connection. Even long after you die you always will have been. What was once you becomes other things.

Hope you find some peace."

I mean how many of the electronics that make our lives so easy and we take for granted are made cheap as fuck overseas? What happens when those have to be made locally and costs oodles more? Can the American public really deal with something like that? I mean we all saw how wonderfully we dealt with this pandemic... gives me lot of hope for our government in crisis.... Luckily though, I think it’s a moot point as the world is too interconnected for anyone to ever really win a global war.

We’re simply too good at killing each other now to make war really worth it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Our defense spending is about 3.5% of our GDP. During the height of the Cold War it was as high as 12% so while the numbers are still massive, we have cut military spending significantly without the Soviet boogeyman to justify the expenditure."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know everyone loves to shit on the Iraq war and rightfully so for many reasons, but the initial invasion in 03 was some seriously incredible stuff. We had the logistical capabilities to feed and maintain an invasion force half way across the world and then ransack a country of over 30 million in less than a month. Yes, the occupation was a debacle, but the actual invasion was damn impressive and I feel pretty confident in saying there isn’t another nation on earth who could have done that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a guess but maybe they mean Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan but yeah that’s not China
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is fair. OP used China as an example and it just went down that path. Considering the trifecta to accomplish removing USD would be a strong self sufficient China, India, and Russia all 3 would have considerable risks. Think Coyote with Mexican refugees/immigrants. I have a friend who was adopted from Russia when he was 8 and I call him a spy every time I see him."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a follow up, if you have some kind of ambition to change the world for the betterment of humanity and yourself, that’s awesome. Just don’t cause your own suffering. You can love yourself and the world both for who you are and who you can be while working toward both ends. Try to affirm; try not to negate."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cranky, that’s deep. I know the Nazi’s loved Nietzsche, which probably ruined him as a philosopher to take seriously forevermore. However, the phallus/vulva point of view deserves a deep dive..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Nietzsche ends up doing an incredible job of describing the Paschal Mystery. The idea that a will IS power and is alive, and that our wills collectively interact and nourish each other. 

The will of a tyrant (""I will be above all others"") provides us a choice: submit (""I will be beneath you""), rebel (""I will overthrow you""), or - the most preferred option - do some dialectics and arrive at ""I am equal to you, and so one day you will acknowledge this.""

In this way, our suffering is always frameable as opportunity, to help others and the self. Then the last step is letting go of the distinction of self and you're all set to transcend to the astral plane or sea of tranquility or whatever"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing is, if we stop having kids and families, there really will be no stopping the ego from devouring everything. At this moment in my life, I strongly empathize with your feeling, but I have been choosing to reinforce a slightly different perspective, which doesn't assume ignorance on their part.... ""Wow, you really are more brave than me."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"one thing I’ve been thinking about if I find love and money and all that nonsense is considering adoption, I mean I think some point of me always wanted a lil mini part me who I could “see myself in” but now I’m like how much of that is really who your parents are anyways (and then I’m like well yeah man nature vs nurture has been a question out there for a bit). I’m not in any position to make that decision now ofc but that’s given me a tiny bit of hope I guess if I think I could handle it, esp if I could provide the kid a rad life to the best I can"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I thought about how for thousands of years there have been people who told us that things can't go on like this, from Jesus Christ to the Diggers, Malthus to Zerzan, from Karl Marx to Huey Newton. But the shit goes on and on... I'm not saying we can't change the world cause everybody does a little bit of that"" Don't get too overwhelmed with the global negativity, find the small part of the world you exist in and try to make it better. Plant some spinach or something."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"damn dude it’s nice to know I’m not the only one ya know? and I’m sure there’s dozens of us(!) out here in a similar boat, and with GameStop I mean if anything it’s been a fun ride that spices my day up a bit, and I can always scroll in an echo chamber of positive vibes for the stock and holding and all for some good vibes"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what degree? just curious
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congress definitely needs a raise.

It’s fucking idiotic that I make far more than my senator for a job that is objectively easier."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is it you make all these assumptions about me or politicians?  My undergrad was computer science.  Graduate work in atmospheric science and social sciences. Yes, I had to take calc, linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, etc.  And even in that field we rarely have to actually solve those problems by hand. The computer did it, so long as you can spot check. But too many people with a CS degree seem to think they can do everyone else's job better than them.

Most people can learn to program if they put effort into it. Plenty can learn to solve calc problems if taught properly.  But the world needs more skillsets than just CS and mathematics.

I work in research.  I work with lots of brilliant people.  But many of them do not have the social skills required to be a politician, nor to relate important knowledge to the world.  But many aren't interested in that and are content working in their research fields.

But this arrogance that if you have a political science degree instead of a CS degree you are somehow incompetent is silly. It always irritated me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah those are good points. Hoepfully it's true about not annihilating each other. But hoepfully that doesnt mean too much compromise.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's good if your friend can laugh it off. The problem is that Asians throughout America are being attacked and even killed over casual false assumptions, so I needed to call it out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"damn dude, that was a super interesting read, thanks for sharing that I really appreciate it - it’s a really thought provoking way to think about things and I dig it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool advice, thank you. And shut off the TV"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"for real. I needed a glimmer of hope regardless of how silly it may be. I have a feeling more people are feeling this way now than ever. Had a nice conversation  with a friend I hadn't spoken with forever the other day, and he essentially said the same thing: I'm glad I'm not the only one who's been feeling this way. He wasn't alone, neither are you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Senators make $174k. Granted they haven’t had a raise in 10 years, but that is still pretty good money. Top 7% income.

What do you do that is easier and pays more?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd leave him be. He's living up to his username.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think we just have to hope that the powers that be realize that if for example, China and the US started duking it out, that the war was already lost because we would have to destroy our own economy to do the same to the other guy. The status quo is tense, but everyone benefits from it and can’t afford to rock the boat too much."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said Chinese, as in the nation state, which encompasses a large number of people of a multitude of ethnicities and races. You're the one who brought race into it. Also, ""commonly known"" means that people are aware of the issue rather than that it is the majority of a particular group. Its a common enough occurrence to be a problem and something to be aware of, but that does not mean that every Asian person is a spy. You jumping to that was a result of your own biases and assumptions of China being a homogeneous whole coloring your perceptions."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"and neither are you, let’s take the good times while *they’re coming and and ride them (to the moon but if not we’ll land among the stars or whatever that phrase is). thanks for turning my evening around dude"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m in middle management at a FAANG.

They make $174k, have to maintain two residences (at least one of which is in a HCOL city), travel more than 50%, have work obligations at all days and hours including breakfasts and dinners, and have to look polished most of the time.

I make far more than them, only need a single residence, travel about 25%, rarely work weekends, evenings, or early AM, and haven’t needed to dry clean clothes in years.

I’m confident that nearly every senator and the majority of house reps could get jobs as my peers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I still have to learn to let it go sometimes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Russia would feed China? Then why don’t they currently
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad I could help and likewise. it's actually invigorating to not be the one dragging everyone else down with misery😎I like to imagine the post-plague world being full of kinder more compassionate people and - who knows - perhaps some structural changes to our society thats designed for sociopaths to win.

Anywho- have a good night man. Hope all is relatively well, bittersweet glad that you're wholly familiar with dealing with this. It always scares me how deep I was able to fall into depression while fervently believing I wasn't depressed, everything was just pointless and happy people must be delusional yadda yadda.

I have a looming suspicion that perhaps *everything* may not suck"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"just like they could send all of their oil/gas production to China, but dont. two out of four major pipelines between the two are enough, but they did still build out more

you dont make contract with a single customer as then you lose other markets. but in a total war Russia and China would rally along each other. right now Russia is exporting a lot of food to Turkey and other parts of world, in a war they would redirect"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"that’s the thought that gives me a bit of hope, I’d like to think a pandemic and the resulting bleh can shake things up at least a bit.  

and back at ya, depression sneaks up on you so quick and even if you recognize it it seems like eh it’s whatever. such a sneaky bitch.  

and I hope you’re right and things go off and look up soon. and if it doesn’t I just gotta remind myself hey I’ve got my bike and my dog and both those are just pure happiness if I block everything else out"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing to keep in mind is that the current holdings are based on initial investments. The actual AUM is really low so far, so the weights will probably change a lot once Cathie buys another 10% of TSLA for it like everyone fucking knows she will."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You don’t make profit until you have something to sell. Sort of like biotech companies. Staying alive until you have a finished idea. Biotech developments take years but space tech takes decades. Cathie will have to convince investors to take losses for a very long time before things pop off. It is a very good idea but think of how long you can tie your money up without gains before you have to pull out

Given the size of the sell offs, some are saying that it only makes sense that it must have been a fund the size of Blackrock or Vanguard.

Blackrock and Vanguard also happen to be the two largest holders of shitco $PENN (Blackrock owns 12.5% while Vanguard holds 9%). Now I believe that this stock was ponzi scheme from the beginning, given that it ran up 1500% based on no fundamentals and a significant loss in income.

I just wanted to point this out because FUCK Dave Portnoy. He has been all over Twitter tryna convince his followers to buy the dip on shitty $PENN stock while insiders have been dumping it like their life depends on it. AVOID THIS STOCK LIKE THE PLAGUE.

Now I'm not quite sure what Blackrock dumping shitco $PENN has on the broader market but it would be interesting to see if there were other companies that are largely held by Blackrock/Vanguard that are being dumped right now.

Edit: For those of you that are stupid enough to still be buying into this garbage - look at the recent insider transactions. They're dumping all their shares to all you retards that think Portnoy is on your side.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock and Vanguard are not active manager, they are passive (for most part) and just the nature of business requires them to buy or sell as per the benchmark they are following.

When prices fall, so does the weight of security in their benchmark and hence they have to readjust. They dont have any nefarious plans behind the selling and their trading is completely automated, so this conspiracy is poo poo on a stick."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,my guess: crash market and have $$$ to buy at a discount.. also fucks retailers somehow.. petty af
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is the new casinos. It makes sense that PENN, which derives its revenue from casinos, will suffer from the loss of customers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Penn, discovery, Viacom cbs and of course rkt, all been hyped by CNBC. Hahahaahahaha hahahhahha you can search in YouTube they invite them to make ad. Now the big whales dump all of them"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People are having their ious called in
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"$uvxy
This is not financial advice"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m betting on Nardini
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the people that actually like PaperHand Portnoy tend not to be very intelligent people
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they do
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they wouldn't, see Wirecard and German DAX ;)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re a retard. Show me your loss porn in a couple months
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just cause big Pete made 375 million. Can’t blame a guy with multiple wives boyfriends for taking profits. You are a very little boy also.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Disclaimer if NY doesn’t get passed and it probably won’t stock goes to 80. And then.....💎🤲
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sense the prevailing sentiment is doom and gloom, I think April will be ups.

It is historically green."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no conspiracy. As someone else pointed out, it is likely that Blackrock already dumped their shares of $PENN last week. The only conspiracy here is that $PENN managed to make it to the S&P500"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao did you even read my support or have you even bothered looking at their financials? You’re an absolute clown if you think this stock is fairly valued
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I find it hilarious how many people are still bullish on PENN. I hope they post their loss porn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they’re huge holdings and property all over the country. Small markets elsewhere and the mobile app seems to be doing very well
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m long on penn for the mobile gaming
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This discount, yes. Yes discount them are sell, we buy up go back yes discount us them sell."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BlackRock is long on gme, they’re the biggest institutional investor"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hasn’t sold any yet allegedly (last I heard this was a few weeks ago, I think)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m long on penn. they are top 3 in each state and spend a fraction of marketing as draft kings because barstool is becoming a top 5-10 publisher in us (above discover channel)

Avg cost is low 80s right now I’m considering averaging up before casinos open up and sports gambling blows up. Can’t say how high it will go but it will be higher than now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is their net down because the purchase of a large portion of barstool is added into that calculation?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got you homeboy
Ps salt deez nutz"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope its green as well. But with market manipulation. I dont trust wallstreet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did both. Congrats on comparing an EPS of -5 mostly occurring in Q1 2020 with Q3 and Q4 actually turning positive genius. There’s also other indicators besides EPS, genius.

Look at this entire market. All this shit is (and has been) over valued. I actually do hope and have been hoping all this shit continues to dip. I just think solely focusing on an extreme outlier per your EPS argument is idiotic and you’re just horned up for Davey"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah . I thought so too . I’ve  not into draft kings specifically .. yet . Any insights ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"🦍 at 245 , subjectiveness right"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,idk... someone may need a Capitol...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right so he’s watching his net worth tumble and instructing his followers to prop up the stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should try learn a thing or two about valuation metrics
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And, you know the pandemic keeping people out of their casinos"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just casinos closing and they were later to market than draft kings. They’re catching up quick though and barstool does add additional revenue opportunities
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i wish this sub was under a milly people again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL the funny thing is I didn’t even focus on EPS, that was someone else’s comment. How about you tell me, which indicators suggest it is NOT overvalued? Cause it is literally overvalued by every single metric. Now combine that with the sheer amount of insider selling. Anyway I hope you’re only arguing cause you’re long on the stock, in which case please post your loss porn in a few months"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sup
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock is the biggest whale in GME, and shittadel sqrewed them over in a Tesla position a few years back. (look in to it) and now blackrock owns 13-18mill shares in GME. (ithink, bad memory) and they might want to up their stake in the float to sqreew shitadel over bigtime. And yes blackrock is richer than the whole universe so gme is in good hands"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the same feeling I get when I hear the original version of a song that was sampled for another song for the first time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m bullish
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,YoU sHoUlD tRy T.... stfu
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh shit you’re right. You’re argument is black rock and not understanding how additions to an ETF works. Even better lmfao.

Hey man I’m rooting for it to hit 80, potentially 70 so I can go ahead and enter a full position; overall market too uncertain for me to do it in PENN or anything else new. Go risk your short term shorts now bucko!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My broker said market suffered from hypertension and myopia
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,245 lbs lots of ape
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't know this, probably should have investigated a little bit before commenting but at least I left it open to any possibility, (albeit this one makes no sense knowing this)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Salty nutz is a wanna be bot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This. 👍🏻
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wouldnt they want to get out of their position over time rather than dump and cause a price drop though?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Additions to an ETF? When did I once even mention an ETF. Looking at your comment history you clearly just get off tryna play the devils advocate on people’s posts to sound like you’re smart but you’re actually a complete idiot hahaha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Overall market too uncertain”. There’s still good plays out there. Tbh sounds like you’re the one that’s uncertain, despite ironically how certain you try to come off 😂"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all good. Not trying to bust your balls. Blackrock is likely the primary whale backing GME and they have a history with Ryan Cohen (backed him and Chewy). If Blackrock was unloading any blocks, it's to fund their war against the shorts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,9 million shares or so long I believe. Also their position has increased. Also...Blackrock was an original funder of RC/Chewy....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Got heeeem. Lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at your comment that had -22 upvote you damn inbred lmfao. You didn’t understand what the dude was saying and said “bUlLs MaKe ExCuSES fOr AnyThInG”

Id say I enjoy talkin and understanding idiots rather than playing devils advocate since it’s my personal opinions rather than ones upheld for the sake of argument."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When did I say I was certain? I literally said markets too uncertain for me. I’m just saying your argument is fucking stupid 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have a Shakespearean war with Citadel going on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was going to post this fact.  Thanks for saving me the trouble.  Now I don't have to type all that.... oh, shit.

Keep up the good work to you and u/tedclev.

PS: Don't you love the ""Shakespearean war"" reference above.  Feels almost Iliad at this point but Shakespearean works too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah and again that had nothing to do with additions to an ETF lmao. Just stop trying to sound smart, I can tell you’re actually a dumb ass"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha well you might one of the few people on this post that doesn’t think the stock is overvalued, so perhaps you’re fucking stupid if you can’t see it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls on horses and spears
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man I’m kinda retarded. You are too but you just ignorant about it. 

I prob did better than you in the market for what it’s worth!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man you are truly retarded. In the end stop trying to play Mr. Know it All you fucking dweeb. You’re the type of guy who gonna pop champagne if PENN (and the market) goes down and say “I told you so”! I’ll see you in a year if you have the balls to short that long. If you even can short 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Calls on shields.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im retarded as well, but I don’t waste my time going off on people’s posts so that I can pretend I’m not retarded"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey you’re the one continuing to enable the said retard. You seem to enjoy my words! 

Plus I enjoy having one on ones!"
2021-03-29 22:38:39,wallstreetbets,"ARKX Holdings Early Thoughts 🚀🛰🛸 ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th).

At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let’s do some digging. 

From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx)

*Why invest in ARKX*

*Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.*

*The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.*

**why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as “cash-like” for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. 

Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). 

The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). 

Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies).

**39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that’s actually the first thing I’ve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. 

**only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, 🚀 Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). 

**their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it’s absolutely needed for space tech whether it’s printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. 

**actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings (excluding USD) have current revenue and financial stability as opposed to negative FCF for the next few years to come (last 2 holdings). Again a sign of lowered risks taken given the current equities market. 

**TLDR**: while initially underwhelming ARKX composition could very well be increased and even reshuffled as market conditions normalize (and/or market crash). Doesn’t look like very spacey nor ultra innovative right now but it feels like Cathie Wood hasn’t shown her hand yet. 

Not a recommendation to buy, hold nor sell any securities. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 because it’s space + WSB."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how is the starting price set up for etf ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Boeing is disappointing to see here. The corporate focus is value extraction. They actively suppress innovation because R&D money doesn't impress shareholders who want high dividends now not great things later. Just my opinion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What time are they releasing tmrw?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks to the OP for writing this up.  Also, thanks to everyone else in the comments.  I have some ARKQ and ARKF.  I was curious what all would be in ARKX and what people’s reactions would be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ark has a 0.75% expense ratio. Why would I ever invest in them when I could just buy their holdings and save .75% per year?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Arkx not up on rh?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i was holding funds for this all month so i got in at 250 on my main account and 18 on an off that may go up to 250 depending on how im feeling about GME and AMC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... She got Deere in this... yes. We need riding  mowers in space...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,God I wanna be a space farmer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,shii was just looking it top ten yeah thought it would be bigger than fucking 3d printing bru
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, that sounds kind of cool. Space  🍌"
2021-03-29 22:37:32,wallstreetbets,Morgan Stanley has no more RKT blocks to sell LOL 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They say on CNBC that they've got nothing to sell to keep the price up and then immediately try to sell 20m shares. Isn't this illegal? How long is CNBC going to keep doing this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've had a secret theory that rocket has been buying back shares for a while now. That's why it spikes at open every morning before mellowing out each day.
 

I wonder if Rocket bought the block."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LOVE THIS!! MOON!! 🚀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in 5000 Shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, CNBC, the most reputable news source /s"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So call options then
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So ms dumped their shares and the stock didn’t crash due to the bagholders?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Since when do banks real time comment on their trades? Make all the effort to trade on dark pool but put the trade on bloomberg? Wtf?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We’re going to the Fucken moon tomorrow.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where does anyone get these information?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I invested in RKT, I’d be crossing my fingers that GME explodes soon. All those apes with their fresh, new tendies would send Rocket .... rocketing"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,why are big banks selling tins of stock recently? major crash soon?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Short sell?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone pls explain to my monke brain what this means?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where ya get this list from?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They were under the couch cushions
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,right now its best to hold shares. not options.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Weren’t they the guys with a conscious in the big short?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I HAVE SOME RKT SHARES AND I HOLD THEM, THEY ARE WORTH"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still dunno what that mean, but apes said they long gme"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I should contact them to get a good deal on lincoln logs then.  I bet they have a few million pieces laying around.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So.. where do I find the market Bottoms? Asking for a friend?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit his LinkedIn description of his time at Kidder is one of the funniest things I have ever read. Emphasis added for the section that jumps it up to the “funniest things ever read” category

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in rocket for 100 since Jan. It was heavily shorted. But it's cheap and it pays dividends and is undervalued some. I like it and have. I just don't want GME gang getting in on it. They stress me the fuck out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I would say this is bullish. A fund had to liquidate 20m shares yet the price ended flat, means there's plenty of big money buyers at this price. Compare what happened to Viacom's stock and Discovery's stock when they had to liquidate. 

Full disclosure, I'm not a professional and I do have a relatively large position in RKT."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT go up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes daddy 🍆💦🦶
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I am a Foote
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kinda wanna throw a ""hey sec, that manipulation thing you were looking for on reddit is over there"" to them"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It prints tendies quarterly. It's a decent stock. Wish I had cash for more. Sticking with my 100.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity told me my brain was too smooth to buy calls or puts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds like Theta gang to me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please give ape a quick ELI5. Ape wants more bananas
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,37.56% estimate per Ortex as of today
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went from 3.1 million down to 2.6 million left available to short this morning as an fyi

I like the stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's irrelevant except in the sense that short interest is holding down the value of RKT from where it should be.

If you look at any price target, any metric released about RKT, you'll see it's over sold and undervalued. If you're hoping for a squeeze maybe, but probably not. That said, if they wanna fuck with the shorts, now sounds like a good time to start buying back shares as was indicated earlier in the month. With a big hedge fund getting slapped with a margin call dragging down the market, buying back shares could put the hurt on other large shorts and the combination of their longs dropping and shorts climbing could get more margin calls going accelerating the effect."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fintel showed a decrease of 500k shares to short from morning to midday. From 3.1 to 2.6 available. 

That plus the news of the block sale probably had an impact."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re now both financially and morally ruined
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lessthan Stanley

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel had a position on RKT but they sold most of it last Dec before all this fuckery happened
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i haz long rkt
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg terminal costing 20K/year
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bloomberg terminal.. its a 25k a year subscription
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If anything the UWMC bs was a distraction from us taking this rocket off in the first place.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what happens when you put blinders on. I'm riding the long haul and really hoping this one doesn't get meme raped
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say that's generally very bullish. 20m shares was absorbed liked nothing. It means Institutions have a hard on for the stock. 

Compared what happened to RKT to what happened to VIAC and DISCA, those two got annihilated. RKT ended pretty flat.   

I will warn you I have YOLOed into RKT with 25k shares and a bunch of calls so take that how you will."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were selling a block (or blocks idk) of RKT in the process of liquidating their positions and if all the blocks are already sold, then there's less selling pressure on the stock and a greater chance the price would increase.  This is not financial advice, just a commonly made speculation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was in on RKT on day one and got out next day, 29 in 33 out, sadly ""waited for the first 30 minutes of the day volatility to be over"". What's the deal with RKT blowing up to 26 the other day?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this happens more than we want to give credit to. Fomo is a huge money maker for them no doubt. I don't necessarily think that was the case this morning though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everyone knows J-Pow plays the ukulele-banjo, so he's got that shit covered."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At that time, traders also got paid on carry without being assessed a financing charge. Carry is the interest an investment pays. So Citibank had treasury traders taking home multi-million dollar bonuses based on simply buying and holding Treasuries yielding 10% without doing much  trading."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Solid stock imo. The dividend was great and the company is profitable. And it's name is rocket.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,hahahahaha this shall be my most favorite reply today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't pay dividends. It payed a single one time special dividend.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Personally I would say this is bullish. A fund had to liquidate 20m shares yet the price ended flat, means there's plenty of big money buyers at this price. Compare what happened to Viacom's stock and Discovery's stock when they had to liquidate.

Thanks! I also just realized another redditor asked same question earlier today. Thank you for your time! :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. 20M shares of RKT were eaten up so fast by someone who speculates that RKT will be valued as a fintech rather than mortgage firm. Thanks for responding!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i hope. i have april 16 25c that i've been sitting on since it shot up to $42 back in february. i'd like to say i didn't get left bag holding.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I think they dumped blocks and said we're done before the initial sale even got reported.

This was the first indication it was happening."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. The buyback is basically a guarantee it won’t go below IPO price and nothing more. They don’t need to use the buyback of it stays where it is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too... a lot of them.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the thing. Dark Pools are created to not move the market THIS IS HUGE they are set  up for extremely wealthy to trade between, given the Congressional Special Covid Rules with SLR it looks to be badly abused"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They told me I had just enough wrinkles to buy shares and then sell them as calls

The stock price has been suppressed by shorts for months, but this won't last forever as more investors realize its value. RKT's CEO has also publicly addressed short sellers and will continue to make moves so the shorts can fuck off. Earlier this month they issued a one time special divvy (which the shorts had to pay for) and RKT also has a $1B stock buyback ready to go.

And RKT isn't going to tank to $12.89 by April 1 unless we see a market wide crash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, whoever bought those $12.89 calls with a premium of $12.83 is paying roughly $25.72 per share if they choose to exercise. So it wouldn't be worth to exercise the call option because whoever bought it would still be under unless it reaches $25.72 I am assuming this is a way to reduce risk and losses. You pay a heavier premium but reduce the downside if you're not above the $25.72 per share price. On the chance that it does raise above that target the rewards are still minimal because of high pricing. On the chance that OP does get assigned, he still wins because his cost basis is lower then what he would receive for the price per share and the premium combined so he would net the 2K+ in pure profit. 

Low risk and low reward for the buyer.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw it being pushed by MSM and that was a warning sign.  Just like they said Reddit was going after Viacom and Discovery.  

What did I miss?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,First start with 10m
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Counter to what others may assume, I was actually born poor, immigrated to the US my family after the Vietnam war. Served in the military to pay for college. Not that it matters, I just generally think the whole circle jerk of assuming everyone who has money is some asshole is not healthy.

As for the reason why I YOLOed, I guess it boiled down to 3.

1. The company has a history of ethical behavior. During the 2008 crisis, they DID NOT engage in subprime lending. When it came down to it, they chose to be ethical instead of being Profitable. [You can see that in this interview with the founder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=560s)

On top of that, they have an astronomical NPS score relative to the competition. That's the customer satisfaction score. It's like 74 vs 16. [You can see that in this analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1uQ6ltMaq8&t=450s)

What that tells me is that in a continued bull market, they should grow market share as word spreads about their ethical behavior and how well they treat their customers. BUT, in a bear market, when things go to shit, I also know that they probably did not engage in whatever risky behavior that fucked other firms. They're more likely to come out ahead (like they did during the 2008 crisis).

2. They're fundamentally mis-priced (I believe). They're priced as a mortgage company when they are really a fintech. Some people debate this of course, that the whole crux of the Bear/Bull fight. But what convinced me is that the founder Dan Gilbert and the CEO Jay Farner seem to understand technology and embrace change and innovation. You can see that here in these interviews.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j\_KPc1ZefOg&t=30s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_KPc1ZefOg&t=30s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=1002s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=1002s)

What this tells me (if I'm correct) is that the price will rise in the future as the market begins to price it as a fintech.

3. The price is (I believe) being artificially suppressed. You can see that in my DD about RKT here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big\_catalyst\_tomorrow\_for\_rkt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big_catalyst_tomorrow_for_rkt/)

If I'm correct, that tells me the fair value is somewhere higher. Actually, what happened today also confirmed that since 20m shares were bought up like crack at $25.25 to $26.25. [You can find a discussion about that here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfvovp/what_morgan_stanleys_offering_of_rkt_20m_share/)

The fundamentals are great too, they're making gobs of money.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmcjbw/simple\_short\_and\_sweet\_smooth\_brain\_dd\_for\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmcjbw/simple_short_and_sweet_smooth_brain_dd_for_why/)

In fact, RKT did NOT go public for the money, they went public to attract talent to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon.[Here's an article from when they first went Public.](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)

>While Quicken's coffers do not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said, **going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.**  
>  
>**""That’s a lot easier to do when you’re a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and software people.""**

Not an expert, not financial advice, those are just my thoughts, good luck to you.

Edit: Also u/TreeImmediate added below why the P/E ratio is not accurate for RKT. Worth a read if you're interested. He pegs the fair value even as just a mortgage company at $50."

There’s a reason people pay 20k a year for the terminal(other reasons also of course)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Given the timing, it's MOST LIKELY due to that hedge fund going bust. Given the history of RKT, especially given that they came out of the 2008 crisis on top because they DID NOT engage in sub-prime lending while everyone else was tells me that MOST LIKELY their stock is not toxic.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea, maybe because the market doesn't really know what to make of what happened yet. There still seems to be an uneasiness about other funds going bust and a chain reaction? That's my guess, not a pro by any means."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, whether or not Dan Gilbert is the one that bought back the stock is just speculation.  They did recently authorize a $1 Billion buyback before all of this. 

I was just explaining why they might have authorized the buyback in the first place. 

It would still be bullish if they were the ones that bought it back since 1. That means they think the price is cheap and 2. they definitely won't be lending out those shares to shorters. 

But in a way, you would be right because them buying it back themselves wouldn't be AS bullish as institutions gobbling it up. We'll never know which situation it was I guess. Or maybe we will tomorrow who knows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol same here. Any stock I buy drops when I purchase and anything I sell shoots up. I need to wash this mushhh off of me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha! I did that just last week. True story.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok.  I thought something was up about his comment.  Since the calls he sold were like 99% intrinsic value, basically anything over 25.72 is a loss for OP because he’s missing out on gains right?  It seems like just selling all his shares at 25.72 is effectively the same as selling the deep ITM calls."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m saying it’s more worth it to exercise than it is to let it expire worthless, especially if you already paid 1/2 the share price in premium.  So maybe the option buyer can trade it to cut losses, but in the end isn’t someone buying and exercising it?

Also where is the 2k number coming from?  Is that under the assumption that it finishes the week where it is currently priced?  The premium was 99% intrinsic value, so wouldn’t any EOW price over $25.72 be a loss for OP?  Meaning he would have been better off not selling a call because he missed out on gains?"

Wow. I knew everything else, but not this. You should probably add the fact that almost every source out there has listed RKT with an incorrect P/E Ratio of over 13x. It's actually way more underpriced than people realize. The reason why is brokers are using the GAAP Diluted EPS to calculate the P/E Ratio. But if you take a look at the [earnings transcript](https://s25.q4cdn.com/509921419/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-2020-Earnings-Release-v-final-web.pdf), you'll see that the GAAP Diluted EPS actually misses all of Q1, Q2 and a month of Q3.
 
>""GAAP"" stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. On August 6, 2020, Rocket Companies' stock began trading on the NYSE and it did not have any shares outstanding or calculations of earnings per share for any periods prior to this date. Under GAAP, the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the three and twelve months ended December31, 2020, include only the period from August 6, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

Comparison between incorrect and correct P/E calculations:

Share price (24) / Gaap Diluted EPS (1.76) = 13.636x P/E Ratio (incorrect)

Share Price (24) / Adjusted Diluted EPS (4.11) = 5.839x P/E Ratio (correct)

So yeah, RKT fair value is over $50 per share even if it were to be priced as a mortgage company. US Mortgage Industry average is 13.7x P/E ratio. Edit: And FYI, it does happen to be America's *largest* mortgage lender. It's not a question of whether RKT will go up, but *when* will it go up? Patience will be rewarded."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they didn’t think those things. There’s still definitely a bearish outlook that it’s just another mortgage lender/ they’ll get killed when interests rates go rise/ RE market takes a shit. Depends on what camp you’re in. Also the hedge fund went bust, it was a forced liquidation, wasn’t like they get to pick or chose. I could be wrong though, I don’t know what happens in an event like this, I think a lot of people don’t know. I just know it held up a lot better than VIAC or DISCA."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been thinking something similar. It could definitely snowball if another hedge fund gets margin called. They liquidate their positions, retail gets nervous and starts to pull out, which makes other over leveraged hedge funds get margin called. 

There’s a pretty decent chance that GME/AMC get the margin call snowball rolling on this."

I don't care what YOU believe, I do care what others who are skimming and reading the comments believe since they might be young/ impressionable. I don't want them to grow up with the same mentality as you and take that to the voting booth."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's a pretty superficial understanding of the financial crisis and society's problems.

Per the wikipedia:  

>Government policies that encouraged home ownership, providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers; overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate; questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers; compensation structures by banks and mortgage originators that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation; and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making. 

So encourage home ownership, that's great, but without proper regulation that leads to sub-prime lending. That has nothing to do with the rich since they are obviously not the recipients of sub prime loans. 

Did people make huge sums of money from it? Sure. Is wealth inequality a problem? Of course. But just blatantly blaming the rich misses the underlying problem and that is the fundamentals of the American economy has changed. We are no longer a manufacturing economy. The government has not kept up and the public education system has not kept up. Politicians are too scared to tax and too scared to stop spending so they run up the debt and kick the can down the road. There are rich people who don't mind being taxed more but that tax money has to go to good use. Running around screaming eat the rich doesn't solve anything. And frankly, we're running out of time for such simplistic immaturity and stupidity. I wish the world was so simple, but it's not.

What's my point? We're all in this together, rich, poor, black, white, asian, latino, male, female, whatever. We're all in this together."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude seriously chill the fuck out or go find a life outside of the internet. He’s buying back shares not going private you idiot. If you took the time to Google it for a goddamn minute you could have found out he’s trying to reduce volume by buying back shares and offering a $1.15 dividend per share to fuck with the shorts. Jesus you are insufferable.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks anyway. I bounce between so many sites to look at charts anyway...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for taking the time to spell this out. Hope some young apes are listening.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So you want them to vote a certain way.  

And think I should give a shit.  Bye liar"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reason it was poorly regulated is because the very wealthy didn't want it to be regulated. And who got bailed out?

I don't really want to do a politics debate here, since this is not the sub for that, and I understand that reasonable people will disagree. But you see an anti-rich sentiment as potentially dangerous. I see the pro-rich sentiment as currently causing real problems.

All the races and genders may be in this together, but Bezos and Elon, and Buffet aren't in anything together with me."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, no wanted those loans to be regulated, not the poor people buying houses, not the home builders, not the homeowners that saw their houses appreciate. It wasn't just ""the rich"". Everyone loves money when it's flowing.  

I'm not pro-rich and this isn't about politics. You think it's about politics but I'm trying to tell you that you don't understand the fundamental problem. Technology is changing the world faster than our government/ society can respond. You can tax the rich all you want, doesn't solve the underlying problem."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A company going private and a company buying back shares to decrease the outstanding float is not the same thing. You asked why and I told you, he’s trying to drive the price up. Google it fuckface."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Changing technology as the prime cause of our increasing wealth inequality is a weird take. 

I believe you are a smart person, and I believe you are sincere. I also believe you are all the way wrong. But I don't want to debate right now or here, so I hope you have a nice day"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is essential the same thing. Buying back is just a slower and prolonged process versus doing a one time offer. It's cash for shares. There's no difference, whether you do it by pieces or in one go."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been itching to watch the big short again for weeks. can't put it off any longer
2021-03-29 22:12:11,wallstreetbets,"What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 means MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like your logic but you’re missing one key thing that could throw this all off. They may have had other incentives to offer that price for the block trade. i.e. we’ll give you a discount on this trade if you let us borrow shares xyz at a lower rate or sell us some other shares at a lower price, or even hookers and blow.

If I'm understanding you correctly: Even in a special circumstance like this one, RKT wouldn't legally be able to purchase the block in its entirety, which means they probably didn't get any of it. The entire block going at once to one buyer seems to be what was reported. 

That would indicate some other institution has purchased it (~$505M). I figured RKT might simply to try and keep this out of the hands of the HF's (who might not buy it because its above the average but I don't know if this would be a valid way to hedge 20M shares to neutralize their short positions). What I'm hearing you say is that it wasn't likely an available option for them?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Many here are missing the point.

**THIS IS A CHEAPER WAY TO COVER SHORTS THAN BUYING AT MARKET**

Why? Because if you buy 1,000,000 shares at $24, the price becomes $25. If you buy 1,000,000 shares at $25, the price is $27. You buy 1,000,000 more shares, it's now $31. You start running out of sell orders between $24 and $35.

Now buy all from this block at $25, what happens to the price? Still <$25, you've covered lots of your $26-40 shorts for profit."

2021-03-29 21:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Biocryst ($BCRX) continues to remain undervalued First off, I am not giving you advice. I'm not a financial advisor, nor do I work in the pharma industry. I'm just sharing some research I did, and I'm open to all feedback and comments. Additionally (in full disclosure) based on what I found, I'm holding 450 shares because I'm still afraid of options.

Lets start off with some TLDR for the bullish thoughts and bearish thoughts.

Bullish points:

Based on fairly conservative COGS I have a share target of $19, but if that turns out to be overly conservative a more realistic value could easily push the share target to $24-$30. These values also assume fairly conservative adoption among the patient pool. The recent injection of liquidity also gives them plenty of runway to start cashing in on a fully approved drug (Orladeyo). Additionally none of this accounts for their developmental drug (BCX9930) at all which [has been racking up some big wins in clinical trials fairly recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and could push this to another level entirely. Considering that their Orladeyo drug on its own would support nearly double the current share price this makes a 10$ entry point fairly attractive with a potential bonus moonshot if BCX9930 takes off.

Bearish points:

Despite being approved, the rate of adoption of Orladeyo could take years to secure my estimated market share (I cant find any data to help estimate adoption rates). Drug trials can be a shot in the dark, and while currently there is no bad news regarding their up and coming drug BCX9930, a bad result would certainly draw enough negative sentiment to tank the price, despite Orladeyo easily supporting a share price of 19$ on its own. Additionally BCX9930 will need to complete trials for all of the numerous diseases they plan to market it for. Those trials will cost time and money and drag out for years. Lastly drug prices are in the focus of media pressure in the US which could likely have a negative impact on the pharma industry as a whole.

Now for the details. I'm going to talk through Liquidity, Revenue estimates, Cost estimates, and eventually arrive at my price target estimates. Lastly I'll speculate on some risks.

* Liquidity: In the 3rd quarter, they lost around 45M and had around 150M cash.  In Dec., they secured an additional 325M in liquidity (200M as a line of credit, and 125M as a 1-time gain which results in them paying a royalty on Orladeyo).  They have plenty of liquidity.  
* Revenue:  they have 2 drugs that I consider material.  Orladeyo which was approved in US and Japan, and is about to be approved in Europe.  BCX9930 which is far from approval in all but 1 disease in the US.    

   * Orladeyo is the only oral treatment for a rare disease known as HAE.  
   * Orladeyo will likely be sold for around 300000 per patient per year.  Biocryst set a price for sales in US of 485000, and will likely be sold for less in Europe, but I figure it averages 300000.  This price might sound obscene but is actually cheaper then its competition Takhzyro and Haegarda, which cost over 500000 per year.  
   * Orladeyo was actually only 30-44% effective in reducing HAE attacks, whereas Takhzyro and Haegarda are both around 80% effective.  However, Orladeyo is the only oral medication while Takhzyro and Haegarda both require injections.  The keys to Orledeyo are that it is a much more convenient and less invasive treatment, and despite its seemingly low effectiveness, it turns out that 50% of patients had a 70% reduction in attacks (while the other 50% probably saw little or no benefit, averaging to 30-44%).  
   * Also, in Biocryst's 3rd quarter conference call, management discussed a survey that they conducted, and found that about half of patients receiving injection treatments would consider switching to Orladeyo.  Since Orladeyo is effective in half of patients, and half of patients would consider switching, I conclude that Orladeyo could likely secure roughly a 25% market share
   * There are 7500 patients in US and 6500 in Europe.  If I conservatively assume 20% market share, their revenue would be .2\*14000\*300000=840M.  FYI, their guidance is ""north of 500M"".  
   * For sales in Japan, Biocryst made a deal with a pharma company called Torii.  Torii will sell Orladeyo in Japan and pay a royalty to Biocryst of between 20-40%, which will amount to around 15M in royalty revenue for Biocryst.  
* Costs  

   * After looking at various income statements, it looks like cost-of-goods-sold is generally 15-33% in the pharma industry.  I'll conservatively assume 33% for Orladeyo.  Gross profit is 840M\*.67 + 15M royalties=575M
   * In the [4th quarter](https://ir.biocryst.com/node/22286/pdf) they had 605000 in product sales (100000 was Orladeyo).  COGS was only 33000.  It's unclear how much of this COGS is attributable to Orladeyo or how much noise there is due to revenue still being so small, but 33000/605000 implies a COGS of just 5.5%.  This leads me to think my 33% assumption may be high.  If COGS turns out to be 25%, then gross profit would be 645M.   If COGS turns out to be 16%, then gross profit would be 715M.  I can't imagine COGS being any lower (otherwise the drug wouldn't cost 485000).  
   * As a result of securing additional liquidity, Biocryst will pay a royalty of 8.75% on the first 350M of sales, then 2.75% on sales between 350M and 550M, then 0 thereafter.  This amounts to a maximum annual royalty expense of 350\*8.75% + 200\*2.75% = 36M
   * SG&A + R&D + interest expenses were 50M in 3rd quarter, and increased to 62M in the 4th quarter.  They said they had infrastructure set up to market/distribute Orladeyo so I imagine SG&A won't increase much, but R&D will likely increase to fund further research of BCX9930 as well as other drugs.  I'll assume these expenses rise to 75M per quarter, or 300M annually.  
* Based on these assumptions that leaves profit of 575M - 36M - 300M = 239M.  Again, COGS is a major unknown in my model, but profit could be as large as 309M (in my 25% scenario) or 379M (in my 16% scenario)
* Share count was 176M in 3rd quarter, and increased from 110M last year.  I'll assume risk of further dilution to 200M.  
* EPS is 239/200=1.19.  I estimate a $19 share price based on P/E of 16 and COGS of 33% (This improves to $24 and $30 share prices in my 25% or 16% COGS scenarios respectively, both of which are more realistic than a conservative 33%).  **This is** ***before*** **considering the BC.0X9930 drug, which actually seems to be their primary asset.**  I did not see any revenue estimates for BCX9930.  But lets look at what we do know:  

   * 9930 is already close to approval to treat PNH in the US (here is some great [DD thats focused more on this new drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from [u/BIO9999](https://www.reddit.com/user/BIO9999/)), but there would only be around 300 patients in the US.  I found a presentation on Biocryst's [IR page](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) that listed other diseases that 9930 could treat, and I googled the prevalence of each in the US:   

      * aHUS - 600
      * ANCA vasculitis - 6000
      * Lupus nephritis - 12000
      * IgAN vasculitis - 66000
      * glomerulonephritis - inconclusive
      * primary membranous nephropathy - 3000
      * IgA nephropathy - 7500
   * It's unclear how many of these patients would need treatment with 9930 or what the price of 9930 would be, but there seems to be a **huge opportunity for 9930 to easily double my revenue/profit forecasts**.  This revenue is many years and many clinical trials away though, and may eventually face competition from other drugs, so I didn't include it in my analysis.  
* Risks:  (1) I did not consider corporate tax on their profit (though they probably won't pay much tax due to years of losses to carry forward).  (2) I've seen politicians tweet about obscene drug prices, and the bad press/political pressure may cause price reductions and instantly hurt the share price.  (3) According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus revenue estimates are only 56.8M in 2021 and 144M in 2022 (as opposed to my long-term estimate of 855M).  It seems it might be some time before they reach my revenue targets.  
* Again, I'm not that familiar with the pharma industry so I'm not really sure what will happen with COGS, R&D, or SG&A, but I tried to be conservative.  I never thought I would consider a pharma stock, but this really looks good around 10.  Thoughts?

At first, I thought I was being skeptical like you, but now I’ve realized you’re basically spending a good amount of time soft bashing it, and nobody who actually believes in the company would do that. So what, do you not want it to pop? I’m just curious."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I am ""bashing"" is 

* this factor 7 that everyone is using which is simply false

I think a realistic price target as presented here is way more believable and credible than those astronomic pts that bio9999 throws around. Don't get me wrong here, I think the guy know his shit concerning drugs but he has no clue of financials.


What I want is actual discussion but instead all that happens is you get called a bear (or in your case mega bearish) and insulted (for having a pt that is 100% the current price lol). This post does a good job of presenting why the other ""serious"" pts are not going to happen, at least not in the near future."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the people that comment with an opposing thesis. I would much rather see the other side's view, regardless of which position I take on it(if one at all).

Bear comments on bull posts have helped me find profitable positions with higher accuracy than bull posts, thus far (although my bull winners pay off bigger when they win)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go through your post history again. Maybe you should tone back your criticisms just a bit if you want people to believe you’re actually long on the stock. Your idea of actual discussion involves generating concern wherever possible. I can’t tell if you are trying to drive new potential investors away, because if one of your comments was the first they saw when they visited the subreddit, it would be a terrible first impression. 

For all Bio9999’s shortcomings being a little too blindly optimistic on the stock, he’s still contributing infinitely more to the discussion than you have or will, even if your goal is to spread FUD. Just saying."

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. 🤷 

Anyway, $APHA/$TLRY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, eventually."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The world is large yes but have you thought about it? The cultural differences, population, along with wealth play a huge role in what is plausible when thinking about where this market will flourish . 90% of the 2019 and 2020 legal cannabis sales were in the US which is yet to be even half legalized. Other parts of the world 1) don't consume like we do in the US. 2) have the disposal income to spend on it. I mean the possibility of it becoming legal in Mexico doesn't mean much because it's citizens can't afford to buy it for much money. How much could you sell a  joint for in Mexico?? 10 to 20 pesos from what I read or 1 US dollar. Unless it was to a US tourist not much. 3) Have the population anywhere near the size of the US. Europe might come around and do well. Though that is many countries with individual governments far behind the US in progress to legalize. Other than that most Asian countries are very against legalization. Some have the death penalty for selling large quantities and years jail time for small offenses. The Middle East has a similar veiw. South America is similar to a Mexico situation where I don't imagine you could sell it for much. Africa?  Does anyone honesty think African countries will have big legal cannabis markets?? Basically the US (currently largest) , Europe (though that is many countries that have yet to legalize some will some won't) , Australia and Canada (small populations)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good. So that’s why it skyrocketed this morning.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would sell 10 CCs and let 5 ride. Not financial advice.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy moly dude. You mad?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope—it’s the opposite; I bought the put at the peak of today’s gains, knowing it would probably drop at the end of the day. So far it looks like I was right."

GME has significant implications, but any DD should take into account this monumental shift in financial policy over the next 9 months to protect people from reading into things that are much greater in scope than GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So what's the plan here lads

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All accumulation of money is evil. When one person has more money than necessary really all they are doing is keeping the ability from others to buy needed goods and services. The actual value disparity is irrelevant. The hoarding of wealth is a sickness of Capitalism which itself is self destructive in the end.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you borrow money from your broker to play stocks, the broker requires you keep a certain amount of cash in your account to help reduce their risk in case you go tits-up in debt.  That security deposit funded by you is your margin.

When things in your account start looking bad, the broker can make a margin call, which is a request for you to increase that security deposit to an amount that's acceptable to them.  If you can't dump more of your money into your margin, the broker can decide to seize your margin and liquidate all the stocks that you have with them."

Nope, completely separate OS by IBM. NeXT was cool, but required specialty hardware. All of these operating systems had true multitasking and protected memory, making a stark contrast to Windows which didn't have them until NT and arguably no OS delivered to mass market (or for general consumption) by MS had these basic operating system features until 2000 (when they merged NT and 95 into Windows 2000)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They're holding $7000 from me for 2015 where I may have made 30k that year. Everytime I call them it says we're to busy call again tomorrow.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean disclaimer - I did know from everyone who has ever dealt with the IRS ever - don't fuck with the IRS. I should have spent the day on hold - which I *tried* calling them a few times prior - always gave up for various reasons after holding for a few hours... don't do that, no matter how small, take the day off to wait to talk to them. 

What bothers me is - why the fuck did you audit some random scrub's tax return from 2016 in late 2018???

I got laid off, had multiple w-2's & unemployment which I didn't even exhaust and was back in school for a bit to change careers. 

I made what was clearly an accidental mistake on a return that was complex enough to merit having a professional double check it, but I was fucking unemployed due to the price of oil falling not my inability to do my job 5 months of that year and exhausted my savings living & paying for education and such.

I couldn't afford a professional same as I couldn't afford taxACT's audit protection. I exhausted my savings & partially cashed out a 401k - I was fucking broke!

Also bootstrapped, I make significantly more now, they make more money off me than they do Warren Buffett for fucks sake. 

Why? Over a $600-$800 error???

Why can you afford to audit that & then get a fucking judgement over an amount no sane profitable fucking debt collector would chase beyond the occasional phone call would chase? 

Especially when you by your own fucking balance sheets know you're already holding 75% of the total amount - with interest & fines - of my fucking money?!?!

Yet... Too expensive to audit the rich. 

Common."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I finally got through I was on hold for like ~5 hours? 

I smoked a blunt, pooped, showered, played video games, made a late lunch, and then went back to video games while listening to their hold script. 

After a 10 minute conversation waited the requisite half hour possible delay as they batch their faxes before calling work HR lady to confirm they'd received the form lifting the garnishment around 4pm...

Got call from HR on my way in at 8:15ish on my way in & went straight there, poked my head in my boss's office on my way back down to cya taking day off to deal with thing... Had a 5 min walk from my apt to work... Started holding ~9:30am. Literally took a whole business day to talk to them. 

Sorry man :/ be persistent - the employees are actually nice/helpful if you can actually get through to them. I didn't complain about the hold time as pretty sure they're aware they're understaffed.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah slow down. Im not calling it a short squeeze. The company is a fintech and also extremely profitable. The price its been hovering around has been due to the low float which has made it attractive for short sellers.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you I didn’t feel like reading a book this morning haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you've been reading too much of those Seeking Alpha articles. I hate to break it to you but Chapter 11 is bankruptcy #Theycantpaynobills #MeNoPayBank. There are some benefits of going into bankruptcy but if bankruptcy is so great as per your description then we would of seen mass bankruptcy across airlines, cruises lines, and hotels over the past year. So why is everyone reluctant to do so and will only do it as a last resort? Simply because going into bankruptcy makes you lose control of the company and your assets and everything is at the mercy of bankruptcy court who would arbitrate the negotiation between the debtholders and the company. So how happy do you think those debtholders will be when the company asks for more cash and debt forgiveness? No very happy at all as you can imagine. This is why most of those offshore companies coming out of bankruptcy so far are working with less than $50 million in cash. Sounds a lot? If you do work in the industry then you would also know, on average it costs over $32 Million just to take a ship out of cold storage, doesn't sound that much now huh? In comparison, Transocean has more than $1 Billion in cash, just sitting there. 

Also, as a bank, how comfortable are you to loan money to a company who has a history of bankruptcy? Its like you walking into the bank with a 200 credit score asking for 200k loan. Even if you as a bank get conned into loaning that money, you'd be asking for insane borrowing costs that would definitely affect the bottom line of the borrower to offset that risk. This is why these same companies who had been in bankruptcy continues to go back into bankruptcy. Simple as that and the debtholders know it.

This also means if demand does increase, these new companies who came out of bankruptcy can no longer afford to take more ships out of cold storage or build/update their ships thus can't grow = bad for business.

I'm glad you touched the point of scrapping rigs. That would only happen if oil does not recover and demand does not go up which all current fundamental factors go against this. But if you been listening to their earnings calls, you would know that Transocean has been diversifying some of their unused rigs in overseas oil storage and its been paying off. I don't see any Seeking Alpha or Motley Fool articles covering this, they are just repeating the same bear news/analysis like Eljefe2800 said...hmm I wonder why.

You also missed the point that Transocean did restructured a good portion of their debt without going into bankruptcy thus the lawsuit.

One last thing, besides numerous earnings calls and analysts confirming this, it is also just logical; you are Chevon, planning to pay millions for a large contract to develop a well. You expect the project will be done over 3 years, so after knowing that SDRL just came out of bankruptcy and knowing that they were also in bankruptcy less than 3 years ago who would you trust? So don't assume this does not affect the oil clients. 

A word of advice, in the future, stop reading those seeking alpha articles and instead read the actual 10K, 10Q and actually listen to the earnings calls."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,XOM is a double if we get $90-100 oil again. RIG would be more like a 10x.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that's pretty well said. Kudos for putting everything in laymens terms lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right about one thing. If they enter Chapter 11 the valuation of the company is out of their hands & the original shareholders lose out partially or completely. So they don't YOLO into it for that reason but there are some positives such as wiping out BILLIONS of debt that would handcuff them in years to come. 

Where you're wrong...Companies are not exiting Ch11 with <$50m available its closer to $500m if you look at Diamond, Noble, Valaris who are some of the most relatable examples. In fact most of them have additional credit lines established as part of the restructuring. OK sure RIG has more at $1B but they also have upcoming payments on new equipment which is a huge chunk of money (hello 20k BOP's). And that's in addition to paying back debt at some point

Reactivation costs are actually closer to $50-75m for cold stacked floating rigs by the way. The latest gen rigs had a lot more toys on them than earlier versions. If you see the state of them now you'd see why the costs are so high. Almost a full renovation is needed which is also why scrapping them becomes the easy way out when cash is tight.

As for repurposing rigs for oil storage, I wasn't aware of this. Seems odd though as if you had ever stepped foot on a drillship you'd know how small they are compared to other vessels. Maybe a WSB retard hired one last April to store their negative value oil futures. Who knows, but its not going to save the day for them and they wouldn't be the only ones in a position to do it.

I still don't see any cases where oil companies are selecting rigs based solely on financial history. They want the safest rigs possible from companies with a good safety track record. (RIG is strong in this regard I will admit)

So if the ex-Ch11 companies have almost no debt, cash & credit available to reactivate rigs & invest in upgrades to meet new demands. Then I'm not sure your case makes as much sense any more? They're not completely FUK but it's not quite the walk in the park that you're expecting 

No positions by the way & not copy pasta from Seeking Alpha. Just 10+ years working in this industry. I hope I'm wrong"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nm. I understood it right. Op only lost money on the shares, not the contracts"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I missed that you bought the shares on margin and now I get it, thanks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jesus dude you're on thin ice here. Godspeed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He should have wrote naked calls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dave Ramsey is like boomer Cramer². I never want to hear his advice in this subreddit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean he also forced his employees to go to a Christmas party and forbid anyone to wear a mask, so..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Like a good child soldier for the Long Whales.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RH doesn't allow most uncovered risks. Only CCs and CSPs are allowed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's definitely a boomer, but unlike Cramer he wants regular people to succeed.  His advice is as anti-WSB as it gets but it's not unsound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,damn he should get a better brokerage then

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d be absolutely shocked if Chopped films in 12 hours. It’s more likely they film 3 episodes a day. 

My father had a food network show. They were so efficient they would film it “live to tape” which means that a 30 minute show took around 30 minutes to film and they even switched between cameras in a control room live. When it was done filming it was already edited and ready to air. They’d film a full season of edited and ready to air shows in 3 days. And this was with a tiny crew too. They have more kitchen workers than high-paying production workers. And the kitchen workers also create a ton of online recipes that make more ad dollars."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But I got this notion that the motion in your ocean meets small craft advisories.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interviews online seem to back up the 12 hour thing - and I know other shows like Cupcake Wars used to film over 1-2 days, and I'm pretty sure Netflix's ""Sugar Rush"" actually films over 2-3, but I can certainly see a ton of these shows that don't allow for retakes.

I know on Chopped & Cupcake Wars the vast majority of that time is simply prep time - moving ingredients into place, getting shots of the food, doing pickups of the bakers pretending to ""decide"" what to make on the spot, etc. 

& good point about the recipe, just last night my wife was on one of the sites looking for some specific recipe we saw on a competition show. They get the residuals, they often have a huge stake in the participants if any of them blow up as well."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets," So if I capsize in your thighs, high tide, be minus five  
You sunk my battle ship please turn me on"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good Bot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,DUR
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had to go look that up myself, it’s so different than my experience at FN. You are correct. While it’s clear these cooking competition shows are heavily edited to keep things moving, I just figured that meant they filmed for 3 hours instead of 1. 

It annoys me, because I had such a bad experience at FN! My father was on back when they still did regular cooking shows. The crew was all the same as Emeril Live which was filmed with an audience, so they were a machine of efficiency. But I was 18, just on as a guest, and did not go through any media training as my father had. 

They’d wheel in a cart and 4 kitchen people would stage the kitchen in 5 minutes as the kitchen producer would give specific instructions. They’d tell me exactly which eggplant to grab out of a basket, which cutting board, and which knife to use. How thick to cut it and then to slide it into the pan and put the cutting board in the sink. A ton of directions in 5 minutes as everything got put in place. Then they’d start filming and literally play the opening of the show for no reason as this was being taped. Then my father would start the show using a teleprompter and an ear piece for stage directions (I had neither as a guest). 

We had to accomplish everything that needed done in the time before a commercial break because, even though it was filmed, they treated it like it was live for no reason. I’d grab the eggplant start cutting and they’d yell CUT. Then they’d immediately reset the whole show and explain to me that I wasn’t looking into the camera as I cut the eggplant. We’d start entirely over, I’d get all the way to the end and I’d turn around to put the cutting board in the sink and they’d yell cut because I turned my back to the camera instead of walking backwards. We’d do everything again. But first they’d explain to me that this was the LAST eggplant just to add more pressure. 

It was stupid and awful. I’m an indie film director now and I STILL don’t understand why it would have been the end of the world to just pick back up from me walking to the sink instead of throwing all the food away and starting over. (They’d start from the last commercial break, not the whole show). 

When I was on it probably took twice as long as an episode without a guest. But they’d still get 3 episodes a day. They’d film full seasons of like 3 cooking shows during a break of Emeril Live (which had like 150+ episodes a year). 

Don’t know why I explained all of that other than because it still gives me nightmares."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Like Mr. Coffee with the automatic drip..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,and you shorted 2 shares of Tesla because....you want me to hate you?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 30 days
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TME said they’re buying back 1b in shares...seems like a good move relative to the rest of those listed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are these numbers in millions because otherwise they look like chump change?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone had it up on another thread.  VIAC, GSX, DISCA, TME the only tickers I remember.  There were more, those are just assumptions because of the massive volume.  Up somewhere on wsb.  Also saw on Twitter some insider had a 45M block sale of Viacom?  That might have what causes today's drop but who knows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d usually agree - but in this case one hell of a whale has left the market, and he’s not coming back. That missing money is a big hole to fill and there’s no telling if It will get filled."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing with FTCH and the blocks that got dumped to the market means no institutions wanted to buy the blocks being offered. Even the institutions already holding those companies. 

If I have 20 donkeys and you come up to me with a blanket that has the Black Plague, and say give me $100 or I'll cover your donkey with this blanket. 

And instead of paying you the $100 I say, fuck them donkeys. I'm not very invested in those donkeys."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Zoom out to the last 6 months.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought some GSX and IQ before I realized that the previous insane valuations were there because Archegos manipulated them up so that they can take on more margin.

Now I hope I'm wrong and they go back up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disney is far more than Disney+ lol.  Theme parks, abc, ESPN, licensing, stores, hotels.  You can't compare the two like that.  Plus Disney + is gonna have better content than Paramount + for forget.  Star wars and marvel, endless scripts incoming."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Annnnndddd...

VIAC is printing shares to raise capital because they know their stock was overheated and it was free money

DISC dreams of having their own streaming service bur can't even get out of the ""free cable packages"" in reality

Tencent - eh, this one may rebound, but music services are a dime a dozen and none too profitable

These stocks are being firesold down to these prices because there is no higher value in them other than the leverage that was propping them up... Will the eventually go up, sure, will they outperform their markets, not likely."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bigly
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,when would you but DISCA then ? after all'Hf bankrupcy ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy dickshit there are so many posts about this and so few point out this glaring fact. It was a singular event but unless there is another hedge fund in line to do the same stupid shit, there is nothing likely to fuel that kind of rise again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's $18B in a market worth over $50T. About one third of one percent. The $72B in leverage will just be given to other whales.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, I bought Sept calls today."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True... Viacom still has some of these things, licensing, CBS (leading US network), sports, multiple cable networks (MSNBC has lots of viewers), Simon and Schuster, they fleeced the NCAA for the tournament rights until 2032 (bonkers great deal). ESPN is next to worthless as it is consistently bleeding money.  Not saying they have the same value as Disney is in a stronger position (for what it is worth I think Disney will grow revenue by cutting out movie theaters). I think Viac is just undervalued."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,average down? lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't have an opinion on the matter, I haven't done any research beside reading news and what's posted here on WSB. I believe you could dig up some numbers that would help estimate risks but given resources available, I don't believe it would be much.    
   
Problem is, not much is known at this point. We don't know if there will be more liquidations related to this HF or if those sudden drops will cause domino effect to other HFs. You could try to time a bottom based on feels and greed WSB style, but always be careful when catching a falling knife."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Avatar has to have pretty much lost its leverage by now. They did a great job with Disney on doing the park, but the movie came out so long ago..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're definitely right, Gonna be cautius with this one"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,lol i bought in at $45.6 and sold 53 calls for a $1 premium. That's almost a 20% move on to hit that strike. If it does I dont care i make 20%. If it doesn't Ill keep selling calls and hold the stock. It's got a 11 PE with a whole shit ton of trademarks I dont mind at all.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i think he meant sell puts
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Avatar the last airbender not the stupid movie
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My problem is I am always overly cautious so I might not be best source of advice. Premarket on VIAC and DISCA looks optimistic. But then again, we don't know what will happen in next few days or weeks. If you only invest what you're willing to lose, you're good."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For some reason I presumed you were talking about selling calls naked or in a spread. Your CC play makes a lot of sense since you believe in the company at the current price.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t seem like enough to get behind. Especially after it got Shyamalan’d.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"4 shares at $279. At this point I’ve decided either I’ll lose everything or go to the moon, cool with either"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is actually the opposite imo, I feel like most of the people that got in early are done with it, and ready to move on. Even if they are still holding."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I miss the office on Netflix. Not gonna sign-up for Peacock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s still early tho at 180
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just go amc if you're late on the gme train.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it make me a bad person for hoping it tanks again before it moons so I can hard yolo in?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s how I felt about PLTR
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was going to the moon though? So wouldn't now still be getting in early?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People believing that the stock is a good stock and then complaining that they didn't buy the dip need to check their brains. If it is a good stock, and it's worth more than now, then IT IS the dip. Buy the dip and hold, don't be smooth popsicle brain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean.. yes.. I am very much looking forward to WSB moving on and taking the fight to the broader market.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hah, my average is at $230."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can guarantee you the people that got in GME early are NOT talking about it... if you put 15k down in early jan, and excited anytime before 400, you got 300-400k back,

That's IF you only put 15k...

Noone wants that sort of attention.

That's why i keep shitting on smoothbrain fomoers. You got in at 400 and are telling others to hold so that your hope that you won't lose your house is not 0."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here.  I average up every payday..

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, I eat paste.


When you buy stock, you should always have an exit plan envisioned. Something that lets you cut a profit, isn't stupid, but also isn't ""lets cut my losses."" Remember, were it any other stock, cashing out at a 30% gain is pretty swell for an average stock. But if you're extremely bullish about a stock's ability to grow, maybe that plan looks something like, ""I sell enough shares to cover my initial investment but not if it involves selling more than 1/5th of my total shares."" 


That then becomes your law. You do not deviate from the plan. If you did your job up front and didn't invest money you *need* elsewhere, then watching your investment crash and burn isn't going to set you back either."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,20 @ $96 and i ain’t selling till we reach AT LEAST 100k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s like ninety hundred dollars!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's called fractional shares. They can/should buy now then average down if they need to. I need the price of the stock to go up so I can justify buying a $20 share for $200
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucked up part for me is I expected this current situation after the first drop and was convinced it would find support between 70-90. Clearly it didn't so I lost out on buying a shit ton of shares. The second run up did convince people though so now we have proper support which is nice. I can't complain because for the first run up I averaged up to the 30s before it took off.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have over 10k ready if it cracks duble digi but thats the hard rule i set. Except 100 ill do 100. But calling 200->170 a dip is a stretch for me in the context of GME. If it happens every other day its not a dip. If it drops to 120 and holds for a few weeks thats a dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the guys who wanted us to buy silver now want us to buy GME.

It's a setup."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, in January I was gobbling shares at this price and higher, thrilled to even.  I liked the stock.

Today, I like the stock.  Now anything I can generate selling covered calls on my greenstonks goes directly into GME and any left over change goes into AMC.  In other words still buying when I can and diamond handing what's already bought.

It's still cheap and the ride is worth it, an opportunity like this is literally once in a lifetime thing.  The potential imo is excellent and a bit speculative,  a meteoric rise will make me rich a 100% loss gives me a war story and will NOT ruin me. 

It's a great game, fun.  And the company behind it will transform itself into a great platform and will NOT go bankrupt,  unlike the evil shitadel."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Just kind of ruined.” is a great way to describe how I feel after the last month on here

Edit: about myself. not the sub."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got back in at $50 a month ago. Foolishly set a stop loss that triggered when it dipped below $150 after getting near $300. Still made money and bought back in at $184. I know it's high, but it's money I don't need anytime soon and if it squeezes like everyone thinks then I don't mind the high buy-in."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"THANK YOU. 

I got in at $40 back when WSB was still at 1 mil members and I was only in it because there was the huge (141% float) squeeze and the insurance that GME had solid fundamentals to take it above $40. 

Now it’s not a sure bet for but everyone keeps posting about GME and confirming this bias. I just wanna see some decent DD on other tickers for once instead of  third rate memes on GME every day. Like seriously, the entire front page is filled with GME. 

I’m a supporter of GME as well but I would also like to see other content for once. If I wanted pure GME content, I would have gone to /r/GME"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">This sub is not just for GME. This kinda comment is suitable for the other sub.

But this is a sub for gambling. And GME could potentially be the biggest gamble of our lives"

I actually made a ton off the first squeeze back in january so now i just have some house money in this time. I’ve actually got a lot of faith in it, but i’d by lying if i’d say this is free money or anything. not sure why the other guy is so butthurt"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody is saying anything against that. I was simply  telling a bitch who beds with donkeys that claimed falsehoods such as ""GME is over unless you got in at $50 or less"" to shut the fuck up and that is all my good fellow.

GME is a once in a lifetime event. Whining about it being the center of attention is like whining about the moon landing being in all the news in 1969. This sub doesn't exist to cater to your exact needs."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means it is expected that pltr will be trading at 103x its eps or what they earn per share, a normal range is 20x...so overvalued"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its called post nut clarity
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Here's something to make you feel better: -$19289. FML haha. Long term bagholder here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$15 was my buy in price so I’ll probably pick up some more using profits from SPCE if it goes back down there again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was just thinking 19.05
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the insane dilution doesn't help the price even with enthusiastic buyers wanting long positions."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen what happens when the underlying data inputs are flawed?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Antitrust laws and effective taxation were dead by 1920. Not long before the Bad Thing happened, coincidentally.  


Both were back by 1960, and now they're both gone again.  


Let's hope another Bad Thing doesn't happen."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock benefit compensation. They would have been profitable in 2020 but they rewarded employees for sticking with them while being unprofitable for 16 years. 

This was without a sales team. Airbus improved their production by 33% from using their software. They are already involved in over 40 different industries."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock based compensation

When a company reports earnings per share they report it on a non-GAAP basis, and it doesn't include SBC. For the quarter in question I believe Palantir awarded insiders 400mn+ of SBC as a follow up to their IPO.

 That 400 mn made them ""not profitable"" from a GAAP perspective, although it wasn't really a business expense was it?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s been buying since $14 though so she’s just accumulating
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wsb style
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol fuck... I have like $70k in this stock... It better turn around. 

I am fine holding long term for tendies"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've already got a 2023 leap for pltr and if it drops to 15 I'll probably triple or quint my bet.

More likely I'll also set up a bunch of bull call spreads at a 20/40 strike for jan 2022 to 2023.  I feel similarly about PLTR as I did about Amazon in 2008 and Tesla in 2014 (but instead of investing I made bets with colleagues at work, because my brain is shrivelled and smooth))"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can speak for all current pltr ards and say FUCK THAT 15$ a share. Don’t even think that as a play.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Institutional buy in other than ark will help but that ain’t happening publicly anytime soon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,nah man. India too preoccupied with its domestic problems to become a global power.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes.  That's a lot of the part I've had experience with on VANTAGE.  The key is that they take time to understand what the data should be, and we (the Army) as customers have been filling in behind and cleaning up our inputs."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Netflix at $80... I remember when it was $7, and they where hemorrhaging cash, loosing content, phasing out dvds, and where taking on loads of debt to finance their own content and offering themselves to blockbuster. Netflix was a shit show of a company for a long time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yay we can be PLTR fucked buddies...I've put in exactly $69,628.46. What a bag of shit :D"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I posted about the merits of 20/40 debit spread leaps. I think this is a good target range over the next couple of years."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno how to do any of that shit.  I will probably just buy more shares 'cause I'm stoopid.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean other then meme hype there wasn’t a really great reason for it to rise from $15 back in October to its peak in the 40s, could easily go back down again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> other than ark 

How come ark lacks the streetcred to provide stability? I tried googling, but maybe I need to add ""controversy"" or ""fuk"" to the search words."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you not see analysts finding PLTR too restrictive though?

With things like Jupyter/Streamlit/ELK stack making it easier and easier for relatively novice analysts to pull in, manipulate, and present data, I can't see many companies paying for PLTR when there are free alternatives that allow much more freedom.

Military, of course. Military ethos seems to be 'why take free when we can spend money'.

Financial companies will build their own proprietary systems. Biotechs and academics will want their own systems that they can tweak according to their needs.

PLTR to me seems like a swiss army knife in a world that needs all of the parts of a swiss army knife but of a much better quality than is offered on a swiss army knife."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"OK - thanks! Just to push you a little further, could you share the worst thing that happened out of it all?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I made it this far down the thread. Shorting at $8 is full blown retarded
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir is far more moral than google or Facebook. Do you boycott their products?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re just going to get the “best of” stories. Everything sounds obvious in hindsight, but there’s also countless people who lost it all"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, that´s why I dodged it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask your wife’s boyfriend to explain it to you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure you could find plenty of analysis why it’s worth 22-26$...40 was gme hype train shrapnel before earnings.  Valuation vs PPE ration is high but consider potential market penetration it’s really betting on huge growth in an untapped industry - I guess? I think I don’t know fuck it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not based in AI; it's their attention to the underlying data engineering to power AI (or other forms of analysis).

It's not expert core, per se.  It's the rigid devotion to doing the fundamentals the ""*right*"" way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"someone mentioned it earlier, but yes:
Academics want customized systems for research work.
Finance wants in-house proprietary because speed/optimization for proprietary trading strategies.
Novice analysts have lots of good stack options to play with small datasets.

Nowhere represented in these descriptions are the blue-chip Large-cap small-margin companies.  The Airline companies.  The Shipping industry (moreso ground than sea).  Heavy industrial machinery.  Resource extraction.

These are all companies where the development-and-growth-part of their problems are mostly classical optimization and industrial engineering applications, where a small in-house team of research wizards can do the heavy lifting.  However, the production-part of their problems is going to increasingly be driven by sentiment analysis, consumer trends, secondary market effects, climate events, and other factors.  You can't pay a small in-house team to do anywhere near as well at managing, organizing, and mining all the data for that as you can to pay an expert company to help you set it up, maintain it, and provide support for your classic-problem specialists as they continue to design future growth and operations.

These are all industries where a fraction of a percent improvement that can be eked out by active management and crunching of all that data translates to tens of billions of dollars a year.  If Palantir is making a 5% commission on that business intelligence and data analytics, they're a company doing 100Bn/yr in business easily (note that this isn't realistic because competitors *will* arise, but it's a reference scale).

The key is that the quantity of data is way, way higher than what academics can realistically handle or crunch on, while also being more sophisticated and powerful than what novice platforms can support with the platforms you listed.

It's not a question of whether other folks can do things.  It's a question of the combination of things all at once--as I said, I'm not impressed by their AI or analytics effects even if they are top-notch in the industry.  I'm impressed by the *systems engineering* they've gone through floor-to-ceiling to ensure that what they have is scalable, maintainable, reliable, and *fast*."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I can not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You expect a turnaround of this scale instantaneously? If BB was to ipo today, it'd open at $40. Let's be real"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. Been asked by younger coworkers, how could you have passed. It’s real simple, Netflix at $7 wasn’t looking great. The early streaming experience was kind of meh is why I didn’t take buy in at $7. And honestly would have dumped it all at $12-14 anyway, I know damn well I wouldn’t have held it long past the price doubling."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you’re saying there’s no downside. Or, you’re implying that there are classified details, while still refusing to speak in generalities."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong, I like BB. I think Chen is a smart guy. It's just that BB needs to shake off their perception of being an old phone maker. Hopefully their IVY platform will open a lot of peoples eyes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If, instead of BlackBerry they stayed with the name,Research In Motion, they would be a $40 stock right now. Fucks sake, Research In Motion literally describes a massive chunk of what they are working on."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I rather trust my guts and go with it and face the consequences of those decisions, than to listen to somebody else and feel like a tool afterwards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"More that I can't list a downside that wasn't self-imposed.  I'm sure other clients have *seen* downsides, but from where I sit/sat all the problems were our (the customer's) fault, either on an individual or systemic level.

Edit: granted, this was the senior leader view, and for a 9 figure contract I'm sure the best of their best were doing the work visible to the General Officer level folks.

Also, refusing to speak in generalities is what the law requires regarding classified info; we can't even comment ""no comment"" in public.  So, if there were problems involving classified materials, nobody would discuss them anyway--that'd be a violation of the law and at the senior pentagon level, they go after folks for that if it makes news b/c headlines are bad optics."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to insinuate an answer either way, but how would you explain how every etf that has GME in it trading almost exactly the same today?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh I kind of agree but the rim jokes would be plentiful and blackberry is a household name for alot of people.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the time, Netflix could have gone either way. I don’t feel like an idiot for not buying in😑. But I’ve made and lost and made plenty in the 10 years since. Easy to look back 10 years."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But those all still need to built, mounted and wired up.  Licenses negotiated.  Lots of towns are resisting placing them all over.  The signals don’t go through buildings so in cities they will all need to be line of sight.  Remote highways will also need at least 5 per mile to hit that 1000ft range (probably more to make sure).   And routers/signal boosters."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What year do you think it is?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, it just won’t be traditional tower builders.  NOK is negotiating them all over the place as well as Ericsson."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'd like to read what he has to say too. Can't tell if genuinely bullish or gone insane...

There was a rumour that his broker wouldn't let him sell on 3/2 for some legit but bullshit reason or other. So, yeah, I'm wondering whether the trauma of watching his thesis play out two days before he was able to cash out has turned him into a batshit crazy jungle colonel a la Apocalypse Now. Then again, like you said, the dude's a millionaire so he knows better than I do. I'm in significantly on RKT, but I just keep my average price below $24 cos I think that's what SirJack's cost basis is. Somehow, this logic makes sense to me 😂

Sir Jack, if you're reading this: ""It's judgement that defeats us.""

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are people saying VIAC is an opportunity?  AFAICT, the fall is part of the reason margin calls were triggered on the fund, which then decided to sell-off.  It wasn't the sell-off which caused it lose 50% of its value, which is what it seems like some people are implying.  I'm reading reporting (MSM) that the sell-off only dropped the value by \~7%.

Are folks thinking that VIAC is fundamentally more sound?  It's only traded above the current value for half of its lifetime.  It struggled in the recent past b/c they were playing a traditional media company's game in a streaming media's market...

Is there some reason (b/c Paramount+ doesn't seem enough) to think that VIAC will make a comeback?"

Other than ViacomCBS and Discovery, media reports have mentioned US-listed Chinese companies Baidu Inc., GSX Techedu Inc., IQIYI Inc., and Tencent Music Entertainment Group as the stocks in Archegos portfolio.
According to a report in Forbes, there are no securities filings by Archegos on SEC’s repository for such filings, EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval), despite the huge transactions undertaken by Archegos.

How come?

That is because Archegos status as a family office exempts it from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s reporting requirements for investment firms

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if this is true, but the first Vanguard rep told me because I had 1 option I was transferring over, that's why the rest of the stock I was transferring over was appearing as margin.

Also I didn't apply/get approved for option trading for Vanguard, so they were confused why I had an option in my account (part of why they were telling me my transfer should have never went through the first time). It just seemed like the reps I was talking to didn't know what they were doing.

Hope your transfer goes through smoothly though!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was told by fidelity that RH just transfers a lot of their securities out as margin and that messes with a lot of peoples transfers. I'm not sure if it's related to RH Gold or if is due to options turned on but that's the reason for why you get margin. At least that's what I was told by the fidelity rep.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"2010 Dodd Frank Act specifically altered the preexisting limits on “family office” firms. It’s almost like the US Congress designed this fleecing for a reason. 

>	So in 2013, Hwang converted the firm into a “family office,” set up to manage his private wealth. The family office, Archegos Capital Management, appears to be massive, not just in size and scope, but also in risk appetite. However, its status as a family office exempts it from the Securities and Exchange Commission’s reporting requirements for investment firms. Historically, family offices weren’t required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 because of an exemption provided to firms with fewer than 15 clients. When the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in 2010, the 15-client exemption was removed, dramatically increasing transparency on hedge funds and private equity firms. The Act included a provision that explicitly exempted family offices from reporting requirements. Thus, as a family office, Hwang’s firm wasn't required to disclose much."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Madoff did get called out, the SEC ignored it.

> The second case of concerns about Madoff's operation was raised in May 2000, when Harry Markopolos, a financial analyst and portfolio manager at Boston options trader Rampart Investment Management, alerted the SEC about his suspicions. A year earlier, Rampart had learned that Access International Advisors, one of its trading partners, had significant investments with Madoff. Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked him to design a product that could replicate Madoff's returns.[11] However, Markopolos concluded that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. After four hours of trying and failing to replicate Madoff's returns, Markopolos concluded Madoff was a fraud. He told the SEC that based on his analysis of Madoff's returns, it was mathematically impossible for Madoff to deliver them using the strategies he claimed to use. In his view, there were only two ways to explain the figures—either Madoff was front running his order flow, or his wealth management business was a massive Ponzi scheme. This submission, along with three others, passed with no substantive action from the SEC.[88][89]"

So I wrote them a five page response indicating how their math is flawed and went through my 1040 line by line showing correctly how to calculate taxes on untaxed income and even had a summary of my proposed changes vs their proposed changes. What I should owe on back taxes plus interest is not even $200 iirc."

Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any details please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so here's my thoughts:

I'm extremely bearish on the overall market. I'm assuming there's going to be another really big crash, much like thousands of others. The problem is always *when*. 

So investing in negative beta stocks is the play. Meanwhile GME has unheard of amounts of negative beta. 

The question remains then: Will GMEs beta continue to stay negative before the market crashes? Or will its beta return to positive before then?"

So by the Black Rock reducing their positions in all the stocks that drop, citadel was one of the main holders of those shares, it pushed citadel closer to a margin call.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean if you think about it if GME was a poor investment like they claim there wouldn't be inflation because their shorting would take our money. If on the other hand they're forced to lose billions to regular people who will spend the money there will be concern of inflation (even if the positive aspects way outweigh the negative).

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Understanding the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility was established in order to encourage financial markets to function more effectively. Primary dealers borrow overnight loans from the PDCF through their clearing banks at the primary credit rate offered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

A frequency-based fee is assigned to primary dealers who borrow from the PDCF on more than 45 business days.

Financial Crisis
The facility was one of a number of steps taken by the government to free up credit during the financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression of 1929. The crisis was the result of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and culminating in the near collapse of the banking system. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which forced banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income minorities creating a market for subprime mortgages.

The Federal Reserve made loans totaling $8.95 trillion to primary dealers in exchange for a wide range of collateral under its Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley each received loans that total more than $1 trillion. However, these were overnight loans, which were frequently rolled over into new loans. Some 21,000 transactions with financial companies and foreign central banks were made using the facility."

&#x200B;

OP is wrong for pretty easy reasons. He flat out doesn't understand what Archegos is and why it matters that they're not a HF:

>Archegos never filed anything with the SEC and they have ties to blackrock

Archegos is a family office, not a hedge fund or a RIA. They are not obligated to file anything with the SEC.

Furthermore, Archegos notoriously trades their equity positions through swaps which does not require any 13F filings as they don't actually own the stock, just the economic exposure. The actual stock gets owned by the bank as a hedge or internalized with other PB/swap positions (if I'm a bank and a client wants a swap to long TSLA and I've already got another client with a swap to short tsla, I just use one swap to hedge another instead of having to use up my balance sheet on both).

Back during my years as a synthetics trader (at one of the majors), we looked at onboarding Archegos in 2016 but couldn't get past relationship risk committee. They'd be exclusively a swap client which was pretty lucrative for us given we had a bit of pb shorts in us listed chinese equities that we could internalize with."

BBY is 1) going down the tubes, and 2) entered into that deal with Apple (and MS, and Amazon, and Google, and to a lesser degree Samsung, Sony, and LG in the Home Theater Dept) so that they could a) actually sell those companies' products, and b) get the white glove support treatment (each of those companies have reps that visit stores regularly to train the sales team).

Gamestop doesn't make products that BBY would sell. Gamestop already has a ton of locations around the country. So neither of them need each other in the way BBY and those product suppliers do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop has locations throughout the country. Apple wants Apple stores to be a premium experience. But they want extra retail space. So they can piggyback on Best Buy. GameStop has plenty of retail space. And Best Buy (while I personally like it) isn’t some amazing name. GameStop doesn’t need BB logistics. They have their own supply chain. There are way fewer Bb locations than GameStops. This just wouldn’t make sense for either business.

Wait. I thought all these GME bag holders were gonna get destroyed? I thought everyone on this sub bet their whole life savings on GME? You can't POSSIBLY EXPECT ME TO NOT BELIEVE that if 90% of the people on FUCKING WALLSTREETBETS say something that the accuracy of their statements is not 1000% iron clad. Right? People don't lie! Especially people on reddit! And doubly especially on WSB!! In fact I've never seen a single comment on WSB that I haven't immediately believed with 1000% conviction.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah I’d be more worried if he was talking about cesium and water
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That could be part of a transformation though. If GME took over video game sales for Best Buy they could effectively reduce the number of their brick and mortar locations that are solely GameStops. It would represent a massive cut in their overhead and allow them to focus more resources on their major e-commerce shift.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cohen's advantage here is the move towards experiences. Leveraging the brick and mortar to increase overall sales but not sinking all your revenue into leases. Get me in the store and let me try an HTC Vive on, I'm a lot more likely to buy one. Do a payment plan, the people have more access to it. Go to HTC and say ""Hey, I'm offering payment plans for your hardware. You should give me a % of your digital sales. Also I prevent scalping/botting."" They've definitely got a lot of opportunities."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If so I can’t resist a discount
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No.. they don’t have to sell GME shares due to its inherent risk / volatility.  They can continue carrying risky investments.  The difference is they have to have higher levels of cash in hand to back their investments.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between holding shares of a stock and having a short position that can lose more money than you could afford to pay back.

EDIT: In a long position, you're losses are limited to whatever you have invested in the stock. This is because a stock can only drop to zero. However, in a short position, you could theoretically lose an infinite amount of money, because there is no hard limit on how much a stock can go up."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I went to buy stuff from the closest GameStop store today only to find it is permanently closed. (I’m so sad it was 5 mins from my house and was open a month ago). Now I will have to go to one of the other 3 locations in a 10 mile radius

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The enforcement is that UWMC will no longer do business with any broker that also does business with Rocket. How aggressively will they be tracking the brokers is anyone's guess right now. It'll be another 5 months before we see the earnings reports from either company to determine the full effect of the ultimatum. But since UWMC closes loans in 1/3 the time and for an average of 15 basis points lower interest, brokers would find it beneficial to stick with UWMC. They can shop around to anyone else that isn't Rocket if they'd like to compare rates. Rocket doesn't seem too worried about it. Time will tell."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Love this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the worst sport.. I’d rather sit at the end of my driveway and watch cars drive by as I shake my fist and tell them to slow down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I dated a race car driver once - like a semipro or whatever and was friends with another one. They are all bitches and cry a lot. Actual tears
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn’t want competition with his adorableness.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyways he would forget to teach and easily go on these rants. I wanted to see this and they were like “haha wait till 11th grade” I thought that was for pussies so it also overlapped with my study hall and a bet was born
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No but there was once an issue with the football team
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I BET IT WAS YOU!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t even keep track of mods 😵
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All Star Special, eggs scrambled with cheese, grits, biscuit instead of toast, sausage, and regular pancakes, please.

Plus apple butter for the biscuit.

Shit's second nature!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's great, right?!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stew pickles lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1000%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should try a Labatt max ice tall boy on an empty stomach. For a soyboy like me it really gets the zoot going
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oh ya that's a classic for sure. This was my first taste test for the new batch I made. I like to go in blind lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just about died thinking my flair was gone
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry but I have to follow the flair
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not when he wants flair 😏

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🥺
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,She’s can’t be wrong all the time right? Right!?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,G hurt me in ways I don’t want to talk about - but I’ve been sitting on some cash specifically for space so idk how to convince myself otherwise.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shambles!!  
Edit: 🥺"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah - that means I’m the best
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m preserving myself so I never age. I’m really 79
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost. I’m coming for u/callsonalcoholism ‘s title
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll tell you like I told some retard in the pinned. 

What else are you gonna watch in space?

Or Cathie is just as dumb as us"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,JD... Her own 3D printing ETF... Cathie has lost the plot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep getting it back 🥺
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m a giver
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. Seriously dude I have feelings
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t even speak in gmt only est and mtn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same, I was doing it when I was going to work every day, I would just drink coffee all day and then eat at dinner time.  Lost a lot of weight.  I've gotten fat as fuck during covid."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, it could be changed to “dm me scat porn”"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know which mod gave you that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are savages. Also OIP is mean 😒 literally just says “what in the world” over possible feet pics and leaves. 1000% he’s single. Been foot insecure all day

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Very clunky. Even mod stuff like flairs is easy enough on mobile so I try not to use desktop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Samsies.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I tried Apollo and some others.  Couldn’t get into them.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"🤭 Thanks. I'm going to at least apply. It might be interesting. Plus I know a couple people in NYC so it'd be good to be near them too.

 As it stands right now, my current job is already making me work similar hours (not quite as bad) and isn't paying me anywhere near as much. Plus it'd definitely build character, whatever that means 🤡"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually tend to lose weight when I'm stressed. So I'd probably come out looking like an addict
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe I could teach the old suits a thing or two about buying 0dte FDs in my interview 🤡
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ayee here u are. I thing the saucemaster got in a  fraction earlier. Good try leggund!!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s worse than golf

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a gokart track record but no real car experience. I feel that 🥴
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet that I could attend and make it a week in his class by pretending to be a foreign exchange student if no one ratted me out. They’d have to play along. They agreed. Bets were stacked and I showed up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I rarely change flairs, and this was not one of the times I did"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit! That’s true - we just assumed it wasn’t when he said mod logs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the raisin bread and apple butter. And I get hash with cheese and jalapeños 😩😖😖 fuck it hits
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol exactly
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You do what must be done🥲

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your avatar says girl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You did mine and I never even sent any pics so I don't actually get it lol

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the latter explanation is more correct.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like a curse that doesn’t go away.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A born again virgin, huh?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s probably the cause of your virginity.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Then I just don’t open my DM’s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone tell me what scat porn is?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope lol I’d love to find out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I concur OIP is the biggest gay
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m going to change mine to ‘gild this guy’ and see how many I get
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m nervous af guys 🥲
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No bugs yet I guess?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Mf you even have “bull gang” in your profile...  I see through your lies.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo the first few times I did it, the only way I could get to it was google search > reddit thread > link

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Go buy some gaming shit please...  I’m still balls deep in CRSR sept 45c.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No harm in applying my man. If you do get a yes, awesome I say take it and make some 🅱️igly 🅱️ucks.

If not then it's a good time to reassess what more you want out of your current position/current company.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was not on the roster. It was hard, but I kept a straight fucking *face* and nodded every damn time he asked me a question. Friend chimed in and said “yeah she’s new” and he went with it and just bitched about them never updating shit. He really did rant and it was the funniest shit ever. He didn’t give me homework"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I’m just fuckin with you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfaoo I’m joking I’m giving him the benefit of the doubt
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hash browns are a close second. Depends on whether I feel like I need something dry to absorb all the grease or liquid to balance out the biscuit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You, know I never once in history asked for flair. I fucking waited 💅"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also you are close to booting Dan for 4th place. Close...do you like soda water?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There’s bitch but she’s half og

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You offered - I saw this one happen
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck. There’s no one left!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was able to run it with the other night...  took longer than usual tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There was a note?!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If we are taking bets I'm going with magic man, Mr Z."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t know but some mod changed someone’s flair to “trades feet pics for flair” a couple weeks ago
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also when was it if you know?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t read the second part it keeps cutting off

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They are! The fastest karts I’ve driven go 60!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I made it 4 weeks and I was also in AV. Suck it haters. So I’m sitting there is some class and a teacher got a call from Mr Garman that he needed a projector light so she insists **I take it to him** I couldn’t get out of it

Edit:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,u/dube123 is a gurl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As far as I know. Unless anyone new wants to disclose that info
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just cool too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I actually didn't send any pics I'm a fraud
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I said who do I gotta send titty pics too and he just set the flair at that 💀
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m pretty sure there was an offer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw it 😬
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He gave his PSH 2020 Annual Letter to shareholders and it had a section about it.. said it won’t be q1 and that he won’t comment on it until DA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[yes](https://reddit.com/r/PSTH/comments/mfqkyq/while_we_previously_believed_that_we_would_be/)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's okay I forgive you I'm dead inside already anyway 🙂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not what the flair says
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Flair disagrees 🤔

Must be *really* bad if you gotta lie about it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. I have to call the authorities on this one u/floppyfolds
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can’t imagine holding something that long. I’m so bored with KTOS right now it’s only been since January
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FML.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is within the realm of possibilities lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Early 2020 maybe February
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""downvote this person, they have shit opinions"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It says “downvote this person, they have shit opinions.”  

I’m gonna change cold’s back to what I set it as earlier now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I guess it’s too early yet. Puts on summer east coast bugs. Especially Delaware horseflies
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One where batteries suck but at least everything else doesn’t suck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Earths flat? I know a dinosaur who told me

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Unpinned go kart racing - that would be worth it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyway so I’m nervous and approach his class - I just decided to roll so I walk in right up to him, put the box in his hand and said “Mrs weaver said you need this” and winked and left. I figured I was fucked either way. But 2 classes go by and no principal. So I decide maybe it’s cool or maybe I’m going to be embarrassed in class but I came this far, so I went again. This time he just gives me homework. It was funny he didn’t tell. 

So I did fail 9th grade history. But I also got an B in 11th grade history that year. And that’s why im on this stupid sub"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Carrie keeps rubbing it in my face :'(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is close enough. It’s hard because I really like Kuwait Dan, but I’m going to make you my 4 seed mod. This is a hard bracket. 

zjz and OIP are my 16 seeds and fighting for the bottom spot. Whatevs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We lost tormentorosa to the unnamed with cracks me up because u/VacationLover1 didn’t know she was a girl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hate to see it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was absolutely an offer, I remember it. Impressive it never happened"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aw man I’m sorry ...i was worried about this, it may take longer but Spacman I’m sure will find something good! You can always take profits on some of those shares in the mean time? That’s what I did and I’m leaving the door open to going back in"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren’t we all 😞
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You sit on a throne of lies sir!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That would have been great
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been holding AAPL since $12 lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes he certainly is a mod which means he's capable of giving a flair
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"he would have claimed it by now, no way he lets that go unclaimed"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I found who did it in mod logs, it was not VL1"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,“Licks toes for tendies” lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I’m glad you got it I couldn’t see the whole thing and I have been trying to log on to the computer to see it

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,👏👏👏
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow what a rollercoaster of events. Dude sounds exactly like my junior year history teacher. We would literally just watch history movies about early 19-20th century us history.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"~~....you *wish* she was rubbing it in your face ;)~~

~~Okay I'm done now. I blame it on the alcohol!~~

Probably too far tbh."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,By GM3 how so?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would only send titty pics to /u/Fannypackphantom not any mods
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I even offered a change of flair and was declined.. if I remember correctly
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why lol I’m not the one talking bad about AOC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🧐🧐 my god Watson
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who was it 🤨
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was zjz. It’s got his magic man signature all over it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would see him years later with his boyfriend yelling at people for taking advantage of the under 10 aisle. Weirdest best guy I ever met. Literally had a penny barrel to collect pennies in his room over years just so they wouldn’t be in use
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😟
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GP already did that one, you can't hurt me more than he did"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,😂😂😂😂 maybe she’s an ass/hip person tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. You were extra nice and tired that week flairing the fuck out of everyone. I remember the offer she said she loved it. You offered me the same but like - way different scenarios
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I said I'm not creative idk what to make it myself 😭 you are supposed to be the funny one
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Replied to the wrong comment, oops"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of the mods
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was not zjz, VL1 or OIP"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good. I was going to stalk you if you told me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Naw lmao Georgia
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow he hates pennies so much he tried to make them extinct. I think only the US still has pennies now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I must have accidentally mixed up the unleaded drinks again.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You talking about the casino themed one?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"She would be 

#severely 

Disappointed.

Although I have tiny tits too though so if she's a boob girl she'd still be disappointed.  I just realized why I'm single."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was funny at first but it got old :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Big if true
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll cover my eyes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t like to be wrong 😡

I don’t know who has flair abilities...was it Bacon?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gonna go back up?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,didnt they try to short squeeze a coal miner too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What is moral hazard?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No one knows. Everyone is punting. Wear a Brioni suit and you are still just a punter.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and this time, it’s NOT ok. I’ll be looking forward to my delicious golden tendies served hot on a silver platter, soon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did they break? Why are they letting this air
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're gonna blame us. We have to keep doing positive things in the community, because we definitely are gonna get blamed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banks are in the business of hiding all the risk they can. They create this ridiculous positions to try to imprint an image of professionalism. When they go tits up, and they will, guess who bails them out? Your taxes. This will NEVER change unless we demand our governments to stop the bailouts. Let those fuckers crash and burn.

This is not just a saying, just go check the list of banks that were bailed out with your money.  I guarantee your bank is either in that list or will be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Difference is I’ll and most apes payed 1,50$ for a library card where you got free information or a boomer that payed 1,5 mill on an education that don’t give any advantage to a moron ape, I’m not educated I’m inspired, if I’ll was an educated man I’ll be a damn fool."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He mispronounced, ""this racket."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Voice does not match the face creeped me out lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it really gambling when you know you’re going to be bailed out if things get really bad?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop your crazy talk. Ape no like crazy talk. Now I go to therapy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,when wallstreet does it its being responsible
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever heard someone say “monkeys in suits”?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,More financially advise?  What the fuck does that mean?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a “financial professional” I have to disagree. 

In fact, many know what they’re talking about, but they end up losing their personal money anyway. It doesn’t matter if you’re a professional or retail trader, the house will eventually win the longer you are at the casino."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the sparkly crayons ✨
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, they're apes wearing monkey masks. Why didn't we think about that?..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cats don't call on congress to bail them out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you should invest in lean hogs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that shit is so fugging diverse man.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> There is no skill in banking. It's an ""industry"" full of prom kings.

what the hell am I reading right now. you seriously think bankers are the Chads? lol

there is knowledge and skill in finance. and there are plenty of resources to help the average investor"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. We need to rent some office space on Wall St and set up a brokerage house and all become ""Ape Advisors"" a couple of the smoothest brained apes will have to start off as banana pickers and then work their way up to ""Jr Ape Advisors"". We have to show that we have an internal training program so, we look legit and all, we can't have them thinking we're all crayon dust sniffing fiends. We'll specialize in Yolos (don't worry, we're professionals and know how to mitigate risk) and when we go tits up we'll get bailed out. I overheard a few monkies talking about such a scheme. I'm Ape and can't think crazy shit like that by myself. I call it collaboration because stealing idea like Mark Zuckerberg make Ape feel bad. Ape like to help other apes learn about collaboration."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. whoops.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No insult snek!  They useful, kill vermin!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would go lean hogs, fat chicks and anything in-between. I'm soo fucking hooked I would try to find a market for dead Russian hookers if it would keep me in the green."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. ""former GS traders are two a penny,"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guys working at Goldman are the chads for sure.

If you're in a Chase branch in Des Moines, you're a retail employee feeding chads. 

Prove me wrong.

Yeah you got me on the skill part. There's also skill in MLM and conning old ladies over the phone. But it's not ""work."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, banks are taking the losses.  Hrm."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If those HFs own a lot of Tesla, and sell all of their Tesla to cover loses, then Tesla price drops. 

Has nothing to do with the company itself, only matters how many shares are being sold vs how many are being bought. If supply outweighs demand, the price goes down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The senior guys - who know it's all BS and just punting - get off on making the wannabes do the reports. Nothing more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you watch the Foundry video on Vimeo the sales lead says that word about 10000x
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between being a 🌈🐻 and wanting the market to exist on actual money instead of leveraged funds that are backed by hopes and dreams.  The leverage gotta go, but the actual money can stay and stonks can still go up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All I’m seeing is a picture of a cat 🐱 me-fuckin-ow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Makes Bernie Madoff look like an amateur

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,.29 & .39 tacos
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this shows margin account increases, does it maybe reflect the increase in retail traders through apps and margin accts on robinhood and such?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So. Should we go cash gang?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the only known stock with a negative beta.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep cash on your account to scoop up deals once this market fucking craters.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone get Ja. Find Ja Rule!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He has been saying it for 12 months.... The market is highly overvalued and is setting itself up for a crash. Expectations >>> value/ fundamentals drives the hype
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,JPOW provided infinite liquidity
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,McDoubles have been $1 my entire life. Makes me think inflation isn't real.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've still got my hat in the ring and keeping some cash on the side.

I'd assume this is but one of many dominoes to fall yet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cash gang?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, already did that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao you want the guy who lost all of his 15B of personal wealth to go to jail for losing it? If losing money is now illegal many here are fucked.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s actually inversely related to the general market in some respects. When the market tanks, the big boys have to deleverage some of their holdings due to loss of capital in their long positions. This leads them to close some of their GME shorts, shooting GME upwards when SPY dumps"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Back in your day you could actually afford a house on a high school diploma job. These days you have an MD/PHD and pay rent to the wife's boyfriend cuz you can't get a loan. Damn your old 👍😂😜
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I understand it, he was hiding stock ownership and avoiding reporting limits by doing swaps where the counter party was holding title to the stock but he was at risk for the loss or profit from the gain. Not a lawyer,  but I think that's illegal.  And thank God stupid investments aren't illegal.  I would have done serious time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm on board with cardboard. They ain't taking my schtonka trucks tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt that be true for every other shorted stock too then?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Born in '72 here. I am in cold sweats thinking back to those phone calls ... thanks!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea but we got to see all the good bands.  We got to see them cheap too.  You'd be hard pressed to name a classic rock band we didn't see for less than $10.  Many of them on their very first tours.

70's = classic cars, classic rock, classic clothes, classic tv, even classic porn!  Back before porn was gay midget aliens with smooth brains....no wait."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless you're rentech that is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Shorts will be covered in a down turn however HFs may choose not to cover companies they think will be bankrupted in the next crash and cash out when the chart hits 0$.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a certain nostalgia for the 70s. At least people were real not just teenage trolls on the internet. I have a firm belief that music went to shit with the advancement of technology regarding availability of electronics to young people. The children of the world are just that, children and cannot therefore understand deeper meaning in music and lyrics. Metaphors are above their head and they just jump on a band wagon ( pun intended) pushing crap to the top of the charts. Just today I put on a YouTube playlist for new hip hop releases...... Every song sounded the same. No lyrical ingenuity, no metaphors and derivative as fuck.even the instrumentals and beats are basic af.  I was born too late i think."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't realize they generate enormous fees. I haven't seen them cause I am just a retail dude.

CFD's is what I heard as well. Sounded like goldman started working with hwang cause he was generating too much in fees."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it might have been CFD's? Jury seems out still (bloomberg)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The bus is pretty reliable.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh *67... I remember the first time someone called back. I was shook haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that's what I've read as well.  All very hinky."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As reliable as a volvo?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you watch the big short? If you have enough money you can ask for anything. 

""I have 12 billion dollars and i want to short the standard deviation of the spy500""  


Goldman rep- ""Yes sir, we will get back to you"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Big Short, Wolf of Wall Street, Boiler Room is one of my favorites, pre-fame Vin Diesel.  And Barbarians at the Gates is underrated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in for a few months and even got my dad to buy in. Genuinely believe they could compete with FUTU. If it got to those level $100-$200 I’d be so happy. Good DD OP!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t them buying puts just hedging like any market maker/HEDGE fund does?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so they bought puts before they did a massive dump of shares?  Hmnn nothing illegal about that?  Lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They really need to tack on a few zeros to the fines they give for this type of shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman Sachs is so scummy I'm not sure why anybody still does business with them. They consistently fuck their own clients in the ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so goldman was buying puts on their own stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You summarized everything completely in ONE sentence... good job.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop wrinkling my brain.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did do that didn't they?

Bought some GS calls today when SP was down... they certainly are a lot of things but ""bagholders""...  they aren't."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok.... lots of stupid wsb kids today... GS was holding the equity position because Archegos had swaps.  So you don’t even know wtf you’re talking about to start with.  Putting in a hedge is good for the bank risk management since again - they’re holding the equity and sold archegos the swap.  You do know what a swap is right?  Is today your first day?  Are you new here?  Why are half of you here?  You’re mostly incompetent af.  Go home.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not at all what insider trading is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I respect and admire that goddamn company. That company has a special place in my heart like that fucking stripper loving executive at Enron who got a court order, through divorce, to sell his Enron holdings before shit hit the fan. No jail time resulted and he got top price.

God bless you pieces of shit. 💕"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They already dumped. That's why they booked the losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While true, timing of such trades could definitely suggest insider trading. Their massive dump last week may have been intended to hide exactly that sort of fuckery. That said, SEC doesn't do shit to GS anyway. So, all of this conjecture is pretty irrelevant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes Goldman is holding the assets in the TRS but they no doubt increased their hedge just before they liquidated Hwang. Because why wouldn’t they. 

Thanks mate try again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s funny seeing the apes here railing against the hedge funds while it was investment bankers who always called the shots
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know enough about how these sort of operations work, like the true dynamics of the relationship between a prime broker and a fund like the one that blew up in this situation. So I'm going guessing that this was part of the normal risk management procedures. Now the front running after all agreeing to an orderly sell off, that's the Ruthless GS I know and love."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one is ""railing against hedge funds"".

It's against very specific hedge funds that engage in wide spread criminal activity like Melvin, wolverine, citadel, point72, Maplelane.


Find someone pissing on Bridgewater or renaissance. Go on, show me posts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s called hedging
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Impossible to be smarter”

I’d phrase it differently. It’s impossible to more correctly incorporate past information to generate a range of expected future results. 

AI can’t predict the future, and if there are new fact patterns that it hasn’t seen before then it’s predictions can still be wildly wrong.  It is still possible to be smarter."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why learn advanced maths when the computers can do it better and faster?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo Ray Dalio is the GOAT. Too bad their interview process is weird as fuck so I didn't get to work there lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My impression is that most of his leverage was in contracts for difference, not holding shares.  The shares he did hold were posted as collateral for margin."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s not insider trading retard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, wait, the AI that predicted Muskrat de Methe ice cream might not have been right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who programmes those computers with what?

Computers a good at computing like the name suggests. They are not good at the math underpinning the calculations, I. e. Knowing why they are doing what and what to do next to get which result why."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think that would count to the 5% rule he was trying to hid and did hide  from the SEC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would AI development allow computers to do everything themselves? I.E. the computers can think for themselves and trade independently from human input. That would be amazing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not being a previously-convicted hedge fund manager, I'm not sure how these things work."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,By your next update I need you to do some illegal shit and be able to provide updates.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"West coast guy, they've decided to legalize my crimes 🤨"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♂️
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MT guy, fuckwad governor is trying to fuck these crimes up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Naw guy I was hoping to retire near Missoula don't do me like that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Planning on removing the grow your own. Also setting it up so his buddies get all the permits. I can't imagine the low quality shit that will be produced.  Missoula is a fantastic area, getting pricey but compared to some West Coast locations you probably wont notice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oddly WA doesn't allow for homegrown, there should be a model law and regulation that every state follows.

I'm in south Seattle so I should have sufficient equity to do it.  We'll see, real estate around Big Sky (my original plan) is effed up, Jackson Hole and WYO too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Missoula is pretty bad now. Most homes going for 50-80K above asking price. Median is up to 470ish K. 
If you got a million to drop on a place you can get some amazing places.
I need to find my groove on the market to get to early retirement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about a bit outside of town?  The beauty of being a former glacier stomping ground, the valley is wide and looooong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how far you want to go outside of town. Its pricey all the way to Hamilton in the south, Ronan to the north and Superior the West and only getting worse.
How soon do you plan on exiting? Also political leaning can affect how you feel about some of these areas. Missoula very liberal in a sea of militia red Q-believers"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lived in Spokane during Ruby Ridge, I'm familiar with the political dynamic.

I may have gotten priced out, maybe I'll just get a trailer in the desert.  We'll see how my meme stocks play out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you luck out and don't mind a condo, you might be able to get a 2br/1/5 ba for about 225K. If you are good with reparis its possible to find a fixer upper for less 300K"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fixer upper it is, hold the shiplap."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Strange how the dates are. I tend to try and stay away from everything on 4/1 but this year....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah don’t buy calls this week theta will fuck you to climax faster this time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Absurd
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,More like bad Friday am I right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll probably beat off and check stocks regardless
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well we can't fuckin eat Chicken Tendies, 'cause it's a Lenten Friday.

All that leaves is work and masturbation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,hahah I can relate to this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lent is bullshit. Gimme tendies.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Has he tried being buried in the cave for three days straight?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts on viac?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Call the manager and ask
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bounce back not happening till liquidation over lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If that’s your Thursday what’s your Saturday?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So how much longer do we think the liquidation will continue for? I’m seeing it increase today - short interest per Bloomberg is still 18.64%...

If you are long VIAC you think it’s worth buying at any price less <$50 a share?  Just curious others thoughts on it

I’m thinking long term it might get acquired by another media firm"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wouldn't you like to find out ;)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems hard to beat 50% from peak. I bought in this morning
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have got DISCB instead... damn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember Thor in end game? Pretty similar to that with less clothes and more Colfax hookers.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha Looks like it! I should have bought some of both..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV now has a contender for godship in WSB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,where were you able to see that RLX was part of the Archegos bets?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,15 billion would land you right at the middle of Forbes 100 top billionaires list; that’s hardcore lose porn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hwang out with your wang out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,From 3 commas to 0.0 😂
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Biggest lost porn so far
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy is actually my college roommates Uncle. I never understood how he could spend so freely. Was a good friend tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So... how does his loss porn rate?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he’ll be ok he can take 3k in losses per year off his taxes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are telling me its a good Idea to buy the BIDU dip ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good fucking lord, Chinese markets are like open PVP area. Shit just goes down there immediately, anyone old enough to remember $LK?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because with small dick energy like that he wouldn’t have gotten to a billion in the first place.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin call the movie lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's funny because 'Son' can mean 'loss' in Japanese: 損
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They took him off the site now lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Average up or bust. This is WSB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty sure he rolled up and out instead 

max yolo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The good news is that there's only 3 ways SPY can go.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So punny 🤣
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what. When did this sub turned into that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit balls. ME TOO. Second generation gay here, and those FotF bastards basically indoctrinated a whole branch of my family. Turned them into weapons of hate telling me my respective family was gonna burn in the fires of hell for all eternity. For the last 30 years. Why am I not surprised their money management guru was an admitted, convicted criminal."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Because WSB martinis taste like pee
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"didn't the internal do almost 100% ? 

I don't think it is a ponzi the two funds are just entirely different. The one that is down is just a boomer equity holding fund. 

Simmon's cash cow fund uses all the quantitative shit and manages a much smaller amount of money allowing it to exploit things all across the markets (bonds, fx, small cap, etc. ) without being as limited by position sizing. The position sizing thing is why he bought out all of the earlier investors. 

Not much point in ponziing your own money"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Medallion is small I think they cap at $10B? They found if they got too big they couldn't execute and it exposed them to risks

Good lesson to learn from LTCM"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yea, for sure some jew trillionaires like rothschild money then you have that trilly saudi money"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. The bald goblin finally realized it's more fun to pull the strings behind the scenes without having the accountability as CEO. Let someone else be the fall guy  whenever the woke mob finds something new to throw a tantum about. He needs to focus on finding a new ex-wife, anyway."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t bleed a turnip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when you owe the bank $20 billion

If you did not sell in mid 2007, you were an idiot who got BTFO. Since then it was a long march downward until late 2008.

Late 2008 was the bottom, and ANYONE who bought into the market at the bottom is now a very rich man.

You NEVER sell at the bottom, you buy into it. If you didn't heed the warnings in 2007, you had to buy in during 2008 to lower your average cost while eating humble pie about how the ""bears were wrong""."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"1. When a bank auctions large blocks of shares off, it is usually due to a margin call. 

2. There were several articles over the past 2 weeks warning of margin calls starting to hit, particularly for Chinese stocks. A 3 min google search found the following:

https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wealthy-facing-margin-calls-show-pitfalls-of-pledged-shares/articleshow/74732173.cms

There were lots of other articles leading up to Friday. And on Friday AM pre-market, I believe an article on SA mentioned the share auction by GS. 

3. Baidu was down 40% MoM. Any leveraged positions in a China-concentrated portfolio would be at risk for margin call given the recent market performance.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Allow me to explain further. 

They cannot ‘immediately’ execute stock sales of this magnitude. It’s not a ‘snap your fingers’ and all your stock is sold sort of process, they need to find enough buyers. When blocks of this size hit the market, they always lose a ton in the process of dumping shares. The loss during the sale is amplified by the number of shares. The more shares you have to move, the more selling pressure it creates, and the stock usually craters in the process. 

For instance on this particular margin call, Credit Suisse (and other creditors) dumped an absolute shit ton of ViacomCBS, which is now down by about 50% in the past 4 trading days. They were losing money all the way down, as they continued to sell at lower and lower prices."

One could trade this with confidence. The other couldn't.

I wanted to buy bidu but had no way of knowing whether there is some scandal about to blow, or if it was gonna get delisted as some bazinga or motley fool articles were saying. If I knew it's dropping cause a fund was getting liquidated I'd go all in and make a killing. 

It's not about ER numbers and market reaction. It's about real time immediate knowledge of whether something is a crisis or a blip. 

It's the context that made the difference. 

Anyways that's all from me."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been trying to do as much research on options as possible, but applying this knowledge I've received from videos/reading isn't translating over to when I'm actually buying these options on my app. It sounds so easy then I see the options chain and start wondering why wouldn't I just pick the longest expiration date (is it just the increase in premium?) and in that case can I exercise at any time before expiration? What if I can't afford the exercise? How do I just sell the option? So many questions and I'm tempted to just buy an AMC call at $10 to expire next month or something to test it all out, but then, if it's currently trading at $10, what's stopping me from buying an option with a strike of $8 and exercising immediately? I feel dumber for having asked that question but seriously, the best way for me to learn is by trial and error, this is just too risky to do that with though, and simulators just don't do it for me."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Answered in other comments friend. The shareholder lawsuits are worthless IMO, and the Lavvan lawsuit is a risk but I think it's likely to get settled out of court for a fraction of the headline number. It also only relates to cannabis which is not a significant part of AMRS's business yet - so a bit of a stretch for Lavvan to claim huge damages when their isn't much evidence to support that AMRS got much benefit from their partnership at all

On dilution - the strategic transactions mentioned in the DD are a validation of the company's business model - they generate a significant amount of up front cash as well as recurring revenues over a multi-year period. This is huge as it allows the company to raise cash from operations instead of diluting existing investors by raising new money. Prior to these deals, AMRS didn't have a sustainable business model to go along with with its incredible technology. The strategic transactions will provide proof that they can monetize their tech and end the years of significant dilution"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Notice the disclosure at the bottom of the piece?

""Disclosure: I am/we are short AMRS.""

As pointed out in the DD, this is a turnaround story that really began in November 2020. That is a big part of why the opportunity exists. You just have to decide if you believe it or not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the response given in the stocktwits board this morning. It went something like this:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thank you for sending these. If you look at the company's history, they struggled for a long time with the more complex stuff (biofuels, etc) before focusing on the more simple niches. I particularly love that they are have leaned into the high-margin consumer channels - what they've done with Biossance is particularly inspiring. PureCane has huge potential (think it needs some branding work) and Pipette just needs to gain a wider audience. The others in the pipeline are also fantastic. 

The retail channels make them less dependent on monetizing molecules with industrial counterparties as their consumer brands continue to gain scale, they will inevitably lead to significant cash flow generation. The balance sheet continues to improve as the overhang from equity dilution continues to be cleaned up while the top-line on the income statement will continue to gain steam. Any leftover excess capital will be reinvested in the business and the technology, allowing them to circle back to the more complex and world-changing applications you alluded to. All in all, what an exciting time"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"good luck retard, I´m in with the same (10 25$)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem sir. Love this company and happy to try to help. It's a complicated story with lots happening, enjoy the ride!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think its fair to think they're partially priced in but the market also discounts stocks that have failed to deliver in the past. So if they don't deliver i think they tank. If they do deliver than I think it's fair to say that the stock price will react positively to the delivered expectations. That's why this is inherently riskier play than other already risky options. They have shown in the past that they can't be relied on to act in the stock owners best interest. However, the DD is trying to say that ***THIS*** time they will actually deliver and there will be tendies for everyone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. Not all of these are necessarily applicable to AMRS, but I generally use a handful of tools for investment research. The most valuable to me by far is BamSEC. There is no better way to track, analyze, and read up on public companies in my opinion. Another one I use a bunch is Koyfin, which is free (crazy - it's insanely useful). I can't recommend it enough. I also read a significant amount of equity research both from professionals (get BofA for free through my Merrill Edge accounts, Morningstar, ValueLine, etc) and also amateurs on forums like Seeking Alpha or online communities like StockTwits (awesome AMRS community) + a few others

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am pretty new to things myself. I found that looking at income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements was very helpful. Lots of data to sort through when first starting out, but looking up definitions and figuing out how the number affect one another is essential to getting a deeper understanding of what to look for. You can get a good feel of how things look for companies in different sectors and start to see similarities and differences between them. You’ll probably find some oddities faster than you would expect and can look in the news or 10-k for explanations."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, but it looks like she was a CEO? Different than being a stock picker isn't it?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Timelines tend to get moved when you can cut the biggest line item in the budget by a factor of three or four. Starship will be that much cheaper.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> We have no idea if there's a real market for Starship.  

Starship will probably be cheaper than Falcon 9 both in terms of cost per kg \*and\* in absolute terms. There's a huge market even if that isn't the case, as long as they can get Starship below $100m per launch. Even if launch demand doesn't pick up, at $100m per launch they can merge missions that would normally go on multiple Falcon 9 flights, or bundle them with Starlink missions and have much higher margins on their launches. They can't do that now with Falcon Heavy due to the fairing size. Why do you think they aren't launching Starlink on Falcon Heavy even though it's cheaper on a cost per kg basis?

Starship is going to consume the entire commercial launch market when it's up and running, and eventually most government contracts as well. I have no doubts about this. The question for Rocket Lab is, what do they provide that makes it worth paying three or four times as much for a launch?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"She's a long term investor, this is the market, it's not that hard to see she does her homework and holds for YEARS ok, the price is highly reflective of that.

Do you understand."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have made a huge mistake.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure where the floor is on this, but listening to that call gave me zero short term confidence (and I really love their designs). Long term I can understand their thinking, but there are some huge questions. Who will be their manufacturing partner and what will that deal look like? Since they now want to handle manufacturing themselves long term, how much is it going to cost to build a factory and how long will that take? If they don’t already have a manufacturing partner, are they going to be able to stay on track for delivering vehicles in 2022? They didn’t even get into how the chip shortage is currently affecting them, so how likely are delays in the production schedule? Yes, they have a decent amount of cash on hand, but if they’re going to eventually take on manufacturing themselves won’t they need to raise more capital? Since they got rid of their engineering services, when will they be taking in revenue? Talking about strong demand for the MPDV in Europe made me nervous. That’s a 2023 vehicle, and without knowing what their manufacturing deal is, it’s fair to ask if they can build and deliver vehicles to Europe at scale to meet demand. They talked about interest from TNCs, but the statements were extremely vague, and it’s hard to imagine the interest was that strong when they can’t meaningfully say when they can start production. My feeling was Tony’s focus was more on the pickup and the MPDV. The lifestyle vehicle is supposed to be their first release. That makes me feel like there isn’t much demand for it at this point in time (the website primarily highlights the truck and MPDV as well). 

The executive turn over and lack of communication to investors are also huge red flags. My take away from investor relations not communicating is they don’t fucking know what to say because there isn’t a concrete plan in place. It could also be why Tony was telling investors to call him directly. It’s easier for Tony to spin things if he’s the one handling the communication. 

Until their manufacturing partnership is announced this is fucked. Without that information there’s no reason to believe they’ll be able to produce and deliver vehicles within the next two years. 

Only thing I can do is pray they announce something big before April 16th. Fuck"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Proper fucked
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I think he did the right thing for the company. Investors paid 200million for intellectual property that was being sold for pennies to a competitor... They literally just charged for the engineers time...  what people are paying for now is the inexperience of the previous management, toby wouldn't have walked away from the Hyundai deal if it was good

Additionally everyone that was replaced in upper management was replaced with people with more experience... This is bullish and a sign that those people are willing to place their careers in a startup.


Tony took the harder road on Earnings and for longs that will pay 100x.  Literally everything he said was legit... And I think Institutions will I best especially if he announces manufacturing partner... That might be hurried up now to prevent the floor from completely falling out... 


This started out as a short Squeeze bear hunt for me but I ended up falling in love... I should have sold at 16 and bought warrants today...

Today effectively cleaned out most of my account I'll post loss porn later perhaps."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing about that call inspired confidence. I imagine you can diamond hand any near expiry calls, but otherwise I'd cut losses here"

.. you can read the part in the Earnings transcript where tony says the deal was priced at the engineers hours not at the value of the IP.. I wanted something greater from hyundai but I am extremely bullish about Tony's ability to bring this home... I think the hard changes he's made show institutional investors that they can trust him..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like you got in a day early
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This will hurt bad. What a complete shit show that CC was.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure how to respond at open. Were full on drill team 6 right now. I liked the company and the vehicles/tech but this is hard to watch after that call.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, just when my calls are set to expire! 

The real play on this now are shares/warrants if you believe in Tony’s ability to create a successful long term strategy. There are still positives here (lots of cash on hand, thoughtfully designed product, cost efficient design). But until there’s more concrete information there’s still a lot of risk."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There seems to be a lot of similarities in both Arrival and Canoo, their business model and manufacturing process now seems identical, even their websites are basically the same... I can see them combining to be honest, GOEV on the consumer/light enterprise and Arrival on the heavy commercial side, match made in heaven?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I just ended up buying more GOEV stock yesterday and then it tanked, feels bad! So right now I have a decent long position and if I sold right now, I would take 35% hit.

But with there new strategy, revenue generation happens at a later date because they would not be counting on engineering consulting and only on selling EVs, heck even subscription model is out, don't you think? 

I am thinking about getting May $10 calls, why are you buying warrants?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m still pretty bullish sitting on a average of $13, manufacturing partnership, ev demand from Europe & undisclosed ev car design. I see potential upside"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what's with the slaughter during premarket now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens in April? Are they planning to announce something?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why? Did you read the part where Hyundai bwas just paying for the engineers time vs for the intellectual property?  Straight up walking away from that was the right thing to do
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok that makes sense. I am debating whether to get $10 calls for May or August, at least profit from some upside movement, if any. 

I am long in GOEV with 251 shares and so far they have been disappointing. There vehicles look cool, but since they don't have there own production they do not control there destiny."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what ? 
There is another common things 

The only 2 EV , Hyundai invested"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would buy warrants if I had any money lol because they are essentially like long term options..  the subscription model is just being moved to the bracket of ""it won't make us the most money we need to figure out b2b fleet stuff first and then crack that egg"" 

The only way that the engineering thing made sense was if it produced them royalties which it doesn't seem like it did.. there's literally no way Hyundai bent that far over for Canoo..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's huge... And again I credit tony for violently unfucking the previous managements lack of business acumen so we can move on... He does now need to save the stock price as it will be very pivitoal to the eventual direct offering needed to pay for the Factory...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I should have split them before earnings and bought puts to benifit either way. but no Im out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"🍑
💦💦💦💦"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, me too I still have 17 days for my calls to mean something...  Well see"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s because of the change in leadership and direction. Seems to be a good move for the company but not what hyped it and so is concerning for investors.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That I do agree with. But 

The problems as I see it, and these are short term:
- CEO not present
- Total pivot
- EV is in the shit for now in general, sentiment around SPAC also.

I cant really see any positivity that this will result in. Maybe my 40Cs are fine for august but my April calls are gone. 30k away. bye bye.

I want this stock to rocket, but I cant really see it right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this makes it sound that they are quite a ways before they can deliver vehicles. Did Tony say in call yesterday that they are still on track to deliver vehicles in 2022?

Good point about warrants! Do you know when GOEV warrants will expire or would have to be exercised?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where have I heard that before?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, honestly I think I institutions looked at the long term approach of Tony and saw that it was different.. Tony basically said the previous management didn't know what they were doing, the IP of the company is great, and oh here's my team of solid rock stars to turn this into a great performing company. Institutions would 100 percent rather you delay a manufacturing announcement than get the shitshow deal that Fisker got...  I honestly think if I 17 mil short at 16 I would be fucking nervous right now... 

I do wish I had may calls to be honest"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a /u/planereflection question about warrants...

Yes they are on time  because contract manufacturing will be the bridge to ramp..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would love if institutions went it. Hope you're right, we'll see. 

I mean this stock have gone down 27-30% the last 2 weeks. I wonder where the bottom is."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/pchampn - Warrants expire in 2025. They can call earlier if GOEV trades over $18 for 20 of 30 trading days. At that point, the warrants will be over twice what they are today (around $7)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you visited papa Manpreet on Twitter?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could they use warrants to pay for factory?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!  /u/planereflection and  /u/BrotherLuminous 

Several of you are referring to April 16 or generally April. Are you expecting some news from Canoo next month?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you mind elaborating more on this? Thank you sir.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have not, good?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t believe the warrants can. They can have an offering to raise additional capital. However, seeing they have $700m+ in cash, there’s no need for an offering at this time. To put in perspective, $RIDE bought their factory for $20m."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Warrants are like LEAPs. They allow you to buy one share for $11.50, until 2025. If GOEV is say $20, warrants would have an intrinsic value of $8.50 ($20 - $11.50 = $8.50) + time value. Compare this to calls, a November $12.50 call is currently $1.65. It has a higher strike, shorter expiry, and not much less (currently $2.75 per warrant).

Having covered GOEV since August, calls have been incredibly difficult to time. Warrants on the other hand, have been much more stable and don’t have the risk of expiring worthless (soon, anyways). 

Key difference between warrants and calls is that warrants ultimately dilute the commons, whereas calls don’t. You can’t write options on warrants. You also can’t purchase them on Robinhood or WeBull. Warrants can be called earlier by the company, but at that point, you would’ve atleast doubled your money (from here), so you can’t really complain."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, where do you get the $11.50 from?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too much into TA, but yeah if he's right then Im all for it and a super happy person. :>"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $11.50 was from the SEC filings. As a word of caution, other SPACs gives the right for a fraction of a share, whereas $GOEVW allows 1 share for 1 warrant. The only way to know is to dig into the SEC filings. I really like warrants because they allow similar leverage like calls (especially once GOEV > $18) without the terrible theta burn. For example, when GOEV is $30 (323%), GOEVW would be $18.50 (642%)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My question is, what's to stop Trulieve, Curaleaf, etc. who already have a lot of locations in major markets from just opening their stores to selling other products?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing at all. That's the point though. 

Let's say they have to give up 40% of shelf space to other brands. First, that's 40% across all 70+ stores. That's going to add up quickly, and they are going to have an excess of product to move. 

As long as they are both heavily retail and heavily wholesale, I doubt many other retail stores are going to be eager to carry Trulieve products. Why would you? Why carry a brand tied to a competitor's retail store over another brand that has no retail and is wholesale only. Especially if you're located near a Trulieve location. That wholesaler is on your side. They want customers in YOUR door, where their products are. See what I'm getting at? 


So selling 1,000,000sqft of grow space is easy when you monopolize the stores **and** the products in those stores. It isn't easy when you lose your monopoly on both. They are far too over built for a competitive state level legal market, and they will be a USA version of an LP by being over built for their current day market, while praying for the future market (US national market) to open up and save their asses. 

At least LPs have a global market like the EU (expected to have **more** long term potential than the US, per Curaleaf) and Mexico (coming soon) to tackle while everyone waits on US politicians to get the job done."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude what's to stop Trulieve from selling different brands at their stores once it's totally legal? They have the locations, people are used to going there, they'd be happy to see other brands available at their local dispensary."

I am a fucking 15 years old kid  
When my reddit account was created i bet my life savings to GME, it was only 2k, i ask my mom if i can do stocks, she just give me a yes, she doesnt know what a stock is, or if the thing she sign was a contract with a broker or a marriage document.  
At that day i bought 7 shares of gme around the 260 a share, next day i wake up and see that gme was going to the fucking moon, i dont remember how much a share was at that point, i just remember how 5 minutes later GME was going to THE FUCKING FLOOR, so as a noob trader with gme being my first stock i sold my 7 shares and lose 1k, at that point i reconsider and decided to buy again, at that point i just can buy 4 shares, so i did, i didnt have more cash so i started saving money again and 3 or 4 days ago when gme went to 120 a share i down my position and buy another 3 shares again to have my fucking 7 shares.  
Now i am just waiting to watch each share at 200k and buy a girlfriend or something.  
Wish me luck

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow the unions really got their PR game up huh. People actually believe that this is a thing?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My brother in law works there, it is very much a thing. Lady pissed herself at his factory because the bathrooms are so far away, they purposely keep themselves dehydrated during their shifts so that they don’t have to go. Idk why they don’t provide like a bathroom golf cart or some shit they could ride on since it’s so far away"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nonsense. You have no idea what you're talking about. Don't believe everything you read.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How did it go down? Did she stand up and announce she was pissing herself because the bathrooms are so far away? 

Look, idk what's the story, and I'm not sure your brother in law does. Needless to say, no place is perfect and in such a big company it's inevitable that there'll be some horrible managers, too. 

But some people prefer to hold in any complaints they have until they implode. Amazon is really not a good place for office drones; it has a DIY vibe and tends to reward folks with backbone who work hard to fix broken shit. That's true for Corporate as well as FC. 

FCs are run by folks a few years out of MBA, mostly great people but lack the experience. Which makes it all the more crucial that employees engage with their managers and work together to address issues rather than expect Bezos to come over and change their diaper, or the union fairy to get them free unicorns.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The big day is here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings changed to tomorrow after close and it went down 7% so far today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure! I'm still pretty new to this as my post suggests (only started back in late November), so some of this advice might be incomplete, but I'll do my best.

1. Always, ALWAYS save money for dips. If you think that it won't drop lower and wanna go all in, definitely don't. Think of how many times a stock ""dips."" So many times. The chance that you actually hit the lowest point, esp. when the stock market has been trading sideways these past two months, is very little. Stocks don't just go up. They will pullback at some point for you to buy the dip again.
2. If a stock ran up already, NEVER FOMO. There will always be more plays. And if you like a stock that has had a bull run and want to hold it for long, wait for the pullback. It will happen at some point, and the longer the bull run, generally the greater chance it will have a pullback soon. Even if you miss the boat, again, it will dip back at some point, and there are other plays to get in on as well.
3. Do NOT buy off of margin when the market is trading sideways or in deep shit. (Some would even say to minimize your margin as much as possible or never buy off margin. It's helpful though if you feel really confident about a play and are still waiting on some cash.) I would've lost only like...20% if I had not used the margin I was using at the start of February. It's just too risky. You can use margin if you're confident that the market is bullish, but it's still risky. Be aware of when the risks outweight the potential rewards.
4. Valuations are actually very important. Pls, for the love of God, DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CONSIDER HOW MUCH A STOCK HAS GONE UP ALREADY as well as how the current price compares to revenue, company forecasts, other things. Oh yeah, and take price/revenue estimates with a MASSIVE grain of salt. Do they seem realistic given the current state of the company and its future plans?
5. HOLD if you like the stock for good reason. Do not be afraid to hold. If the stock seems overvalued and is no longer a valuable investment, then you should sell. But if a stock plummets off of little news or only something relatively minor, and if that doesn't change how you feel about the investment in the long run, then just hold. I've sold things countless times for a loss or for only small gains, only to see it  run up afterwards. And this has probably happened more often than I've sold and avoided a loss. 
6. Be wary of survivorship bias and response bias. These are very common here on Reddit and throughout investing circles. Stocks don't always go up (even if the US market as a whole generally does), and many have killed themselves over bad trades. There is a lot to learn from the winners as well as the losers. 
7. Take what ANYBODY says with a grain - no, a pile of salt. Do your own research and trust that first, because who knows what kinda motivations are behind what somebody says, or how much they may or may not know. Follow up on certain claims ppl make. Don't just listen to empty words and sentiment, and this goes for both bullish and bearish sentiments. 

I also have a lot of advice regarding specific types of stocks. Feel free to PM me if you're interested!"

DFV's Potential profits from his 16th Apr $12 Calls. I know Warden was saying he's only holding for a statement to keep retail motivated, but this is only partially true in my opinion. (RISK/REWARD) Implied volatility turbo charges the theta on these options. With current Implied volatility he'll still profit $14M if it only goes to $320 per share by 4/16 expiration. If something crazy happens and it goes to $780, he'll make approximately $37M plus."
