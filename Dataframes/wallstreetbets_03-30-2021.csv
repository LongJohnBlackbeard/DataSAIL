03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I live in Irvine, CA close to Spectrum mall where there is huge Blackberry building and the lights are always on. So I‚Äôll say BB is still in business. # ApeLogic"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My cat‚Äôs name is Vincent. That‚Äôs about all the valuable discourse I can add here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Possibly but in the meantime just HODL and buy the dip at $6 cause frankly why the fuck not at this point. Yeah it will take 2-3yrs for those earnings to spike up to the old days but damn it will be worth it if you buy in at 6 and sell for $100. Might take my EEENF earnings and average way the fuck down from $17...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ABSOLUTELY, THEY ARE PIONEERS. BUT THEY HAVE TO STEP IT UP IF THEY WANT TO SEE IT RISE AGAIN....."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe the way up is through WSB again!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only think promising is a potential buyout.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not to mention that you can get a small container of blackberries at the grocery store for $2.99 that has to count for something in the moral department
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My cat's name is Vince too. He's a maine coon. He is also the shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#I am gonna be buying the dip until 2069ü§£
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess below $7 is lucrative again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man already - %9.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"John Chen just signed a contract to be on till 2023, so I don‚Äôt think a potential buy out is on the table anytime soon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends where you are, honestly.  BBs go way above $2.99 in this part of the country."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You ain't wrong
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean sometimes you just gotta wait
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How shitty will that be when a tiny container of blackberries will be worth more than a share of BB. Maybe we need to just start a WSB blackberry farm that we all invest in instead.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,May you steer this ship into Ever Greener waters.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IMAGINE THAT??.... WHOLE GAME CHANGER!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lube with talc and clotrimazole
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's a sexy dip
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rkt only dips
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was lower 5 days ago
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did the same
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it again tomorrow on the next dip?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For anyone who does not already know, institutions and insiders own MORE THAN 100% OF THE FLOAT and there is a Billion $$$ buy back in progress. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

104 million share float

112 million shares owned by institutions

5.8 million shrs owned by insiders"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why RKT when you can GME?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This RKT crashes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Trash
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn strait it is!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought what I could then as well. Just not enough tendies
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If there‚Äôs one tomorrow, then hell yes. I‚Äôm just a smooth brained ape here"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why buy GME when you can buy RKT?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Show us your put positions then
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only trash I see here is you ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,laughs in Brazilian
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because I‚Äôve made thousands of dollars from GME and nothing from RKT. 45 @ $80
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course I don‚Äôt have any RkT stock, it‚Äôs shit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Waxes in Brazilian
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fair enough. I‚Äôm playing the long game with RKT so I don‚Äôt care too much what happens in the next couple of months. Long term RKT is a good play. Tendies are tendies my fellow ape.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt disagree with that!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yahoo finance, ok, proof or ban"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how they still label it a gain. 

Congratulations! You just made a gain of -$60,000!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Son: Daddy, what is a bag holder?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If someone want to check.

This look THE SAME drop after the GME earning report right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#better setup a dip-buying plan.  Gonna be a while ü§£
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as YOU believe in BB, it‚Äôs the only thing that matters"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure why people thought bb was a good play. It reminds me of pltr and uwmc plays. Lots o loss porn

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as he doesn't care about money one way or the other, thats what matters?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im so deep into uwmc :( good thing it has a dividend
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad user
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sigh üòî they always end up learning the hard way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He only loses if he sells lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We all learn and start somewhere unfortunately.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ER was fine in my view.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont understand this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit at this rate I'm gonna have to hold till I have grandkids.  My oldest is 7.  üò≠
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB will be launched üöÄüöÄüöÄ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My puts won‚Äôt break even until this POS hits 8.05

Finally on the winning side of a BB catalyst"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So if i like the stonk and want to make money from said stonk should i buy puts?? seems like my decision making goes the opposite way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The squiggly lines didn't stop the stock from going down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you say that? I‚Äôm also a BB holder
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He lost 17.5k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The number 515 is a mixture of energies and vibrations of the numbers 5 and 1. The number 5 appears twice in this number and that intensifies its influence in the overall symbolism of the number 515.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The design wins in EV were good. Selling the patent portfolio is good. There was nothing about this quarter that made it a particularly critical one as long as they keep pushing forward on all fronts which they are.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For a company that's focusing on restructuring their business I didn't expect much this quarter. Revenues were down partially due to an ongoing patent sale and chip shortage. Patent sales are mobile/messenger related. This shows they're serious about change, going to reinvest majority of this capital into their newer product offerings. Ivy expected to roll out early 2022. Good news for longs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck?  Lost me at numbers
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right when I sell, but I'm stubborn so everyone will have to wait."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You monster
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. This is why I never sell out of any of my positions anymore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Will this save my gush positions... probably not. Sigh.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does it feel like a coordinated post?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still good to get in at opening bell. Price still down from earlier dips.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MRO is a slept on money printer past few months
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre gonna release more shares to reduce that debt
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at $3 last march. Sold for $11ü§òüöÄ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/wasupg; i made, then lost, over a million in the last market bubble. 2008 i think it was. and i learned, then, that  YOLO is a big lie. You don't Only Live Once. We have many lives in a single lifetime. And I'd be embarrassed to tell you how much I have lost in my lifetimes.. for all the gains i have right now. We reinvent ourselves constantly. And we balance our losses with our gains.  I was told by one of many Gurus:  ""When something bad happens, ask yourself, ""What is the lesson in this?. Then it will be a gift.""  My lesson in losing so... much... money trading in the market in 2008  was the knowledge and skill sets to earn it all back. On stocks I could afford. Limiting myself to accumulating and holding long. (I was way too addicted to trading. Everyone said go OXY, however, i prefer this price point.  And this particular company. Less than 12 bucks a share?  I think i got that much in my pocket right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL. GUSH I got rid of it last week. I bought it and XLE, but only kept XLE. GUSH started to hurt."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take out the S
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"because i, me, a person,  am your basic human being: currently in my home; on the sofa: in a pandemic; so i hit the ""cross post"" button to share it with my friends on other stock boards here on reddit. i enjoy when other people share an uptick in the wind with me. thought id do the same. you may notice the posts do come from me. i don't have anyone to coordinate with. except two dogs. and they're into cookies. not stocks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/Macool-The-Ape.  What you said. FWIW, getting in at opening bells never used to work for me UNTIL I started investing in MRO.  i got compulsive and wanted feed my share addiction from the .03's- 11.90 while MRO was flying under the radar.  Then I bought in at every single uptick. Damn. I didn't go  out to lunch today and I have enough money for a share of this stock. Under 12.00 a share for a oil company in Texas? A company in biz since the 1800's?  MRO seems such a no brainer to me. Of course i could spend nearly two hundred dollars for a share stock of GME now.... yet whether i go to the moon or the debt collector; the stress ain't worth that price. no way.  I find zero stress holding this stock long. I am not a player. I am an investor."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My 1800 at 18 are with you on this adventure.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$14 bag holder checking in. We‚Äôre drilling to the earth‚Äôs core whether we like it or not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I‚Äôm in at 20, so there‚Äôs that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Add 4 more shares and it looks to me like 54 contracts that can bring some of that cash back to you every week

Edit- the 4/9 12c alone would bring you in $1,134 in premiums. Me personally I‚Äôd take a bit more of a chance and choose a lower strike because it most likely wouldn‚Äôt hit $11 by 4/9 and that‚Äôs $1,728 in premium for the same date. This isn‚Äôt financial advice but come on man, make your shares work for you"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, what the hell are you thinking? 

Buy 5 more shares so you can sell another contract..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bag holder also checking in, looks like we'll all be friends for a long time because I'm not selling for a loss. I either swim or I'm going all the way down. Fuck it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$13 bag holder checking in
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought at 9.28 yesterday should‚Äôve waited for today lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"300 shares @$16 bag holder checking in for duty, sir!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you're selling some CC against it until the tendie machine cranks back up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i bought in when it was 27 lol. Then average it down to 23, then sold it all when it was 17. I was lucky. But then I use that money to go into GME and AMC.

Ape is in my DNA"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When GME is squeezed I'm putting half of my portfolio into BB. I really like this stock, so don't worry... I'll come for you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If it makes you feel better I have $10 April 1st calls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not. There‚Äôs a thing called opportunity cost. At some point, you can take that 50k and put it to better use!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you bought in at $5, you would still be holding for the same amount of time.  What's the problem?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB has promise, and I feel it only lost steam because of the RH bullshit and everybody is just too focused on squeezing GME to move over. Give it time"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,13.48  ugh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Down 18k, it hurts my bum."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I buy more it goes down I buy more it goes down, what the fuck Chen what the hell do you want from us?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember that's how much you lost so far....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just averaged down the other day to $14.50 lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is not a bag holding when u sell covered calls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy high sell low
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sell some covered calls and start chipping at your costs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh what‚Äôs another three months
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell ATM covered calls 45 DTE for a higher assignment risk but remember you can always roll your contracts either up, further in time or either both. You can become a master at rolling and roll only into rising implied volatility üòâ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell some cc you'll be aight
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least it is going to be much easier to bring that buying average down. This really is a 2 year investment play for me. Maybe longer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah... this will soon blow over and we‚Äôll rocket back up to.... $9.25. üò¨
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol. I bought BB and NOK at the TOP looking for one day of wave riding, we got shut down the next day, and while GME rebounded for a day, these two never moved. I bought BB at 24 and sold at 14.5 and Nokia at whatever it was and sold at 5-6. What a shit show"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why doesn‚Äôt everyone here with high cost avg‚Äôs double down at this point? Or sell cc‚Äôs to lower your cost avg
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same boat brother. :( I bought at $23.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell that crap and buy something else
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cut ur loses man gtfo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,20 @ 24.81 :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either BB or Amc will fly after GME and it scares me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#BB is a turd.  Papa Chen has gotta go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, yes you are"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you pressed ""exercise""?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was in at 13.72 cut my losses at 11.70, was just tying up capital"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding with you @13.65
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats quite the loss, Just_Lick_My_Ass. Damn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I might just sell my 270 shares to invest in EEENF in the morning... I originally invested 5k and here we are
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell covered calls, you can lower your cost basis and hopefully unload some bags."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,18 average here üíÄ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs at the same place where it fucked me on December calls lol Earnings was bad then too I was trying to warn people
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,17 @ $22.06 l feel your pain!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüò≠üò¨
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Put up your weekly chart with these averages... 52 , 104 and 156 ... Hopefully she holds at this convergence. My price target posted yesterday on someone going bullish prior to earnings ...  $7.50  Best of luck! Have it on my watch to hit that but I'm not going short."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1400 @ $14.90 here. I've got a standing buy order for another 1000 @ $6. I both want it to fill and don't at the same time. But I think it has huge growth potential as autonomous vehicles become more common.  I like the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro. I had 50 shares at $25 on the initial jump up. I was hurting for so long... I‚Äôm glad I liquidated at $18 and threw the rest on Tesla puts, was able to make all my money back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. I don‚Äôt even want to look at my portfolio anymore
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"17,000 @19.50.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,21.50 checking in.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You win
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea r/thetagang really makes the money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just a smooth brain. Why would those fly after GME goes to the moon?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean? I own shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm on damage control now. I‚Äôll be selling CCs below my cost basis and if I get assigned then good I off this train and I‚Äôll make up my loses somewhere else
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow very smart of you to do that but then again you bought BB at the top so idk lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Always bigger in Texas.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I like to play both sides. FDs and scalping options are fun when it works out, thetagang is definitely smaller percentage gains but they are consistent and somewhat reliable. Shit... even just to get some value back when the underlying takes a shit is nice. I had 1 stock that I was bagholding until I ended up making more back in premiums than what I lost in the value of the underlying. If you‚Äôre a young(ish) investor like myself it‚Äôs worth it to play smart and take some bigger risks while you can afford to make it back. That‚Äôs why I follow WSB and theta. I love having both plays at my disposal. Hell, sometimes I‚Äôll even use my premiums as my gambling money for FDs lol. Better to bet with house money am I right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Edit- I take this back. I‚Äôm guessing the bottom of the picture is CCs considering it says collateral?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause of wishful thinking
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because months ago our DD guys showed us the way of BB, also we want a amc squeeze to happen after GME or if it doesn't happen parallel to gme squeeze"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You got this homie
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro my anus was gaping for a minute there lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahaha I do the same thing! Sold a RAD FD on Friday to buy a RIOT FD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes only just spotted that as well. He could should definitely get up to 54 contracts and should also set a closer strike for more premium
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,2023 is the year I guess.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 600 shares at like $19 or so. I've sold like $4k worth of covered calls against these shares so the loss is a bit lessened.. but still awful lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did say that he won‚Äôt dilute the stock. So we‚Äôve got that going for us, which is nice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is a long term play. I rarely even check in on the price. If they haven't gained significant traction by the end of the year then I'll start to worry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Their stock popped a wk or 2 after earnings last time. Gonna wait to see what the next few weeks bring.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it helps, I have 15C's that were up 20x at one point and I just stared at them ü§∑ 

Still got 80 days left on the tires so either Papa Chen takes us to Valhalla or I burn in shame."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"in the same boat my dude, just hold at this point"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been saving up just to buy its dip. Where will it be? $8? $7?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earnings are exactly where they forecast it.  $0.03 share.

Anyone who was invested in this stock for this earnings report hasn't done the DD.

Partnerships with Amazon, Baidu, x # of Car manufacturers is why we are invested.  And all those were just starting."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got some 9 dollar puts.. *avoids eye contact*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For me BB is a long term hold.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good chance to buy more tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think one of my favorite things to do is wait until a bad earnings report, cruise WSB to see who was betting big and just bask on their misery. It makes me feel better about how much money I loose on a weekly basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The loss porn hasn‚Äôt reached its full potential
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine matching your projected earnings and the stock tanks 8%.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i think this was expected though wasnt it? i havent dug too deep on BB but how was their earnings call? any recent DD someone mind linking?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely will be, I'm holding 300 @17can so I'm with you. If you look at the after hours graph it isn't pretty."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess my 10k yolo is better in BB stock than in my checking account. Wasn't planning to touch it till then anyways.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haven‚Äôt seen the news. Bad earnings?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe this bad earnings report will have the same reverse effect as the positive earnings reports.  Stocks will moon tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's down 5% already, gonna be a big drop tomorrow for me and everyone. Pain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB dropped more, no surprises here"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some small street bets $9.50 strikes expiring this week. They gonna be worth $0 I‚Äôm betting so 100% loss. Small street though so who cares too lazy to even sell what‚Äôs left
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted here a few days ago.  WEEKLY chart points to $7.50 and teased that I would buy at that price.  How I chart. WEEKLY CHART .. SMA 52  104   156  1y 2y and 2y price average. This is a convergence play.  Note, I never buy anything and hold. I'm an active trader mostly trading weekly options and use the WEEKLY chart to determining major support or major resistance. Good luck with this one!  I'm Canadian and love the company. Rarely buy shares or short shares. Mostly options trading."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It happened again if you check after hours. Holding BB is like burning a cigarette on your thigh every day
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ain't a lost until you sell. Especially with my large $16 bags. Good think I have it in my IRA which I never touch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I lost about $700 with weeklies. They weren't FD's because they were in the money when I bought them originally.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh.  That explains the after market nose dive.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's this return to fundamentals in price? We're in the land of the TSLA and GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Took my $1500 losses a few weeks ago. Moved on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it that bad ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Really that bad? I didn't think so
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The reports were absolutely brutal, idk how they fucked up so bad."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hopped out of $bb when I had the chance. That shit was wild. Holding my $gme shares now like a boss
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. I wish I could afford to DIVORCE my BB. She keeps doing me wrong.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This earnings call is cringe worthy. Who the fuck is this guy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get the impression they just wanted to fuck retail traders. revenue holdovers, real estate losses, and a bunch of bullshit that seems almost intentionally directed at the stock price. One asshole even through his nose up to ""unprecedented volatility"". they'll probably beat next Q when no one's looking."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro the premium is dopshit for OTM calls, how the fuck you made $4K?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I sold at 15c for may 21. Easy 100$
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Based on ""chart astrology"" the bottom should be $6 (strong price support) . I doubt it will go that low, but it's very unlikely to go lower."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is true and I didnt expect good earnings. But I really hoped for a small beat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree but the red still makes me sad.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great comment last earnings killed me on calls so I tried to warn people this isn‚Äôt an warning play, plus auto delays for chips is bearish on bb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I get that but this shit is going to $4.  There are more sure ways to make money right now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I might if it goes down enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah son.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the true purpose of WSB.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earning missed but they seem to have quite a bit in the pipeline with IVY and QNX that will take a while to realize.  I'm a fucking moron when it comes to this stuff but I still think they have good long term potential.  I'll keep buying every month.  


They also mentioned they have a marketing campaign starting soon in the US and UK to let people know they're not just making phones anymore."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've already written it off.  Not gonna chase that loss.  Just training my asshole for the next one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm also holding 300@17
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think earnings were normal. Exactly what was expected. Stock has dipped 8% after hours though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm tired of it.  I'd rather just realize the loss than stare at every time I login.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah... I don't really understand most of it but even I can see it is devastating. I will hodl this till 2030 now...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im confused.. I'm listening live now are the reports already public ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why were they so bad
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ehhh. Disagree.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean CEO? Seems fine to me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they just doesn't care about share price at this moment. This was never quick buck, even though I had 30$ sell order setup in January and was couple cents away from executing lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow earning down now we're going to see upsides pretty soon given all the good news that have happened over the past couple months so far. Go BB go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i bought pretty much right at the peak and immediately sold a $25c.
here's just one of the calls i sold -
https://i.imgur.com/sk14p1t.png"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Never maybe 6 but it will come back next year as the write offs have cleared their calendar of bad news expect revenue bottom line growth and debt reduction bb to the moon in 2021
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be okay with that, I'd pick up a fuckload. Bb is a long play and will be undervalued for a while to come I expect."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What magic number are you waiting for? Or just buy shortly after open?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Foreal. I‚Äôve had enough of this shit üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What doesn't hurt you makes your anus looser.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think people wanted more progress in software. Plus it is looking rough for auto sales with the chip shortage. Most people still see the potential but sitting on this for 3-6 months before she starts chugging along again isn't appealing. Plus Chen isn't exactly an inspiring CEO. I don't blame people for selling. I don't think I'll add until she drops to where she was before Ivy news. Then I'll feel pretty comfortable averaging down.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. The amount of time researching and looking at this albatross is not worth it. Going to sell and release myself from the prison that is BB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They hit expectations, no?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúThe ceo doesn‚Äôt care about stock price‚Äù. That doesn‚Äôt happen in our realm of existence, ever. 

They had other priorities, clearly. On the call, their priorities were clearly write-offs and fiscal year earnings. 

Which is all fine well and good, but 300 million in losses definitely fucked this quarter."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol then you smart. I held on to it like a chump and now premium's cheap as hell
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">will be undervalued for a while to come I expect.

Then theres plenty of time to pick it up later lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just bought some today. I usually wait for an extra \~25% drop before buying more. However, I intentionally bought less today in case of an earnings drop, so I may buy some more at 10% down.

I do not have a big position, but I am probably going to start buying a little here and there each month. I have a feeling this stock is in for a beat down period for awhile, but is still a good long term stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think expected was \~230m, reported \~215m

&#x200B;

Honestly I don't see the panic when they've got so many projects under the hood that aren't even close to reaching their full potential (IVY, AWS collaborations, etc)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc ceo said he doesn‚Äôt care about stock price and checks only weekly at best
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"scraping $0.03 to $0.10 covered calls to recover some of the losses ... but after today, i may not be able to recover financially from $BB"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Honestly I don't see the panic when they've got so many projects under the hood that aren't even close to reaching their full potential (IVY, AWS collaborations, etc)



Which don't generate any revenue apparently."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got nice fat bridge for sale too. Special price just for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"?

&#x200B;

How can BB generate revenue from technology that isn't fully public yet"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it's weird how the business I'm planning to start when I retire isn't generating money in my thirties
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"By getting paid for development of services e.g. for AWS

Either way, they generated less revenue than Q4 last year - in a growing cybersecurity/tech market. That is quite terrible."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know. I have this super awesome plan for the future. But why isnt it giving me money now!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but nobody's buying stock in your dream retirement business now are they?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They should still generate revenue.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So the AWS agreement was made public in December last year - Did we expect revenue from that agreement in Q1 2021? I certainly didn't think so. Wouldn't this be more likely to show as Amazon  inches closer to deploying hordes of self driving delivery drones?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Something something, Amazon wasn‚Äôt profitable for the first 12 years or some shit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But they had growing revenue and were a growth company.

BB apparently is not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't forget. He likes the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This morning I decided I would pick either chewy or bb. Spaghetti for dinner.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This March dip has been fucking delicious for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds bullish for gamestop. Ryan Cohen is a fucking beauty.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great, now stop dipping below 80.  We raised you better than that, kid"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chwy has a market cap of 33B. Gamestop has a market cap at 200/share of 13B. When you think about it, shouldn't gamestop be worth as much as Chewy?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait until the hedge funds find...oh, you don‚Äôt say...really?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was already invested. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|snoo)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait one sells pet food and one sells game.  How is that a comp lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I LIKE THE STOCK üëçüèº
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Went 70% chewy and 30% Bb because of experience holding bb is an abusive portfolio relationship for me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. Rolled into sept 90c. Should be keepers for a bit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jesus christ net sales grew 50% year over year

Bull 4 sho"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ful as fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Packing heat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We don't think
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,game stop will be worth a lot more than chewy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop is worth bout a tril buddy, haven‚Äôt you heard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gamestop is worth in the trillions what are you talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So they should both be worth $3B?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chew toys, treats, ect.. are all in the game realm if you are a pet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cohen fudge packers unite.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I should rephrase that, shouldn't the big banks think of gamestop worth as much or more then chewy? The gaming industry has to be bigger then the pet industry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So will I
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All in good Time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before gamestop can be Worth anything again,  they need to provide a clear path to show they can increase sales in years.  The business model they had is going to be dead.  No matter how big the gaming market may be,  how does gamestop collect the money?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that's the path. Its going be chewified.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But they really need to prove themselves.  I have a teenager and it's just too easy buying the games straight off the respected console,  or steam for pc.... as a 3rd party they really have an uphill battle to get someone to go off the platform specifically to gamestop"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If GameStop created an ‚Äúapp‚Äù for all platforms (essentially steam but can be used on pc/Xbox/PS/Nintendo) where you can buy *one* copy of the game and activate it on any platform where you log in...that‚Äôd be awesome. I have already had to buy multiple of the same games for different platforms to play with different friends. I‚Äôd even shell out an extra 10/20 bucks to have the ability to download it onto any platform I am logged into whenever I want. Would incentivize buying from GameStop and bypassing the consoles digital store.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, it's going be a long & difficult uphill battle to prove that the business plan is valid. I really believe in Ryan cohen, and when you think about it a lot of the people in this forum are consumers too so we are ""validating"" the concept ourselves with the money we spend there. I really like the cat moon t-shirts that gamestop is selling now, and for $20 very affordable. https://www.gamestop.com/clothing/mens/clothing/tops-shirts/products/mooncat-t-shirt/11106326.html"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I always run into a problem buying peripherals online and feeling like I am either not quite getting the right product or am getting ripped off in some way. Bought an Xbox controller and had just way too frustrating of a time with it. I‚Äôd look to a gaming specific place for something like that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely intriguing,  I just feel the market is going to make them prove a concept at this point.  Essentially they just have to take their business name and money and completely rebuild it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We get the peripherals at best buy. Points and certificates as elite members add up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The market is different now. I don't care as an investor all the mumbo jumbo you are trying to get at. We vibe with potential and leaders. That's it. Investing at it's finest. What can come from this? Idk but I'm investing everything in it, for the potential."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is PLTR trending but barely pushing green?

As a ThetaGang call seller, I can say the premiums are cheap now. Almost...too cheap"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's going on with PLTR today?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As a palantard I'm pretty sure it's trending from people making fun of us. I'll take my gold star though!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know for a fact AAL was listed enough to be on this today... I know this because I‚Äôm the one who listed it so many times
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So far... Today. Today is tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR dethroned GME?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im all in on PLTR
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As a Palantard I approve this message

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao  
ONE green day and pltr dethrones gme"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh AMC you try so hard to be relevant
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,great chart. how didi you do that?  I would never have thought that [tesla](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BodpOp0qaAU) would be discussed so much.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the only three stocks I hodl are the top three most talked about rn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you guys enjoy the data. A point of note is that this is only in the Daily Discussion and Tomorrow's Moves threads. Does not include the GME-specific thread.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha my code has a number of bells and whistles to prevent against manipulation, which also includes some measures preventing single people from having undue influence"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Peter Thiel knows how to use bots very well to try to manipulate online sentiment. He needs to keep the price up enough to keep dumping his shares. Lot of fools will be left holding the bag this year.

Edit: Thiel has been using bots since at least 1999:

>	When Paypal figured that eBay was their key distribution platform, their marketing team came up with a creative marketing campaign to simulate demand. They created a robot ‚Äî a script that could spider eBay‚Äôs site looking for certain types of auctions ‚Äî that bid on items and then, insisted on paying for the auction using Paypal.

You bet your ass Thiel has a social media manipulation bot army on this sub. The difference this time is he isn‚Äôt trying to get a startup off the ground... he‚Äôs trying to dump his shares as quickly as possible at the highest price his army of bots and tape painting can support. He knows a correction is coming. He‚Äôs been holding his shares for a looong time and he‚Äôs cashing out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this for discussion threads? That kinda makes your comment fake news.

Edit: they deleted their comment so I guess they realized the mistake."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every week there is someone claiming the mods are censoring discussion of a particular stock. The fact that it seems to be a different stock every time I post leads me to believe that perhaps claims of bias against particular assets is exaggerated. I think a lot of posts just get removed in general due to the bot army.

If there is evidence to the contrary I'd be happy to entertain it, but I haven't seen anything on my end. It's pretty easy to give benefit of the doubt when there are countless examples of u/zjz and the rest of the current team acting in good faith."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That sub is fucking terrible.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It is one of the most interesting things that is happening right now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When you buy GME at 450 and need to shit on other stonks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact that you even mention it proves everything . Let me guess a GME bag holder ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm after a green day,  still down 35%"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sounds stupid. I‚Äôll buy more.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree with you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How is GME gonna change the gaming industry? By creating a Steam or Epic store competitor? Consoles have their own marketplace. A one stop shop for all gamers? Isn't that what they've always tried to be? Clue me in on this digital approach because I'm genuinely curious and don't understand.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol GME is not changing the gaming world , they may try and get into it by buying one of the gaming companies but not changing it
Shit you could say the same for amc they have tons of brick and motor and could also buy a gaming company"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right... mr crystal magic ball.  I won‚Äôt waste my time. There‚Äôs enough great DD that won‚Äôt appear on here.  Do some research stop wasting brain cells. Bye

What they didn't expect was an actual pivot to break even online + storefront with prior management. Now they are stuck holding  a massive short position where the business is actually adding actual executives who know how use online marketplaces as leverage.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It's looking like the new foundational support. Like $40 was. Until we get a big catalyst. If Ryan Cohen is confirmed CEO. And u/Deepfuckingvalue buys another 50k shares same day or around there. I think it's time to put space suits on

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"well they can't just sell stock, they have to file in advance"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"...But they fucked over kids and poor people who were trying to sell their used games for over a decade. They also fucked over their employees with low pay and shit working conditions.
I despise GameStop and its brand for their predatory practices. No amount of reinvention will erase their past mistakes for me. If they were an honest company, they would have gone bankrupt years ago.

Unrelated: Imagine a GME stock buyback when the Stock is $200 a share. The company would offer shareholders $20 of in-store credit per share. $11 if you want cash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If people buy their games online directly through the platform and download to their machine, what is the model that is being proposed for GameStop?  Where do they add value?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy to triple sales when they weren't making any before.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,None in stock due to Covid chips shortage though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last year the April share recount caused a short squeeze. Conveniently, he put his options the same week as that meeting, 2021."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow is both the quarterly earnings report for hedgies and the end of the SLR exemptions.  Might be a spicy next couple of days.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would bet money his plan is to exercise those contracts in time to be recounted so they are enforced right away. Or maybe right after while they're buying.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His options are up in April right? If he exercises them at the 4 or 5 dollar mark he‚Äôs going to have so many shares he may have to be reported on the next SEC filing!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wow this is mind numbing retardation. and not the good kind.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, are you trying to make money or have morals? Choose one. Note: what you bring up has been one of my primary beefs with them, though I better understand *why* those prices were so low (there were 10 more used copies in the back) and it's also a primary point they're likely to change since it's one of the primary complaints."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For the millionth time, e-commerce and digital distribution are not the same thing. GameStop‚Äôs competitors won‚Äôt all of a sudden be Sony, epic, steam, etc. it will still be Walmart, target, Amazon, etc"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There will always be a demand for physical discs as long as countries like America are decades behind in modern, high speed internet infrastructure. Gamestop can take advantage of the demand for physical during the transition which is going to last years, not overnight like boomers predicted.

Consoles and console games are just a slice of the pie that is the gaming market. Peripherals, gaming parts, accessories, gaming merch, limited edition collectibles, bundles, sponsored events, esports, etc. are highly valuable revenue streams that all experts agree will grow YoY for the longterm. Not only that covid proved these streams are pandemic-resistant."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How about you do it? ;)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe businesses should act ethically. Back in the early 2000s, selling to GameStop was the only option for young people to get any money for their games. 

Gamestop took advantage of that and turned it into 50% of their business."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the plan?  To compete for sales of headphones and gaming chairs?  That's not very innovative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn't sound all that innovative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing not certain in this whole ordeal ironically is the SEC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Last year I believe it was announced in April. Theres dd on this.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its 50k shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ehh lots of people held from 300 down to 50 why sell now

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Games have Little resale value. Unless you‚Äôre holding a mint copy of DEF jam fight for New York, I must scream but I have no mouth, or anything of that nature you‚Äôre not gonna get much. The fact that GameStop even buys back games in and of itself it is convenient."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol it doesn't matter if it is or isn't.

They shorted what they thought was a sears or jc penny or barnes and nobles. They choose poorly. And doubled down to that extent.

Now they are stuck shorting something that would fundamentally fail and that they could accelerate through whatever means. Short sells. Common sharing between ETFs. Coordinated media coverage. Coordinated forum cointelpro stuff. Hell, they prevented people from BUYING. And whatever crap/leverage they got going on regarding pressure on Cohen and company.

They were wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you explain to a smooth-brained ape such as myself? How would the SEC throw a wrench into all of this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes it is, because how much of that volume are the same X amount of shares being traded between bots and daytraders?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My only gripe was the markup on the used games.

New Game: $60

Used Game: $40

Buy-back: $5"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If games had little resale value, reselling them wouldn't make GameStop much money.

Gamestop, on average, paid 52 cents on the dollar for games. (They earned an average of 48 cents profit per dollar of used game sales.) It also accounted for 44% of their gross profit in 2013. It's literally the only reason they haven't gone bankrupt.

Used game sales is the only thing unique to GameStop. Other businesses do everything else better and cheaper."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Allowing hedgefunds to just keep the borrowed shares, without buying them. Lack of enforcement or possibly corruption/collision. Using phantom shares for free to return the borrows. I doubt it though."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buyers market.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only reason GameStop buys games is to sell them. Because making 35 dollars off a used copy of Gears of War 2 is better than not making any money at all. And this in turn let‚Äôs kids and customers buy games at discount instead having to pay full price. It‚Äôs called business. You maximize profit and minimize cost. Again who else aside from a pawn shop is going to buy used games?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn, already deleted. Now I‚Äôll always wonder, who was that secretive primate?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When I had gains I was wishing I had bought more the gods answered  my prayers lol

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess if April‚Äôs is no good there is always May
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Let's GO! This stock looks a hell of a lot like RKT right before it spiked. Bought 30 more shares this afternoon. Plan to sell if there a is a spike. Long term hold if not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My wife's bf texted me to tell you to take that 11k and buy the dip tomorrow
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably should sell, lockup ends tomorrow. Earnings beat, stock price double from IPO, no better time to dump a large portion of your shares..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs crazy how low the volume is on this stock. IMO it is very undervalued. I really like the stock . May be just as much as rkt if you know what I mean.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought several 100 at $24 and sold this AM at open. Made a solid return on a short term bet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol didn‚Äôt they declare bankruptcy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell make 11k like that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He should sell? Just to buy more?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lockup expiration isn‚Äôt nearly as big a deal as people make it out to seem.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Carl has puts on ASO. no worries though, i thought about a one or two-day play on ASO puts for a split second as well, but i'm now hoping the lock-out expiry is a non-event and that the shorts have to sweat out the long weekend.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I can assure you, I do not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just delete the app and claim the ‚Äúwhoopsie daisy‚Äù defense in court.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, you assume we are making money"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never sell, problem solved."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, do I get PAID if I lost money?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sales net out at the end once you sell. Any losses from previous purchases of same stock will roll into cost basis at time of repurchase. If you have realized gains the previous loss will reduce amount of gains you report. I don‚Äôt know what this idiot did but If you‚Äôre in and out of trades the loss or gain keeps rolling into the repurchase until the final realized gain once you sell. He didn‚Äôt plan well what a dummy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How much does your mom charge?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"On November 30 or before that, you just need to sell all and take December off from market."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow I might be screwed by this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Um had between 200k and 2 mil in trades daily and traded over 45million worth....so he lost all of it and ended with 45k but still has to pay taxes on his gains he lost...oops
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you make over 1000 then just get an effing accountant to do your taxes. Not financial advise. ...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody know if wash sale applies to options that are same company but different strike or expiration date?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt wash sales only mess you up if you hold though the new year? My understanding is the loss gets added to the cost basis, so as long as you sell the stock eventually and don‚Äôt rebuy and hold, you‚Äôre all good. Someone correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but I think that‚Äôs how it works."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule, does it mean I can't buy the same stock again within 30 days, or any stock for 30 days?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serious question: what should I set aside for taxes?
Will your app give you the relevant info?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs one of the big advantages of trading out of a Roth IRA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which one of you retards is this? 45M in trades and ends up with a 45k net profit at the end of the year.

Maybe this is why they say that day trading is a bad idea..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont know how to sell, so i dont have understand wash sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can tell that Forbes really gives a shit about new investors understanding the wash sale rules because they were touting this kinda stuff in November
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve luckily never been fucked on a tax bill, but I don‚Äôt think I fully understand the wash rule even after years of trading. Let‚Äôs say I buy a rack (100 contracts) of SPY calls.  I close the rack for a loss. Later I buy different strike SPY calls to enter at a better price.  I sell these for a profit.  Is that a wash? I.e. I owe capital gains on both transactions and not just on the profit? 

Shit shouldn‚Äôt apply to options imo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He obviously never got into options.  I mean the massive losses I take in options will easily equal out my stock gains :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,800K is chump change.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can just declare bankruptcy (unlike my student loans)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why I buy high sell low so I can owe more tax. Yes makes sense to this ape.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"WTH?  I wash my ass everyday, thank you very much, ain't payin' no damn taxes on my apeness."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to have gains for that ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|grin)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sale doesnt apply do mark to market traders
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow lol üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, is this tax advice?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs a taxes ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow so this is something people up vote?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"STOP POSTING THIS SHIT IN THIS SUB. Jesus fuck it‚Äôs a God damn CASINO.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares man. GME was cool like a month ago.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither does 95% of the sub.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But your honor... i was... uh. I didn‚Äôt.... well... i was unaware. Yes i was unaware.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was thinking of not paying anything at all in taxes this year, and then just double up earnings next year to cover both... seems sound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have had a few concussions growing up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The problem is you can owe taxes without making any money.  If you make $3.50 on one trade and lose $3.50 on another, it's possible to make $0 total, but owe taxes on the $3.50 anyway, which you now don't have because you already lost it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you explain this using a made up single instance example?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is my understanding too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This folds together all previous gains/loses together for the year, regardless if bought in the 31 day period for your true realized gains/loses?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs because we are the most free people to have ever lived.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,To stop everyone from selling their losers on dec 31 and buying back on Jan 1 to lower their taxes. Why's that silly?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you just started this year, just make sure you close out wash sale stocks. If that happens to be GME and the rocket is in December then maybe take the tax loss if it wasn't a big deal LOL."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost $36,000 in the Nasdaq crash and could only write off $3,000 per year for 12 years!!! (Of course, I no longer had money to trade...)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What?

$45 million was over the entire year. $200k to $2M was a day.

You buy 1,000 shares of Y at $20 and 100 shares of X at $250 and you've done $45,000 in trades and with triple margin you just need $15,000 in cash.  Sell Y at 21, buy at 22, sell at 23. And you've have $42,000 in costs and $46,000 in proceeds for just Y. But you still started with that $15,000. 

Last year I had about $650,000 in proceeds/costs despite never having an account balance over $100,000."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one knows because the IRS doesn't say. Wash sales are defined in [IRS Pub. 550](https://www.irs.gov/publications/p550#en_US_2019_publink100010601), and ""substantially identical"" is outlined for stocks and bonds (scroll down a bit), but not for options. The IRS *does* say the following:

>In determining whether stock or securities are substantially identical, you must consider all the facts and circumstances in your particular case.

&nbsp;

A rule of thumb incorporating this ""guidance"" is that options are substantially identical if the new option allows you to experience the same ups/downs as the one sold at a loss. How different the strikes and expirations must be to not cover ""the same"" market fluctuations is ambiguous though.

Of course, the best way to avoid wash sale restrictions it to not have any losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah once you sell it and wait 30 days you get the loss
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the mother fucking way.  They'll just print it away
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought wash sales only apply to selling on a loss. So if you made 3.50 on your first trade, and sold and rebought the same security pre30 days and lose 3.50, you can still claim that as a loss.

However, if you sold a security for a loss, and then you bought back that same security then the loss amount gets added to your total buy price, your first losses can't be  written off until 90 days following the sell of your second time buying assuming you don't do anymore wash sales.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7OmiwjGsZE&ab\_channel=TDAmeritrade](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R7OmiwjGsZE&ab_channel=TDAmeritrade)

I believe the kid who made 45K profit but owes 800K is because the timings didn't line up and he didn't sell his second wash before the holdings time before tax due date so he couldn't report losses for 2020, but he could for 2021. However, you can't get deductibles on 2020 taxes with 2021 so he still owes those taxes for 2020."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure capital losses offset capital gains but im also stupid so idk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy 10,000 gme Jan 1, price goes down by $1. Sell it and have loss of $10,000. Buy back in the next day when it drops even more. Loss disallowed until you sell again"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"December has 31 days, and you held no stock in December. All will be realized.

BTW, this is a satire to those who do not know how to handle wash sale."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,üò≥
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, the article says ""he transacted $45M (yes, Million) in total trades""  not that he had 45M"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, that's my ""it's possible"" caveat.  There's specific rules you have to follow, otherwise it looks like you're trying to rack up capital losses on purpose (by moving in and out of the same stock), which the IRS doesn't want.  

If you don't even know that's a rule, you can accidentally not follow them and get fucked with surprise taxes for gains you no longer have."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sales is really just a timing issue, it was implemented in the past because assholes didn't want to pay taxes so they sold securities at a loss to try and claim that as their tax write off. The guy who lost 800K on 45K profit is truly retarded, he waited for the stars to align and timed it perfectly to miss the year window."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does loss disallowed mean?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It may be dumb, but it works"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a few wash sales myself, but since I'm out of my positions now and it's been 90 days, I can file all my losses. I got scared when I read that Forbes article, but then I realized that guy is truly retarded."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It means you can‚Äôt claim it on your taxes until you sell the shares for real (and don‚Äôt buy back in)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't write it off. Come on man. I know we are all retarded...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so sell november and taking 30 days off would prevent a simpleton like myself from ever having to actually understand this right?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you'd want to liquidate positions you had previous losses in before the end of the year?  Would that solve things?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The wording made no sense to this retard!  I would have said ‚Äúyou can‚Äôt write it off until you sell again‚Äù.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah pretty much.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes and no- depends on what you‚Äôre trading and how often and how much.

Ok so better example:
I bought 100 A at $10 then
I bought 100 A at $5. Then
I sold 200 A at $8.  Then
I bought 200 A at $5.

My taxable gain for this series of events would be $300 ($5 A to $8 A). My potential loss would be $200, but because I bought back in all of those shares within 30 days of the sell transaction, I cannot claim that loss until I sell my shares again and keep them sold."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NICE
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man that could get really confusing real quick!  So this guy in this article could potentially write these losses off next year?  Even so, I guess that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that he owes 800k now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right

Well the intention of it is to prevent you from selling all your red stocks in December and then buying them all back at the same price in January to evade taxes.

Overall it‚Äôs kinda stupid because it all works out in the long term anyway"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL!  WTF??   

"" Adam says the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the [LastPass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LastPass) account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Ubiquiti had negligent logging (no access logging on databases) so it was unable to prove or disprove what they accessed, but the attacker targeted the credentials to the databases, and created Linux instances with networking connectivity to said databases,‚Äù Adam wrote in his letter. ‚ÄúLegal overrode the repeated requests to force rotation of all customer credentials, and to revert any device access permission changes within the relevant period.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Woah, check out the lower end of the options chain on them.. I haven't seen anything that bad since the Texas storm had people betting on power companies going bankrupt.  Every ask price below $270 on puts is $10."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And that's, my fellow apes, why you shouldn't use such garbage as LastPass, DashLane, 1password etc. If your all your passwords are stored online, behind a single username and password, it's already a security hole in itself."

I think they'll all get repriced to real numbers tomorrow and it's just an after hours glitch.  But the Texas storm when I was betting against power companies was the only other time I've seen this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs why you don‚Äôt use text based mfa if you can avoid it. Thankfully AWS allows you to use hardware and virtual token generator with SSO. If you decide to use mfa and pick the most insecure way to implement it, you fully deserve whatever happens to you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How? Genuinely curious.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was surprised $280P option is about $1 (ie $100 per contract). This shit is definitely going to half in price at he very least...will go to $150 easily based on the ensuing shitstorm. It will be a reverse gamma squeeze. The entire put option chain ITM by eod"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, this rotation into cyclicals and fading the FANG names cannot last forever. 

I'm balls deep in AMZN, but i think I'm a dumbass with this union vote shit. You'd think it was priced in cause it is has such a high likeliness to pass, but idk the market could knee jerk down.

The other negative with AMZN is that it is going to be lumped in with the overbought tech names, despite having gone sideways for 6 months. 

So selling the ""growth"" story in a market where tech names are trading at 20 year highs relative to revenues, could potentially drag this shit down.

With all that said, logic says not to be long here, which is why I'm long. I'm a stupid fuck, and inversing my sMarT bOi take should make me money somehow."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GameStop will reissue most or all of the shares they repurchased in 2019 and 2020. If they drip the shares out rather than flood the market, they can maximize the amount of cash they receive from this and can pause if the stock falls too quickly. If GameStop's management is able to issue the stock for $100/sh, that's over $3 billion in profit based on the shares they bought back in 2019 and 2020. This should effectively pop the bubble in GameStop stock and should decrease the volatility as well. GameStop's management should be able to cash in on the market mispricing them via this mechanism.

It is all about GME. Always was. Nothing else matters.   


See that last minute effort to push GME below 190? It was not done by selling GME shares but by shorting or selling a whole bunch of other stuff: even QQQ had a weird last minute plunge. Several other stocks, identical pattern.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's way too much to describe. However I will try to take a stab at the most simplest of them long calls and long puts. A long call is where you are saying I think the price is going to go up and I think it's going to go up to this number. A long put is the same thing except you think it's going to drop. Each option contract is for 100 shares. Simply put if stock is $50 and you think it is going to $100 and you buy a $100 call and it ends up going to a hundred and twenty then you basically just made the prophets of the $20 difference between 100 and 120 * 100 shares minus the premium you paid for the contract. It is the reverse on a put.

This is a major oversimplification of these options and in reality you really need to spend some time studying and watching some YouTube videos less you end up with all your money gone. Options are very high risk as you can lose the entirety of your premium in just the two I described. Other options have other varying levels of risks and you would be foolish not to fully understand them before you purchase them. Nobody is going to be able to properly tell you how they work in a short space on this site"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"calls means up, puts mean down, flat means you lose"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy some. You will understand.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You buy the right to sell to someone a stock at a specific price. For that right you pay a ""premium"".  

Essentially you're betting that a stock will hit a price and if you're right you win big. If you're wrong you lose the premium you paid (well not really, you can still sell at a loss, but thats the basic jist behind it)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Someone make me understand options

Also, it should be noted only you can make yourself understand, don't try delegating that responsibility to others. Ask inquiring questions based on your research."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs 2 screenshots
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you try swiping?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There are 2 pictures there

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is what all of us feel.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, but sadly its one of the more international ones of sorts . In my country the only broker that has the gme ticker is them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also insane waiting times for execution and just doesn't work half of the time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fucking hate etoro, slowly moving all my trades over to Freetrade.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I didn't see that shit at first either. I just freaked and checked after hours prices to make sure I wasn't missing something üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Apologies... didn't see the other one
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm kicking myself extra hard because I ran up frivolous credit card debt on stupid crap when I could have easily been setting aside close to $1k each month for the past 3-4 years. Everything is paid off now and I've cut out all the unnecessary stuff to focus on saving and investing. My only outstanding debt is my car and I should have that paid off about 2 years early. Better late than never.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I moved over to interactive brokerage, in Australia so I don't have too much choice here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I had contracts worth 450 each and I let them drop to about 80 each now...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Art of the Deal
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I believe we can recover ATLEAST a little. It isn‚Äôt out of the realm of possibility‚Äôs for it to go quite a bit higher either
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It wont moon while you are buying. Just look at a single minute candle. $1mil cant even move a needle in a stock worth 40b
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea its possible. I really believe RKT course corrects quickly compared to all the other stocks I have lost money on

PS: I was so close to getting one $25 call for 4/1 because it was a .11 a share and I gots $11 worth of buyin power"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No I meant what if price goes above your limit price
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I‚Äôm debating on buying some cheap options at open
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He won't get more purchases unless someone is selling a limit price at his level.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You will get filled. Dont worry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Y‚Äôall need to be smarter with your strikes on GME for real...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to diversify and only put 90% in. The 10% is to buy the dip.

GME is not the norm.

Just play it easy, hold it and the reward will be sweet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be selling 2 well-OTM calls every week until IV is below 150% lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,800 lmaoo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Got them at 15 cents and got 1 on 4/16 im green on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont even buy strikes. Shares y‚Äôall please.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought 199 WAS the dip üòÜ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do as I say, not as I do. They‚Äôre also .01% of my portfolio üòÇ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, this smooth brain is buying 2 well-OTM calls every week."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Might as well do daily close to expiration and just rebuy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,bro we all see that $800 call... üëÄ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this getting downvotes? Hedgies?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you think some dude buying two shares for $400 instead of an option with a premium of $400 is ‚Äúhurting these guys‚Äù more than the other you out yo mind.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everytime I see dip, Imma like look at those curves"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dip is like midd-low $100s.

It is were I got my few shares and just sitting and waiting for the next drop back to the 120s"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have the same ones although they‚Äôre 100% of my porty
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's like ""lOoK gUyS iM BuYiNg CoVeReD cAlLs!!:1!!-"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's getting down voted because he came into WSB and told someone not to trade options and buy shares instead. That's like going into the vatican to preach the benefits of satanism.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares are the only way to truly hurt these guys
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well the dude holding 2 shares is at least keeping shares out of the pool.

Buying a $400 FD just gives someone smarter than you $400.

If you're going to buy calls they need to be at least 50-60 Delta to make it worth while.

190c at $1700 an option... That's less than 10 shares of gamestop that will get hedged (maybe) for 59 shares.

Seems like a no brainer at that point. Just cough up the $1700 though"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he sold some OTM calls... He could possibly even afford to buy an ITM call. ü§î
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would 100% agree if it were any other stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or accumulate 35 more shares so he can start selling THREE calls a week.

Seriously you can sell a call that's 25%+ OTM for next week for $1,200. Dude can make $2k+ per week off 200 shares until the price either drops or the squeeze squozes. And if it squozes you can probably buy back the calls you sold that week and ride the squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Its a squeeze. The demand for shares sparks that very squeeze.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"the assumption is they don't cover far otm calls with low probability so it's actually pointless and just speculating. Also, you don't force 100 shares buy everytime an option is traded (if at risk of exercised), just once per contract."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The one problem is that I'd be too retarded to recognize the squeeze until it's too late for me to buy back my calls and I'd watch the squeeze squeeze my ass cheeks for a couple grand. Yikes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You wouldn't get squeezed for a couple grand, that's why you have shares. You'd get cucked out of some gains, but you would still be selling 200 shares for a decent gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You had worded it better than me. I just couldn't comprehend allowing myself to be cucked so hard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket labs is suppose to go public sometime soon. They will be a sleeping giant. Very talented and they managed to beat Jeff Bezos to reusable rockets having just successfully recovered a rocket they are planning to relaunch. ARKX will go heavy into this company. Their small size leaves huge room for growth especially if they achieve the same kind of efficiency as the falcon 9 in reusability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket Labs is big potential
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt wait to hear the first report of a space-soldier capturing a foreign intruder and making them reveal their Netflix login info, only to be forced to watch Cuties ‚ÄúA Clockwork Orange‚Äù style. Space wars are going to be FUN."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. Bring on those blue alien women that Captain Kirk was always banging.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ARKX without RYCEy is trash buy RYCEy before Cathy buys the dips
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you seen the holdings of her space fund?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NYT just put out an article stating a study found an astronaut‚Äôs heart shrunk in space. We still don‚Äôt know some of the long term effects of human exposure to those elements.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed they already have a deal to go public via SPAC so its a matter of time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This! Also, you may have noticed the 3D printing ETF included in ARKX. Rocket Lab and others will be driving down rocket cost by 3D printing rocket components."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was actually very surprised they were not initially added.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rocket Lab (VACQ) and Astra (HOL) were perfect additions to ARKX. Considering ARKX wants to want invest in ‚ÄúOrbital Aerospace‚Äù companies. 

The only reason I can think of is that they are expecting to invest in Starlink (SpaceX subsidiary) eventually. And don‚Äôt want to hold anything that directly competes against SpaceX (orbital launches). Ark-funds is obviously a big supporter of everything Elon.

Maxar was a no brainer with a low P/E ratio but high growth potential. Very surprised MAXR wasn‚Äôt included."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. the digital globe part of the company is incredibly interesting as well and that will drive revenue too. I was focused on the vehicle stuff opposed to the imagery
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The key is to pick what you like from her holdings. Don‚Äôt pay her to buy stock for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, but don‚Äôt mean PLTR stock price go to moon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"proud owner over >2K PLTR shares, i feel you i was focusing on infrastructure better than John Deere and Netflix"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yes - which is why i wrote this shit DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually I think they may given up on it. Elon has proven that the specific variant of steel he is using for starship is a much more cost effective way to build. Overcommitting to carbon fiber may prove to be rocket labs one mistake thus far. It‚Äôs very hard to work with and much too expensive.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed and cathy buys SPACs so its not like she couldnt have
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKLB doesn't exist yet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think its an acquisition target for a big boy, similar to how AJRD got snatched up.

Maybe Google or another information service but I think most likely RTX or LHX as a stretch. MAXRs offerings fit in within both company's portfolios."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,did exactly that with DE at the beginning of the year and it has crushed for me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, unless you think Alibaba, John Deere, Netflix, etc, are space companies.  Top one on the list is Trimble (TRMB), so may be best just to stick with that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw the initial holdings and immediately decided the fund didn't exist in my mind üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relativity Space uses a machine that they call Stargate to completely autonomously 3D print and assemble metal rockets. This would be a faster way to get to cheap manufacturing of rockets.

Relativity Space hasnt gone public yet but the largest holding of PRNT is THE EXONE COMPANY which also has developed metal printing machines."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think she only buys SPACs that go through DA. Most of the space SPACs have not completed the deal yet
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They could have added VACQ.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"agreed. hell you have to wonder if MSFT or AAPL want to get in on the action like amazon did. RTX a possibility, LHX trickier cause they divested from all the consulting/contractors at Gov buildings when Harris and L3 merged"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, John Deere has working contracts with NASA and have developed tech through that partnership. Doesn‚Äôt Alibaba have some type of satellite side hustle? I‚Äôm not sure, but I feel like I remember reading about that at some point. I could be completely making that up though, so definitely take it with a grain of salt. I have no idea why Netflix is in there"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"probably the smart decision. when i saw her own ETF in ARKX i immediately thought a CDO inside of a CDO, ITS AWESOME"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could have, Yes, but why drag it down when you get it direct without the baggage."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can ""maybe"" see JD (from a distance) involved in mechanical engineering on the lower end, but what troubles me is Alibaba.  For that reason alone I won't touch it.  Netflix, who knows, maybe just for it's real-time delivery of feed.  As an investment, though, I would rather chose my own than an ETF for other than what I just flipped for quick few bucks."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's very clear she decided to open and bring to market an ETF in the Space sector before the Space sector was big enough to create and ETF in.

It may pay off in a decade or two, but there's no reason to rush into this ETF."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options.

An option is the right to buy 100 shares, but not a commitment to do so.

2 large ""calls"" betting on the price rising:330 at the strike price of $52, so if exercised he could have 33000 shares.261 at strike of $52.5, so 26100 shares if exercised.One moderate ""put"" betting on it falling to strike $51, 6 contracts, so the option on 600 shares

The cost on the far right is how much the options cost, per share, that x100 (and times the number of contracts bought) is gone, you spent it. You hope to recoup it either selling the options, or exercising them if they turn ITM (In The Money)

With the 52 call example the shares would have to have hit $52 + option cost for them to be profitable if exercised, but exercising means buying all those shares.

People sell option contracts they bought to others if they cannot afford to exercise them themselves.

When you exercise, you're paying the strike price per share, so the difference between that and the share value when you exercise is profit (less the option cost) if you then sell them off.

If it doesn't hit 52 by 4/1/21 they're worthless though, your option to exercise has expired.

I'm not good at this but it will do until someone wants to explain it better/pick holes in what I have wrong.

He essentially gave some one 14k dollars in a contract. In the contract it says ‚ÄúALL PROFITS THAT 60,000 shares of MO stock would gain after 52$ share price will be mine before 4/1‚Äù. So if MO gets to 53$, his contract activates, 52-53= 1$ but he has 60,000 shares, so he actually gains 60,000$ and he didn‚Äôt buy the shares but just paid 14k so the profit is 46k if MO gets to 53$."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not alone, bro!  Chin up!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have time to spare so I‚Äôm gonna grade your ‚Äúoption‚Äù explanation- I‚Äôll play the knowledgeable and the beginner so both sides views are made. 

Start: 

>An option is the right to buy 100 shares, but not a commitment to do so.

True, but this is not needed. 1) no one should ever exercises. 2) this definition just confuses beginners- it‚Äôs more confusion. Some some can learn option without understanding this as they will not be exercising. 

>2 large ""calls"" betting on the price rising:
330 at the strike price of $52, so if exercised he could have 33000 shares.
>261 at strike of $52.5, so 26100 shares if exercised.
One moderate ""put"" betting on it falling to strike $51, 6 contracts, so the option on 600 shares

Here you should really define what call, strike, and put, and exercise even mean before writing the numbers. For someone that doesn‚Äôt understand the image, they def will not understand what any of what you wrote means. And using word alike ‚Äúlarge‚Äù should be avoided. Large option could be either the leverage or the price- which is stupid since this same ‚Äúlarge‚Äù bet would be like 10 GME calls- not something if call ‚Äúlarge‚Äù. 

>The cost on the far right is how much the options cost, per share, that x100 (and times the number of contracts bought) is gone, you spent it. 

The cost of the far right is the MARK price of the option CURRENTLY. Mark price is just the mid point of bid-ask spread. So it‚Äôs not exactly the value but close to it. The option he bought costs more than the price show in the right, since he had loss, so you can assume that he bought the option for more than their current price. 

>You hope to recoup it either selling the options, or exercising them if they turn ITM (In The Money)

The first is true. Second is- no retail investor does it so it‚Äôs not even an ‚Äúoption‚Äù. (Funny because the reason it‚Äôs called option is that you have the option to do so, but no one actually does it). You make money by selling the contract. DO NOT EXERCISE (buy shares at strike). 

>With the 52 call example the shares would have to have hit $52 + option cost for them to be profitable if exercised, but exercising means buying all those shares.

The strike+cost= break even. So the profit would come after hitting that number. Because he is leveraged 330X in 52 calls, every cent $MO gains after 52+cost, gives him 330 dollars. Every dime gives him 3,300$. And if MO hits, 53$ (currently 51.3) or gains 3% in the next 2 days, he gets 25k just from the 52c. (Every 1$ gains 33k from 52c). 

>People sell option contracts they bought to others if they cannot afford to exercise them themselves.

99.99999999% of the time this is true. 

>When you exercise, you're paying the price per share that it was when the option was bought, so the difference between that and the share value when you exercise is profit (less the option cost) if you then sell them off.

This is wrong. The price at option bought time doesn‚Äôt matter. The strike of the option is the price you agreed to buy the stock at. When you exercise, you are simply paying the strike price of the option. 


>If it doesn't hit 52 by 4/1/21 they're worthless though, your option to exercise has expired.

True. 

>I'm not good at this but it will do until someone wants to explain it better/pick holes in what I have wrong.

>Edit: mostly formatting, strike, and to not forget to multiply options cost by no. of contracts too, and the important bit about exercising."

I'm new to this and most sounds like rocket science to me, but you've actually explained it pretty well. 
Im too new to do options but i still have a small question:

I'm learning with like 2k in my brokers account, options (if always multiplied by 100) would be too expensive right and would not be an option with that amount of money?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can buy options with the intent to never excise them and always sell them on instead, and this is very common, and a quicker way to earn, but they are a larger gamble than stocks because they can expire having not hit your strike price, no-one might be interested in buying them.  
So though it protects you from loosing the cost of buying 100 shares as you were never committed to that, you can still end up missing every call you ever make or not finding a buyer and lose 100% of what you spent buying the option in the first place.  


On the other hand if you buy shares they're also a gamble but if they go down you've normally only lost some of the money you put in, not all of it, and it might go back up again at some point anyway, and if you've done some decent due diligence you're more likely to come out not so badly.  


I'm fairly new at this too but I would suggest spending quite a bit of time learning more about stocks first before options as on the way you'll also end up getting a better understanding of how prices move, what affects them, and that will help later for judging what sort of strike prices people go for and the date, and you'll probably get a better understanding of all the risks too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,now that you sold it will lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey man, thanks for taking the time. 

Alright, got it so far. Ive actually seen some options (calls) the last couple of days where the stock price already matched or was higher than the strike price. 
The time was almost a non factor in my eyes (like really close to expire). Those calls wouldve been a save bet or not? U dont need to go into detail here, but I think in those cases the premium is way higher and therefore maybe not worth it?
Was hard to google that phenomen this afternoon, couldnt find anything. 

Well yeah, I defo will be learning without options for now but understanding them more and more will help definitely. Before doing this kind of stuff I prolly neee to set up a free account for testing. Thanks again  :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what if it gets acquired tonight?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wdym acquired?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why the downvotes lmfao, I looked it up, Altria isn't getting acquired tonight (it's not even on the table) and the price isn't hitting 53$ anytime this week"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SNL isn't CC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Comedy Central is pretty dead man. I listen to a lot of podcasts with comedians and they all refer to it in the past tense as it doesn't exist anymore...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love tuning into Comedy Central every Saturday night to watch SNL. Family tradition for 40 years
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I work at Comedy Central. Save your money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow no way they own that one bad version of adult swim
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cable television is the future! I'm buying leaps
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dave Chapelle also worked with Netflix to get the rights to his show lately.  Haven‚Äôt seen much more on that but that doesn‚Äôt help Comedy Central at all
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense since they were down 30 percent for no other reason that someone else made a bet on another company and failed miserably. So yeah, unless something is wrong about their business model, I don't see why a cool 30 percent over 8 months isn't realistic."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it hinges on people signing up for Paramount Plus rather than their nostalgia for old reruns on Comedy Central
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah no, this will be consolidating for a while under 50 lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long VIAC.
4/21, 6/21, 1/22 calls at 47.5$ & 50$."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently waiting for the end of the week before I decide to buy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy central didn't pay Chappelle for a decade while still airing his show and reaping all the benefits of it. When he didn't want to do another deal, they buried him  and pretty much tried to end his career. They can go fuck themselves."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fact you made an argument for VIAC through CC is comedy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That whole chart looks like the sketch of an overly optimistic kid‚Äôs idea of a bike ramp.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy central is super woke, they won't be making any money in the future"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Shares are better imo. This stock is volatile AF right now so you might get IV crushed on those calls in case this trades sideways for a few months.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Comedy Central is basically dead, every comedian talks about it. all they have is southpark"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Viacom! shit eaters!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this company is to have a future, they need to start a streaming service, but even if they do, they are late to a market that is slowly becoming polluted. There is a reason the hedgies liquidated this company opposed to liquidating some other company. You could probably make a nice swing trade considering it is very oversold at the moment, but I wouldn‚Äôt hold long term."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They should buy back shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine doing DD on Viacom and not mentioning CBS or Paramount+
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought the same thing. Bought leaps yesterday.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol good luck.

I only see it tanking below $30 by mid April... If not lower.

No new content announced, relies on old TV model for advertising income, and an infuriating streaming site where you cant even bookmark shows you want to watch.

Literally the only things VIAC has going for it is the Trek franchise and sports."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have chosen a very wired time frame for your graph. Change to a year and spot the difference. Stock is still overvalued imho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh no shit, I didn't know that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love your plan currently have a couple TME calls. Thinking about cutting a few long term bets to jump on this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought about going long too. But they also more than doubled since January. It looks like they grew very quickly as well. The current price is the same as mid Jan.  So might this be a justifiable level?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Content and an ability to create it is going to be at a huge premium as everyone consolidates and goes streaming b2c ‚Äî into a massive market that loves stupid shit as much or more than quality 

Short term I could see a bounce, long term ‚Äî it depends on managements ability to turn that appreciating asset into something ‚Äî or at the very least - not piss it away

If debt and management are quality ‚Äî it should recover simply because real assets at a decent price are tough to find in this uncertain world ‚Äî lot of money would scoop it up for even nominal gains"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I'm not the only one who caught that lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SNL is NBC property
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Neither is SpongeBob lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you can watch south park on it

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MY MAN.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. I feel like it may be liquidated a little more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have a streaming service.... and it crap.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They've had their streaming service for 3 years and it's doing fine, it generates revenue through it's base tier limited commercial variant too. Imagine buying NFLX at $50; that's the potential for VIAC in the future, they have little to no barrier of entry into creating tier 1 content, shows and movies, through Paramount and CBS two entertainment Goliath's. If it weren't for these huge blocks getting dropped this could have easily ran into the $120-$150 range EOY"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You do realize they merged with CBS 12/2019 
 Looking at a year chart is only going to show you the increasing value of the combined companies. 
 Not even that.  Covid hit right after the merger finalized. 
 The current price is barely 2% above the merger day value, that means none of their streaming services and excess cash on hand for growth is priced on, currently. 
   
  Shorts always want to think a stock is overvalued because that's the big story on MSM, one day you're gonna realize that the over valued narrative that's being pushed is just a tool to separate you from your money.  Like any MSM finance narrative
  
 Now, had you said the stock was over valued, you might have had a point.  As it stands, your opinion is useless, based on nothing, and easily proven false."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not going lower than this, likely ever, yesterday had 10x average volume and it couldn't even retest $40 got slapped the minute it went under $44 and couldn't even get below $45 today with more than 4x average volume, when the short positions close this is going to low $50's"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Correct
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*HBO has entered the chat*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can watch South Park on its own dedicated website. Have been able to for years.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, but the best era was when Jackie Gleeson was  in the main cast, along with Lucille ball.... I loved when they would have Dezi Arnez on as musical guest."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you going to try and convince me the hot garbage on Netflix is better, NFLX is only going to get worse, by that I mean way more indie/foreign content that I couldnt give a shit about; plus, as more companies exercise their content rights upon expiry NFLX is going to a) lose a lot of premium content, for example the office got yoinked because of Peacock, similar shit may happen, or b) at the very least it may not be exclusive to NFLX, or/and more expensive which will lead to higher revenues from licensing.  

Just because it's not something you watch doesn't mean it's not something other people watch; if you don't know, that's where the entertainment market is moving towards several Al la Carte' content providers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$120 seems a bit too optimistic. Just below the prior peak is very likely though
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"With personal insults you just prove you do not have any argument. Why is my opinion useless and yours superior? Why is my opinion based on nothing and yours on knowledge?
Do you live in a free country and do you know what it means to express different opinions and do you understand that those opinions can help you to see your argument from a different perspective?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt it also on Hulu? Or at least was...have no idea if it still is or not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,NFLX is better because it has top tier content like Cuties.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Netflix is considerably better than Paramount plus. It's not even close
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I'm for sure not saying it bounces all the way back to ATH; but, intrinsically, this has the potential to be a $200 dollar stock < 3 years, reliant upon continued, quality content additions and subscriptions to P+"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You ignoring the actual financial points Is easiest for you huh? And focusing on the only thing you can argue against, ""my mean words"" shows your opinion is based on shit. 
 Did you argue technicals, fundamentals or just emotions?  
 Exactly. So go fuck off back to ""bear land"" with your bitch ass."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Taken off within the past year. HBO only place to watch it as far as I know besides CC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I remember whenever I used Netflix is spending too much time scrolling through tons of shit I wasn't remotely interested in... It's only going to get worse too, because an overwhelming majority of the 'tier 1' content Netflix has isn't their, Netflix pays Companies like VIAC subsidiaries CBS/Paramount/CC/MTV/BET etc... For the rights to showcase the content and gone are the days where Netflix will easily be able to retain exclusive rights when the companies it pays for content exercise their rights to purvey that content on their own platforms, and the cost benifit will be positive either way for companies like VIAC a) they get more revenue renegotiating exclusive rights contracts with Netflix or, b) the contracts aren't exclusive rights contracts and therefore appear as content on P+  c) this type of disruption will funnel  non-core Netflix user's towards these alternative platforms d) there's a strong argument to be made that in the near future people will have 2-3+ subscription services and Paramount+ is poised to be a frontrunner as that 2nd or 3rd option"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe at this exact moment in time, I'll not deny they're the #1 for sure, personally, I think it's trash, everything I've ever enjoyed on Netflix gets rotated off of to the point I'm over it, more than 80% of its content at any given time is trash that I'd never watch anyways; I'd rather pay less for something that has less content but all its content is stuff I'd watch. NFLX didn't blow up over night and neither will P+ but, it's ability to do what Netflix did in its first decade is exponentially easier than it was for Netflix and will be exponentially more profitable. Paramount is one of the major motion picture studios, imagine all the infrastructure and talent pools they're able to access, high grade A list acting; not the fucking C+ budget priced, who the fuck is this type of talent Netflix splurges on! They've already announced that certain movies produced by Paramount will be available on P+ 45 days after its theatrical release; 5 years from now P+ could be a behemoth with regards to content providers. Netflix is only going to deteriorate, with more companies retaining rights to their content for their own platforms and or charge Netflix a heavy premium which will ultimately lead to the content being more difficult to access on a consistent basis. And, foreign content is interesting, but, I'm not spending $20 a month to watch indie productions and foreign content... Sorry, not sorry!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#so you're saying its price could go up or down?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me helmet on backwards I cant c

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The past 2 months at the very end of the month it has shot up. Does anyone know if there is reason behind this? Options expiring or just coincidence? Hoping the same happens this month we are at the end of it. GME TO DA MOOON

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, right after you posted this it went up $6, so you were right"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seeing how fast GME plummeted after $200 this morning shows how strong of a wall we‚Äôre up against. Even at $195 there was massive selling pressure just 15 minutes ago. We need a lot of volume to break $200 this afternoon.

Due to a loss in my family I am liquidating to help with expenses for her child...I will be back and ready to refuel the üöÄ for the üåôüåö and beyond thanks for allowing me to learn from all 9mill+
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Blah blah something something technicals dont fucking matter on GME
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hodl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha Lebron just doing what Shaq started....remember what he did to Chris Dudley...Oh my goodness Shaq think of his children....poor kids gotta watch that youtube clip and read those comments...moment of silence for Chris Dudley please
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude just shut the fuck up about GME. Literally hundreds of new posts about it DAILY. There is nothing new here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good dd, dd like this needs to hit trending instead of all the same post this is the quality stuff we need"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought five more for myself at $190 this morning.  Convinced my sister to buy four, and my dad to buy two."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess enough times and eventually you'll be right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine they were like ""Woah man GME is going up"", and we were like ""yeah we knew it would"" and they were like ""we didn't want that to happen"" and we were like ""it did though lolz"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"  I am going to repeat this message from here to eternity: Dates & DD don't mean shit. This is not normal stock. It is being manipulated to the nth degree. But the good news is they can manipulate it for so long and so many methods before it gets critical. Doesn't matter if ""all hedgefunds"" get in on it. All. Shorts. Must. Cover. Remember that. 

  I will just BUY, HODL and STAY patient and vigilant. Let the cucks wriggle and squirm as much as they want. ¬£10,000,000 a share. I also treat everything until the squeeze as a distraction. Even the stonk itself. It is merely the vessel to Valhalla. May we all reach it's peaceful shores."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean RSI and MACD were close because price was very stable before, its the same now since a week. 

Not sure if lines being close signal breakout."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just need to sacrifice some chickens to molok

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Your words and your pretty pictures fed my confirmation bias and I really can't ask for anything else.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fun day, lets get that next jump"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Loved the post man! I wont be as detailed as you but in another note I've been tracking NOPECHART which showed a negative end of day result which we didn't see since the run up in FEB and it went negative about two trading days ago. I'm confident we are going to rip to the heavens.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No ape pattern. No Batman pattern. No obtuse crocked penis wedge pattern. Obviously fake TA.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course it will moon. Had to sell 5 of my 7 shares this morning, because dishwasher broke and needs replacement. So yeah, here‚Äôs your catalyst.  You‚Äôre welcome"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys of any of the matter when we have a dark pool, synthetic shares and shady options"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If i say that TA on a normal stock is reading tea leaves, interpreting lines in the palms of the hand and studying tarot cards, and on GME its pure astrology.

What do you say in response?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon soon is something I like.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone please get me a graph of the GME price... in combination with posts saying it's going to the moon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need 2 days for my paycheck, can we wait 2 more days please?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically what I'm getting from this is prepare to buy another dip. Gotcha

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lit thanks a bunch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Only using Oscillators doesnt give you nearly enough info tho. but GME UPPIES i like

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No disrespect, but I would not bet one penny because of indicators like MACD or RSI..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,looks like you were right! I'd say it could try to consolidate 200 now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How hard is OPs dick right now? Glad I listened and got 15 more shares- good DD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD. All I got from it though is a craving for some McDonald's
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have lent a lot of ETF to short the shit out of the stock! EXPECT FUCKERY!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TLDR. When your done drawing charts with crayon, can I have them? I‚Äôm getting hungry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It really hard to do TA on manipulated stock. Just buy and hodL. Regardless good DD.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving this so my wife‚Äôs boyfriend can explain it to me later.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD + yellow and red colors. So ... we're buying McDonalds now?

Ape confused. Wrinkles have been smoothed. Need dip to buy moar."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My dumbass thought MACD meant McDonalds :(

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,OBV is also +768k (ish)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could DFV $12 calls be the catalyst? They expire the 16th? Couldn‚Äôt that be some fuel amongst a few others to send this sykward?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Taking time to gain the reward is beneficial as it helps to save it when you reach it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If they do another short attack amd get it around 150 or lower I'm probably just gonna go all in. I'd sell everything else at a slight loss but it's ride or die.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think once dfv and others execute their 4/16 calls, is when shit gets real"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm a noob but, it doesn‚Äôt make sense to me that you‚Äôre using technical analysis when the GME rise to $300+ was not driven by technicals. It‚Äôs a hype driven meme stock. Sure the short squeeze was legitimate, but GME‚Äôs current stock value has to have far surpassed that by now. 

Or maybe I‚Äôm completely wrong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The success rate on these ‚ÄúGME is about to explode‚Äù posts is arguably 0%. No one knows when. Just buy and hold baby
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I like this stonk but every week there are a shit ton of these posts and we are still here. No doubt we will launch at some point but reading the same story over and over again, meh just keep hodl"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far no new retail or institutional buyers are interested, can't blame them the price is wildly inflated at the moment.

Until huge buys start happening there will be no spike, which means no squeeze (even though that's very unlikely given the SI).

Just don't see it anytime soon.  I think we yo-yo for awhile while bigger players and day traders make bank."

That‚Äôs all I can think about. Everyone who has made this breakout prediction up until this date has been wrong. But daily someone has a reason as to why the next breakout will happen and daily it doesn‚Äôt.

One day it will, one day it will be right, we will see. I‚Äôm not sure about most things as I don‚Äôt know a lot and won‚Äôt be doing my DD on this specific instance, but seeing these breakout predictions is getting awkward.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yus. Graphs and acronyms, I'm sold"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Doing TA on this is pretty much useless because  it is such a atypical situation
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD lines close to each other doesn't mean breakout is coming, it's just means that momentum and volatility are low. 

MACD is a lagging indicator, meaning it doesn't predict anything, you can use it to spot divergencies and that's pretty much it"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not done buying shares at these levels. Can the squeeze wait a lil bit longer?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done on the explanation of two things I really put stock into....NPI. I really hope they don‚Äôt dilute with more shares.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the stonk will do what it's going to do. Just HODL

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME To infinity and beyond!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So....puts?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I need to see a picture of whatever normal/not going to maybe moon is so I can understand the seriousness better. I‚Äôm not seeing any pictures of ‚Äúthis so what it is NOT‚Äù so it‚Äôs kinda hard for me to comprehend this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty clear it‚Äôs about to cup handle from the $220 spike just $20 left to retrace then spike
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another technical analysis using normal a metrics is like saying, ‚Äúwe all have a bunch of carrots, now if you look at how these oranges grow‚Äù

Here's a better ""when in doubt, zoom out"" chart to show what they are getting at in the big picture.

The big picture MACD is even getting ready to swing up, if not already doing so, to the signal line and RSI is also ready to head up off the 50 range towards 70. 

As we know, GME isn't behaving like a normal stock, but the indicators do look promising at this point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My ape brain can no longer take in any more DD or TA! I just like stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there. üêà

I just leave most cash in the US accounts that way they dont rape the 1.x% everytime there is a conversion as well. But take your time and check that the CAD is up a bit before doing so.

Not advice, thats just what I do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats how you get white hair and wrinkles lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have more that 1k or so to convert look into Norbert's Gambit if you don't know. Turns it from a stupid percent fee like 2% each way to a 2x normal stock transaction cost fee that's pretty much static for any amount, but it can just take a little time to convert."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be careful in placing hope for that interview, I can see HFs setting that up like earnings.  Get everyone's hopes up then focus on negative spin when it doesn't meet people's expectation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would buy that dip so hard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't need no catalyst. We apes are the biggest catalyst there is.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Power hour is 1-2pm ET, the interview will take place after markets close. But, should be nice for tomorrow (;"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What time?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying there might be a.... Fire sale? Be still my beating heart
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IS there a link?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,APES DON‚ÄôT PULL OUT!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,do you know where to watch it at??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either interview is going awful we‚Äôre getting another short attack lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm hoping for another discount. Got $500 to throw, trying to get as many shares as possible"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks simple jack!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want them to tank the price so badly! I have ¬£1k waiting to get in a fire sale!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,going full retard is the way! the only way! ![img](emote|wsb_emojis|tendies)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like they just signed on a few prominent people as growth executives from Amazon and Chewy. 

Could be very good news"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idgaf if they setup a massive short. Give me those shares a discount. not fuckin selling

P. S. I like the stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You HODL?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So possible sale on GME? I'm down for that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where did you see mention of no GME personnel in the meeting?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late. You already gone done it. You went full returd
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are a retard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly maybe the analysts are gonna say bad things while the hedgies sell it short
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I kind of hope they drop it again so I can average down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I REALLY hope they do...   Got my funds ready for the dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As far as this stock being not normal, any normal catalysts happening on the business side of GME will only lead to normal price fluctuations, like today.

The trigger for a squeeze would be somewhere within the Game of Shorts & Borrows.

Easy proof: there was ZERO business factor in the Jan gamma squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,üß†
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No it does not. And there are plenty of catalysts. Like 2 top-notch hires.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what time??? WHAT TIME GOD DAMMIT??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is correct I‚Äôll edit thanks for that
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I too learned something new today..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought RSI was what my wrist got whenever my wife was away...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought one more share today at 186.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Purely speculation: could be hedgies being forced to close out some of their shorts pre-month end? ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è IDFK, just a guess."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i like this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"98% inna da left, pop pop"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"**not fun fact** if you suddenly experience the above phenomenon seek medical attention immediately. 

* not financial advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People are obsessed with TA and it almost never pans out. If it were THAT reliable, don‚Äôt you think people who trade for a living wokldve scripted bots and dominated the world by now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a reliable pastime!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That should be a new euphemism for jerking off.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's arguable that these indicators provide ""some"" insight. They aren't that applicable to a stock as volatile as this. With so much manipulation it becomes even more unreliable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree but this stock is not the norm, it defies all odds. WHY because we are only buying and holding. A recipe that shorts never antisipated when they wrote nakeds at $19 then they did it again after the first run, this time the shorted it with a passion because the stock will never go that high again.

Oh boy!!!! Shorts this will be a monumental pile of pain if you cannot get out, just FLIP and go LONG while the stock is still CHEAP."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TA hardly works
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They do, just gotta understand news trumps TA. People still buy on patterns, but if it's a bad news day, nobody is pouring in the cash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to use technical analysis for a swing trade is like trying to predict the weather a year out anyways.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cause if and when it goes up, OP wants to be able to take credit as a genius lmao. We been seeing the same TA nonsense for weeks now"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,THANK YOU
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is gonna hurt some feelings here, but technical analysis is backwards-looking confirmation bias, nothing more. It cannot be used to predict the future, only used to explain why the past-present occurred. Not to mention, there's a billion different patterns to ""explain"" every movement. That's not reliable or future-looking in the slightest lmao. 

We live in an age where a tweet sends stocks up or down far more than any trend lines do.

Technical analysis is absolute horseshit and that statement is hardly contained to $GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It can give you an idea of how the stock is behaving and how ‚Äúsmart money‚Äù is looking at it. Right now, it‚Äôs behaving like a typical stock. Holding value and seeing a slow ramp into a sustainable squeeze is what we want - rather than a fast spike and drop last time. That  should/may/ideally allow the price to go a lot higher than the biggest spike we‚Äôve seen so far. 

A not-so-volatile squeeze would be the MOAS here. At least, that‚Äôs my understanding."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol glad somebody said it. If you look at any day over the last month it crosses constantly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD and RSI are the two most garbage indicators, change my mind"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep reading this. Why $200?

The only number I want to see GME break is $350. RH shut off buying when we hit $350 the first time and GME was slammed when we approached $350 it early/mid March. 

So I am not getting too excited until we breach $350."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I use RSI, MACD and VWAP. They‚Äôre helpful for intraday trades. Not reliable for swing trades. And for $GME - they‚Äôre fuckin useless."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how OP doesn't even mention his timeframe for his calculations. It could be like 5min and r/wsb wouldn't even know.

Hell, I just checked the 1D range and it isnt anywhere close to the oversold region."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Work
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You shouldn't be in this game dude. Selling shares to buy food? Sad man. Real sad. Worried for you.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BANANA CHEAP BUY BANANA
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't DD. This is astrology. Although I do agree with some points it's not because of TA. There is no TA for GME. There are no indicators for momentum. Because of the apes holding, every direction it moves will be with momentum. This is a short squeeze it will either rocket to andromeda or plummet to the seventh circle of hell."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My confirmation bias is through the roof.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And everyone clapped
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sagittarius is in ascension.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Please explain in great detail why someone else's calls expiring would be a catalyst for a stock price increasing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought the squeeze price is $1,000 per share? People here say that anyway."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't the boost in share price today due to new buy ins? How else would the stock price go up?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People need hope to hold on to something this risky. Confirmation bias gives them more hope.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it basically just yellow line above pink line= good?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not sure i understand. Can you circle a bunch of things in yellow?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I need john madden to do all DD from now on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except in Aztec basketball, the team with the most points loses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My personal guess is that it'll go down little by little to like at least $160 or maybe even $120 before another rally of hitting over $300.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,#Not at all.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§°
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Sir please place your jacked tits in the upright position, we are about to take off.*"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Averaged down from 333 to 191
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,211 gang
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking hell are you me?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs quite a lot of perseverance  and money
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged up from 118 to 250ish a few weeks back....only brought it back down to 235 last week. It is definitely more fun to watch the gains/losses when you have more shares though. Watching it move by a few cents and you get to see your shares jump by dollars is fun.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm down to $133 can‚Äôt wait to average üÜô to $250.... wait is that the wayü§î pretty good deal at least 4 times profit to $1,000 minimum per share. Math üßÆ checks out I think ü§™"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Average  üÜô then sell Higher at the ‚ÄúLunar GameStop Tourist Welcome Center‚Äù üöÄ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged up too but only because I have a gut feeling we are still at the base of the mountain here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,At least keep enough money to afford a van down by the river.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Averaging down is nice, but if you expect the moon, the difference in an average between say 130 and 180 doesn't much matter if you're adding to your position."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MOASS will lead to mo ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When it fell from 350 to 250 in that one second that day i couldnt stop laughing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,240 is after averaging down with this month's salary.. i was a 300+ gang from that last spike to 350...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,whos needs therapy when you have GME.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,its not really humor it was more like. holy shit lmao holy shit and then reading all the comments on wsb
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"im not just talking about stocks, its more like my mentality changed. It's boring when im making money, I like to be losing and chasing for a win. I have now turned into a risk seeker for the dopamine hit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i use wealthsimple =(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"AH i use wealthsimple, I heard I couldnt do it with them but i didnt do too much digging. Thanks"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"3PM New York time I believe, not so sure."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who‚Äôs doing an interview please???
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they meant Ja Rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,4-16 DFV exercises 500 c@12.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A good announcement gives the long whales a REASON to go nuts and buy. If the long whales just picked up tons of shares out of nowhere, they could be accused of market manipulation. I‚Äôm a retard, just my two cents"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm glad it‚Äôs settling at 180 then

Also: all these people talking fundamentals but can u explain to me why so many companies have doubled and tripled in the last 1-2 years.. how can a company like apple double in valuation over a year (64$ a year ago, now 119, or 2T) and people aren‚Äôt throwing the f word at them? Apple gained a trillion over a year and ur sitting here talking fundamentals? Get outta here with this shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's just one Amazon guy out of other Amazon/Chewy alumni already hired. The big news may not likely come until the empty board seats are replaced.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thx for reminding, I put in an edit just in case"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,PH is 3-4PM Eastern bud
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only way!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem, you‚Äôre one of the few people who actually wrote something for a technical analysis using the flair.  It‚Äôs ok, maybe not the best, but I would like to more technical analysis from you in the future, maybe adding some other technical indicators.  Maybe even look at a few different stocks, and see which one has the most clear technicals signaling up or down to then enter into either calls or puts respectively.


If you can consistently find good plays by analyzing the technicals, and can predict say 10-20% moves, you could hit a few ten baggers I would think."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good move
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You missed out buying at $203, then it's worth more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just thinking that if I were the DTCC I wouldn't want this to take off until I got my shit in order.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but every time it gets close to another catalyst they seem to do a massive sell and drive it back down drastically. I don't doubt that they're working on slowly covering their shorts and using the rest of their leverage over the market to mitigate their losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you're still looking at this like a normal stock. None of that is relevant here. Last time the stock didn't lose momentum because of smart money or anything normal. Robinhood shut trading down. 

The last several weeks trading within a narrow band for maximum pain. That's been orchestrated and fought out by big players. There is no technical predictive view on that in these hour by hour analyses. 

MACD was primed to go weeks ago. Then what happened? Smart money? Trader sentiment? No. Shorts began shorting ETFs in rampant fashion to drive the price down.

If there's any predictions it should be on how low these scum will go considering the SEC is content eating their a**"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This, wonder how they will react when it breaks 500 again I mean if all goes well the freaking MOASS could be tens to hundreds of thousands I mean they freaked out over 350 what would happen at like 5000 lol mayhem."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not sure if this still applies because I'm a smooth brain, but late last week there was some DD showing the percentage of ITM calls vs puts for GME. $200 was a significant breakthrough where the ratio of calls to puts ITM was strongly favoring calls (something like 70% calls ITM). The more calls that are ITM, the more upward pressure there is on the stock price."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most people are morons, they don't realize that just acting like an imbecile won't get them rich, it will get them working at Wendy's.  All the bullshit from these tards isn't helping their cause. They have no idea what is going on and when GME is up they are happy and when GME is down they are sad.  Even if GME moons they will end up blowing their money and then being broke and have nothing and still have to go work at Wendy's.

People pretend like it is a sure thing, then when they lose it drives them insane. They have no idea if they are even being played or not but all they can do is assume that they are special and the universe is trying to make them millionaires without having any real proof.

I bet they are already checking out Lambos to find out which ones they want to order. These people would get butchered in a real war. They better hope DFV, RC, and others can actually pick up the slack needed and not double crossing them or just gambling.

What amazes me is how people will believe so much shit without having any real proof of it. Someone shows an image and it 100% must be true of it reinforces their desire. Fucking lunatics IMO. I'm not saying GME won't moon, I'm simply saying most apes are actually retards and maybe if they learn to use their brains they might actually figure out a way increases the chances that GME will moon significantly. About 90% of these imbeciles seem to be able to only make irrelevant comments that only reinforce an unproven narrative(the narrative is not DFV's. If you bought in at 400 or 200 you are in a totally different ballpark). Some use TA like it's actually science when it's just BS justification, just a religion. A few others try to do DD and research but that is swamped out by the noise. All these imbeciles better hope the ""whales"" are not just corralling them for the slaughter but really want them to make some money(but you would think you would want some proof so you don't get eaten). No wonder why humanity is in such a mess, morons can't even have basic skepticism of their own beliefs."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have to eat
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most disingenuous comment iv read in a long time, I‚Äôm good bro"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If it plummets people will buy the dip and then we are back to square one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you considered the weaknesses of sagittarius? Namely inability to fulfill promises, lack of patience and lack of tact"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying 50.000 is a lot to leave on the table no 

Edit: or yolo 10mil on more shares"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But at what point does it become a blind following that hurts more than helps? That‚Äôs what I keep wondering after seeing constant repetition of logical analytic insight... but this stock isn‚Äôt ever going to follow a normal stocks recipe for success.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, it's the X's you've got to worry about"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,>usually
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly I don't think it'll go down past 175 anymore. It went back down last week and we rebuild and created solid walls where it will be hard to make people sell. This area is probably the new low 40 that we saw weeks ago. Traded sideways for a while and then boom again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thnk yu fr dis

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok I‚Äôve just googled this to no avail.  any link you can share?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a private meeting, nothing will be brought to public either way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it is a closed interview... someone answered with a screenshot about this. I am not sure but it looked like a screen from a Bloomberg terminal...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that would be so fucked and amazing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Translation, whales need a smoke cover. Apparently it's illegal to like the stock just for the sake of the stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying a ton of shares isn't manipulation though... Anyone can dump millions into a stock anytime they choose.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They long whales aren't buying unless it is to take part in the squeeze and sell for profit to reload later.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,196*
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is much more than double in the past year. Yes other stocks can get detached from fundamentals but the key is gme is a case where everyone knows why. It would be poor investing to get in at this price with the idea you won't sell if it spikes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, went full retard. Power hour is 1-2pm Mtn time. Never go full retard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs the plan! Of course I had to post GME first cuz this is WSB and the GME arc, but I‚Äôve been keeping very close eye on the TA indicators for AMC and PLTR respectively. 

Thanks for the positive feedback it really means a lot after the time I‚Äôve put in to educate myself since getting into the market last December. Maybe I‚Äôll post some more soon if time permits!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh for sure, you nailed it, it is a massive scramble to keep their heads above the water.

The beauty of it all is that they have the ""brightest"" and ""smartest"" with an arsenal of sophisticated tools and some serious $$ to pull it off but they cannot. WHY I AM SO SURE ABOUT IT.... the stock trades at $197. No SSR, they just cannot break it.

The thing that drives the market is dislocated with GME, greed and fear drives the market, it creates buy and sell, with GME there is only HOPE, BUY, HOLD, the physiological chain is dysfunctional.

Therefore I am so glad I am on the side where I know how much I can loose if it goes to $0, shorts have no idea how high this thing can go, we know how high... the hight I am willing to hold before I sell. 

NO one can force the longs to sell. Shorts on the other hand???"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stock market goes brrrr. Then power fluctuates, breaker trips. Then announcements about risk, etc etc"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly think it‚Äôs game over once we breach $350. That‚Äôs when RH was in the early stages of being margin called. 

If it‚Äôs similar to the VW squeeze we are looking at $30k/share. But that was only 15% short interest and the shorts were given a break. I suspect we will see prices greater than $100k. How high? No clue.

I don‚Äôt see how this doesn‚Äôt result in a massive market correction. I assume it will crash but, at a minimum, we should see a fire sale on tech stocks as funds are liquidated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha, ok, I remember seeing a similar DD recently. Not that I disagree (or have the knowledge to argue my point), but I see a lot of chatter surrounding ITM options every week. Each time we approach those price targets we start to see a massive increase in puts. No rocketing happens and then a new ‚Äúmax pain DD‚Äù comes out shortly after explaining how long whales didn‚Äôt want to rocket yet to bleed the shorts. 

I hope we are correct but we keep breaking $200 and nothing happens haha."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Then gambling shouldn't be a priority
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You're right. I don't give a shit if you eat or not. Hopefully you don't have a family though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm just saying TA is pointless especially with gme
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah k you don't know shit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,just buy low sell high I guess
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Traded at 40 for a long time and I thought I learned my lesson. Said I‚Äôd still hold but couldn‚Äôt buy any more because losing any more money would‚Äôve hurt too much. Boy was I wrong.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too unlikely too. Just paying $12/share to just own the shares outright is negligible if he wants to essentially maintain his position past the expiry date. They're so deep itm that he pretty much already owns 150k shares, the only reason he'd sell is to take some profit without scaring people since selling calls is less scary than shares, though he also has eight figs of cash so I don't think that's likely unless we double the week before."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The key point in the comment you're replying to is the ""not selling if it spikes"" part. The price is currently too high/volatile for anyone (especially an institution) to make a reasonable long term investment.

Buying now is a play on the squeeze, pure & simple. Even though we all like the stock & are in it for the long haul - really we're all going to try selling at the peak (most of us will miss it) & some of us might buy back in later. 

That's fine for us apes with our own money - but far too reckless for someone to do with someone else's money."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúYou are here by fined 10 shares of BRK.A‚Äù
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets," Europe's top markets regulator fined Moody's Corp . for breaching rules designed to prevent conflicts of interest with its largest shareholder, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc .

The European Securities and Markets Authority said Tuesday that it fined Moody's units in the U.K., France, Germany, Italy and Spain ‚Ç¨3.7 million, the equivalent of $4.4 million.

ESMA has special rules related to companies that own more than 10% of credit rating firms. The ratings company can't issue new ratings for companies in which such an investor is a board member or a major shareholder. The rules also require certain disclosures on existing ratings of companies in which such investors hold 5%.

Berkshire Hathaway is Moody's largest shareholder, with 13% of its shares, according to FactSet.

Berkshire Hathaway didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

""All the breaches were found to have resulted from negligence on the part of Moody's ,"" ESMA said. The regulator said it was crucial for ratings companies to ""eliminate or manage and disclose conflicts of interest to avoid interference by shareholders with the rating process.""

Moody's had ratings on units of Powergrid Holdings, a U.K. power company, and Munich Re , a German reinsurer, in which Berkshire Hathaway owned 10% or more or had a director, ESMA said.

In 2015 Moody's rated a ¬£150 million bond, the equivalent of $206 million, by Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) Ltd., the regulator said. Berkshire Hathaway was represented on the board of the unit and owned more than 10% of the capital or voting rights at the time.

"" Moody's Investors Service is pleased that this matter is closed,"" a Moody's spokesman said. ""We are committed to the integrity and independence of our ratings and to complying with all regulatory requirements.""

The largest part of the fine‚Äî‚Ç¨2.7 million‚Äîwas for Moody's U.K. operations. ESMA said it found 206 instances for 65 rated entities where the U.K. unit didn't provide appropriate disclosure regarding shareholder conflicts of interests. The regulator found 72 such instances at 36 rated entities at Moody's units across France, Germany, Italy and Spain.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They sell ratings for fees ...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Housing prices are preposterous.

The U.S. is printing money like crazy while also keeping interest rates catastrophically low.  It's almost like they just want everything to bubble and speculate forever rather than for painful corrections to occur. 

Almost."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For real. Shit makes you feel crazy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it only feels that way because you're looking now.

I would say it has been like this for about 25 years. (that's how long i've been looking)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How on earth does Moody's still exist?  How are they still taken seriously after the housing crisis?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there anyone not breaching conflict of interest rules? And also what's with the names of the rating agencies... Moody? Srsly? And standard and poors sounds like average and bankrupt...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For every million they're fined, they make 100 million in profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,4mil is just a drop in an ocean. It‚Äôs like Apple had to pay peanuts for battery issues with iPhone 6
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These fines need to be 10x at a bare minimum

Bunch of fucks. Here‚Äôs a spoon hedgies so you can eat my ass out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we get over the idea that so many people have that Buffett is a good guy? He's a total shark. He says in his book to buy companies that have a ""Moat"" meaning a monopoly/oligopoly. The basis of his investment thesis is to buy companies that don't have to deal with competition. His Clayton Homes unit provides predatory loans on manufactured housing to the poorest people in the country. Geico uses their financial power to shit on bodyshops and customers, destroying a once solid, family based industry. He fricking owns a ton of Wells Fargo, for gods sake. He says not to be against America, but his companies exploit average Americans as a normal course of business."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So ratings agencies, businesses who rely on being viewed as credible and ethical are neither of those things. Shocking.

Anybody who pays attention to these guys in 2021 deserves to lose their money. The internet exists. The information is out there. The ratings agencies are relics."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Err no, no it's not. Some of the american institutions have been collecting interest and businesses since before the civil war. They could shrug off 4b. Now 40b or 400b that would make waves because it would bankrupt smaller financial firms and their backers. Sends a whole new message to the big dogs. 

Don't burn the system down and we will let you keep being wealthy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To determine accident, in this case, you can look at if their rating was the same as other rating agencies (no bias, so nothing to gain). You can  look whether berkshire capitalized on that rating (did they issue any debt?). You can see if it was a one off issue, or it had a history of happening. Sure you can't prove mistake I guess. But you also can't easily prove malicious intent, which is why they usually resort to a fine. 

I don't see why a % based fine makes a lick of sense. Let's say a random employee at a restaurant forgets to wash his hands and the health inspector notices. If he works for a mom and pop store, the fine is $100  but if he works for McDonald's, the penalty is $1 million? That could be 10 years profit for that location because of one random employee's mistake. How could McDonald's ever stand to compete in this case? Why would a health inspector ever inspect a mom and pop store for pittance violations, when they can make bank harassing conglomerates for when they notice the 16yr old didn't wipe down the counters?

If a big business like Amazon wants to start a one off grocery store, why should the fines in the grocery store segment scale way the heck up because the owner of the grocery store happens to run another successful business (aws) under the same umbrella company? 



If geico ends up committing a massive rule violation unbeknownst to berkshire hathaway, should the fine be 100x bigger simply because berkshire also passively owns other companies as well? Yes, the geico fine will typically be a rounding error on berkshire's balance sheet, but that doesn't mean geico isn't also trying to independently run efficiently and doesn't care about fines. 

The punishment for a regulation violation should be proportional to the crime, not proportional to whether the perpetrator of the crime simply works for a large conglomerate or small business. 

If the rule gets changed to what you are hoping for, it would just lead to lots of ""separate"" legal companies and absurd legal waste. Plus perverse incentives for regulators to completely ignore little guys violations and only go after big guys. Just absurdly inefficient. Plus, if you base it on profits, if amazon has a good year in aws  the grocery store fine would be big, if aws has a losing year, the grocery store fine is really small? How does that make literally any sense because some employee forgot to clean the bathroom, or the  grocery store forgot to submit compliance paperwork to osha?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Either way 4b is a huge number for most. Yes the top companies could probably shake it off but most mid sized wouldn't be able too. 40b is a ridiculous figure that most companies would never be able to pay.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Absurdly inefficient"" when have these fines done anything to  clean up negligent companies. It's not even a slap on the wrist.

A cop pulls over a mom and pop shop owner and gives them a $170 ticket. They pay it and regret the fact that they lost a days profits. Same cop pulls over bezos he puts the ticket on some assistants desk and tells them to handle it.

Again flat monetary fines are rules for poor people. They literally do not effect the wealthy. If we want to see changes in the system there need to be changes for the punishments. Whether its through % based fines or sanctions people in power need actual punishments for fucking up. 

As for regulating bodies neglecting smaller companies and focusing on the bigger ones. That's not such a bad thing. Big companies should be under more scrutiny. They have more power, they should be more responsible. Maybe we won't have another 08. With the extra funding the regulators can have more staff and keep all companies, regardless of size under tighter scrutiny."

Do you honestly think it makes sense to charge mcdonalds 1m for a random employee not washing their hands, but charge 100 to a mom and pop store?

Do you think it makes sense to charge geico 100x the fine it normally would get, because berkshire owns a bunch of unrelated companies? Is this fair to geico in relation to its competitors who may commit similar rule violations?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know. Thankfully, I‚Äôm not in Georgia anymore and made a long term career decision.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Circling back to your McDonald's example let's say the fine is 1% that means mom and pop are making 10k... Hopefully it's part time. Whereas that 1 single McDonald's shop is making 100million. 

You're really saying charging 100/10k and 100/100m are the same punishment?

If I'm working the books for that McDonald's I'm going to recommend they not worry about alot of these little rules that just amount to monetary punishments. Don't waste time with health training. Bring sick employees in. You'll recoup that 100 bucks in no time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't answer your question because you jumped all over the place with McDonald's, geico and grocery stores. This is a sub for retards. Keep it slow. 

To answer broad spectrum though, yes. With adjustments.


A huge problem with modern society is people not paying thier fair share. It's seen as a badge of honor to skirt tax loopholes while maximizing profits.

Amazon could take a hit on all transactions for a month and still squeeze out those grocery stores. The same fine does not have the same effect.

Do you really think it makes sense to fine McDonald's the same amount as a mom and pop shop? It's going to effect the mom and pop shop way more than micky ds.

Hypothetically A makes 140k and B makes 14k. They commit the same crime. Thier victims are effected the same way. They are ordered to pay 1k. B is fucked while A is annoyed. If they were both ordered to pay 5% of thier previous years salary they would be equally affected.

Edit for your exact McDonald's example you would charge that store based on thier last year the same way you would charge a mom and pop store. So if that 1m was proportionally to 100 bucks... yeah... yes I would. Otherwise that McDonald's is gonna wipe every employees ass with that 100 dollar fine and it's a waste of time enforcing it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I know but it's not like the law makers care about that shit anyway
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oh man. and here i am in a town where 500 bucks a month rent would mean that you have 3 roommates all paying an even share

I might be impatient."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying both the individual mcdonalds location and the mom and pop are making roughly the same profits. You were advocating for the fine to be proportional to the corporate entity's profits, as opposed to the fine being proportional to the crime committed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's complete insanity. So if berkshire decides to expand into a new industry and tries to open up one restaurant, if an employee forgets to wash his hands, the restaurant loses 60 years of profits? Yes berkshire can afford it, but that segment of the business can't. They'd literally never try to open up the store in the first place, as the cost benefit makes literally 0 sense. Eventually a 16 yr old would forget to wash their hands. I'm dumbfounded anyone would think that's fair and rational approach to business law."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No they don't give a shit about fuck.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Multiple times I said it would be based on the physical location. Monetary fines proportional to the crime are a fallacy. If we make different amounts they are not proportional. They do not effect us equally. That has been my argument from the start.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First if we keep Berkshire and amazon from expanding into other markets and forcing out other businesses that's not a bad thing. Just because they have capital doesn't mean they should freely expand into other businesses and force out smaller companies. The rich get richer? That's you standard for fair?

Second a restaurant wouldn't be getting fined based on its parent companies profits. Retail type outlets (physical stores, restaurants ect) would be fined based on the money that physical location made. 

You really think the current method works?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry if I misunderstood. It's a very common belief that it should be percent of profits, and almost everyone here is arguing they should have been fined more when nobody knows how much the European corporate bond rating division makes. The implication of all these arguments is percent of profits. Some people in the thread even flatly specified 10x moodys profits."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"
>Second a restaurant wouldn't be getting fined based on its parent companies profits. Retail type outlets (physical stores, restaurants ect) would be fined based on the money that physical location made. 

But that's literally exactly what you're advocating for. You want a percent of profit fine for all of moodys, when it was only the moodys European corporate bond rating part of the business that had a regulatory error. The fine is small because moodys European corporate bond rating part of the business is small."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh jeeze 3 roommates. 

Yeah I lived like that a few years back. That's why I went with 300-500 college rent was 300x6 rooms after was 500x4.

Now I have a 4 bedroom house on an acre and my mortgage is 1k. I don't miss the city at all. Still obviously couldn't imagine living on 14k a year"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you misunderstood it just means I did a poor job explaining it. 

I said rounding error but thats hyperbole. If it was % based and they paid less I'd also have no issue with it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would hardly call Moodys retail but nowhere did I advocate for it to be a percent of thier entire profit. I merely said a percentage of thier earnings. It would be a more standard model that would effect everyone equally and encourage better practices. I also advocated for sanctions as an alternative. 

Hypothetically I speed because 170 bucks isn't really a big deal to me. For a minimum wage employee that's like 1% or thier yearly earnings. If I had to pay thousands for a speeding ticket I'd probably drive pretty fucking slow. Instead the government has convinced me to slow down with a sanction. If I get another ticket I'll be ubering for a year. That keeps me in check until October when the record gets wiped clean. I'll be good for awhile but I'll slip up and start speeding. If the fine was % of my earnings and I had to pay thousands it would be more effective. 

Flat monetary fines are literally the lest corrective rules."

>I would hardly call Moodys retail but nowhere did I advocate for it to be a percent of thier entire profit. I merely said a percentage of thier earnings. 

Well you specifically said % based and a rounding error on their balance sheet, and what I thought you said is a very common belief. You also have literally no idea what profits the European corporate bond rating component of the business makes, and they don't publish their balance sheet, so how do you know if 4m was a rounding error for that segment of the business or not?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. That rent actually seems pretty reasonable. City by me has 250k houses renting out 4 rooms for 2-2.5k total for all 4 rooms.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Advocating for a change to systems vs one specific example. Obviously some firms could end up pay less others more. There would be rules on when a parent company is liable and factored into the equation. (McDonald's example they wouldn't be able to sperate thier ice cream business from the burger business).

FYI this isnt a new idea. You can look into it. The idea of flat fees is inherently unjust."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"250k houses! what a dream. its totally tempting to move to a city with rock bottom pricing like that.

i mean to be fair youre not paying 2k for a house, thats for the basement suite. but you're usually allowed to use the back yard a bit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I mean they're old houses not much to look at but where I'm talking about is where every young person in like a 2 hr radius likes to live or party so there's that. Bar on every corner and such. Right across one of the great lakes from you guys.

Cool concept if they can nail it. Small aircraft, controlled via AI, powered via solar panels, can take human passangers around regional airports very quickly. Goods could even be placed on empty flights used to reallocate planes across airports. Something likely unprofitable unless optimized out the ASS which is cool to see Palantir being the ones to make the purchase.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Great. Thanks. I had to look it up and now I'm doomed for eternity. Palantard in?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, but Palantir is not a fund and it's too small and niche to behave as a holding company or conglomerate. This is really bad news."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are you telling me that you have actually researched PLTR's business structure and the quality of the software it is offering and had bullish opinion, but decided that because the company acquired a minority stake in some startup, you are gonna pull out? I actually like the fact that they have proactive approach, PLTR is cash rich, I do not want the company to have 1 billion dollars just sitting in a bank. Also have in mind that Thiel is considered to be one of the best investors in history and is nicknamed King Midas by his colleagues."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long too and was doing some options on the side, but this news and the article below are making me stay away from it:

https://investorplace.com/2021/03/pltr-stock-suffers-from-no-competitive-advantage/

It looks like Cathie can't articulate Palantir's value prop, and SPLK is now investing more on R&D than PLTR is. And now we know where the money is going."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not pull out, reduce the size of the position. Palantir is a long term investment which is currently burning cash at a fantastic rate. I would prefer it if they keep lots of cash on hand until such time as they are profitable because if they end up needing to raise more money in the future they will have to do so by diluting their existing shares.

 This investment seems unnecessarily risky since they don‚Äôt actually turn a profit  yet. I could understand making investments in companies that have some connection to their core business (like say a company that had invented a better database or something) but I am not impressed with them acting like a venture capital company buying in on someone‚Äôs private placement right before they go public with a SPAC."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This article is complete and utter bullshit. PLTR has no competitive advantage over its competitors? Palantir software is so unique that the company basically does not have any real competitors. On some occasions , U.S government agencies gave the contracts to PLTR without following normal procedure( allowing differ.companies to submit offers) , cuz they stated that no other company meets their criteria( no one except PLTR can do what they want). Furthermore, BP said that PLTR's software allowed the company to cut its expenses by 50 percent and Airbus said that since using PLTR they were able to cut its production costs by 30 percent.Do you really think that their product is not valuable, take into account the fact that both companies are paying PLTR more than 100 million dollars per year combined?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if the average driver was expected to fly a helicopter. Flying cars will never exist or be used the way regular cars are now because most people are incapable or unwilling to put in the time and effort to safely fly.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was a great comment earlier talking about how this can reduce the amount of supply variables that one of its major contracts, Airbus, has to go through. Theil wouldn't spend that much money without a guaranteed ROI, plus potential to gain market share/efficiency with other similar companies if they commit to PLTR software (vertical integration)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You have your reasons for it and that's OK. I was a firm believer not long ago and at some point had 1000 shares and options. I happen to know how the sausage is made and can tell you that their software is not magical. They have a charismatic CEO and great deals with customers and customer success stories to tell. I was betting on them to continue rising, but they didn't recover from ER and the lockup expiration, and seeing them squander their attention on other things is not a good sign for me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't care about the guy nor the publication, the details in the article are verifiable. Actually, Cathie stresses that this is a long term play and doesn't care about profitability now. This is not a good sign for those looking for better returns now. If PLTR remains a good investment, it's probably not for wsb tards."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"**Updated [graph w/ channel](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) as of 2:48pm**

It‚Äôs been testing the support since noon so don‚Äôt be surprised if shorts are fired and the price dips. It‚Äôs all part of the game.

**Update 12:58pm:** It‚Äôs broken the support twice since posting, but quickly re-entered the channel both times. CCI(20) dipped to -200 and quickly topped 230; volatility is picking up from the past hour, with volume up from noon as well. Usually GME has stalled out on low volume past 11am-noon so this is a good sign. Hoping to close around $190, last time we closed above $190 was 3/18.

**Update 1:12pm:** Volume has picked up and the [price has spiked](https://imgur.com/a/Qbob22C) to $195. A breakout point in the channel would be around $197-$199 in the next 10 minutes.

**Update 1:45pm:** With the support being tested multiple times and the quick shoot upward at 1:10, it was beginning to look like the trend within channel had been broken. However, it seems as if the support is still holding as it dips right now. Expecting a reversal and upward trend in the next 10-20 mins because of the very negative CCI. If we reach $200 today I expect a lot of shorts to be fired, possibly even closing red. Hold on folks.

**Update 2:07pm:** Seems like my hunch about a reversal was right. Closing in on 200! Let‚Äôs see what happens. Right now 200 is within the channel, but I could see the channel quickly becoming irrelevant if we break this milestone. After all the channel is just a rough estimate of where to expect the peaks and dips.

**Update 2:32pm:** We brushed $200.16 at 2:29, though I am surprised to see the lack of a major dip. It may be too early to say. A wild guess of mine is that with the recent liquidation of HFs and today‚Äôs good news, shorts may just be running out of bullets, considering today‚Äôs steady growth and lack of major dips. But who can say for sure. Definitely a significant day for GME.

**Update 2:44pm:** Now comfortably sitting at 200+. Volume will likely pickup and I don‚Äôt see the channel holding for much longer with the added volatility. Remember, we can‚Äôt save our friends in the 200s if you paperhand now. Patience!

**Update 2:47pm:** Currently [testing the resistance](https://imgur.com/a/hIdAWAz) for the first time today along the 200s.

**Update 2:57pm:** Looks like we‚Äôre staying in the channel still. Current descent doesn‚Äôt look too significant, wouldn‚Äôt worry about a large dip unless we fall below $195, a couple dollars below the support right now.

**Update 3:12pm:** Quick dip below support. Seems to be rebounding with $195 being a new floor of sorts (2:10-2:20 shows this). Market data showed a lot of buying pressure at $196. Whether this holds the rest of today or not, only time will tell. I wouldn‚Äôt dismiss the possibility of shorts being fired before close.

**Update 3:18pm:** Buy the dip and hold on! Wee!

**Update 3:29:** Last update before any remarks at close. This current dip seems to have little momentum, with $195 being a loose support. Expecting some upward pressure right before close if we stay stagnant."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a self fulfilling prophecy at this point. Take RSI for example. No serious trader would enter into a position when a stock is over 70 RSI because that‚Äôs a sign it‚Äôs over bought. Well once enough people know that they‚Äôll cut and wait for the dip. Well now people are selling because of the indicator so the indicator works.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It is. Especially for GME as its more options driven and the volume is in bursts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I always think of it as reading tea leaves. You see in it what you want to see and that can be dangerous. At the same time it can help you focus and think deeply about the status of things.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so when do i get my own crystals?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> horoscopes for men

Nah because at least with horoscopes the constellations actually exist. It's more like dowsing, where the person who is walking the field decides where the rods point.

Like horoscopes and dowsing it's all completely bunk of course - a glance at L2 will tell you more about what's coming than any technical analysis ever would."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it makes its own reality because people (and I expect machines) are trading with it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Even if it's complete bullshit it has a net effect on the market and is actually predictive if a great enough portion of market activity is based on it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"its just dumbass bullshit people on twitter post about to seem smart. It's like Kanye West...he tries to sound smart and to idiots he does, but most people know what he's saying makes no fucking sense."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So is there still a chance we close red? Or not anymore?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah,I'm waiting 170 to drop another grand on it."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The cock and balls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mostly right. A lot of DD I see using multiple indicators on this strange stock seems to be borderline conspiracy. However, I had marked the channel since 11:45 and it‚Äôs held within for the most part, so it seems to be a good guideline of where to expect the dips to bottom out. I would also check my reply below where it seems that GME held within the same channel the last 90 minutes of yesterday."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And you would be doing so with very little to show for it. GME today has tested this support line 9 times so far, and has tested the resistance 3-4 times. If you project the channel onto yesterday you can also see that the same support line in the same channel was tested 3 times yesterday after 2:30pm.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the argument for TA that TA supporters always give is that if enough people believe in TA it will work

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo man, dowsing is real and it works. I know it sounds ridiculous, but the only ridiculous thing about it, is that it works."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah because the machines know people actually believe this stuff which makes those traders *highly* predictable so you can beat them to whatever they're going to do.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You're the best. Never change.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I never claimed to be an expert in anything lmao. It‚Äôs WSB dude. I noticed a pattern and it was fun to keep up with. Getting so pressed over reddit...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not doubting you or your knowledge but every time ppl try to guess what is to come, the stock takes a deep dive or it climbs up really fast. It doesn‚Äôt have any patterns and its artificially inflated but we both agree its gonna go up"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Admittedly TA started by studying patterns and probability. It‚Äòa similar to black jack. Would you hit on a 16 knowing there‚Äôs a 30% chance you‚Äôll get a 10? Would you buy into a stock when it‚Äôs showing signs of being overbought?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TIL TA supporters have the same mindset as orks from 40k
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't tell if meme but in fair testing scenarios it has never once been shown to work. Not unlike technical analysis - it's probably not the lines on the graph but the other information you know that may make you a successful investor despite also doing technical analysis.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are. So stop telling people that the price is hitting $10k when you don‚Äôt actually know what you are talking about.

Remember, 92.5 percent of gme shares are owned by banks, institutions and hedge funds.  This whole thing going on is them making money off each other.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technical analysis means nothing for GME, because institutional investors can do w/e they want and break all resistance on a whim. TA works best for natural securities that have grown organically and actually has support and resistance that isn't artificially created by a few large holders, not for a short squeezed stock like GME. It's a ticking time bomb. 

The sell wall is also massive for GME atm, not to mention the ridiculously disproportionate puts to calls ratio this week. The banks are really trying to milk the retail investors with options. Never letting it get too high, and not drop too low so they can thetagang to collect premiums. Just buy shares and hold."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,3800 shares of UWMC here...stock is so cheap and undervalued I'm thinking I might as well round up my holdings to 5k shares.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here! I‚Äôm all in for this dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could I get a quick breakdown for this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me be clear. I got in at the low 8's and am averaging down. It's 7.83. It's all about your entry point my man. I see juicy returns as this is severely undervalued.

As for Eviction and Foreclosure moratoriums. We're not really seeing that right now, especially with stimulus. However, if it DID happen... That means more housing inventory in a market that has a severe undersupply of housing inventory.... As grim as it sounds, it may actually be beneficial."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have any additional information to elaborate that statement?

I‚Äôve only heard people talk great things about their personal experience with them.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for the input. I appreciate the reply. I hadn't seen your DD. New to the sub.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy didn't even read UWMC's financial statements. [They listed the amount that is already borrowed ($6.9B) under the lines of credit (the total available lines of credit totals $12.625B) as a part of their liabilities](https://ibb.co/g7S0qnw). OP is literally twisting the financial statements from UWMC to suit his own investment interests.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term I could see it returning to 9-10 eventually once the dump phase of the PnD runs it's course. Trouble is, there's a lot of uncertainty in the markets right now and there's a significant risk of pullback of the entire market to raise liquidity to cover losses in other sectors (just look at viacom). That makes looking at historical support levels (like 9-10 for uwmc) ... risky. Past price is not an indicator of future price etc. etc.

Combine this with opportunity cost (e.g. ignoring meme stocks, things like Viacom, discovery, apple seem to be trading at local minima), I wouldn't take this bet - but I do understand your argument. Good luck!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think any form of ultimatium is good for any business, hence I don't like UWM. And it's not going very well so I'm not alone thinking that :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape, strong together. April 16th judgment day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly and I will. I still have faith in the stock and especially the company.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was going to roll them next week if I have too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,mine are down 90+ percent too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold if you can. Hopefully it shoots up soon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is, you need to look at their mortgage servicing rights (net), mortgages at fair market value AND cash and cash equivalents. Those are all their listed assets. And they say their total listed assets at the end of Q4 2020 is 11.493B.

I made a decision on this company based off factors that were important to me, but I can understand opportunity cost.

""Derivatives
Derivatives are recognized as assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets and measured at fair value with changes in fair value recorded within the consolidated statements of operations in the period in which they occur. The Company enters into derivative instruments to reduce its risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates. The Company accounts for derivative instruments as free-standing derivative instruments and does not designate any for hedge accounting. Interest rate lock commitments (or ‚ÄúIRLCs‚Äù) on mortgage loans to be originated or purchased which are intended to be sold are considered to be derivatives with changes in fair value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as part of loan production income. Fair value is estimated primarily based on relative changes in interest rates for the underlying mortgages to be originated or purchased. Fair value estimates also take into account the probability that loan commitments may not be exercised by customers. The Company uses forward mortgage backed security contracts, which are known as forward loan sale commitments (or ‚ÄúFLSCs‚Äù), to economically hedge the IRLCs. Refer to Note 3 ‚Äì Derivatives for further details.""

""Mortgage Loans at Fair Value and Revenue Recognition

Mortgage loans are recorded at estimated fair value. Fair value of mortgage loans is estimated using observable market information including pricing from current cash commitments from government sponsored enterprises, recent market commitment prices, or broker quotes, as if the loans were to be sold currently into the secondary market.

A majority of the revenues from mortgage loan originations are recognized when the loan is originated which is the primary revenue recognition event as the loans are recorded at fair value upon origination. Loan origination fees are recognized as income at the time the loans are originated. Interest income is accrued at the contractual rate, unless collectability is uncertain. Loan production income also includes the unrealized gains and losses associated with the changes in the fair value of mortgage loans at fair value, the realized and unrealized gains and losses from derivative assets and liabilities and the capitalization of MSRs.
Loans are considered to be sold when the Company surrenders control over the financial assets. Control is considered to have been surrendered when the transferred assets have been isolated from the Company, beyond the reach of the Company and its creditors; the purchaser obtains the right, free of conditions that constrain it from taking advantage of that right, to pledge or exchange the transferred assets; and the Company does not maintain effective control over the transferred assets through an agreement that entitles or obligates the Company to repurchase or redeem the transferred assets before their maturity. The Company typically considers the above criteria to have been met when transferring title to another party where no substantive repurchase rights or obligations exist.""

""Mortgage Servicing Rights and Revenue Recognition - Sale of MSRs
MSRs are initially recorded at estimated fair value. To determine the fair value of the servicing right created, the Company uses third party estimates of fair value at the time of initial recognition. Subsequent fair value (measured for subsequent impairment purposes) is estimated with the assistance of an third party broker based upon a valuation model that calculates the estimated present value of future cash flows. The valuation model incorporates market estimates of the estimated market prepayment speeds, discount rate, cost to service, float value, ancillary income, inflation, and delinquency and default rates.
 
MSRs are amortized in proportion to the estimated future net servicing revenue. MSRs are periodically evaluated for impairment. For this purpose, the Company stratifies its MSRs based on interest rate. Changes in the estimates used to value MSRs could materially change the estimated fair value and any valuation allowances required. Management records a valuation allowance when the fair value of the mortgage servicing asset strata is less than its amortized book value. Valuation allowances are recorded as a temporary impairment to the affected strata effectively reducing recorded MSRs and incurring a charge to operations. Valuation recoveries are recorded in subsequent periods. When a mortgage prepays, the Company permanently reduces the associated MSR in the period of prepayment with a charge to operations.
Sales of MSRs are recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to a buyer, and a substantive non-refundable down payment is received. Also, any risks retained by the Company must be reasonably quantifiable to be eligible for sale accounting.""

First, you absolute moron: Holding Mortgage Servicing Rights are a hedge against higher inflation, because prepayments are lowered, and thus the value of them is heightened.

Second, you absolute moron: ""The Company enters into derivative instruments to reduce its risk exposure to fluctuations in interest rates.""

That is why they have lines of credit. They take that money to originate the loan, and then sell it off. And repeat. "" Warehouse lines of credit play an important role in making the mortgage loan market more accessible to property buyers since many mortgage bankers would not be able to attract sufficient amount of deposits that are necessary to fund mortgage loans by themselves. Therefore, warehouse funding allows the loan originators to provide mortgages at more competitive rates.[\[2\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warehouse_line_of_credit#cite_note-2) Unlike in other types of lending, loan originators earn more profit from origination fees rather than interest rate spread since the closed mortgage loan is sold quickly to an investor. ""

There is a **reason** that when Rocket had its Line of Credit increased, it was seen as a **good** thing. It was widely seen  as a sign of heavy loan volume, and that they needed more money in their credit facility line to originate even **more** loans to take market share, as well as get more revenues (and therefore net income).

It differs from a fixed payment or term loan that has a guaranteed balance and payment structure. Instead, the payments of revolving debt are based on the balance of credit every month. Interest payments are calculated likewise; payments are based on the interest rate and balance and are often computed daily.

Let me reiterate:  [Warehouse Lending Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warehouse_lending.asp) \->  Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its [origination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination.asp) to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.

Just stop, i'm not going to keep responding to you. You don't know what you're talking about, and what's more, you don't understand the industry you're speaking about.

Edit:  Honestly. It's just even dumber that you think that the line of credit to originate the loan on the mortgage isn't collateralized by the, you know, house before it's sold off on the secondary."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Best bet is to ignore the rkt fanboys. It's crazy how much time they spend bashing other stocks. Good luck on the investments.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,None of this shows that it isn't a liability. A line of credit is a liability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean this one?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A balance sheet is a snapshot on the exact day. In this case December 31st. However, these facilities are used ultra short term (a few days). Furthermore, their collateralized and sent off or sold directly on the secondary market. 

Much like a bond. You add to the assets and liability sheet on the -balance- sheet. However, it's net neutral. The interest is where you lose money. Here, it's actually not the same, except as stated it's  a credit for the ultra short term (a few days). 

I would really recommend reading this:  [Warehouse Lending Definition (investopedia.com)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/w/warehouse_lending.asp) . It explains it in a clear and understandable manner.  I would really recommend reading it all, but this portion is a relevant portion:

Warehouse lending is a line of credit given to a loan originator. The funds are used to pay for a mortgage that a borrower uses to purchase property. The life of the loan generally extends from its [origination](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/origination.asp) to the time it is sold on the secondary market either directly or through securitization.

The repayment of warehouse lines of credit is ensured by lenders through charges on each transaction, in addition to charges when loan originators post collateral.

As well as this:

Warehouse lending can most simply be understood as a means for a bank or similar institution to provide funds to a borrower without using its capital. A small or medium-sized bank might prefer to use warehouse lending and to make money from origination fees and the sale of the loan rather than earn interest and fees on a 30-year mortgage loan.

In warehouse lending, a bank handles the application and approval of a loan but obtains the funds for the loan from a warehouse lender. When the bank then sells the mortgage to another creditor in the secondary market, it receives the funds that it then uses to pay back the warehouse lender. The bank profits through this process by earning points and origination fees."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you knew this when you made this meme, but in case you don't, there's a fan theory that John Candy is actually Satan in this movie, and that Mrs. McAllister is actually ""selling her soul to the devil himself,"" as she says earlier in the scene. Legend has it that if you go to a crossroads and offer to sell your soul to the devil, he will appear and grant your wish. Mrs. McAllister is at an airport (a crossroads of sorts) and offers to sell her soul to be with her son on Christmas. John Candy shows up, and grants her wish. In true Faustian bargain form, her wish is granted, but her family actually arrives right after she does - she never needed to make the deal at all. Likewise, if you go to an airport, and offer to sell your soul to Satan, he can make GME fly to an incredible price. Unfortunately, you will have a bad deal, as GME was already going to fly to an incredible price anyway."

Game stop has 69,940,000 shares outstanding with a float of 45,350,000, so that leaves you with 24,590,000. Now this is where it gets interesting...    
With that box office hit plus the IV that Home Alone went through and unrealized gains, based on the ‚Äúestimated‚Äù gross (not taking into account the hedgies that said it wouldn‚Äôt make it) you would plug a simple calculation from here.    

HAGross/((GSSO-GSF)x10)=current share price

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve had nothing but undying hope for going on 40 years. I‚Äôm still here, still holding on"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He literally said he don't have a timeline and there are no guarantees either
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Like as an editing tip or do you mean you don't like hearing the audio? Because I like having the original audio and also reading the funny meme part.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oh man just wait until u/theroaringkitty hears he got real-life tweeted by u/deepfuckingvalue
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"dude DFV is the OP, it‚Äòs his second account for memes"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody tell him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§£ü§£ü§£
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,also on his youtube
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many duis
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Weren't they all booked too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,but also because of his fat balls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôre a GME holder I‚Äôll marry you too bro

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Grew up there. 10/10

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I was there when the first great dip happened. I came in at 400, making everything trying times."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,at this point i averaged up so much that 40$ would financially ruin me. would still suck dicks behind wendys to buy more and average down again though.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't believe some ape just stole DFV's OG memes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, obtaining his level of success would provide him ""third person reference to himself"" privilege... so not inconceivable ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|joy)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Selflove is important
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs been his entire message all along
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV has always been a value investor that likes the company and the stock. It‚Äôs not his role to hype a squeeze, it has never been and it certainly isn‚Äôt now that he‚Äôs having class action lawsuits brought against him for the January mess. 

There are other investors that are squeeze-oriented and focus on that, you can find plenty of their DD. 

Don‚Äôt blame him for keeping up the same line he‚Äôs had for more than an year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly right.

He mentions that we are close to the fair price, which is the goal."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">cost basis

IT COMES DOWN TO PATIENCE AT THIS POINT IF DFV CAN HOLD IN MILLIONS OF  LOSS SINCE LAST YEAR I CAN ALSO HOLD TILL THIS SHIT  LANDS ON THE MOON"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The dude literally posted his portfolio going from $50 million to $15 million. That‚Äôs the biggest loss porn you‚Äôll ever see in his sub.

And then he doubled down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs mentioned in the meme, but you obviously completely misunderstood the context in which it was mentioned."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People under the age of 25 really shouldn't be allowed on the internet. Has a more tear jerking feel good family movie since Home Alone and its sequel ever been made. Don't think so.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh man. So many great movies! Candy died just a few months before I graduated from high school (early '94). Hit me just as hard as Farley's death just a few years later. God the time flies.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,and the bus is slower but accomplishes the same ü§î
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did somebody say R.V?!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"hell yeah, brother. Where do I sign up?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good God, my rent is gonna go through the roof."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,call yourselves the Meme Street Posse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me add, they have a hotel/indoor Waterpark, beaches (great in July/August), tons of outdoor activities and incredible food, if you are willing to forfeit an artery or 2"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There are dozens of us! (NE Wisconsin represent)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good call. In my DD I go into how next week's mayor race is going to swing the city into a better direction.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its a smallish city in ne wisconsin, south of Green Bay, north of Milwaukee"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I grew up in Plymouth, can confirm, we also called it Shebaghdad."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lived practically in New Glarus for a bit. 

But man Spotted Cow is horrible... Their limited edition sours and every once in awhile that IPA or APA was on point. But you're better off going to Madison and MKE for good beer."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Now I wish I hadn't given my free award to DFV.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IM ALREADY IN SHEBOYGAN.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is a cheboygan michigan too. Spelled different sounds the same.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Da baby
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh to be this naive... 

ü§ó Here's a hug for you, ya big ole ape."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That would reboot the simulation
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,oops.  tweet from roaring kitty.  meme from roaring kitty.  lol at me.  note to self:  roaring kitty = roaring kitty.  (and i know DFV is roaring kitty).  im not even hung over or high.  do i need professional help?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was confused as well
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really into fat balls, but I like cats. Is he a cat?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He has 0.004269% of a share. Make sure you drag a wet floor sign behind you down the aisle.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I hope they don't stay trying for long in that case!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not what apes want to hear about now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wanted to highlight this. 

In DFVs original play a short squeeze was (basically) non-existent and he always vouched for the deep value in GME. 

If the SI% which is thrown around and the probably massive FTDs/counterfeit shares theory are correct, it doesn't matter if DFV says anything about a short squeeze. If we get to the ""cost basis"" (aka ~$500) a short squeeze would be inevitable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"DFV's primary objective right now isn't to screenshot himself making nine digit profits, it's dodging the narratives that paint him to be a market manipulating cult leader."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guess I‚Äôm just a retard right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right on the dotted tramp stamp
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TO THE MOON
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Currently in se Wisco. I try to get to sheboygan a few times a year, as well as door county and boulder junction. We are so lucky with what we have in this state"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appleton, standing by."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeaa buddy! Thats where im at go pack! haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, why do we care about sheboygan?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now if it is a Saturday and we had had a few high lifes, it was Shavegas, if you were cool with bringing home a 3 ü§£"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Living here I hear you. Spotted Cow was great, when i was 22, but good god, its a shitty light beer with 'some' flavor"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the fun fact!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is not at all confusing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you look at the account comment history - this is definitely a real DFV account.

edit: though I‚Äôm not sure if you were implying the guy above him was trolling or if the account is a fake"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's okay. :\]

You're what the French call 'les incompetents.'"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre in this sub, you need professional help just like the rest of us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He belongs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahah it happens, I didn‚Äôt know he had this account until he posted the eminem interview meme on here ü§£"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you just need to sit down, breathe deeply, and sip on some cool DD."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh you sweet summer child
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay I Believe You, but My Tommy Gun Don't"

https://youtu.be/mXnJqYwebF8"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha no idea why people downvoted you, just look at his post history this is literally DFV‚Äôs second account."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He deserves the nine digit profit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, lemme explain it to you then.

Kevin‚Äôs mom represents the apes who are impatient and freaking out that the squeeze hasn‚Äôt happened yet. She‚Äôs saying that she‚Äôll even sell HER loss porn to get to her destination if she has to. 

John Candy represents DFV, obviously, telling the ape to calm the fuck down...we‚Äôll take a slower form of travel but we‚Äôll get to where we need to be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,TO PLUTO
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm down in Chicago currently but yeah I get up when I can (originally from Greenbay area). Lucky to have access to one of the best coast lines in the country IMO.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this is the animated cow girl that sings im not a cat... 

Edit: not the version i expected."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cause he used retard in a negative context
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But what I got from this meme is that 'where we need to be' is the stock's fair value... not the moon, not $10k, $1k etc. My feeling is DFV is telling us not to fixate on a possible squeeze (missed flight) but slowly move towards the fair value which he thinks will be more than the current price..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah fuck I'm dumb.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You clearly don't understand the fundamentals here. Over 100% float shorted. Apes hold price high. Hedgies pay interest. Company turns around. It never goes back down to a point shorts can profit. They have to cover. That's it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But he never specified what he thinks fair value is.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A little slow, you might say. There's another word, thats on the tip of my tongue"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,choo choo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last finra said 14% SI, no? Bloomberg owneship mostly has data from December and we make assumptions based on the the rule where they have to report if their ownership changes more than 5%/10% in a month. I'm trying to find concrete evidence of there being enormous short interest. If there isn't, this will not moon as high as we want it to."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the casinoüòÇüòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,UWMC is gonna come back with a vengeance.  Buy that beautiful dip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry for the hard loss dude. I also lost a good amount on RKT/UWM calls. Thats why options game is a tough one... you are fighting against time, and time always wins. You 10x your risk gains/losses when you play with options.

Here is some helpful tips; 

\-If you like the stock long term, buy option LEAPS, and give yourself time for the position 

\-""Short Squeeze"" is not the norm, run ups and excitement are... always do your due diligence on everything, make sure it makes sense

\- If you buy an option that expires within the month, try NOT to hold it for more than a day. Theta will burn you before you make any profits

\-Don't believe everything a retarded ape tells you"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Options aren‚Äôt always the best option...just sayin
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Sorry ape. You‚Äôre not alone I also made some RKT and UWM gains to then double down on UWM and lose a good chunk of it. This is the way.

######edit oh there is no volume with DISCB"
2021-03-30 19:39:56,wallstreetbets,"ABCL DD First time post, but wanted to bring more attention to a biotech stock that I personally love.

ABCL is not a biotech company, nor is it a pharma company. They want to be both, they want to make data, make drugs, make new scientific discoveries, they want royalties, partnerships, research. This company has huge plans and is in the right spot financially to make it all happen.

Check out their earnings:

ABCL [(Link to Earnings)](https://investors.abcellera.com/news/news-releases/2021/AbCellera-Reports-Full-Year-2020-Business-Results/default.aspx) TLDR its fucking massive, its a phenomenal report. 800 million on hand with Little debt with the debt at 0% interest. *0. F'ing. Percent.* [(Link to pretty color ppt from earnings call)](https://s26.q4cdn.com/359178033/files/doc_presentation/2021/3/AbCellera-2020-Business-Update-(March-29-2021).pdf)

ABCL has huge potential to become a **massive juggernaut** as a biotech/pharma company.

Their antibody discovery platform allows them to rapidly discover therapeutic targets and push them into preclinical development. This is best demonstrated by the development of Bamlanivimab, where the antibody went from unknown to discovered product to clinical trials in **60 days. 60. days.** Typical drug development takes years on average and they had a covid drug in clinical trials by the summer of 2020 after starting discovery efforts in late winter.

Let me start a new paragraph and reemphasize this shit ***60. F'ing. Days***. Thats the definition of industry disruption, to introduce a new product that drastically improves and decreases development time is huge. I fucking snorted the crayons (orange you tards any other flavor isn't worth the time) out of my nose when I saw this, full disclosure I work in the industry and we can't fucking match this.

And since I know most of you can't read, here's a couple bullet points your partner's girlfriend or boyfriend can read to you tonight:

* ABCL 2020 Annual Revenue was $**233,155,000.**
* ABCL 2021 Q1 Project Revenue from one income stream AKA Bamlamni-60fuckingday-cumfasterthanyourpreeteen-vimab is a minimum of ***190,000,000, more likely over 200mil.***

Their projected 2021 Q1 revenue is essentially their whole entire year in 2020.

Now during the earnings call one investor had a decent slightly stoopid question of what about when COVID is over. Ladies and Gents sit down and shut up. COVID is projected to be endemic for the decade if not forever, it is here to stay. Which means COVID drugs are here to stay and here to generate money. The CEO made sure to point this out, also that ABCL is not a fucking COVID company. They many projects in different fields of therapeutics (oncology, animal health, nerve regeneration, etc) and they acquired a company called Trianni last year. A humanized mouse model company that OTHER companies will use for research and drug development.

&#x200B;

If my retard summaries above weren't enough check out the historical short volume data. If you wanted squeeze potential, ABCL might just have a bunch of lemons so find some fucking sugar, ice cubes, and water. Might just be drinking some lemonade on the porch of your 100 year old dilapidated Southern Style farm house porch  of a home that you bought with 5% interest with a waived inspection and no DIY skills to speak of.

# TLDR

I like the stonk. Not a financial advisor. Just a smooth brained amc holding ape.

ABCL 380 shares and counting avg 34.70."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, sounds good. But im gonna wait like 2 months for the hype to die down and for this to drop down a bit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate the DD. I was surprised to see such a positive earnings. Most biotech IPOs have shit financials and highly speculative. I'm looking to buy in after it stabilizes a bit after the report.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Revenue was higher than expected but earnings was much lower.

The risk here is on COVID - where the vast majority of their revenue relates to. It is unclear to me how their revenue will fare once the disease is under control."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They‚Äôre just consultants.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,one thing I didn't mention is they sneakily dropped that they have a new COVID antibody 1404 that is in preclinical development with Eli Lily with a predicted clinical trial start in Q2 and they expect it to work against all variants of COVID. Definitely something to keep an eye out for
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah big part of why I feel pretty bullish even as a ‚Äúbag holder.‚Äù Probably a good idea to see how it performs I like to watch a stock for a while before jumping in, note they IPO'd at $20, so its hard to see it getting below that and it definitely looks like there is a huge fight to keep the price low right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree a current strong reliance on a single source at the moment, but Covid isn‚Äôt under control. The industry predicts a strong international COVID presence in the near/mid if not long term future. Short term we can expect a strong revenue stream and for the future there should be more info coming out about other projects already being executed on."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs false, they aren‚Äôt consultants and they plan on manufacturing their own therapies in the next few years as soon as they can get facilities built."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Specifically about COVID-19, even though their process isn't about that particular problem:

Isn't the rollout of vaccines destined to moot all other COVID-19-related biotech projects? People aren't getting hospitalized after a vaccine, so it's one-and-done for controlling the biggest problem of the disease: lethality. Not sure if the post-vaccine contagion study results are out yet, but guidelines are already set for vaccinated people being reasonably safe in exclusively vaccinated company.

I just don't see a cash cow in fighting a problem we already seem to have the solution to. Forgive my ignorance."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just read up their site. It screams consultants to me, but wtf do I know."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Covid drugs account for only 2 out of 103 programs that Abcellera has under contract. They are fighting way more problems than just Covid. It just happens that Covid ended up as their first go-to-market, think of it as a proof of concept. 

To put it into perspective: Abcellera spent few months in early 2020 narrowing down the right solution for Covid treatment. In return for this 2-3 months of work,  not only did they get paid for their time but they received $198 mil in royalty revenue. Abcellera will continue to receive more of this recurring revenue for as long as their client (Eli Lilly) sells more of the drug. The potential of this revenue model is huge. Abcellera gets to share in the benefits of a successful drug without taking on massive investment risks that come with new drug development (those are borne by their clients)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While vaccination will reduce hospitalization, it will likely still be necessary to treat patients with Covid. Vaccination is not a cure nor is it a treatment and internationally vaccination rates even in the midterm projection are not going to reach a point where Covid will be ‚Äúover‚Äù. And as the media fear mongers circulating variants, (for good reason) vaccine efficacy could drop.

Basically a treatment will be necessary whether it‚Äôs from regeneron or from abcellera, and vaccinated or not the sooner the treatment is administered to a patient the better the outcome."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure you can call them consultants, consultants that bring in leading technologies and data sets. The key differentiator is their revenue model - they get paid for their time AND they get paid for milestones (their client's successful clinical trials) AND they get paid royalties for as long as their clients sell the drug that was developed with Abcelleras help. The last part is huge.  It's a brilliant revenue model, what you're seeing in this ER is just the beginning, based on royalties from one drug only."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd love to hear more of your insight so if you could elaborate more on your previous statement it would be greatly appreciated. I also understand the consultant designation and it has truth to it but I disagree with the negative conations your three word statement gives.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you. And If I recall correctly its lifetime revenue of a products lifecycle. So as long as a therapy such as bamlanivimab is sold, ABCL will receive a percentage (25? maybe more?)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Consultants provide a service. The only differentiator would be there attempt to partner with other companies. Coming from a dot com background their whole site is just a bunch of fluffy bullshit from my perspective. 

So they are seeking partnerships with established biotech/pharma in order to profit off royalties. These established entities typically have existing high quality R&D capabilities.

Therefore, whatever it is they offer has to be incredibly unique. I‚Äôm not seeing anything that stands out. Doesn‚Äôt mean it doesn‚Äôt exist. Just means I don‚Äôt see it from where I‚Äôm standing.

I see a company claiming they are going to change the world by selling consulting services to big corps. And if I want to make money, how does that make me money? How do you value that? They get some royalties? Do they own the property? What‚Äôs it worth?

And as one of those big corps, I‚Äôm asking myself why I‚Äôm not letting my own people work on this and why am I outsourcing this?

And as for the COVID nonsense, I don‚Äôt see their name up there with J&J, Moderna, Pfizer. 60 days, for what? Where did that go? Now they might start trials in Q2? A year too late?

Sorry, i ain‚Äôt seeing a reason to buy, at least not now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the reply! I'm going to address a couple points that I think could use some clarification:

Seeking of partnerships with establish biotech/pharma in the industry is a pretty standard practice. Abcellera is a young company and quite frankly if they weren't doing this it would be  concerning.

The key difference here is the high quality R&D capabilities. Yes companies like Roche, Gilead, J&J, Pfizer, Takeda, etc have great RnD but it takes a huge investment in time as well as money to produce drugs.

Abcellera's work is geared towards drastically reducing those costs, and as a result their partnership agreements result in revenue sharing rather than a consultant fee. This is also why in their list of disclosed partnerships you see Eli Lily, Regeneron, Gilead, Merck, Sanofi, Pfizer, Lyell, Novartis, Bill and Melinda Gates foundation. You're right these big companies do ask why  would they want to work with Abcellera. The truth is the majority of these companies if they stuck to their traditional target discovery models would not need Abcellera. But they don't want to and Abcellera fills a space/need that might save them millions in time, money and infrastructure at the most cost intensive portion of their research.

This is the unique product/service they offer. In 60 days at the start of the pandemic Bamlanivimab was discovered and identified as a neutralizing antibody and taken by eli lily (among other antibody candidates) into pre-clinical work. A lot of other work like moderna's was based on SARS data from the 2000's, work that has had years to reach the point where it was able to be developed into vaccines for a different disease, LY-COV555 is all SARS-COV-2 for the disease target COVID-19.

As to how they make money or a stock holder money, that really is dependent on the negotiated partnerships. If they are all like how the current FDA EUA balmanivimab/etesevimab deal is structured then the revenue stream will be fairly strong.

As for the covid nonsense.

The Abcellera developed antibodies are not vaccines, they are treatments. Moderna, Pfizer, J&J drugs are not being used to treat active disease.

Bamlanivimab was already being distributed as a treatment in the US, its being distributed as a combo with etesevimab (eli lily partnership), and is in the process of being approved for distribution in the european markets with is expected to occur sooner than later.

The Q2 trial start is for a new antibody being named 1404 which is different from LY-COV555 aka Bamlanivimab. And the publicly disclosed statement on it from Abcellera durings the earnings call was they expect it to perform against all circulating variants in the world. At this moment in time we do not have that, it is a severe medical need that is projected to be necessary.

I don't know if its time to buy shares or not but this company has amazing work, its got huge potential and I don't think its  a company to dismiss. Thanks again for your reply!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I appreciate the lengths you are going to get into this. I‚Äôll keep it on the short list. But right now, I‚Äôm an old skeptical fart that isn‚Äôt seeing anything special about it."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sure they ain't just freaking each other?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think people are afraid of mortgages b/c they know the market is in a bubble but this time is way different. The banks have effectively already been bailed out by the covid stimulus plans and even when we do have some foreclosures (which we will in the next several months) the housing market itself is strong and RKT and other banks will get their money back instead of having to sell for pennies on the dollar like in 08. At least that's my personal take on the matter.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME helped too and I still have a single share to watch it, but I'm tired of trying to time the market. Less stressful to find a few food companies and just hodl."

I read that they may have some unsecured debt in addition to their mortgage port which scares me. I'm hoping someone else will do a legit DD on it at some point, otherwise I may be digging into that this weekend."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Facts. Never know when it‚Äôs going to take off or if the engines gonna fail again. Just like Starship üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just think its a shot in the foot by limiting brokers on who they could go with, rocket is a giant. Gilbert basically owns detroit lol ill put my faith in RKT, if UWMC takes flight then ill give all those bulls a salute and congrats lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm long RKT for their growth potential (digitizing the mortgage experience will get a lot more market share), but also that RKT is very careful with their lending. Their 10-K shows an average credit score of 756 for loan production and 740 for loan servicing. Their delinquency rate is 4% even with covid forbearance.

For a value play I actually also bought some PFSI, which is the 3rd largest mortgage company that no one is talking about. Their ratios are way better than UWMC and RKT, with P/E of 3.18 and almost trading at book value. Their loan portfolio is more risky than RKT though so I probably won't hold for a long time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think they can both coexist. I know they're battling by UWM trying to reject anyone who does business with RKT, but ultimately there are going to be people (millineals) that want to do everything online w/RKT and there will be people (boomers) that want to deal with a real person (UWMC) for one of the biggest purchases of their life. Went ahead and sold a single UWMC csp to at least start the ball rolling. Either way I'm gonna enjoy the ride until July and then reassess."
2021-03-30 19:26:32,wallstreetbets,"Hertz could become the next GME because of all the Melvins shorting it Because Hertz's bankruptcy protection status is well known, everybody knows that there is an extremely high chance that the shares will be cancelled.  **The stock is worthless and that's exactly why it can go to the moon**.

Because the stock will go to 0 soon, a lot of hedge funds are shorting the stock thinking that it is easy money.  But as Melvin Capital learned from Gamestock, some short selling strategies are extremely dangerous.  If they bet on a stock going down and the stock price goes up instead, they lose money.  If their cushion of margin runs out, they have to start closing out their short position at a loss.

# The cost of borrowing Hertz shares indicates that short sellers have piled into this short

Anybody borrowing shares of Hertz through Interactive Brokers has to pay **26.33%**.  The actual borrowing costs that short sellers pay is somewhere between 50-100% of that figure because they usually go with somebody cheaper than Interactive Brokers, so the actual borrowing cost is something **higher than 13%**.  (\*Technically, IB rounds the share price up to the nearest dollar and the 26.33% is applied to that number, so the cost to borrow at IB is much higher than 26%.)

13% is a really high interest rate.  Stock indexes have only gone up 6-10% historically.  The reason why borrowing costs get expensive is because too many people are trying to short a stock.  Because the supply of shares being lent out is less than the demand from short sellers, the borrowing cost shoots up into the autistically expensive range.

https://preview.redd.it/l4wbu14r46q61.jpg?width=748&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=696a4a9c72b00593fcf1327bd9f7fe5253107c4a

A lot of short sellers piled into Hertz increases the chance that there are dumb Melvins piled into Hertz.  The Melvins of the hedge fund world take on too much risk.  They are the dumb money that contribute to short squeezes.  When their short position moves against them too much, they will start buying the stock and cause the squeeze to get even bigger.  (They buy the stock to try to get out of their short position.)  Then they realize that they've been outplayed by a bunch of autists posting dumb memes on internet message boards.

# Things that normally prevent short squeezes from getting out of hand

For most stocks like Gamestop, Nokia, etc. there are going to be institutional investors who buy the stock because they believe that it is a good investment.  If the stock then goes up 3X, many of them will sell their stock because it has hit their price target.  That kind of selling usually causes a short squeeze to end, which is what we've seen in Nokia.  As the autists and Melvins fight it out, the institutional investors step in and put an end to the party.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/83hp9ddd96q61.jpg?width=433&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bd78aacfbdab79695d06b6336eba8345b079b6db

Gamestop turned out a little differently because all of the institutional holders eventually sold everything and got flushed out that way.

Institutional investors have probably all cleared out of Hertz for two reasons:

1. The vast majority of them aren't allowed to hold pink sheet stocks.
2. Everybody thinks that Hertz stock will be a zero.  The bondholders will take over (or whoever the bondholders sell to, e.g. [Knighthead + Certares](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/hertz-gets-4-2-billion-113503798.html)) and the shareholders will get wiped out because there isn't enough money in Hertz for the shares to be worth anything.  In the unlikely event that a bidding war breaks out, then maybe the shares could be worth something.

So if autists and short selling hedge funds were to have a short squeeze battle in this stock, it's unlikely that institutional investors step in and drive down the share price with their selling.

# This is not an investment

The stock is almost certainly going to 0.  I have no position in Hertz and neither should you.  I'm posting this just for entertainment value.  If you're the kind of person who is willing to lose money to try to wreck hedge funds... this is for you."

Do not ruin your good DD's with cheap next GME promises."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks that are ""almost certainly going to 0"" do not get short squeezed. Think about it: if you were short such a stock, why would you buy to cover, ever?

At IPO, they thought the company was worth 3bn. That means we‚Äôve given the company 8x more credit than the SPAC after 1 year. These aren‚Äôt sustainable valuation levels IMO. I mean I‚Äôm not ballsy enough to bet the other way on this, and I do think they will remain market leaders, but the business needs to catch up to the valuation before I see significant room for growth.

2021-03-30 18:25:23,wallstreetbets,"$AAL - The American Airlines Degenerate Gamble - AAL Trade Thesis What‚Äôs poppin‚Äô fellas, hope you‚Äôre all doing well. I‚Äôve got a short little trade thesis that I can‚Äôt get out of my mind due to how odd it is, and was looking for some second opinions on it. Reposting this due to it getting removed yesterday.

&nbsp;

In my spare time, I‚Äôve been working on a few tools to help me with my trades. I‚Äôve been working on a program similar to CheddarFlow, which analyzes a shitload of options data, performs various forms of analysis on it, and then alerts me if there‚Äôs anything funky going on which could help net me some easy cash. Earlier today, my program notified me of [this order](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/809296545936965642/826183106280554556/e436fbf7bcda456a57af24d40e19487d.png), which I found really odd, due to the entire nature of it. $50,000 worth of 0.04 cent AAL options hitting the wire expiring this Thursday. This trade alone isn‚Äôt that crazy since it could‚Äôve been made due to a multitude of different reasons, but shortly after the order was caught, I got alerted that [government officials](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/794766298373423136/826220503492067368/5c6356221adb7155516c01780601cb6f.png) were also picking up shares of various airlines.

&nbsp;

So now, things are interesting. We got crazy volume on an obscenely stupid OTM AAL call option expiring this Thursday, alongside government officials swallowing shares of various airline companies. What do we make of this? Does somebody know something? I‚Äôm not entirely convinced that this isn‚Äôt a crazy coincidence, but the contracts are literally the same price as a scratch ticket coming in at 4$ a pop, so it‚Äôs not like the overhead cost to play is that high.

&nbsp;

I initially thought that this play may have been a hedge for an insanely large short position, but the stock volume, combined with the insanely short date on the purchased options says otherwise. I also thought that it could be part of a janky ass multi-legged options strategy, but my program already checks for that, and upon manual inspection of the data, I also couldn‚Äôt find anything. What the fuck is going on? **If anyone has any ideas, theories or relevant helpful information on the topic, please share!**

&nbsp;

**I‚Äôm not trying to bullshit anyone, this trade is likely gonna go straight to 0 well before Thursday rolls around.** That being said, coincidence or not, the circumstances surrounding it are quite enticing. To those traders who are addicted to FDs, or have cash burning a hole in their pocket and want to YOLO on something, I feel like this trade is the one to go with. For the same price as a scratch ticket, this trade provides us with comparable odds.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If she started an OF where she just takes stock certificates of GME and drives around to different Gamestop locations and takes pictures in front of them, I'd buy that."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's simple, if actors who pretend to be journalists on tv dont agree with your investment choices, or the decisions of multibillion dollar companies, it's obviously everyone else who is wrong.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Honest question: is there a different wsb-like sub that doesn't have all the GME stuff?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep rolling your eyes son, we‚Äôll be rolling in tendies"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all the same with 90% of boomers, they're too stubborn and stuck in their old ways to understand the huge potential for rebound and exponential growth that GameStop carries. They don't get the gaming craze and don't see money in it, so when $GME blasts off to the moon, I and I'm sure a ton of other apes that grew up in the era of GameStop are going to shit on them. Let me tell you I cannot wait for that day. Suck it you old boomer farts!"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely nobody, including people in their 20s, have told me anything positive about Gamestop unless they're paying attention. I don't get the boomer hate. I mean I get what it is, but I don't get why."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But Shitron research said 5 reasons why it was going back to $20... I wonder what he is thinking now.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want bumper t-shirts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And this is the negative shit that will be reflected on the media. Not all the positive shit WSB has been doing. They will laser focus on comments like this. Keep this as an inside thought for now my friend.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Also as a none-American it‚Äôs shocking but fun to see a dude high on cocaine on live tv talking about finance. We don‚Äôt really have that here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's famous though, he even cameo'd in the first Iron man with his tv show. And in Wall street money never sleeps

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well to be fair, Gamestop has just been kind of a dying company for years.  I do think Ryan Cohen can turn it around, but I don't think the average person will really get it until they start to see some actual changes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't hate boomers and I don't hate people in their 20's who don't pay attention. What I do hate is a boomer paid to be in the know about the market and is too smug to admit he's absolutely wrong about it because he hasn't been paying close enough attention
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a boomer, and I love the stock.

Ok, this is simple, loyal customers who support a company, grew into adults, who still love the company, they may not even shop there much anymore, so now the love translates to buying stock in the company they love.

Buy Stock in things you love.

Diamond Hands Boomer"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because we are hitting in the market by doing exactly what they were told not to do by their financial advisors. Advice they pay thousands for.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,but shitron were not stupid enough to carry on playing. i have some respect for them for that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FACTS BRO!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn bro thanks for telling me!!! I‚Äôve had people reach out before and say that and I was like I have no idea I can see it just fine! I have a iPhone 12 ProMax and was damn!!!!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,She probably likes loss porn more
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries!! This was super interesting. I didn‚Äôt even know this could be possible. 

I still don‚Äôt know how it‚Äôs possible lmao. 

Sick combo btw!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i was literally about to ask what TV you had since it looks so bright on my phone!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly...you‚Äôre welcome , have a great time cleaning it up‚Äîwarren buffet"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Winning take, I think.

To the average person nothing *has* changed, and I don't think either awareness or sentiment will move much more until there are concrete changes to something more customer-facing than upper management.

When I'm buying electronics the company's financials or internal politics only ever enter into my considerations if it's either a a stupidly niche/specialised product, or one my purchasing power only barely allows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own some GME from all this and love video games. I do not see how they will insert themselves with players like Valve and the Microsoft Pass. People keep saying they will pivot to digital, but they are gonna be boxed out by like 4-5 Shaq type players."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Which is what makes it, if this take is right, a value play."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's just as likely he's well aware of what's going on and is hoping to downplay things as he is connected to the HF's shorting it. It's like politics... they'll go on TV and give bold-face lies in hopes of saving their own ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking my kid to GameStop was an absolute treat. How can anyone hate on something that gave any child so much joy? I'm not a big gamer, but helped her grind Pokemon, so I want to save the company for the kids now having their own kids who get to go to GameStop as a treat. Damn the hedgies for trying to steal that from us."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do it üôÉ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I want it tagged here when you post it bro üòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe that‚Äôs why people say they can‚Äôt see my videos sometimes and they say it loss on desktop but not mobile? Crazy! I wonder if there is a setting I should switch! I literally record it from my tv and post it lol

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Really saw that movie dozens of times, can't remember him"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,odd that the main concept of investing which is buying what the company will be; not what it was. That straight from the boring investing playbook.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if they're daft enough to think they can actually beat those guys at their own games (heh) right out of the gate. They can't, and they know it. 'Pivot to digital' is such a generic, ambiguous phrase it's borderline useless.

That said, the 'digital space' is nowhere near saturated. There's room for thousands more players yet, at the very least. One thing that comes to mind is fleet leases; develop the know-how of tech enthusiasts on the production floor (and product managers' offices), combine it with some deals with federal government and OEMs for discounts, then become known for actually educating America by providing hardware that school districts might actually be able to deploy (because maintenance and ensuring supply and uptime, etc. can be prohibitively expensive at scale).

Disclaimer: not involved professionally in any of the fields above, so pinch of salt and all that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like the play here, is above and beyond selling games e-commerce wise. But it is a stream of course."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While I agree that the Ms pass is hard to compete with,  new releases usually don‚Äôt go there straight away. 

With Valve, they already had prior sales deals in place (I would assume for the Steam credits they sold) so being able to sell digital games through Gamestop could be in the cards as well (Steam codes). 

Now don‚Äôt quote me on specifics, this is just speculation as far as games go. They can still sell a bunch of things as far as E-commerce goes. Collectors editions, limited editions figures or anything else video game related could do very well in the e-commerce space. Since currently there isn‚Äôt really a dedicated online platform where you can buy all things video games (this week they started selling GPUs and immediately sold out obviously)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not if their main focus remains on buying/selling consoles. GameStop should see a very good q2 if Sony can stock PS5s appropriately.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Totally, agreed either way. He's either ignorant or complicit and I'm not sure which is worse."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My sentiments exactly!

My kid who loved GameStop is 30 now, he is holding his own GME stocks now.

We had fun when he was 9, we are having fun in the stock market now...and damn the shorties."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't remember where in the movie it was, but I watched it a couple of days back and jumped when I recognized him. 

It might have been a clip from this, around a year before collapse of Lehman Brothers. Watch from 2:30, where he starts talking about journalists not knowing as much as hedge fund managers, but wanting to pretend they are 'in the room'

https://youtu.be/BVl9SQ-KVmE"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Most folks aren't invested in the stock market though, nobody teaches you shit about it growing up unless it was your parents really. What's basic to so many of us who do invest is like useless trivia to so so many others."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is as vague as ""Pivot to digital."" Some weird cult like stuff here now. I was in for the short squeeze cause math, but the only thing I know for sure now is that major players don't have to show their hand like the rest of us do."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My opinion is that he's dismissive of the woman in the room. I can almost hear the mansplaining he's holding back, but he'll settle for eyerolls and knowing chortles. ""Well, well, little lady, aren't YOU just the smart little girl, looking at your laptop"". Makes me want to throatpunch him."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Aw, thanks for the award! My very first! :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does it have to be cult like?

I mean, maybe they don‚Äôt take it this direction. Maybe it makes no sense to many. But I just feel like there‚Äôs a place for a gym equivalent type of place for gamers. Couple this with partnerships, and exclusivity deals on a few features that incentivize coming in to the experience.

If this was achievable, the number of hours people would spend there would further bring in more revenue. Paired with the whole friend crews hanging on the regular. 

This is speculation, but like I said, I think it‚Äôs something achievable, the bet in this case is that it is achievable, and there is a market for it. 

Remember, gamers are quite rabid about all the IPs that currently have the hooks in them, which, tbh, even though the perception of gamers is a more reclusive one, people would undoubtedly find common interests with others. And if things like that happen, those formed groups could potentially be spending a lot of time in this sort of place. Buying merch and more."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just feel it is cult like. Your statement is what I am talking about actually. That isn't a business plan and I have yet to see anything from this new amazing board they have put in place that resembles anything actionable. I don't see a big revenue stream coming since what you describe is going to attract younger people with less money. I am in their target demographic for sure, but I don't know what I would buy from them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because you don‚Äôt know what you‚Äôd spend for at GameStop doesn‚Äôt mean there isn‚Äôt a market. The inverse is true too obviously though. 

And of course my comment isn‚Äôt a business plan‚Ä¶I‚Äôd call it a potential narrative. Like I said, I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs going to happen, obviously there is minimal indication that something like that would at this point in time, or it‚Äôs feasibility for that matter. 

Obviously if there was concrete proof of this kind of thing, it would polarize the stock in that, some would think it wouldn‚Äôt work, and others would think it would.  Which would be reflected in the price. 

But this is the idea really with any stock and future potential earnings and what not, and whether whatever proposed business strategies are priced in or not already."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I shouldn't have added the spending part. I should re-iterate they have lost money in the last 4+ years unless there was a console release. Their market cap is crazy high and they basically have to realize what you state to justify that price/cap. So if you like Gamestop that is fine, but very very unlikely to be a good investment. It contains to much risk and not enough upside given the current price."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There was blow-back supposedly about privacy so this makes perfect sense from PLTR's perspective. IMO, PLTR is a long game anyway, you ain't gonna make money in a couple of days, well, not real money. It's also flagged as a ""reddit stock"" so it gets shit-kicked around, but that will eventually fade out. I'm holding 9k shares, and I'll clue you that covered calls are your friend. CSPs probably work too. I'm not giving in on PLTR and I don't give one fuck what some analyst/entertainer says. I didn't read the article..."

**My trading journal from Friday 3/26**

**MORNING 07:00-12:00**

First thing we need to do is to setup our charting tools, I would recommend Tradingview for their free yet powerful charting tools having thousands of community supplied indicators.

https://preview.redd.it/9e536ycn06q61.jpg?width=1673&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8d0e4d631c33ccd0baf71e6db44a754f7b70a8cd

Next we need to open our trading chat group, to get synced with the general pulse of the market, though not as important as TA , it's at least useful so that we don't feel as lonely during trading.

Whoops, Michael is yapping about some personal matters, something about a block sale at his neighborhood. He was this preppy kid I know from high school, he moved to NY to work for some rich dude named Goldman. He said he works as a prime broker, I think that means he's flipping apartments in NY. I'm gonna pm him privately to remind him not to post personal stuff in the group. I  open up my dashboards, and see that there's not much going on. This is very important for beginners, you don't have to be in the market all the time, look for a high probability play before you open a position. Let's just wait patiently until the technicals tells us to enter.

**MIDDAY 12:00-15:00**

Michael spamming the group again with his nonsense, I'm just going to ignore him and open a chart

https://preview.redd.it/u0hy7nat06q61.jpg?width=1641&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1870c9155e18f2b195b5be6d9073fec3237f46e0

Using my favorite indicators of support/resistance, MACD, VWAP and MA cross we can see that this is a clear indicator for a downward move in VIAC according to the technicals, I open a short position here.

2 hours later...

look at that, the TA predicted the exact moment VIAC will drop. Let's close this here, take our tendies and chill while we wait for another play.

&#x200B;

**AFTERNOON  15:00-16:00**

https://preview.redd.it/oaq044xy06q61.jpg?width=500&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9f03aa90bb5daf00d99b911f88c697c34430c1aa

For those that don't know, MOC stands for masculine of center, meaning lesbian/trans people that are masculine in nature. Michael is considering a sex change operation and it looks like he has just announced a mysterious donor that is about to make a big donation to his üçÜ chopping support group. This is not related to trading in anyway, but it's kinda fun hearing about Michael progressive activism. As markets are about to close, lets look at the chart again, this time let's pull up the SPY

https://preview.redd.it/3hha25f016q61.jpg?width=1632&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a44d401e72b863c90fff719775e7bfd60019acc0

Yep definitely we can see an upward movement potential here with the RSI  going up over the purple area and resistance being tested, let's go long here into the close

https://preview.redd.it/q5l5m3j116q61.jpg?width=1640&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c866e21ff30b2bb117e09df144a5ca82089af1cf

And like clockwork, It rocketed up, man look at it go. TA absolutely nailed it once again.

As Ken Griffith once said, advances in technology have enabled real time information and advanced charting techniques to be available to the retail investor, levelling the playing field with institutions.  You just need some crayons and join Goldman's prime brokerage chat group, which absolutely anybody can do right ?

**Remember, if you can't trade profitably using TA. you have to be either lazy or stupid or probably both**

Tune in next week where we will be reviewing the differences between a Crayola and a Wonder Stix and how each will effect your trading style.

Edit 1: I can't believe I have to explain this, guys that was the actual screenshot with accurate timestamp from a GS's VP for BWIC (Bid Wanted In Competition) when they were liquidating Archegos, proving that like Hans Solo, GS did shoot first leaving the other IBs holding the bags.

Edit 2:  Well..., turns out all those smooth brained jokes wasn't so off after all. Apes this post is to highlight the difference of what a retail trader using TA sees and what a prime brokerage client sees and the resulting cause and effect on the price. Puts on K-12"

horoscopes are beyond retardation, they are scam. i wonder when you're going to post your udemy course."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The idiots in here can't read so forget about teaching TA or fib retracements.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't teach anyone technical analysis you just stroked your ego though? MACD, VWAP and MA, how about explaining to the noobs what they are, what they mean, and how the work together to point towards a break in resistance or direction of momentum in a stock.

Honestly feels like an ad for trading view"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You talked about TA predicted the exact moment/price, but I can't figure out what moment you are talking about. Could you add values to the text so it is comparable to the chart, would help the beginners :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Every time I‚Äôve seen someone post some TA trying to predict something in the future, it‚Äôs always been wrong. The only time it has been right is when someone like OP posts TA for yesterday. It‚Äôs easy to cherry-pick successful results that have already happened."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apparently im both lazy and stupid because nothing I do can match the screenshots.  Unfortunately, I cant even post a screenshot of what us wrong, but one thing I do know is I am unable to find the support/resistance indicator.  Also, I have no idea how to select a specific section of a chart for analysis, the entire chart has all the colored areas.  Do you have any recommendations or alternative ways of analysis?  I did experiment with alternative methods, such as MACD strategy, and it seems promising, but I have no idea if its useful for day trading or not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man.  Informative post about TA, showing it works, and progressive friends?  The perfect combo.  Tell Michael I said hey"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Noice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does TA stand for?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Whats that green and blue rectangular indicator?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Awesome thx
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe the request was for more ‚ÄúT & A‚Äù but I guess TA works too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hhaha well done :)
 Dont anyone explain it to the idiots pls!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's cool. But the issue with TA and price action trading is that, either you naturally get it or you don't. There's a lot of intuition and mental models you have to assume apart from this.

Some people have it instinctively and some struggle a lot."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only one percent of day traders are successful, and most who are don‚Äôt beat the market. The real question is what differentiates them? Laziness and stupidity? Its a very poor explanation and shows that you don‚Äôt actually know what makes you different."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like how 90% of the time when someone is serious about their TA they will still qualify it with ""this will probably happen"" because they still know deep down that TA is bullshit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA is fake, you can do better via astrology"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah great except TA is horseshit
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recommend ""a random walk down wallstreet"" to anyone believing this BS.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i tried the indicators on gamestop and I feel like unless a movement up or down has passed it all looks the same.  How do you tell what way things are going in the actual here and now?  Trying to figure this out as best I can
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Orang Indo bro?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's where we got out GME money from, thanks tho"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,See unfortunately it only works for the past...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're assuming he did it today, all he did was link some screen shots of trading view. His set ups were absolute nonsense. The spy was up a dollar on the day it looked like had 6 green bars into hitting resistance 3 times and hes like ""this is a buy set up yep!"".

This guy certainly is not a profitable trader and has little idea what hes talking about, using a TA that blips above a purple line for 1 minute is not indicative of anything. And I hate to shit talk him cause there are real things you can gain from using TA. But this is beyond non sense. 

&#x200B;

tldr: The line moved an inch above the purple that means parabolic break out!"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the hard part but I see you‚Äôre a natural
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well did you wait for the line to touch the purple? Cause that means price is about to sky rocket.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">The idiots in here can't read so forget about teaching TA or fib retracements.

i think he did that immediately after typing the title lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This was a total joke of a post. But you‚Äôre prob just downvote farming so whatever
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn‚Äôt look like VWAP is even on his charts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was really interested when I read the title and then the actual post is just total - look at my successful trades bullshit, with no actual insight or useful explanation of how the TA provides insight into the price movement"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah he didn‚Äôt touch on risk analysis/management at all, only what happens when he‚Äôs right. What kills pretty much any new trader is the inability to quickly cut losers. Also don‚Äôt trust traders with chart themes like OP, looks like hes used TV for week max. Also noob traders love to think they can predict when something goes down. I‚Äôve only done this shit for 7 years, but its still so easy to spot someone who just got into it and thinks they are an expert."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"MACD = Nonsense

VWAP = Nonsense

MA = Average of how it move

If I have to listen to andrew mo money talk one more time about how GME's vwap did x, or how were testing the 170 resistence. Its like hey dumb dumb we were 350 dollars 2 weeks ago and 40 2 weeks before that. If your such a progamer at indicators why didnt you buy in at 40 dollars? Cause you had no clue what was happening, just like you have no clue now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy doesn't know what hes talking about, this is not real TA.

Ideally TA should be to time trades. If you just watch wolf of wall street and want to be a day trader, you pretty much want to trade breakouts/breakdowns. And you're going to want to use real set ups and patterns, not VWAP (Very Wet Ass Pussy) touching a purple line."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Invite Michael to your chats.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Source for these figures?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a worthless statistic because most daytraders go broke in 2 years, you can't just keep losing money for 2 years and on january 1st suddenly receive the magical ability to make money. Reading tea leaves is not the way to make money. How many % of daytraders keep doing it 2+ years?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"of people who can do it, 80% of people can do it*"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Follow the white rabbit, you'll come across all you need to know
 But think about the basics, if you're steady at something for long enough, you'll get much better, and who is going to keep trading after 2 years of not profiting? Just makes sense right."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"haha well I know you're a retard, but think about it logically. of course you dont get to the 2 year mark and all of a sudden you're making money, this isn't a video game. 

think about this logically, when you're a noob, in anything, you're inherently bad, and need experience. so 99%+ of noobs will lose money. as time goes on you get better, more educated ect. so people that have been in for 6 months lose less than day 1 people, and people that have been in 1 year lose less than 6 months ect.

there's a constant rotation of people coming into the market and stay for say 6 months trading and end up negative at the end which all contributes to that 90% of people that didn't profit.

nobody said anything about most day traders going broke in 2 years either. its 90% of traders dont profit, its not 90% go broke. you can lose 100% or 1% you're still in that 90% that didnt profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I've practiced for years but I can't seem to get better at flipping a coin.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My teacher i guess you can call him is a pro trader. took him 5 years to become profitable. Said before then he had to keep adding money until he learned. Now he can take a 50k L and make it back in a few days. just gotta be disciplined to the max and take the small gains. So many times he sells for 10-30% and then later that day shit coulda made him a quarter million. but its the little gains that add up quick and keep you in that small percentage of successful traders.

How is this even possible? Is this a common ""business model""?

How big is the SECs blindspot?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Through equity swaps. Basically the bank holds the security and pays the returns on it to Archegos. Meanwhile Archegos pays a fee to the bank. Bank diversifies capital risk into credit risk, Archegos doesn‚Äôt have to disclose positions and can avoid some taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anybody else remember when GameStop was first blowing up the professionals were complaining that retail investors weren‚Äôt responsible enough to trade in options and derivatives and thus shouldn‚Äôt have access to them
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is simply hedging with derivatives.

The real issue at the root of the problem is the leverage afforded hedge funds. It appear the are able to borrow beyond their ability to repay & are ‚Äògambling‚Äô on the market with leverage.

Doesn‚Äôt matter how big/wealthy you are, if you are able to borrow more than you can repay it will destabilize the financial system."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wonder if this dude passed the level 3 options course on his platform.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does this mean I'll reach the ""max. profit"" number on my puts?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you buy derivatives, you‚Äôre not really owning any stock; but the party selling you such derivatives must delta hedge, most often by buying/selling sufficient securities to cover their derivative sales. 

In this case, my assumption is that Archegos went bullish on Viacom and Discovery among others (those are two of the best performing stocks year to date) by buying call options and CFDs. GS/MS who sold them the securities had to buy the underlying stocks to hedge. 

My theory is, upon realizing Bill Hwang‚Äôs position is vulnerable to various bad news (Viacom dilution, China stocks delisting potential) GS/MS sold their holdings and tank the stock prices, indirectly triggering a margin call on Archegos. This is not unlikely, given what happened in 2008 - when GS rug pulled their fellow bankers at Lehman by selling all their MBS holdings tanking the MBS/CDO market and created the Global financial crisis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did the stockprice of viacom and discovery tank then? I didn't think CFD's had any actual impact on the price of a security.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The UK has CFD accounts for retail investors. They're classed and regulated like gambling and they're clear that you're not buying the underlying asset.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Family Office"" is a common business model.

This investment strategy is definitely not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's possible because the guy used Total Return Swaps on the stocks. These swaps gives a return that is based on the stock's performance and Hwang gives something back to his broker, either a fixed payment or something variable. 

This means that Hwang still have leveraged exposure, he just doesn't have to show it on his balance sheets."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like I should start taking some economics classes the further along I get into my retail trading hobby
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a tactic to avoid derivative accounting reporting procedures. It‚Äôs a ‚Äúcontract for difference‚Äù instead of a ‚Äúderivative‚Äù. Same liability and risk but without the oversight.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh the world of institutions.  Can't wait for CNBC and others to put their positive spin on this one!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't read the article because of paywall but I'm actually trying to learn whilst I monkay around this place - can someone give me an ape's explanation of what exactly not owning the underlying security means? He was trading in things he never owned? How could that be? How can you trade something you don't own?

Is it basically the same as how banks 'have' your money even if they've loaned it out (ie your deposite $10 they loan someone 10$, both of you believe you 'have' $10 then POOF! $20!)??"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who would've thought a bunch of retarded apes would teach the world how shorting works lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Contract for difference. It's common. Someone's got a 150T CFD on tesla. I wonder when that's going blow up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"With CFD, you don‚Äôt own jack but the contract with the broker - the value of which is determined based on the price of the underlying asset at a given time. So yeah they didn‚Äôt own the underlying because they used a derivative product."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like you know with all the options bets here none of us really own the underlying too right? But the market makers do to hedge our retardation. This is what happened, the institutional banks that were writing out these derivatives held the shares and had to liquidate because Hwang is an autist like us and after blowing up left them holding bags."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I understand that. But common sense would tell me to expect they had at least a chunk of long positions to hedge with?

I mean from what I understand it seems like they full on hedged derivates with derivates only. No? That is like betting on a cock-fight with a result of a different cock-fight. I mean.. yeah the chances are you know which cock wins, but it is still just chances. So a big fucking casino."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,8 to 1 leverage.  8-1!  That's insane.  Just a small movement away from your thesis and you are  bankrupt.  You'd need to hedge everything and be market neutral for that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends, are they gme puts?  If not, then YUS"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The margin call happened just shortly after VIAC took a 20%+ dip (upon announcing they would be doing share dilution). 

It was almost certainly his overleveraged synthetic position in VIAC, plus that rapid drop in price, which led to the margin call. His position was no longer valuable enough to justify his debt ratio."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you buy CFD you don't own an underlying asset. But your broker hedges your contract according to his policy. If broker didn't buy any underlying assets, he would be paying you out of his own pocket whenever you take profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt CFD sellers hedge like option sellers?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He was shorting using Equity Swaps, that way he don't need to file for 13D with SEC. Btw this is not first time our boy Bill to stuck his dick in a cookie jar. He was margin called in 2008 with VW's short squeeze when he owned Tiger Asia Managment hedge fund."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I might be misunderstanding but I don't think it was him that did the sell off, it was his financial backers who loaned him the money for his margin plays to cover their own ass and hedged his contracts since they would be on the hook if it went bad. Don't know the specifics of how much was covered but most likely not enough. They probably didn't expect him to be so over leveraged. 

I want to know who at GS and MS knew to bail and why did they bail when they did. The timing is just too on point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Viacom was tanking before this. Share dilution through a $3b new offering and owning a bunch of second rate streaming services will do that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes most, similar in SK. The disproportion in US is what is mind boggling to me. 
Retail: ‚ÄúCan we have some CFDs?‚Äù
‚ÄúNo! Bad retail, no CFDs!
Institutions: ‚ÄúCan we have som CFDs?‚Äù
‚ÄúSure, have a shitton and you don‚Äôt even have to report them to us. Do whatever.‚Äù"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did I say illegal?  
Bu it does seems to me highly unregulated and overlooked. Combine it with zero actual long positions to hedge and that does seem problematic."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think that's the same.

They are fabricating BS options and misrepresenting those as shares they have on hand to sell now. Artificially inflating supply to drive down the price per share. It's fraud. 

Not nearly the same as you betting on an option written by some one else."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">It's possible because the guy used Total Return Swaps on the stocks. These swaps gives a return that is based on the stock's performance and Hwang gives something back to his broker, either a fixed payment or something variable.  
>  
>This means that Hwang still have leveraged exposure, he just doesn't have to show it on his balance sheets.

Do you think that is why the [SEC has implemented the new change](https://www.sec.gov/rules/sro/nscc/2021/34-91428.pdf) to have cash proceeds from outstanding term debt issuance reported, so they can see these shady dealings?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CNBC: It was reddit squeeze that caused archegos' collapse. Need more regulations on retail
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know, it is written in the pretty picture."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah. and if it tanks, you have to pay up. And that you should have some kind of hedging positions. Seems like they had fuckall."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny thing is that Citadel just talked about switching to this same strategy after the GME drubbing because it would allow them to hide their actual short interest so they wouldn't have to report those positions anymore. They were also talking about how it would help them reduce their capital requirements. So in other words shady investing where there is zero transparency and accountability.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the world of high finance. :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Regulations are for poor people bruh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the same as owning a stock with the only real difference being that you don‚Äôt need to disclose and can hide your positions better. Kind of ridiculous that this loophole exists.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn‚Äôt say it‚Äôs shady it‚Äôs just an option for them to conduct business. It‚Äôs just not a common trade for retail folks like us.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs legal .  

Total return swap is like renting an asset . Makes me think of Eliot management and Samsung cheil merger battle"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They live in an echo chamber and when they do fuck up there is always someone around them that ""bails"" them out(using tax payer money).

I mean, these people literally do not work. You know, the shit you do to survive and to keep humanity moving along.

&#x200B;

Some are very intelligent, and they are probably slightly more intelligent overall because they go to better schools, but most are lunatics and they are definitely very narrow minded and generally actually have less worldly experiences. Some thug on the street that has to be sharp as fuck to stay alive has far more understanding about how  life works then some trust fund baby. Both are closed minded though, but when the thug realizes he's a morn and starts to educate himself he surpasses the trust fund baby who's too rich to fail."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They think they know everything because when they invest 20 million or billion and see 2/3/5% returns it's more than most people will make in a lifetime. Then they use a bunch of words and graphs that arent intuitive for the avg person and act like what they are doing is complex or atleast a fuck load more complex than it really is. Oh and most of them are assisted by AI.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Credit Suisse & Nomura are lenders.

Archegos is a hedge fund. They took multiple derivative positions, calls & puts, with varying expiration dates.

It appears they did not go long with shares.

Risky? Yes.

Irresponsible? Yes.

Unusual? No.

The problem is the amount of leverage they are provided by lenders. If you borrow more than you can payback, it becomes a problem.

Borrowing so that you can gamble larger amounts is risky business. 

The lenders should have required more oversight on how the funds were used.

Either way, mistakes were made. Hedge funds need to pay up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the 1920's people were allowed to leverage 10-1. Then the market crashed, no one could repay those outrageous margin loans, bank runs, people jumped out of windows, Great Depression, and so on.

What's that saying about learning the lessons of history or repeat them?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long Term Capital Management, which was a hedge fund that blew up spectacularly in 1998, was leveraged about 25-1."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No no no. Gme= buy shares, not calls. Ape eats name brand crayon, only mildly retarded."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait. This guy was caught up in the VW squeeze too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"On the contrary, he was long, he was actually attempting a short squeeze on Viacom and Discovery, among other plays.

The recent downtrend in some of  the Chinese stocks such as Baidu and GSX since the beginning of March were already a bad omen. What sparked the implosion was a $3bn stock offering by Viacom at their all-time high last week, diluting the EPS and thus signaling negative sentiment and a selloff.

He was levered and concentrated to the tits, so a lot of the positions had to be liquidated sharply, regardless of how well they had done up to that point."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i dont really understand all this stuff but is it just a coincidence that goldman sachs were supposedly weary of him for years after the insider trading thing but then gave it for the taste of the honey everyone else was getting? i imagine they must have gone in cautiously with him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It went down on the dilution news, but didn't warrant losing 50% of its market cap.

The ""dilution"" is to directly fund new content for its platform. Sounds like you have some FOMO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean you are implying that the sec should regulate this for some reason. Who cares if they don‚Äôt have long positions? Why would that be a requirement?

No taxpayer money is on the hook for archegos as far as I know. Banks took risks, archegos took risks, shit hit the fan and the shareholders take a hit. That‚Äôs how this is supposed to work"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I doubt it. Swaps aren't classified as debt on the balance sheet. Whats more is that these swaps are dealer-to-dealer OTC swaps, so it's a dark market with a lack of oversight. I doubt the SEC can draft up something that quick in response to this."

https://www.bauer.uh.edu/rsusmel/7386/ltcm-2.htm"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true. When you see this things you can only thing that the amount of leverage in the system is way beyond reasonable and that not only GME, but probably most stocks are ultraleveraged. Just look at the VIAC chart. Probably Archegos caused the parabolic movement by entering into equity swaps with different entities. It is just a pyramid scheme like the one Madoff run for years, he was leveraged until the point he could not pay if he got margin called, but he knew other would take the losses while he would take the gains if it played out well."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wouldn't the bank be shorting it on their behalf?

And the bank would have to report their short interest....

It hides Citadel's activity but not the underlying short."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol thank you!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Uncredited investors
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not the same. If you take out a long CFD position and the stock tanks, you have to pay out the difference it tanked. I mean, yes, if you would‚Äôve bought the stock it‚Äôs the same loss. But the difference is that you have to pay later with CFD, which, if you are doing it irresponsibly means you don‚Äôt have to have cash to actually pay out the loss. Which is problematic."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not common for retail because it‚Äôs not allowed in the US for retail.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know it's legal, I just don't think it should be. At the very least the positions should have to be disclosed.

Not to mention they do it to avoid taxes, which should *also* be illegal."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are these the same ""pros"" that advise against investing with loans?

Are they genuinely concerned for people, or just don't want competition?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Banks were leveraged 30-1 in the financial crisis. 8-1 would‚Äôve gotten a AAA rating back then.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There are people that never learn...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah that‚Äôs it. You a big paramount+ guy? Or maybe more cbs all access. I hear there‚Äôs some great content on there. 

If you think it‚Äôs oversold, buy it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well as far as generally mentioned about this whole situation - it was exactly this purpose of it all, to avoid taxes as much possible. So the taxpayer money did kind of take a hit in general.

Second point being as far as I know, CFDs aren't available for retail investor in US (I may be wrong here, I'm euro-ape), yet they are almost absolutely unregulated for institutions? That seems hardly balanced. 

So, illegal? No, I didn't imply that. Although - Unregulated? Yes, bigly. And that does seem not okay. I did say that and so far, stand behind it. But I am open to my mind being changed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you have 2008 as an example, did we not learn a thing? It's not just risk taking when you are ""gambling"" with securities and the ripple effect affects the whole economy. When you unwind positions this big, a fundamentally good company may see its stock price tank because of the firesale itself, and the cascade effect may be devastating for big banks not even aware of their exposure. 

And then you have the bail outs; so yes, taxpayer money may be affected by this ultra aggresive trading strategies, and when you have this kind of exposure, regulation is a must."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It should regulated, in some unregulated derivatives the banks could give them high % of leverage. Imagine someone like Ken Griffin to close his hedge fund and open family office (that means he invest his own capital only). With his capital of 20bil if some bank give him 600-700% margin and got something fucked up he can crash the whole market if some bank start liquidating 140bil $ worth of assets. Imagine 4-5people that have bilions of $ and 6x-7x leverage, they could literaly make a recession..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">I doubt the SEC can draft up something that quick in response to this.

Someone posted about a n SEC Notice of Filling a rule change today. I was surprised it was so quick even though so much was lost recently by Archegos.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the bank gets to aggregate all of this in with their ETF and mutual fund positions.

No one bats an eye when goldman sachs is the largest shareholder of stock X. The entire point is to hide in the shadow of the giants."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Think of it like owning stock on margin. It is marked to market every second of every trading day mimicking the stock price so it‚Äôs not like the value of your account is any different than it would be if you owned the stock or that you have to ‚Äúpay later‚Äù any differently than you would if you got margin called. The problem wasn‚Äôt the structure of the instruments he used, it was the fact that the instruments are basically a loop hole around reporting so the different banks he used and market participants had no idea how much he had levered up and how big his positions in these companies were...or the banks did know and just have retarded risk management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting...thanks for sharing, not all of us are American üëåüèª"

You're sarcastically questioning their content?

There's a basketball tournament called March Madness going on right now. I hear a lot of people are watching it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The government doesn‚Äôt tax losses lol. So no the taxpayer did not take a hit because they lost money. Like a lot of it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dodd Frank was passed after 2008 to maintain financial stability and prevent banks needing bailouts. It appears to be working and tries to prevent systematically important firms from going under and needing a bailout. And let other firms that no one gives a shit about take risks and go under when they blow up. 

What is a ‚Äúfundamentally good‚Äù company is in the eye of the beholder. You‚Äôre on a sub that bid up the price of a company that until recently hadn‚Äôt made any money in 2 years. Certain Hedge funds thought it was worth less than this sub. They were wrong (at least in the near term) and that‚Äôs how price discovery works. If something tanks because of a big sale, other people will buy it. Like when GME tanked and then recovered."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,interesting  history... overleveregerd and no regulations
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Makes sense, thank you. Wouldn‚Äôt the absence of reporting the positions mean also that it could be abused when dealing with several banks? If so, that‚Äôs when it stops behaving like owning actual stock, if it would be possible to us it as collateral with other bank. No?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So do you mean say each bank say knew his holdings with them and thought he only held 5% of a company not realising he was doing this with 10 banks altogether and essentially was holding 50% of companies without anybody knowing that he had 5% more in each of the other banks?

Sorry I'm really dumb but I'm trying to learn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is, also in EU. But the fact that in US it‚Äôs a no-no for retail and unregulated yes-yes for institutions seems weird. (Talking specifically about CFDs, I don‚Äôt know what the deal is on swaps)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh Dodd Frank did nothing banks have continued activities through the 2010's and it's also been partially repealed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think anybody knows specifically what happened but it sounds like it is possible he abused the non-reporting aspect to gain massive leverage by banks that weren‚Äôt aware of other positions he had.

Or the banks were aware and just wanted to collect fees and be first out when it blew up. Sounds like Goldman and ms knew what was going on and were properly hedged and first out whereas other banks like CS and Nomura were completely fucking clueless and ate massive shit lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's exactly what Archegos did.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think anybody knows the specifics right now but that is a possibility.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And that with this mean his 'portfolio wasn't diverse enough'(i dont wanna sound like i know) and so lets then suppose this meant a dip in anything he owned that wasn't 'covered' left him to a big risk of exposure  especially if he had uncovered short positions because short positions can have infinite risk?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my bad, apparently CFDs are legal in Canada. Probably banned in the US because they offer WAY too much leverage and can easily bankrupt retail.

 If i lose 10 million dollars on the 11th year, i don't just magically get the taxes back for the previous gains that i paid taxes on.

This isn't about their money. It's about avoiding taxes. Are you being intentionally dense?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a lawyer, if GS agreed to the deal, then I would think CS might have an action for breach of contract (detrimental reliance). Could be an interesting play to try and recover some of the money from GS/MS for breaching the agreement."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,not gonna happen. CS is a systemically important bank under the too big to fail regime in Switzerland. This means that the government will step in and bail them out no matter what.

Then there's Greensil which had EU regulators scrambling and contacting banks to ask if they had dealings with Greensil and Sanjeev Gupta's GFG alliance and for how much (not entirely sure how GFG is important in this). I think Deutsche unsurprisingly is slightly exposed to this as is UBS.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the long run, it just makes sense. If they don‚Äôt get fresh capital from the top 5 investors, I am not so sure, the Swiss would support a bail out. Especially since so many small businesses go bankrupt and don‚Äôt get a bailout in the corona-madness. But Switzerland is not so much under lockdown like other European countries. It‚Äôs just really a hard sell to bail out a bank again... especially for bad risk management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs true, because the real journalists are actually doing the investigative work. They don‚Äôt have time to be on TV until they publish their stories. One example is Julie Brown‚Äîshe investigated Epstein and revealed all the fucked up shit he was up to. She only went on TV after her story was published and Epstein went to prison."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CS = Credit Suisse. It‚Äôs in this article
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CS:Gone
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No shit! I threw about 75% of my portfolio at GME and left a few long term plays going with about 1k in side action money to play options. Everything I make off my options is getting YOLO into GME tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They can melt the silver and forge a silver hammer to acquire further resources
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like, before humanity learned how to smelt? Always love hearing the ""bear"" case lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This cures everything
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To you as well, comrade."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Real journalists still work for shit companies that are not interested in truth.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CS 1.6?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one can argue Ronin Farrow isn't a ""real"" journalist. He took on NBC corporate then went to The New Yorker after NBC wouldn't publish his story on Weinstein.

Ronin is just one. There are plenty of ""real"" journalists."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Journalism is cancer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully that‚Äôs how low CS goes but I don‚Äôt have a Source
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please, you all will probably list 4 or 5 that had a random good story out of the 10's of thousands feeding garbage to the population."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, just off the top of my head without looking any up I can think of: Ronin Farrow and the two other reporters who helped write the Weinstein story, the reporter at a local Florida newspaper who cracked the Epstein story, the entire team at Pro-Publica, the team at On The Media, the team at Revealed, Taylor Lorenz who is pioneering the field of influencer reporting.

Those are just the national ones I can think of. You've also got all the local journalists who are just covering local stories and trying to keep local govt accountable to people."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool, what about the 70,000 others?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're acting petulant and you're more interested in proving yourself right than gaining any nuanced, informed understanding of journalism as a field and as an industry. Being as close minded as you are won't do you any favors and will give people reason to be dismissive of you."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh stop. You are defending an industry that on a whole is known to mislead and report false information. You are the type that points out how not all nazi or slave owners were bad. Thanks for pointing out Schindler, he doesn't represent everyone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All Nazis and slave owners were/are bad.

I'm regretting I ever tried to give you information you were lacking. As a person, you're a waste of time and energy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was an analogy, not something you needed to directly address. I'm stopping now. Have fun being fed garbage from the media."
2021-03-30 16:52:23,wallstreetbets,Did Cramer really just say this? 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,IDK what he said because I watched it on mute.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fine, Jim you too can be a part of the new GameStop HQ. Here's your broom and overalls you dildo-shaped muppet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer looks like the business version of the tiger king.

Edit: Cool! I don't usually get awards. Thank you my fellow degenerates! :) GME GO MOON SOON."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, he did and tomorrow he‚Äôs going to say how shitty the company is. He switches sides every day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm conflicted now... I do everything the opposite of this turd.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People still listen to this butt plug?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL'ers @ 483.00 'Am I a joke to you?'
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what Cramer has been doing for 20 years on TV. He is wrong about 50% of the time and when he is really wrong, eventually, he just admits he was wrong and acts like it's unusual that he got it wrong. And then the idiots all act like he ""is manning up to his mistake"". 

Just look at the 6 months of his shows leading up to the 2008 financial crisis, the man was as bullish as they come. He had no clue it was coming. 

He is a manipulative asshole who shells for all the typical Wall Street power brokers. That's why they like him. He does what they want."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This means fuckery is afoot.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,dude has the most annoying voice ever..he sounds like hes whining even when he isnt.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gamestop is hiring top notch people, while Citadel stopped hiring at all.

Makes me wonder..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"top notch talent. like we have said for months now.

top notch business plan. like we have said for months now.

top notch market to be in. like we have said for months now.

top notch market mechanical set up. like we have said for months now.


To quote DFV: ""Really, I dont understand how anyone can disagree with this!"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His voice gets higher every day. Is the increasing pressure of the vice WSB has around his balls...? ü§î
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jfc is he drunk at 9am? Chill bruh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim, glad to hear you‚Äôre on board now, but the trouble is that I don‚Äôt remember asking you a god damned thing..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you can't beat'em, give'm a sideways complement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like hes trying to recruit boomers to get scared after the upcoming dip once they buy in. 

recruit boomer

drive price up

apes buy more?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he drunk? I would be too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Guy is a wind sock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean he‚Äôs not wrong. This went from a meme stock to a true asset. 

The company did some funny stuff with the money at first but then we started to see some interesting moves. Moves as if they are working on being a player again. The right moves. 

AMC on the other hand....how that stock is not a penny stock is beyond me. That to me is still a meme stock. And it‚Äôs management is atrocious. It will be a penny stock in a matter of a year. Those guys are clowns. 

But GME....I have to say. That company seems to be gearing up for something. Absolutely great leadership clean up and new hires in my opinion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Jim Cramer puts ketchup on his overcooked eggs, he only uses the watery pre-ketchup at the top of the bottle."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kenny G. must be running low on cash and missed his CNBC payment today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúAbout the banks‚Äù

Still full of shit!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer = Submissive Cuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs looks like a shit coming out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate his shoulder pads, he looks like Uncle Fester"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He‚Äôs right.  

Put it this way, no fucking way is any hedge fund shorting a $10 GME stock with this leadership team Ryan Cohen is assembling."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs him telling the hedges he needs more $$$ to keep spreading FUD
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Top spinner, today this tomorrow that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"this volume for ants?

i have to put it to 100% and I still cant hear anything"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Notice how he is laughing while saying it .
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what he always does. Makes market ""predictions"" (more like the message the market makers want him to push) then if he's wrong or blows up in his face he just back peddles and reports on it like he always knew"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,WE LIKE THE STOCK! WE LIKE THE STOCK!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs on your side now. Y‚Äôall are fucked
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank goodness he's not manipulating the market...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs funny how this forum saw these positive turn arounds coming months before CNBC sees it. If you wait for CNBC to tell you a stock is good, you‚Äôve already missed out. 

I still don‚Äôt trust this scumbag tho. He‚Äôs probably acting like he‚Äôs into GameStop so he sounds more credible later when he starts bashing it again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love the quizzical look of the guy with the merkin on his head. Makes Jim look somehow even more retarded.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Before I came here, I had a positive opinion of Cramer. Because I didn‚Äôt know shit. 
After reading comments and comparing what he says to what actually happens it‚Äôs pretty evident he either doesn‚Äôt know what he‚Äôs talking about or he is trying to manipulate people with disinformation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's brown nosing WSB so the trolling stops üëÜüèºüëÜüèºüëÜüèº
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Leave it to little jimmy to half ass concede, but we know damn well he be the first say ‚Äútold ya so ‚Äú if they turn things around, completely ignoring his rampage last six months about GameStop and not a single person will bring up his obvious idiocy for most of last year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The mocking and shit talking that this jagoff did for the past two months about how anyone who invested in the stock might as well just go out in the backyard and set their money on fire. 

To now be praising and saying ‚Äúmaybe they have a plan or why would these executives go there‚Äù. 

NO SHIT DUMBASS. 

What do you think we‚Äôve been saying this whole time. Cuban made a good point that e-commerce businesses trade on 10-20 sometimes 30 times multiple of sales and you can build that narrative with this stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I really find it interesting that these kind of people (screeming clowns) are shown on TV in the US.... we don‚Äôt have these kind of characters shown on TV in Holland üòÜ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, who would‚Äôve figured WSB DD‚Äôers from Nov-Jan 20/21 were actually right...umm, we all did. That‚Äôs why everyone got on board initially.

WE LIKE THE STOCK! THE DD CHECKS OUT!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm feeling bullish AF!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably trying to make us believe the shorts are out because they believe in the stock now. Smoke and mirrors. Hold
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, I didnt care what he said before, why should I care now? Whether he agrees with us or not is irrelevant. He wins no points for saying true things. He's still a creepy looking catlike person whom I wouldn't let watch my HR ladies kids (she's an awful person, I dont know how she got the job). I also heard he pees sitting down by choice because standing causes him too much strain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer....for fuck‚Äôs sake. Stop with this acting bullshit. ‚ÄòI gotta give it to them.‚Äô Just admit that the Reddit community had a belief in it, had a belief in Ryan Cohen and co. Just admit that the Wall Street ‚Äòpros‚Äô just cared about money and nothing else."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's covering his ass- he makes statements like this and then talks about the ""Pros taking over again"" so he's on record talking about both sides no matter which wins out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck he‚Äôs optimistic now guess it‚Äôs dropping and I can get cheap calls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is a fucking tool and we shouldn't give him any exposure. It will only bring up his views.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC to the moon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shit, Jim likes the stonk, time to sell?! Ha

J/k -  I just bought more! üíéüôåüöÄ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can tell he died a little inside
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually why I am worried.  Every trade I have gotten from Cramer has gone down....Now he is talking gamestonk. IDK.  Do your own DD.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The volume is terribly low.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This has been great exposure for Cramer and his show.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,his voice inflections seemingly affected by increase in ‚Äòbullshit‚Äô to what he‚Äôs saying
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny Cramer says that to start new buyers and then 3 mil shares are borrowed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer likes GME? Thats why we dipped back from $200
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,MSM = WALL STREET. Both are full of shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just Cramer. Pretty much entire media scene is fuking biased and corrupt. They all promote their agenda one way or other and seldom present the correct and complete story.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's just a moronic puppet, that's all."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer just broke my ""Inverse Cramer"" investing algo."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounded like he was about to cry lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer squeezes tubes of toothpaste with his teeth
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he on the verge of crying...or this is just his normal way of speaking?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone definitely got him grabbed by the $BALLS

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone has his balls in a vice.  I don't know who and I don't know why but that is a man whose balls are in the hands of someone else and he is saying whatever they say will make sure they don't squeeze.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer has now gone thru all his stages of grief & has probably finally come to terms with **Resistance is Futile**; so if you can't beat them...join them...

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who thinks Jim bought at the peak??? üòÇ

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know who this guy is, and I haven't been following this closely, but I'm getting Alex Jones vibes from Cramer. He can barely take a breath because he can't *not* talk. Just constant spewing of verbal diarrhea"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is a traditional Wall Street guy. I have mixed feelings about him because if it weren‚Äôt for him, I wouldn‚Äôt have started trading and learning. I wouldn‚Äôt have started in options and exploring that world. His shows and books were interesting enough to get me and my dad in market. So I am grateful for that. 

At the same time, he definitely has a MSM view on a lot of what is going on and makes recommendations based on some old world thinking."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop watching Cramer and CNBC. At least don't take them seriously. They are a propaganda channel for market makers. He will say something different tomorrow most likely, but continue to push his agenda, just like how he mentioned banks again."

Is he trying to get newbies in so when/if a fake squeeze is executed (with the people margin calling on his side) those noobs not knowing the fact dump? 
Idk my thoughts on the way he's approaching it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,üòéyes ‚ù§Ô∏è

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He loses coherent thought anytime the word gamestop pops up. I am pretty sure he is seeing a therapist by now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$DISCA is the play.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets, What's he doing? ...  He's beginning to believe.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Besides the regular WSB diamond hander, it looks like slowly but surely more and more analysts / non-WSB people are turning the corner and seeing the potential in GameStop. First Jefferies, then Zach‚Äôs, and now Cramer (even though Cramer has been know to flip flop). I personally am feeling preeeeeetty optimistic at the outlook all things considered üíéüôåüèºüöÄ"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a man trying to maintain a grip on his shaky little pedastool.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F that relic. Two months late dude. We already knew this was happening.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No wonder... I saw it climb to 200 and then crash back down. Must have wheeled Cramer out the second it broke 195 to say something good about GME to tank the price.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't beat em, join em."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When the squeeze gets squozed.  Everyone should mail crammer a massive dildo. Just so he can quietly go fuck fuck himself.

# AMC Executives Sell Large Amounts of Stock -- Barrons.com

BY Dow Jones \&amp; Company, Inc.  
‚Äî 6:59 AM ET 03/29/2021

AMC Entertainment ( [AMC](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=AMC) 

AMC stock has rocketed so far in 2021 in volatile trading, and executives of the theater chain recently have sold large amounts of stock, after selling none last year. In fact, for three out of four of the executives, these are their first stock sales on the open market on record.

AMC stock has soared nearly 400% year to date, fueled by so-called meme trading. At one point, when shares hit $20.36 in January, they were trading at nearly 10 times the year-end price of $2.12. The S&P 500 index has managed to rise only 5.8% so far this year.

The four executives sold a total of nearly $3 million of AMC stock earlier this month. AMC didn't immediately respond to a request to make them available for comment on their stock sales.

The selling was led by Stephen Colanero, executive vice president and chief marketing officer, who sold 100,000 AMC shares on March 23 for $1.1 million, or $10.52 each on average. He now owns 108,879 shares, according to a form he filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Colanero, who has been with the company since 2009, last sold stock in June 2018, receiving $86,000 for 5,364 shares, a per-share average of $15.95.

Kevin Connor, senior VP, general counsel, and secretary, sold a total of 72,358 AMC shares over March 16 and 17 for $982,600, a per-share average of $13.58. Connor, who has been with the company since June 2007, now owns 65,884 AMC shares.

Elizabeth Frank, executive VP, worldwide programming and chief content officer, sold 40,000 AMC shares on March 16 for $542,400, an average price of $13.56 each. Frank, who has been in her post since July 2012, now owns 173,780 AMC shares.

Chris Cox, senior VP and chief accounting officer, sold 29,068 AMC shares on March 16 for $373,800, a per-share average price of $12.86. Cox, who was named to his current position more than a decade ago, now owns 42,000 shares.

AMC executives aren't the only recent stock sellers. Private-equity firm Silver Lake, which had been one of the company's largest investors, sold its entire stake in January for $713 million.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if Cramer is ok with GME, is this the beginning of the end, or the dawn of a new era?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That spineless bitch prolly realized how fucked hedgies are, bought his own tendies and is spreading the hype."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is legitimately way more retarded than anyone on WSB could ever be

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck Jim Cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy is such a joke, bashing GME for months, and now he is finally seeing what most of us already saw in December/January"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What accent is that? üòÇ nobody understands what hes saying
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He finally gave in for a short time, but he will be pulled back by the suits paying his salary. He will be back to normal soon enough."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone else notice that his callers always thank him profusely when they get on the line? I don‚Äôt remember them gobbling his nob so hard until after he got all the Twitter vitriol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His ass couldn't take it anymore lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer sounds like a clucking chicken

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He doesn't want to go down in history as the biggest moron who didn't see this massive squeeze coming. I wonder how man more are going to turn as we get closer to the pop?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs such a lapdog

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"*Maybe* they have a plan. ***Maybe***. 

&#x200B;

***MAYBE?!***"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they haven't hired me to keep their dev teams honest and lean in not sure how serious they are.

Also, u/savevideo."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Shut it down, shut it all down"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer blasts his asshole with a shower head while sucking dick
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I am absolutely convinced that he went out and bought himself a yuge bag of $GME a couple of weeks ago. üòÅü§£
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp. Guess anti-Jim strategy means we gotta sell $GME now. Thanks a lot Jim.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Typical Cramer. Hop on board after things look good and trash them after they tank. He‚Äôs never ahead of the game. Usually he‚Äôs the kiss of death
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,G A C K E D
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer can cram it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs such a knob.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he likes it do we still like it?! üòù
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer really needs to learn that you can‚Äôt just even out alcohol with cocaine to look sober
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Even a broken clock is right twice a day I guess? Still a bitchass tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Had a stroke trying to give us props
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is a glitch.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs called hedging.  Whether it goes up or down he can say he ‚Äòcalled it‚Äô. ü§ì
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer somehow applauding gme makes me worried because it may plummet. 
On the flip side I am happy because if it dips, I get to buy more üôà"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He is trying so hard to become a Jimpanzee...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I love how this guy went from hating to loving the stonk and wishing to be hired by the company in a matter of weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is still a snake, but holy shit"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FUUUUUUK Crymer...we don't care what he thinks or says üò§
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer been a clown boys
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he is talking up GME on this video because he is tired of taking a beating in WSB!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Next thing you know Cramer will be knocking on our Lambo doors trying to suck us off behind Wendy's
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how does he have a low and high voice at the exact same time??
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I really don't care about this man's opinion. I find him to be an absurd talking head and I will never take advice from him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sus af
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer probably ran out of cash and is looking to score some tendies with us now so he can score some meth or coke or whatever the hell he is on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He will jump on any bandwagon. Has no balls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buaaaa se la esta envainando wuajjajajaja at least he acknowledges the facts, top executives from big corps are joining the proyect , if that doenst mean nothing not sure what does"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wonder if Cramer knows 90% of his viewers are us waiting for him to say something stupid so we can meme it on here...

And the other 10% are people putting their grandparents to bed for background noise 

ü§£"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tome to make bank ! Let‚Äôs gooooo!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,C.Y.A.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚Äò I have to admit if they wanted to do something, they could‚Äô essentially. Pretty profound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The thing about a Liar is their word is worthless no matter what they say.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One thing that‚Äôs fishy is Jim is intentionally trying to squeeze in Gamestop‚Äôs positive outlook these past few days here and there. You can clearly see the question is not related to gamestop. And this has not happened for the first time. I wonder...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What did he say? I can't listen to him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes or no?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How can a speaking voice go through three octaves in one sentence?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he drunk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You apes finally broke him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer has webbed feet - pass it on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Petition to replace Cramer with DFV.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still no comment about the real reason GME and AMC are going to moon.   Fundamentals aren‚Äôt why.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs saying nice things bc he‚Äôs going to need to look for another job. No ones going to hire him if he keeps talking crazy lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You his old ass hopped in the GME trading recently lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is seriously going to be the undoing of Jimbo
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These Cramer snippets remind me of Samuel L Jacksons character in the Robocop remake that progressively loses his shit as the movie goes forward and ends by just ranting ü§£
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he didn't. You hallucinated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So far what are the big names and their ex company positions respectively?  

I got the amazon growth guy. Who's the guy from google?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone with experience tell me how many dildos you have to shove up your ass before you start sounding like Cramer? 

It's my biggest fear"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His voice reminds me of Glenn from Superstore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounded like was going to cry.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he drunk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SHA1 of my theory on their plan: e564e744f60299a41a70554a186e6a853ee9b91e81945036601e1e391d8f0adf. Will post contents if it materializes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp.  The top is in.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Reverse psychology short position? Sounds fishy jimmy!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer more like Dum Namer. Got em.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs almost sad watching Jim Boomer become irrelevant
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He always looks like there's a toilet under there and he's been fighting that turd for a while.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The same fuckin shit he pulled in 2008. Once the jig was up he started taking the opposite position to seem credible. Bald fraud. Fuck him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen, it's Rick Berkeley in disguise."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kramer stamped it. Commence squeeze now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs not too late to get out from behind that dumpster Jim. They are still hiring!!

www.wendys-careers.com"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He talks like Glenn from Superstore.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is he crying or is that just what he sounds like now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations to WSB for buying 1x Jim Cramer, Finance Actor Grade AAA.

The News Corp is currently reprogramming the opinions of your purchase and will be going live soon. Here is your operations manual."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf is he saying? I don't undstand lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starting to wonder if this guy lost everything during his meltdown and may have actually bought some gme

Alternatively he's being told to hype gme, so that people trust him again...

Don't believe manipulators"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, guess I like him now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim cramer wears Speedos for work
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,üòäü•∞
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Telling his number friends to buy them they for attack it so they sell low and have more to cover. Don‚Äôt bother with Cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It fucking **killed** him to compliment GameStop in any way.

#YOU LOST OLD MAN"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he reminds me of if louis ck got into stocks and was somehow worse of a person
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like he is buying the stock, shorty becoming an ape?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs a tweaking muppet
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,FUCK Jim Crammer. Go do some more blow of Ken Griffith's ass loser.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a new world buddy. Embrace it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks Cramer , now if you can only stop microwaving your fish in the office we‚Äôd be on par."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer looks like he coughs without covering his mouth
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The swedish chef because no one can understand him
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The one thing that make me consider selling. An endorsement from this guy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer is as useless as a canned good with the label torn off. 
And when you open it, it‚Äôs filled with poop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trust me, I'm a professional. 

This is not financial advice"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What did he say I can‚Äôt be bothered to watch it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"IF YOU CANT BEAT EM, JOIN EM CRAMER. HA"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer is the skip bayless of financial media. Fuck both of em. Idiots blowing hot air
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean GameStop does have Nintendo god Reggie for advertising and look at the online page for GameStop, they are still kicking"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiotic cocksucker must have closed his short position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy buy buy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs the equivalent to the loser‚Äôs applause at an awards ceremony.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it seem like he just had a stroke?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The HFs = Sauron & the orcs 

Cramer = Gollum 

DFV = Gandalf 

Apes = hobbits

GME  =  üíç"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did Jim bet against Gamestop? He sounds frustrated.  LOL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why does he talk like his jaw is clenched
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why every time Kramer talks it looks like he taking a hard shit in his pants be moving around and shit.üòÇüòÇüòÇ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like a fallout Ghoul.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When Jim Cramer plays GTA he stops at all the red lights
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First they ignore you.   
Then they laugh at you.  
Then they fight you.  
Then you win.  <-  (WE ARE HERE.)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He knows they ain't gonna fold, slowly but surely it's time to start saving face."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Moon
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who cast Louis CK as the kingpin? This sadderverse is getting worse and worse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,they might i‚Äôve have plan? i‚Äôm all in!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cocaine is one hell of a drug.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That means he's invested long.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,God his eyes are deader than mine
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop is a bank got it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,When you have been flipping back and forth your whole life it starts to get a big blurry as you become more senile and you sometimes forget where you are.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's trying reverse psychology.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,love u cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,can he speak in a more coherent way? wtf
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone translate pls?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim is starting to wake up day by day.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer is long on cocaine
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not living in America I had never heard of this jackass before the GME thing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is Cramer the dumb version of Rick? Just as alcoholic, but a complete fucking moron?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"uhhhhh

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,it looked like he was in pain to do that!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"we dont need his validation... he's positive on a stock after its steadily trading at $180+ from $18 ? 


he knows little. apes know much."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why does he sound like a clucking, I mean cucking chicken?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damage control. Screw that guy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate him and his stupid face
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, what a biiiiiitch"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welcome to the dark side lol.  Super smooth brain there, but he finally seems to be getting it. We know he can't just come out and say it.  Just don't go calling yourself an ape anytime soon, Jimbo."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer knows what the inside of his shoes taste like
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I DM him often and ask what his favorite color crayon he eats is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man some of these dudes are just simply clowns.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Derp.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,'Whats up fellow retail investors'
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that geriatric fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer legit sounds drunk in these segments. I‚Äôm kind of hear for it but he still doesn‚Äôt hold the door for people behind him.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,whatever happened to the Brother Cramer award? Or did we realize that he's just a fucking loser sellout?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer‚Äôs choking on my dik
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock! He likes the stock!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Let me kiss your bald shiny forehead ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|kissing_heart)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't what he's saying, Cramer is a literal meme at this point, he gets funnier by the day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt believe I‚Äôm about to say this, I couldn‚Äôt of said any better (or higher) myself"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd like to see a bald Danny McBride play him in the movie.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer flushes the toilet sitting down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He drunk.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel like he's being held hostage and forced to say something positive about gamestop. Bro blink twice if you need help.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer just called the top fellas!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what happens when too big to fail gets its ass handed to it repeatedly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been replace by a reptilian ape... Only thing that makes sense...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This dude is seriously drunk? Does anyone else feel the same way? I'm being 100% serious. My stepdad, who is a raging alcoholic, sounds exactly like this at times."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The fruit and nut salad speaks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bullish af on Cramers Alcohol - Blood - Level
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds like an unstable Yoda...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He is too ugly to punch in the face
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Soft turd hath spoken.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's gotta turn it around at sometime to try and hedge how much of a douche nozzle he's been
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,His sources tell him that the Apes are going to be victorious. He must begin a subtile change in tone over the next few weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My favorite Cramer moment was when he told GameStop to tell their investors the stock isn‚Äôt worth this much. Like yeah people with tons of their stock are going to say it isn‚Äôt worth shit, sure"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That is the voice of disbelief. Nice jobs retards. You broke Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn he sounds like my drunk uncle on Christmas
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dammit now I have to sell /s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro this guy is high out of his mind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer bought Gamestonk
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The whole news media world needs to implode, so much FUD they have spread. All need to be roped. Honest, open non biased journalism has been erased ever since few men owned the monopoly of it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer and Biden having a public conversation lol I buy that on ppv
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beautiful. See, the short squeeze was a technical rally. But, now, GameStop is going through a major digital transformation. I predict it will transform from a meme stonk to a growth company with legit fundamentals. And Jim Cramer seems to agree."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer waited to do his DD apparently.  Like, why the fuck do you think we are even here?  Short squeeze, fuck the hedgies,  sure, but this only started because they were way undervalued in a fast growing sector.

None of those morons did their DD, and doubled down again and again, because they couldn't possibly be wrong.  Are they just catching on now?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, gamestop is about to nosedive, check."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is he saying this am a reading too much into it or are they pushing gme?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotta say, at this point I reckon the whole US dollar is just a casino and your economy is the survival of the luckiest smoothest brains.

Bang your stimmy on red and pray for the best ü§£

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What a hack
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pre Ketchup lmfao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didnt realize this was Cramer until you pointed it out.

I thought it was a novel talking urinal.

hmm... who wouldve thunk..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's optimistic about GameStop? Uh oh...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow my audio must be screwed up. All I heard was buy more GME and AMC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer going full Lou Holtz
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of us! One of us!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please someone else tell me they see the similarity between Cramer and Trump, both in looks and mannerisms? Anyone?

Note: not political, I just think they look like each other."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet he chokes himself out at night listening to Dean Martin records snorting powder wishing he wasn‚Äôt Jim Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs like a creepy old uncle trying to get invited to a high school party
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck does this mean it‚Äôs time to sell?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can we stop showing off Cramer? We are just driving traffic to his show, which in turn tells his team that he should keep doing what he's doing.

Don't we all agree that he isn't important to us?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So THAAAAAAT‚ÄôS why the price went down today.  All makes sense.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer tips less than 15%.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck. Pulling out right now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"[...] _move like that, you gotta believe that some people knew, some people didn't..._

_But do people know about Gamestop going from... d-I don't know, 30 err 400?_

_By the way: Gamestop, I gotta HEEand it to 'em, they ar- they're hiring whss really unbelievable people!_

Jim Cramer circa 2021"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can't understand what he says anyway. His voice is like an uneven, mumbly, super-caffeinated ~~Yoda~~Grover voice.  I literally need subtitles to understand the guy

edit: Yoda is too sage for a comparison. He's more like Grover.. or maybe Gonzo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cramer on TV - immediate mute - All I now see him on tv is him crying ""I  like the stock, I like the stock"" but with a bad lip sync"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He likes the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he'll open his asshole up to all of wallstreetbets
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was financial advice.  The one time there's financial advice and you missed it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Remember in Demolition Man that all restaurants were Taco Bell?

He just said that all stores will eventually be GameStop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said he likes the stock

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He said, to paraphrase, he likes the stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hardly know what he said because he speaks in a cadence of a lush

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said something about gamestop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a shame there's not a lower volume.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He said hold and buy more GME.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds better that way!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only volume I care about is the type which forms those massive green dildos
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the only way to stomach this motherfucker
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They have to be on our side so when they tell us it's over we know our best interests are in their hearts.

I just have to point out that since you said *apart* you're essentially saying the opposite, since something that is apart of something else means they are not a part of each other.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge King and that bitch Carole Gamestop
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tiger King was already the business version of the tiger king. Cat business.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Some say Katy perry wrote the song Hot and Cold about him and his stock picks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You notice that too? Kind of like when he craps on growth stocks in the morning then tells you to buy Shopify in the evening
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes he is the Stephen A Smith of stocks. He's hype and hot takes not financial advice.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Dude switch side base on his position.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I haven‚Äôt listened to him since he made the Bluth company a ‚Äòdon‚Äôt buy‚Äô
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah, but I do encourage averaging down. More shares is mo better!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guy, average down if you can."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, a lot of people didn't know 2008 was coming, hence why it happened like it did









but I guess now that I made this comment I'm going to have redditors who were probably in diapers in 2008 tell me how obvious it was that it was gonna happen"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Verrrry fuckin true. This screech sounding fuck is a lightning rod for fuckery.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on banks is what the hedges are gonna do. Watch it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I thought for a second he breaks out in tears when realising how bright the future of Gamestop actually is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's how boomers convey their conviction because they're bad at lying and manipulating. I thank them for smacking me in my head and telling me to quit whining when I was trying to get my way when I was younger. Now, I can see right through their bullshit instantly.

 His tone is like, ""Listen to me, trust me... You hear the emotions behind my voice?! This is because what I'm saying is true and I believe it. Don't you? DON'T YOU? C'mon please? Reason with me here and believe me!"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like his voice ngl
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe the C-Suite of Gamespot is just handing over lots of retail investors' money to other C-Suites so they'll reciprocate in the future.  

What business plan could save Gamespot in any recognisable form given how game distribution is going digital?  it already has gone digital for the PC."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been that way since the incident

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ape buy, ape HODL. This is the way."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just heard ape buy.

Ape buyed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha. Oh man this is one of the best insults I‚Äôve heard in a long time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,One of my finest recent moves was selling my AMC position at $13 and getting more GME a couple days later at $120-130
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And then there‚Äôs BB which shouldn‚Äôt be a meme at all but is also being walloped by AMC lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But their CEO got a huge multi million dollar bonus. That means they are doing good right? ü¶ç
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"In the future GME will be evaluated at $1000+ on fundamentals alone, and everyone on Reddit will still be arguing over if the squeeze has been squoze, but we‚Äôll be doing it from our yachts"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I still think AMC has potential, but they need to just clean house and put in all new management.  I was figuring around $10 a share if they had a great summer, but most of the current rise is just due to the correlation to GME, and if it's riding high when it decouples, lots of people are going to be left holding while management spends their bonuses.  I've stepped away from it for a while, and may play it again midsummer if they're doing things.  They have avenues for growth and profit, but I'm no longer confident in the current management."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish AMC holders could read this comment objectively and go and do some serious DD. I'm sure many traders have made great gains with it, but the blind holders are in for a difficult ride. The company is destined to fail, unless they fire their top execs and evolve their business model."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope so. I bought in at $339 like an absolute imbecile, and I‚Äôm holding with diamond hands. I also bought BB at almost $20 and that shit is below $10 now. Totally meme disaster stock IMO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought in at $90 after the initial boom started to dip hard. I only did it when I saw they started hiring executives from Chewy and other extremely well run companies. The recent housecleaning only further solidified the decision in my mind. 

I know it‚Äôs not exactly retarded to invest in a company that has great assets but shit management right as soon as they start to change management, but that was the first sign something real is going on at GameStop."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,20 shares of AMC at almost $13/share. i bought back in too quick. dying to dump this shit. it‚Äôs deadweight
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He really looks like one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, it's pointless listening to him, he's all over the place.

One day he pees out of the front-hole of his diaper like a good retard and the next day he shits all over himself again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He hasn't slept since '86
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Really because everything he says will happen the opposite happens
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao not in a million years
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We‚Äôre don‚Äôt want this snake
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's the reverse psychology 4D chess move he is making.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I truly think he's had a stroke and his voice is slurred.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds like an awkward 15yo who only dropped one of his balls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure if that was intentional or not, but the voice of Yoda *is* the voice of Grover, so... yeah."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jar Jar?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He sounds a little like glen from Superstore in this (and Glen sounds a LOT like Kermit the frog so similar green but way less sage)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like the stock, I do hmmf"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GROVER is so spot on
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that's caffeine and some other white substance
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's uncomfortable unless he has some buzzer sound effects he can fondle while he talks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Agreed, I tried to listen to his podcast earlier in the year and could barely make it halfway through one episode. Not sure how anyone can pay attention to that guy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I forgot what he said cause i try to not remember what he says.

I don't care what happens. I believe the process. I trust the apes. I know that this company will outperform what's expected and organically grow, **forcing a margin call** on the idiots that shorted this thing to oblivion. 

I've been here since $35 (the first time). Rode the wave to \~$500, then rode that bitch back down to $40. Took it hard for a day or two, then realized there's no fucking way they covered. Hodl. And here we are, I've averaged up to a number I don't care to admit, and although it's still green, I know this stock has more in her. I'm not fucking leaving. 

&#x200B;

**To Melvin, Citadel, and all other shorties -** Take your time. Bleed yourself dry. Wait until the SEC/DTCC call you and order you to cover. I don't care how it ends, but I know that there will be an end. Until then, I'll keep averaging up or down to my liking. And with the very obvious timed daily drops, I know when to buy my daily/weekly shares. I will own a lambo, compliments of you.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why I Like the Stock: A Personal Anecdote

I have a monthly subscription for my dog's stupid expensive prescription food, through Chewy. Had a notification it was delivered on the 26th - but it's nowhere to be found. Emailed Chewy and let them know on Sunday the 29th.
Less than 10 minutes after sending that message, I got an email saying a new shipment was on its way. Immediately followed by an email from a customer service rep apologizing and letting me know they sent a replacement free of charge. Fucking rad, that's some of the quickest and best customer service I've ever gotten online. 

BUT THEN. The package showed up (on a neighbor's porch. They don't like me very much so they hid it for a couple days I guess). 

I emailed Chewy back and told them it was here, apologized, and asked them to cancel the new order if it's not too late. They replied (again, insanely quickly), saying it was probably too late to cancel, but ""we would greatly appreciate it if you took the time to donate the food to a local animal shelter or rescue.""

If this is the attitude and service that Ryan Cohen (and now more of his Chewy cohorts) are bringing to GME, I am all fucking in."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"After reading the DD about hedge funds abusing the MMs ability to create phantom shares for puts as a hedge I took a look at monthly maturities for contracts.

Pretty much every single monthly maturity has a put to call ratio of 3+ and they're all for under $10 normally around 60k contracts but 07/16/2021 has a ratio of 6.7 and 170k contacts for a $10 strike.

I am thinking they purchased these contacts as gme was approaching $10 to use the phantom shares to short gme and then execute the puts and use those shares to cover their shorts and then they just continue the process.

As these $10 are all going to expire worthless I am assuming they are going to have to start buying shares to cover the phantom shares they shorted? I am also thinking they don't have the capital to pay premium to create more phantom shares this way.

Thoughts?

EDIT: I'm pretty high, most don't have a ratio of 3+, still looks off though the ones with loads of $10 strike puts"

Their goal isn‚Äôt to manipulate the stock price, it‚Äôs to manipulate the hype. When we get hyped up more people buy, even new comers. Then the next day when it‚Äôs red people panic sell because they‚Äôre convinced GME is dead. It‚Äôs literally a short ladder attack on hype."

We need this for long whales to be able to use delta hedging for moon launch. Its ver clear longs are aiming for this. Even signalling their continued presence in opening and closing of the market, and only waking up if correction is needed. We will close close to where we opened the entire week. Im telling you. 

If you think ""big green"" is good and red is bad.... please understand that its not that simple. A big 40% spike in the green can actually delay the squeeze for us lol...you cant look at it as simple as ""we need it go up""

So many of you idiots are setting yourselves up for dissapointment and ""getting tired"" paperhanding because you're cheering the wrong things OR dont see good things happening because theyre different from what you expect.

HOLD! Even if it takes a year from now.
Yes. Im serious, that's the mentality You should have. You impatient bitches are with your minds in the lambo dealership but you dont have the mentality OR mental dedication to see this thing through.

[Billions in Secret Derivatives at Center of Archegos Blowup](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/billions-secretive-derivatives-center-archegos-102415242.html)

One wonders if Hwang was in the same bed with Citadel.

>Much of the leverage used by Hwang‚Äôs Archegos Capital Management was provided by banks including Nomura Holdings Inc. and Credit Suisse Group AG through swaps and so-called contracts-for-difference, according to people with direct knowledge of the deals. It means Archegos may never actually have owned most of the underlying securities -- if any at all.

If this whale tanked 7 ""in the money"" stocks covering his margin call, what were his losses in? Trading default swaps?  Perhaps giant leveraged derivative bets on a GME BK maybe?  Did WSB going long GME sink this guy in addition to Citadel?  What's the next shoe to drop?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Guys sideways trading is good for us. Brings down IV and helps option chains to form.

We need this for long whales to be able to use delta hedging for moon launch. Its ver clear longs are aiming for this. Even signalling their continued presence in opening and closing of the market, and only waking up if correction is needed. We will close close to where we opened the entire week. Im telling you.

If you think ""big green"" is good and red is bad.... please understand that its not that simple. A big 40% spike in the green can actually delay the squeeze for us lol...you cant look at it as simple as ""we need it go go up""

So many of you idiots are setting yourselves up for dissapointment and ""getting tired"" paperhanding because you're cheering the wrong things OR dont see good things happening because theyre different from what you expect.

GME has no obligation to entertain you. She cook you nice tendies though but only if you patiently hold her"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">	GameStop's executive hiring spree continued on Tuesday, with the company adding a former Amazon.com executive and two alums of Chewy.
    
    Elliott Wilke will be GameStop's chief growth officer. GameStop (ticker: GME) said Wilke held a variety of senior roles at Amazon over the past seven years. He will start at GameStop on April 5.
    
    The company also brought on Andrea Wolfe to be its vice president of brand development and Tom Petersen for vice president of merchandising. Wolfe was previously vice president of marketing at Chewy (CHWY), while Petersen was a vice president of merchandising.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Housing crashes and stock market crashes don't always go hand in hand. Actually, I think usually they don't. People just seem to associate the two since 2008 was the biggest economic crash since the Great Depression and it happened on the back of securitized mortgages.

2008 was fairly unique in that it was a market crash precipitated by housing speculation and a fraudulent housing market.

Houses are expensive now, but the housing market is very, very different from 2008. Mortgage lenders are still exercising discretion, buyers are more cautious, and the overall quality of existing mortgages is higher than in 2008. Millennials took the reins from Boomers as the largest generation, and they are mostly in their 30s now and starting to buy homes, creating a demand that outstrips supply, driving prices up.

What they are writing about in this article leading to a stock market crash might barely be a blip in your housing market, it might cause housing to stagnate for a bit, it might cause a housing crash, or it literally might not affect housing at all.

EDIT: I'd also note that housing is on a pretty predictable 18-year cycle, as far as investment fortune-telling goes. It isn't exact, but barring a huge economic event or global catastrophe, it's usually in that ballpark. The pandemic could have been a catalyst that set off a crash early, and it still might be, but it doesn't look like it at this point. We are still a few years ahead of the 18-year mark. If you see the beginning of the Great Recession as properly starting in 2006, we'd be due for a housing crash in 2024, but that can vary by a few years in either direction. If we hit a crash now, we'd be front-running the cycle by quite a bit, not that this can't happen, especially with how crazy things have been in the last year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The housing market is dummy nuts right now. 

Shitbox 2/1 in need of a full rebuild in a shitty neighborhood in so/fla $350,000

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, everything‚Äôs shut down around here yet the housing market is short in inventory causing everything to surge upwards when no ones working."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won‚Äôt happen in the same way. They aren‚Äôt dishing out loans like 2006 and there‚Äôs loads more regulation for the banks due to burned hands. 

Some places the market is collapsing (San Francisco and NYC etc) but firstly that‚Äôs always been expected due to insane prices and secondly more of a cultural thing as people don‚Äôt want to live in expensive shitholes just for work. Other areas are just going to benefit instead."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If I could find a wayyyy..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My guess is at some point last year they lobbied for more leverage with the banks because we were in the middle of the biggest bull run ever.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a good point but you have to remember that the western financial markets had MORE THAN A LITTLE leeway before the shit went down. Markets were still on record highs for days after the first couple cases began appearing in several countries in europe & usa states, while china was rocking 100k+. With everything that was known about the virus's long incubation period, people had plenty of time to short the shit out of the markets. I went out with large investments days before the crash hit because I was so caught up about the virus. I can't believe hedgies would be completely ignorant about what was happening in china at the time either."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, some people were really confused thinking a brokers job was to buy and sell stock on behalf of investors.

Hordes of people were able to keep working, unaffected by the pandemic, and still consider buying homes while interest rates were at historic lows, and they got a few cash infusions along the way. I know my job wasn't affected, and I have a white collar job and work at home. During the pandemic my neighbor who does construction was still working and he installed a swimming pool and remodeled his entire backyard.  Most people were still working and still getting paid.

It isn't too hard to see why housing is going up. People were getting loans for sub 3%. If you were looking at houses for $400k at 4%, at 2.7% you can bump the price up to $470k and still have the same monthly mortgage payment."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You mean that a rate hike will crash the housing market? It might. I doubt it would cause a severe crash though, but maybe a 15-20% that recovers over a few years. There are just so many people looking to buy homes now, and not  enough new construction. 

We might not see another housing crash like 2008 ever again in our lifetimes. If you were still employed and could get a loan, that was probably THE time to buy for generations (if you are talking about maximizing value for price). My buddy bought his house at the bottom of the market because he had a stable job in government. He paid 25% less for his bigger, nicer house in a much more desirable neighborhood than I paid for my house three years ago.

When I look at the monthly moving home sales average where I live, it is in the exact same range it has been in since 2009 started the recovery, whereas volume was WAY higher pre-2008.

I think what might tip things is a flood of foreclosures if a large amount of unemployed homeowners who have been delinquent since the recession started lose their homes when the moratorium ends.

That could put a lot of houses on the market and drive prices down.

But who the hell knows. Housing markets are also local. Some places never lose value, even in hte midst of a huge crash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait have people returned to variable rate loans?!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rate hike vs 60 day loan locks...the 2.5% rate locks are expiring fast.  Housing prices will come down if the Fed doesn't inject that sausage into that juicy prime rate ass...

Demand is high, inventory low, building supplies are hit with shortages...it's a weird limbo market, if you need to buy you don't have a choice.  If you don't have to sell, you don't.  Rental properties can't move, cuz who wants to rent to someone who won't have to pay, and if you list with a non-owner occupier you won't sell.

This all goes away with the vaccination for covid...BUT... mortgage rates absolutely affect pricing.  2.5->3.5% is a big enough jump that it should drop prices a bit but inventory isn't going to jump either.  Should turn down the price heat a bit."

The sellers are probably kicking themselves right now for letting it go to us for the price that they did. I knew that they would feel uncertain about markets and be anxious to get it off their hands, and so we under bid their asking price and they met us in the middle. Now we have already seen $10k increase in equity in less than a year..."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thing is, it‚Äôs hard to tell. It‚Äôs a little like timing the stock market (though it‚Äôs more predictable than the stock market).

Might be you wait now and in a year everything dumps 20% and you hop in.

Might be you wait and in three years it only loses 15% in a crash, but in that time it gained 17%, and you still aren‚Äôt saving money.

It‚Äôs tough to predict. I bought my house in 2018 and it‚Äôs already up by almost 25%, but I bought then because I thought prices were getting high again and interest rates were historically low (they were) and would go back up (they didn‚Äôt, yet).

Still turned out to be a good purchase, but my reasoning turned out to be a little off. My area didn‚Äôt get back to pre-2008 prices again for ten years, so I basically bought at close to the 2008 peak, but after 10 years of inflation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd buy a house at today's prices, I just don't want to deal with such an insane seller's market.  It's stressful just thinking about it, and then you have that constant uncertainty if your offer does get selected that you offered too high and could have saved money.  When I bought my house in '08, I had 5 competing offers.  My sister just sold a house and she had 25 offers and it was on the market for 1 day.  I'll wait till things cool off for better or worse."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. I sold at the end of the call and I‚Äôm kind of regretting it. Oh well, profit is profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah I see, thank you."

So doing the math, someone just made a $32,000,000 bet on GME going down to 175 by April 1st?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME goes down, we buy. GME goes up, we buy. GME goes sideways we buy. GME undercooks chicken, we buy. GME overcooks fish, we buy. GME doesn‚Äôt cook at all, believe it or not.... we buy"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He couldv'e just handed me the money directly. No need for this.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I could live very comfortably at $34 mil. I‚Äôd even have room for a bunch of y‚Äôall retards on my private island.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs ballsy I will give them that.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Went to the website to check it out and saw that there‚Äôs an enormous wedge for $690 Calls expiring 4/1. That‚Äôs the one I care about. I love you fools.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That pie chart makes me want to stab myself in the eyes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Assuming max pain is the most powerful recent driver of GME, looks like we got a good shot at going above 250 this week!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Listen up Retards - 

NO STOP LIMITS TODAY
DONT LIKE THE FIRST DIP - Wait till Noon

and for the Love of Mike, 
Use LIMIT ORDERS WHEN YOU YOLO !"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I just sent application to start transfer to fidelity from RH. Should I cancel or let it ride
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Apparently someone desperately wants to lose money ü§î
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Those $250 puts are the wall HFs put up to keep the price down. Need a shit ton of buys to happen to  break through it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I was smarter to understand this post
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dated april first....april fool???
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is what they have gone full retard today with the shorts and all the good news coming
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could be a put sell, so this person buys shares at that price from put buyers. Doesn‚Äôt mean a bet against might be a bet with GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guh will be heard around the flat earth
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bye bye $32 million dollars. That's insane.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not a bad play considering all the shares that were borrowed this morning.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a perfect bet to make on a day where GME announces a hiring from Amazon and two other from Chewy. Someone is getting desperate
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm really surprised that any fund that‚Äôs been watching this stock be manipulated all over the place would take a large bet from the house doing the manipulating that the stock would be any price. That‚Äôs straight up theft. Would you bet me 50 million that my next poker hand would be 4 aces if I was then allowed to go into another room and come back with 4 ace cards that weren‚Äôt even from the deck I was playing with?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"lmao poor dude, he's rich, but he's about to be 34 mill less rich"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got this covered guys.  Just bought 100 shares.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not today, April 1st is the expiration."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What goes down...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a good exit strategy for that put holder.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,5 bucks says they're naked puts anyways
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Might be hedging
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are two possible answers for Ur question, 
First YES, We need to HODL, and buy dip! 
Second NO, We need to HODL!
I go to do some useful shit today ü¶ßüíé‚úãüèº I mean real shitüòÇ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Over 3 million borrowed etf
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll bet this guy (or gal) is pissed that GME Waited til this morning to announce their new Chief Growth Officer from Amazon!!! Lmao, poor dude (or dudette)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I understand correctly, brake even price is ~175?   
   
Could it be interpreted as bullish in certain scenario? If the put is naked, someone is either pocketing premiums or buying GME at 175. Do I read it right? I'm new to options and I'm from EU so I can only learn options in theory."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[mine shows something different ](https://ibb.co/nRPvFBj)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart move. I can definitely see it going down. Alot
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,250. Strike price though... Doesn't that suggest they believe it'll increase but ultimately settle at 250?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha.. what. a. retard.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't look good for that guy premarket
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Im a new ape, can someone explain what this means for GME?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME has GREAT news today: GME has top Amazon execs to fill Chief Growth Officer and hires 2 Ex Chewy Execs!!!üöÄ
The guy who shorted sure picked a bad day!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, let's teach this person what it's like to be a WSB retarded ape. Just moved fresh money to buy any dips today."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What a damn second? What is the number of FTDs that needed covering? Holy Guacamole! Is this the answer we have been looking for? 

Please somebody tell me I‚Äôm wrong!!!


Are they buying naked puts to keep the cost basis low? Then recycling those shares to cover FYDs?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be an iron condor play, we don't have all the information. GME has been fairly flat lately..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All buy in all market conditions
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a bought account. Painfully obvious
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So guys we are making sure we are gonna get some great loss porn right?

Now all we have to do is convince the guy who got all those puts to post here..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not necessarily a bet.  Evidence suggests that whales (both long and short) have been influencing the price through buying options to force MM to delta hedge in a desired direction.  Such a large OI of puts at a strike higher than the current price acts as a barrier of resistance, in the opposite way that call options act as ramps."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn‚Äôt someone also buy 30 mil of 12c not too long ago?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This looks like the abstracted shares Matt Kohrs is looking for.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GUH
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That person must not have got the memo that it is a short trading week.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember that puts are used as a form of insurance to limit loss. This could just be a big whale that owns a bunch of stock.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right?  GME forgot the fucking lamb sauce a couple nights ago, made me buy another share. I don‚Äôt understand the connection but I like the stock so ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you're saying ... to ... ... buy?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buying GME...that's a paddling.  Not buying GME, oh most definitely that's a paddling"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where is the link to that video with Fred Armisen? Ape need laugh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This calls for the Venezuelan jail video
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have the greatest stock in the world, because of BUY"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme shoots Up or neighborhood, we buy gme"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP is misleading or ignorant.

Does not state puts bought or sold.

States it was a bet today - on top of it being impossible for there to have been options volume already today, there was no (exceptionally minimum) volume on this strike for days. This play finalized a week ago. Has been discussed

They‚Äôre either hoping enough of you don‚Äôt know how to look these things up or need to watch some ‚Äúhow do options work‚Äù videos on YouTube.

Edit: sorry for the hijack.  Correcting Misinformation from any motivation, naive or otherwise, should be encouraged IMO. We cannot just have aggressive titles then leave out the literal important bits and change other bits. Mistakes happen. No need to be emotional. Do your dd.

Please don‚Äôt witch hunt. Please consider all dd and do your own dd. Learn more and become stronger. The yacht isn‚Äôt going to buy itself. Apes together strong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But where's the loss porn in that?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you‚Äôre going to ask us to build you a house and plumbing, to keep your sex cult going on this godforsaken island. We‚Äôll get tired of eating roaches and birds after a few weeks. Who buys an island and can‚Äôt even furnish it? This is worse than Fyre Fest."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I get $2.5 mil my wife and I can retire at 60. If I get $10m my wife and I don't have to work another day and my kids are setup for life too.

If I had $32mil I would never think about money again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that‚Äôs what epstein told me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk wtf they think. Someone made sure they finish in the max bleed area for a week and suddenly they are like..... Today we try the same shit again.
Show em who's dadda Blackrock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just that. There‚Äôs a stepping ladder of calls going all the way up.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"that's probably converted shorts, same as the 800c"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,*proceeds to buy at noon in my timezone* Ok!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started a transfer through fidelity 7 days ago with the estimated time of completion as today. As of this minute, it has not completed...RH really trying to hold me back."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you have an cash deposits still pending? 

I did when I started mine and RH fucking canceled it without saying anything as to why. Had to wait for it to clear first. Process took 2.5 weeks for me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone paid $75 to be able to sell it at $250 anytime between now and April 1st.
So they really only profit if it goes below $175 on expiry."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's simple. When you buy an ""in the money"" put option a moneymaker needs to leverage your bet. You could basically see an ITM put as an alternative way to sell a 100 shares to keep the price down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs confusing about it ü§®
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Price has to drop 15$ for it start printing. And then it doesn't really print that fast because the premium was so high.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Was it on iBoRroWdeSK? Did it say when the shares will be used amd for what too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My broker denied me - https://i.imgur.com/SwiAZal.jpg

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had the cash and wrote the put naked, then yes it's a way to have a break even of $175. Gonna be on the hook at $250 but you got paid $75 to do so.

If you bought the put then your hoping for lower than 175 anytime between now and April 1st."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,After the board overhaul and with the shorts being dumped yesterday? What is your reasoning? All of retail sells after the news they have expected to come out for weeks?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs more than likely that this is bullish - put != bear, call != bull unless you‚Äôre taking about FDs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No it‚Äôs a put so to be ITM it needs to be below 250. Probably below 170ish to break even
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It means you hold.

And snicker a little at someone who is going to undergo a serious wallet-vacuuming."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How about a reverse iron butterfly

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheap? Even 400c for April 9 are $4 premium.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,transfer will take a few days. Squeeze will take several weeks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so the stock is trading $185 let's call it. 
Right now someone agreed to sell it at $250 a share.
That's way over what it's worth right now right .
So to compensate they had to pay $75 to sell it at $250. 
So effectively that person only makes money when the price goes 250 (the strike)-75 (the premium)= below $175 (the break even)

So that was the person who bought the put. 

The other side of the transaction assuming they own no shares (naked)
They agree to buy the shares at $250 anytime between now and expiry. 
For agreeing to this, someone paid them $75. 

So let's say it goes to $300. 
Someone isn't going to let them buy at $250 when it's worth $300. So the option isn't exercised. The buyer loses that $75 premium they paid, the writer gets to keep it. No shares trade hands. 

If it goes to $100. 
The writer received the $75 we talked about originally but now receives gamestop at $250. Their effective breakeven is $175. 

The buyer of the put paid that $75 and got to sell their shares at $250. Despite the fact the stock is $100.
Shares do exchange hands in this scenerio. 

Hope that helps"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Someone paid 75$ x 100 shares (premium) for a put contract that gives them the right to sell 100 shares at 250$. They only profit if the stock goes below $175 however because 250-75=175. If the stock does not go below 175 by the date, this put contract will expire worthless."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's why the shorts are trying to keep us at the 180ish range right now.  By the end of the week they want to be able to push us below 175.

>The hiring comes after the videogame retailer recently added Chewy co-founder Ryan Cohen to its board. Mr. Cohen had urged the company to shift away from its bricks-and-mortar centric business model and instead focus on e-commerce and other technology-driven operations. This month, the company's board tapped Mr. Cohen to lead a committee dedicated to transforming the retailer. 

>Mr. Wilke held various senior roles at Amazon, including in Amazon Fresh and Prime Pantry. He will oversee growth strategies and marketing, focusing on customer loyalty and expanding the company's use of customer insights and metrics for marketing, GameStop said Tuesday. 

>The company said it hired Andrea Wolfe, who previously served as Chewy's vice president of marketing, as vice president of brand development, and Tom Petersen, previously Chewy's vice president of merchandising, for the same role at GameStop, both effective March 29.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This honestly has changed my opinion of GME from a short-term play to a much better long-term outlook.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will say that buying game shit from amazon is not a safe experience. Id like to see them have more competent competition. They let too much counterfeit items and bullshit through. 

Nearly every time the codes for digital items has already been redeemed. I dont know if thats a common thing, though. wouldn't be surprised if kids just type random shit all day long."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> But for a company that's trying to become the Amazon of gaming

How much success did Amazon have by focusing on books when there was hardly any competition? How is Gamestop going to become the 'Amazon of gaming' when there is tons of competition?

I realize there wasn't a lot of thought put into this in the first place considering you're comparing a company with a single focus to Amazon, so I could be asking a lot."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What can they do that amaZon can't tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, Amazon certainly cant get their gaming shit together as they've basically aborted their attempt."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hate to burst everyone's bubble, but GameSpot is trying to become steam which is already the major player in the market, and unfortunately is not public. Steam is by far the best platform for digital game content and gme will never take that from them. 

They are not a good long term play. Only value is from hedges being dummies. After the ride is over, gme will eventually go back down to what it is worth."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The Amazon of Gaming"" already exists and it's called Steam, Epic, GoG etc. If it was so easy to create a one-for-all platform I'm sure one of these companies would have already achieved it in the past years. I seriously doubt that gamestop can do it now out of nowhere. Console games will also be moving to digital only so all there is left for gamestop to sell is accessories, consoles and merch.

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong, I believe in the squeeze and I believe in a bullish future for gme but they definitely will never be the ""Amazon of gaming"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have they stated they want to be the Amazon of gaming? Not sure what they could bring to the table, there's plenty of places to buy gaming hardware. Amazon works because you can buy *everything* on it. Best Buy works because they have a wider focus on all kinds of tech from cameras to TVs to drones to gaming. Gamestop focuses only on gaming and specifically only console gaming. They ignore PC gaming which has exploded the last 12 months, even with new console launches. Idk. I'm not begging for them to go under but I don't know how they'll pivot to be relevant with a narrow focus in a dying market, especially once their stock frenzy dies down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how likely is the short squeeze?

Something about the positions being vacated and the replacements, gives me a bit of a pause.. obviously, they want to remake the company, but it seems that they're unloading all the people who actually know retail.

Set up a game calendar so you can see what's coming out, and then click on it to see all released news/trailers for it and related games or games from the same developer, and customise the calendar so you can easily see which games you want and set reminders. 

Just try to make it a place that when you think of games, you think of them. Not about news or articles or reviews, only the actual games and the buying of games, and official news by the developers."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I reference to this, I went digging deeper after initially spreading news of the upcoming interview. It seems it is a private event available (possibly paid) to those with access to Bloomberg, but the claims in the initial post about the one in October don't line up, and there is no information other than the screenshots:

**Upon deeper digging I could find no public record of the 21 Oct 2020 interview referenced in the WSB post about a new Third Bridge interview tomorrow**


The OP's claim (see WSB link at the bottom) that that Oct 21 interview was where the Microsoft partnership was announced was incorrect, [as Gamestop released a press release on Oct 8.](https://news.gamestop.com/news-releases/news-release-details/gamestop-announces-multi-year-strategic-partnership-microsoft)
Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any details please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

Except everyone who's in an oversold position has been playing a shell game for months trying to hide that fact.

If they actually did a share recall for voting purposes, you basically are yelling 'STOP' and all the shells stop moving, and you start flipping over to see which shells really have GME under them.

If you *know* you don't have enough GME shares to put one under each shell, there's going to be a mad scramble to get some by everyone who's been playing the shell game.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stocks in general? 

No one ever can determine the true peak. I‚Äôm sure there are indicators that can point you in the right direction but I don‚Äôt know them. 

This is not the stock to be learning exit strategy‚Äôs though."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you are playing with volatility that has potential for 10-100xing and you wanna ""find the peak"" I usually recommend giving yourself a conservative estimate and a liberal estimate. On the conservative estimate (for example 5x up in value from your average buy in) you sell half of it to cover your initial, and some decent profits, and every 20-30% it goes up you sell 10-20% more to cash in on more profits while simultaneously riding the wave and keep doing this until the whole thing crashes. If it hits your more liberal estimate of what the absolute peak should be, you sell everything.

You'll likely make way more money than if you sold everything early, and you'll likely not end up a bagholder from trying to find the absolute peak and missing completely. Not fun being stuck with worthless stocks that were once up 10000%, having secured some profit always makes it sting less if you mess up even though unrealized profits also suck to lose.

Obviously you make wayyyyyy more money if you manage to find the bottom and sell exactly at the top, but if that was easy..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Volume is the best indicator but it's not fool proof. Basically, volume starts falling as the price gets too far away from it's perceived ""actual"" value. If the trend is downwards, people are holding their cash and waiting to buy at the bottom, and if the trend is upwards, people stop buying and wait to sell at the peak. So at the peak you'll see a decrease in volume and a significant divergence from the volume weighted moving average. Then there will be a burst in volume as people start selling. 

Of course, there are many other factors at play and actually timing the peak is impossible for GME. Milton Berg has basically built his career on timing the market and his company has thousands of indicators that they track. Trying to do what he does but with just one crazy volatile stock would be insane. Here's a good video with him if you're interested. https://youtu.be/zmP_uiNeiZk"

After the meeting in June everyone can start pricing the company more realistically. 

The real question is how long it takes us to get back there. This squeeze is going to affect the true value of the stock for quite a while i imagine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was just pointing out DFVs apparent propheticness. His OG thesis was that GME was a good investment and that the bearish, GME going the way of blockbuster sentiment was wrong. The squeeze was just the cherry on top.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A company doesn't recall shares, the shareholders are the ones that recall their shares. GME can't force them to do it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is wrong. A company does not recall shares. That isn‚Äôt a thing. You as a shareholder can recall your lent shares before a shareholder vote. Or your broker can recall your lent shares if they vote on your behalf. There is no such thing as a company recalling shares.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well put.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was thinking of GME specifically as a start lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No problem man. All apes here together. All I know is that voting allows them to add 500 more shares which basically doubles the float. They can not do this until may 5th so it shouldn't affect the squeeze but we will see. Good luck in the markets!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a lot of misinformation in your post
 
1.	While yes, Sherman had to fight an uphill battle to change the company, he doesn‚Äôt need the board‚Äôs approval. And short positions don‚Äôt prevent the CEO from making changes.
 
2.	Hestia Capital has a long position in GameStop, not a short position. Them owning about 3.3 million shares is how they were able to get a board member in the end.
 
3.	Kurt Wolf is their member on the board, and he has experience with technology companies. He is a strong advocate for the switch to e-commerce, which is why Hestia wanted a board member.

I did my research"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Si
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Point taken. My mistake. However if a company does decide to do a share holders vote for change of policy wouldn't that force the broker to determine who the true shareholders are by forcing the broker to recall the shares etc....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yea dawg i think ima trust the democratic process on this one..

Hold as long as you can but don‚Äôt get stuck being a bag holder if you can‚Äôt afford it. 

I‚Äôm personally willing to just hold and average down if for some reason the squeeze never happens. I like the stock. Other people in other situations financially have to take their own situations into account.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You need to check with your broker to know how they handle voting rights. Some brokers will vote on your behalf, some give you the right to vote. It will be in your terms of service. If your broker retains the voting rights then it is up to them to recall the shares. If they would prefer to just keep collecting interest on lent shares then they won‚Äôt recall lent shares, this is what Blackrock did last year for GameStop AGM, and why there was no squeeze at that time."

And here's the proxy statement

>HOUSTON, March 26th, 2021 ‚Äì Microvast, a leading global provider of next-generation battery technologies for commercial and specialty vehicles that recently announced a planned business combination with Tuscan Holdings Corp. (Nasdaq: THCB), today announced the intial delivery of battery systems to French bus manufacturer SAFRA in Albi, France. Microvast will provide SAFRA with three standard certified battery products for its full electric and hybrid buses, as well as for the refurbishment of the bus fleet over the next three years.

 

>Microvast collaborates with SAFRA to propel the electrification of French bus market

 

>Last October, Microvast was nominated as the battery supplier for the full-electric bus, hybrid bus, and the retrofit bus of the French bus OEM SAFRA. Under the framework supply agreement, Microvast will supply up to 2,000 battery packs from Microvast over three years, starting in March 2021.

 

>Key factors in the selection of Microvast were its standard and certified battery pack offerings that fulfill the technical requirements. The Microvast battery packs can be flexibly connected in serial and/or parallel to reach different voltage and energy levels.

 

>The high level of standardization and modularity can accommodate various project demands. Furthermore, Microvast battery packs are expected to be certified with ECE R100.2 by June 2021, so that the vehicle can conform to the ECE regulation.

 

>With the planned launch of SAFRA‚Äôs e-bus late this year, Microvast will further expand its footprint in the French e-bus market. Meanwhile, both parties are exploring further opportunities in the fuel cell bus and bus retrofit business. Since Microvast has the complete vertical integrated capability of battery design and production from material to turn-key solution, it can continuously upgrade its solutions by developing new high-performance cells to fit into the standard module and pack products."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was the only good part of Rich. So sad
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was prepped for that.  Tried handing someone returning a cart a quarter.  He was like no.   Wasn't even a rona thing.  Most peeps weren't masked including this dude.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bummer. It pops in my head more than I want to admit.

Just tried to do a spread on Fidelity and it turns out you need $10k in that account to do any trades that will have the effect of creating a spread.

But this is my fuck-around account so I'm not planning on dumping $10k in here yet. I'm still too poor for that.

Here's to hoping it doesn't take 4 tries with ETrade to get level 3 options from them üò´"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on a bear ETF. That‚Äôs some next level bullchad stuff out there. Leaps are ok to hold the portfolio but we need some radically market defiant stickers to gain momentum. Like what TSLA used to be.

Was it random or are they possibly going through some personal things?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean I‚Äôve definitely taken sometimes over a week but not sure of month. Have you just reached out once or several times? I turn the notifications off my WhatsApp too because of group chats so if someone msgs me I could miss it then take time to reply

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. Thanks. So many this year got it and seems to be as bad as when the flu hits. Honestly when it comes to kids I‚Äôd take this over stomach flu outbreaks

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If he is bullish on semiconductors for the mid-term then he hasn‚Äôt been doing enough DD. There‚Äôs a reason why it‚Äôs having trouble right now with the likely possibility that it‚Äôll get much worse. The next 6 month will basically decide if most of the tech sector will die or not. Worst part is that people are going to expect it to be resolved by May due to what is being said but realistically the needed remedy doesn‚Äôt usually come until July at the earliest.

Perhaps I was somewhat unclear. I can understand your frustration with people who are used to being spoon fed information that they could find on their own. And I wasnt asking you to post it because I was too lazy to look it up, I was merely confused as to why it needed to be a private message.

>If I post it, it‚Äôll probably cause people to overreact and sell off shit that aren‚Äôt actually related that I‚Äôm in right now that will get dragged down with it.

That being said, I don't think sharing it with this group of 10 to 20 people who some of which have had an interest in semiconductors for some time now, would cause a major sell off that would affect the rest of your investments. (or perhaps I'm wrong and u/richtofin115 is a much larger whale than I first thought) üôÇ

In the end, whether you choose to share it or not doesn't matter; I will do my own research, not because I don't believe you, but because I take pride in my ability to make decisions with an open mind and not just agree with the most popular opinion (even though I have before, because it IS the path of least resistance, after all)"

He also spent more than a decade at consumer goods giant Procter & Gamble PG, +1.57%.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work for a company that has incredibly strong ties to the automotive industry. Tomorrow‚Äôs infrastructure bill could be huge for EV. Here‚Äôs why:

The number one thing that is stopping electric vehicles from going mainstream is the charging stations. It‚Äôs pretty much a chicken and the egg scenario.

On one hand, you need charging stations to charge a car when you are on the road. However, these are very expensive for the OEMs. They recoup these costs by selling more EVs. But to sell an EV you need the charging stations.

Additionally, most OEMs tend to use their own proprietary plugs, adding to the complexity of this problem.

Thus, if we solve the problem of EV charging stations, we solve the problem for EVs going mainstream. I‚Äôve been hearing that EV charging stations are a big part of tomorrow‚Äôs infrastructure deal."

Essentially, they would take two canoes, and lash them together one on top of another. Holes would be cut out for the head, arms and legs. Then they would put the criminal inside, with their head and limbs hanging out. They would then force feed milk and honey to the prisoner (to induce diarrhea) and smear honey on their faces and limbs. Then they would put the boats out on a calm lake in the hot sun. The insects would get attracted to the honey, and the diarrhea, and lay eggs. The insects, and larvae would then eat the prisoner alive.  Sources say, one of the prisoners took 17 days to die.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The big story is still Archegos Capital. Yesterday I said this didn‚Äôt look like an LTCM-type of systemic event. This morning that view appears vindicated. 

Couple of reasons for this. For one, financial stocks would be on the front line of any massive unwind as many of these banks were/are counterparties not only to Archegos, but to its counterparties. But that fallout appears limited to Nomura and Credit Suisse. The XLF (ETF that tracks financials) is up 0.7% in the pre-market. 

Then you have the stocks that were at the center of Archegos‚Äô implosion (or cover images for the story, at least): Viacom and Discovery. Both saw extensive selling from Friday through yesterday but are up in the pre-market today: VIAC by about 6%, DISCA by 1.5%. (Yeah there are a bunch of Chinese internet stocks that also figured into this story, but they have other issues affecting them).

Finally, you have the news coverage of the story. These have moved on from what you would call ‚Äòfirst day‚Äô news pieces to post-mortem type of things. A quick sample of the headlines this morning:

* ‚ÄúHow Archegos‚Äô $20 billion decision led to banks‚Äô share prices tumbling‚Äù: CNBC;

* ‚ÄúWhat is Archegos and how did it rattle the stock market?‚Äù WSJ;

* ‚ÄúArchegos Capital blowup: What investors need to know‚Äù: Bloomberg;

* ‚ÄúGoldman U-turn on Hwang put bank at nexus of margin call‚Äù: Bloomberg;

Knowing a thing or two about newsrooms (from experience), I can tell you there is no way anybody would have time or interest to pursue projects like this if the bigger story about Archegos was still developing.  

Things could certainly still (d)evolve from here. There may be pockets of information about Archegos that could cause fear in the broader market. But for all intents and purposes, the story would appear to be done. In a few weeks you may have already forgotten about it.

Back to today‚Äôs markets: Ten-year yields have quietly climbed north of 1.7%. Maybe the inflation story will surface again"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do I have this right about the hedge fund domino-effect 

Market/ economic destruction might be unravelling. Here is how: (short term debt cycle & long term debt cycle)

Because of low interest rates funding investment with credit is very lucrative
-> 
hedgefunds get over-leveraged
-> 
Over-leveraged hedgefund get margin called.
They are forced to liquidate. Which means they sell a lot at once driving the price dratiscally down  (like seen in the blocktrades from our boy hwang)
-> 
This is bad if a lot of funds are over-leveraged. Because the total amount spend drives the market that is either paid by money or credit.

If you spend more someone else income increases. That means if someone spends less someone else‚Äôs income decreases. 

Credit is volatile.  if borrowers get margin called credit is wiped out. Credit wiped out equals less spending. 
-> 
Here you get a downward-spiral where one persons spending equals another persons income (over and over again) Less and Less spending will drive the market down."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering the stock hasnt been around that long, you've probably had your shares less than a year. Sometimes u think its gonna be a short gain, but it's a long game instead.  If u can afford to hold, hold. If you need the cash or dont want to risk more and think it will keep going down, sell.  If it were me, I would hold at least a year, unless I was confident I could make back that 35% quickly making other moves (which I have done before).  But one time I was down on GPRO and seriously did not look once in 6 months, logged it and I was up 100%.  Try not to panic!  It's only money!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk man, PLTR is one my strongest conviction plays. Most tech is down anyway and there isn't really bad news. Apr 14 demo day is near so if you really wanna sell it's best to wait a little more"

I thought I would share some tools with the community to help traders out  - starting with this simple ATR calculator

This will be helpful for any Apes that use stop losses as you can quickly calculate the average monthly range expected in a given stock, ensuring you don't set stop losses too tight and giving your ideas chance to play out

It's also helpful to anticipate expected gains. If the monthly ATR is 3% it would be unreasonable to expect the stock to move 20% over a 1 month period

This hopefully will help you to stay patient with your ideas and give you realistic expectations

Save a copy to your google drive and then there is only 2 inputs - Simply change the date (UK Format) to the 1st of what ever month we are in and change the Ticker (yellow boxes) everything else is auto

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"wow nice, thanks for this. I did see some articles on atr on trading view but didn't really understand it as it was too complicated

is the monthly atr reliable for day trading or should it be tighter?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I trade stocks not tools
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hi no problem. If you day trade you would want to calculate the daily ATR to find out the average daily range. I am going to share a more comprehensive sheet I'm working on which will calculate Monthly, Weekly and Daily ATR"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am also an uneducated ape.

To make sure I understand: 

price going up + ATR increasing is bullish

price going down + ATR increasing is bearish

ATR decreasing/staying low is sideways?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope. ATR is the average movement in the stock price over a given time frame. A daily ATR of 2% means the stock moves up or down by 2% on an average day. Therefore if you wanted to trade such a stock on a given day and was expecting a move from $2 to $3,  your probability of winning on that trade is very low because that would be a movement of 50%"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe I'm just dumb but that makes no sense.

If I'm trying to day trade for a 50% return, why would I even bother spending a microsecond on recent past data? 

The only way you're making 50% in a day is being ahead of the game on some big positive (or I guess negative with puts) news for a company that sends its stock to the moon. How is ATR going to help you?

On the other hand, if you're taking a longer term approach, and you've got a stock slowly gaining and ATR increasing, you could be more than 50% sure that the volatility will continue upwards... no? And vice versa?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a hypothetical example you obv wouldn‚Äôt be expecting 50% in 1 day. ATR can increase regardless of stock increasing or decreasing it‚Äôs just a measure of the average % range the stock moves over a given time frame. It‚Äôs not an indicator to get bullish or bearish on a given stock. It‚Äôs a guide to the average expected movement in the stock over a given time frame

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,John has a bunch of ties to huge companies throughout the world. BlackBerry is one of many mobility companies he courted during his Sybase run. He didn‚Äôt just lose those ties after he brokered the deal with SAP causing Sybase stock to rocket. The security technologies he has been pushing guarantee he‚Äôs been developing even further ties in the security community as well as the auto industry. I expect to see him broker a similar deal for BlackBerry merging with another company once the auto security tech takes off in the next couple years.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,gme dipped so I technically had.no choice.. Also by selling and reinvesting in gme made way more off that money then holding the stagnant bb. if only I didn't try doubling up my gme shares by selling and buying on the dips I'd still be up.. ya im retarded I know

Steel has been doing well too, particularly $X recently FYI"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're specialty is deep water drilling, they just released a new safety system and are making efforts to be 'greener' also, my current focus is it's squeeze potential the volume it's been averaging is less than half it's usual volume and when compared to  70m+ shares that are shorted that's like twice the average volume and 4x the average it's been at for the last few weeks, it's been hard to borrow which I'm pretty sure means there's a lot of short volume that's still left uncovered."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It went to 4.70 last time they started covering, so, that's like ~47% increase from where it's at now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmm very interesting. Any reason in your mind why it‚Äôs not a good medium term reopening play too? Either way you may have co cinched me to get some RIG!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's a decent medium play too, I have a really small account and I'm kinda planning on funneling some profits from this into VIAC; the Upper monthly Bollinger has a price target ~$6.30 which is almost double where it's at, looking at recent historical data aside from the covid dip it has traded between where it's at now and low $7 range; I'm not trying to get too greedy and it's literally 99% of my portfolio, so, I personally plan on diversifying a bit after it runs up. My break even is aroun $3.60 so I think I'll start taking profits around $4.20 depending on how the price action is going at that point if/when we're there."

Started my Trading career in Dec 2019 because of a moronic post here about $ACB and Coca Cola starting a CBD drink due to a video of a blind guy! We were true Autists back then!**

**ANYWAY...**

https://finance.yahoo.com/news/abcellera-reports-full-2020-business-200500028.html

**ABOUT THE COMPANY**

Ticker : $ABCL

Price : $23.29 ( At close, 29th) ; $27.70 (After Hours) 

Market Cap : $6.29 Billion


$ABCL (AbCellera Biologics Inc) best known for specializing in antibody discovery and partnering up with Eli Lilly and Co. ($LLY) on a COVID-19 treatment, raised US$555 million through a blockbuster initial public offering in December 2020. 

AbCellera is a technology company that searches, decodes, and analyzes natural immune systems to find antibodies that its partners can develop into drugs to prevent and treat disease. AbCellera partners with drug developers of all sizes, from large pharmaceutical to small biotechnology companies, empowering them to move quickly, reduce cost, and tackle the toughest problems in drug development.

Abcellera did better than most of it's fellow bio technology competitors by bursting out of the gate two years ago with a $30 million grant from the U.S. Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency under its Pandemic Prevention Platform to adapt and pressure test the company‚Äôs platform for responding to a real-world pandemic in less than 55 days. Caught up in a real pandemic in May 2020, Ottawa unzipped CA$175.6 million (US$124.7 million) to support Abcellera's discovery of antibodies for use in drugs to treat COVID-19.


**PETER THIEL JOINS AS A BOARD OF DIRECTOR AT ABCELLERA**

https://calgaryherald.com/pmn/press-releases-pmn/business-wire-news-releases-pmn/peter-thiel-joins-abcelleras-board-of-directors

‚ÄúAbCellera is executing a long-term plan to make biotech move faster. I am proud to help them as they raise our expectations of what‚Äôs possible,‚Äù said Mr. Thiel.

I Trust this man too much! This is primarily the main reason I have invested in this company! My first 300% was because of this man on $PLTR! 


**COLLABORATION WITH ELI LILLY ($LLY) TO CREATE BAMLANIVIMAB (COVID-19 ANTI-BODY)**

https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-authorizes-monoclonal-antibody-treatment-covid-19

Bamlanivimab (INN, codenamed LY-CoV555) is a monoclonal antibody developed by AbCellera Biologics and Eli Lilly as a treatment for COVID-19.

The drug is an IgG1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) directed against the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. The aim is to block viral attachment and entry into human cells, thus neutralizing the virus, and help preventing and treating COVID-19. 


**SUCCESS OF BAMLANIVIMAB**

Lilly announces agreement with U.S. government to supply 300,000 vials of investigational neutralizing antibody bamlanivimab (LY-CoV555) in an effort to fight COVID-19 

https://investor.lilly.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lilly-announces-agreement-us-government-supply-300000-vials

Lilly to supply 650,000 more doses of COVID-19 drug to U.S. government

https://www.google.com/amp/s/mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idUSKBN28C3AO

The Biden administration buys 100,000 doses of a combination antibody treatment for high-risk Covid-19 patients.

(The U.S. government previously agreed to buy nearly 1.5 million doses of bamlanivimab alone. Eli Lilly has delivered more than 1 million doses already, with the remainder to be delivered by the end of March. More than 660,000 doses of bamlanivimab have been shipped out to states and other jurisdictions.)

But with the arrival of recent variants like the South African one and the UK variant, Bamlanivimab seems to no longer work effectively but AbCellera and Eli Lilly has found a solution to the problem. 



**ABCELLERA AND ELI LILLY SOLVES THE VARIANT ISSUE BY COMBINING BAMLANIVIMAB AND ETESEVIMAB**

With bamlanivimab sales not costing them any more money to get (ie: pure profit from this point out) and buffering their bottom line to tune of hundreds of millions of dollars. If your $100M revenue costs you $90M to get, that's great. Their $200M revenue expected in Q1 will cost them nothing. Then think what happens if any of their other 102 programs in the works gets to market too.

They said they have \~$800M in the bank and earned $0.52 per share last year. Point me in the direction of another biotech company that's profitable, has a compelling growth story, and has cash on hand equal to 8 years of operating costs. Can't believe this guy is flying so low under the radar.

Disclosure: Long $ABCL."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Absolutely great question! This was raised on the earnings call by an Analyst.

The answer they gave is somewhat vague but understandable in their current position. They said that with the publication of their capabilities of developing a world class Covid-19 Anti-body in such a short amount of time, it would be inevitable that they would get other big companies to collab with them in the future.

One such example is Regereron. The project they are currently working on is undisclosed and is said to have a massive impact on their balance sheet. At this stage as a new Public company, we can only believe the management that they fulfil their promises down the line.

One other point mentioned was that even with 100+ projects their teams were not utilised 100%. So, even $10 mil from each of their clients or collaborators can yield revenues in the range of $1 bil per year. Add to the list that they don't have much expenses and can therefore have a bigger net profit margin than any other pharmaceutical or Biotech company. 

As I mentioned earlier, my main factor in investing here is Peter Thiel. That man rescued my portfolio, so I have a big trust in him!"

2021-03-30 08:39:48,wallstreetbets,"Spy-When to Buy. This isn't financial advice and I am not responsible for you blowing up your account.

TL:DR: I am going to BUY end of Month APRIL call contracts after 1-2% drop from 4/1 open. YOLO Stim money. 

Rule one of forecasting:  

***PAST PERFORMANCE ISN'T A INDICATOR OF FUTURE RESULTS.***

So you all saw the Graph telling you April is the best time to buy as it shows a 2% gain on average. While this is true what is left out is why April is higher. The reason April is higher is because it is were a lot of the bounce backs have occurred in April while March tends to suck.

I went and pulled all of Spy from 1993 to 2021 and this is what I found.

Spy mostly ends up back were it started between open and close but has large swings between days.

The months with the highest ratios being positive tends to be April and November for the data set as shown below.

As you can see from 1993 through 2020 April still had some red months but is it is mostly green dildos. 

Here is the actual Avg % gain between the first of the month and end of the month from 1993-2021 excluding outliers like the crash of 2020 in march and the recovery in April. Anything outside of -9% and 10% was an outlier.

Included is the avg % difference between the months lowest point and opening price for the month.

For the most part April stands a really good chance of being green but don't buy any options until SPY is below what ever it is going to be on 4/1 by 1-2% as current option contacts by the end of April have to move 1.5-2% for you to just break even. 

April tends to only increase by ~1.5% by close on 4/30.

 For you smooth brains this means you are likely fucked if you buy EOM contracts the first of the month. So wait for red day and then buy and enjoy the ride. 

If you time the lowest price in April the likely max price change you can get by the end of the month is 4% but there are years were it went up 8%.

This is what I am going to throw my stim money on and see what happens."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt spy going to take a shit when the market crashes ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,SPY is typically always stable it's almost impossible to lose money on it if you hold. I typically trade SPY credit spreads when the market is STABLE.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct but it doesn‚Äôt tend to take a shit in April. It tends to do that latter. 

Only times April was negative was mostly back in the 2000-2003. 

As the feds have the money printer and the Congress is looking at adding another 3 trillion and another round of checks it likely won‚Äôt happen next month. 

April could trade sideways but never has it gone but a few dollars from were it started."

\- about 70% of people I've asked have said smth along the lines of ""I look for an expiry date i like with low enough IV across the board, then kinda just wing it on determining strike based on the break-even"" (for buying options) or ""I look across multiple expiry dates for really high IV to sell those options""

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said they use spreadsheets, build sensitivity tables, and/or monte carlo simulation scripts to find an optimal trade

&#x200B;

\- about 15% said ""literally just YOLO""

\---

I'm building a tool that will automatically figure out the optimal strikes and maturities to buy/sell at, after you input your price target.

e.g. This is not my view but let's say hypothetically you think TSLA is worth $520,  with +/-$200 at 95% confidence interval .... what puts at what strike(s) should you consider buying to maximize ROI?""

There's a chance they also get regulatory approval by then due to their fleet, they'll only need like a couple weeks to a month to get enough data to turn in. FSD is a fucking game changer, ppl don't think Tesla can do it (or are behind say Waymo lol) and I think they can do it, are about to do it, and are gonna make a shit-load of money off it. At the same time though Tesla will be growing at 80+% for back to back years and revenue and profit margins are about to rocket. FSD will be solved, Berlin, Texas and Shanghai will be killing it... I don't know what's going to happen but this also feels like a dip so I went for it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">tots and pears

this is a boomer thread do i write lol?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They called Einstein retarded...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would consolidate if I were you into one of them, like the $900 strike... keep 50% in dry powder - CASH - not TSLA shares - and average in to the $900c position every time you‚Äôre down 30-40% by adding another contract from the dry powder. Just seems easier to manage. 2 years is enough time... I would also cash out once you‚Äôre 100% on this YOLO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn you know with that 250k you could have just kept it as margin on something super safe and sold weekly puts like 3% out of the money for tesla and made 10k per week at the current demand for puts.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He's got 50% more to go!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs pretty fucking retarded. So retarded that it may just work.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is in fact SO retarded that I‚Äôm honestly ashamed I was clearly not nearly retarded enough to think of this first
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right?  I don't understand how they could possibly go bankrupt at this point, but they might not have a much higher stock price than now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Elon can take us to mars, he can surely take us to the moon? So I predict Elon makes Tesla cars that can fly to the moon by 2023. This is a solid bet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only thing holding me back from doing this is being so close to transition to long term capital gains. Fuck.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why no wait to buy those Leaps when Tsla is at the bottom.  I think it still has a way to drop.  These are going to hurt if it goes down to $500s
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,regulatory approval? LOL what you smoking dude? they wont even allow manufacturers to replace side mirrors with cameras and you think they're gonna allow some dodgy car with software to drive itself?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> This is mainly a bet on FSD

Is someone going to tell them ?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be concerned about what happens when the EV credit sales dry up. That's been the only thing keeping em afloat for a while now

but yoyolo"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They will grow 10x by 2029
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought that but I was also like there‚Äôs no way he‚Äôs betting that far into the future so I second guessed myself.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you forgot r/vegetagang
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. Prob most helpful reply I‚Äôve received. üôå
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All‚Äôs I‚Äôve been hearing is other car companies will be making more affordable and better electric cars too (because of European regulations or something) so TSLA is going to free fall in these coming years. 

Though, these are stock experts on the news so they may be wrong. Godspeed OP."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or, another option is to buy good companies that are down 30% in three months right before they start killin it"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a casino
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy cocaine and buy more options? I like it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like this, first time I‚Äôve made this type of move and picking a strike price is hard, so I decided to do like an upper and lower bound with focus on the middle type of deal"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve sold puts, and will in the future as well, I‚Äôm in the market for growth right now though not income"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He might get there lol. I think he's been selling stocks that plummeted to buy ones that held steady, which then plummeted. Rotating his money from one loss to another & missing all the bounces."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can only get so retarded that it turns into genius, it‚Äôs like a videogame where once you hit a certain negative number of stats it turns into 9999. And the physics of the universe is maths right? So, it‚Äôs entirely possible."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might still have some time, I just didn‚Äôt wanna wait"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I was considering holding some back and waiting but I hate missing dips so I just did it to get it done. If it falls more I'm not concerned, the numbers will speak for themselves soon enough."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where have you been.
Tsla might as well be the gov‚Äôt for all the scrutiny they get = none.

That‚Äôs literally the last thing on earth I worry about is Uncle Sam crashing the party with oversight."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All in good time friend. And by ‚Äúin good time‚Äù I mean in three weeks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right as credit sales dry the Shanghai Model Y starts ramping, then Berlin, the Y prints money

Edit: obviously though the 3 is what‚Äôs keeping them afloat, the Y is for those margins"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So $200 stock then by 2029.   They have all the possible growth already priced in.  They are valued more than the top 9 car companies combined while selling a fraction of the cars at barely a profit.  You would need insane growth and profitability to justify today‚Äôs existing price let alone any increase in valuation.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He went full retard. He is his own wife‚Äôs boyfriend.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This needs to be a thing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla isn‚Äôt just cars. Also the other car companies don‚Äôt have Papa Musk. I actually think this is a totally safe bet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love reading articles like that. I also love ‚ÄúTesla is behind on fell self driving‚Äù, CNBC in general, business insider, TSLAQ, all that nonsense creates opportunities"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That range you selected won‚Äôt make a difference in terms of danger about worthless expiry until a couple months before they expire. So for the next 18 months or so you really only need to focus on one leveraged TSLA position ... managing 6 or 7 nearly identical positions is just a waste of time and complication in terms of averaging into a position..

Edit: you‚Äôll thank yourself later if you just focus on the 850c position and dump everything else... remember keep enough dry powder! Reason: 850c is intrinsically $200 more valuable than the $1050 so as we near expiry it‚Äôs literally worth $20,000 more per contrast if you‚Äôre sitting on those 850‚Äôs. Do it right man!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the income is 4% per week (theoretically you'd end up with 750k if it lasted a whole year like this) I'd count it as growth. Good luck finding a stock to do that much weekly growth. On the other hand if those calls print, of boy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The wsb circle of life.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The catalysts over the next month, if rumors and internal hype are any gauge, seem pretty massive. 

‚ÄúProbably in the next couple of months‚Äù is a big departure from the sandbagging stance Elon has taken over the past 1 - 1.5 years."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You are an inspiration and a scholar. Thank you sir
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The run up it had today suggests you timed this perfect.

Also, if it runs up enough between now and Q3you can sell higher calls for the same expiration at a crazy high level.  The call you sold will be ore expensive than the one you bought even though the duration is longer on the bought calls.  That guarantees the profit and if you get it to expire between the strikes you keep the sold call money and sell/exercise the in the bought call.  

Best of luck!  Wish I had the capital to follow you.  I think this is risky as hell, but its a risk with a thesis and appropriate payoff for the risk."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay, then explain how the insurance companies are going to act? 

and then: ""baby in road, car in other lane, what does the FSD do?"": A)kill occupants B) kill baby C) kill peeps in other car. What do YOU want it to do here? and then, subsequently, how do you deal with auto cars and manual driven cars on the same road? Will it always be the manual drivers fault? or did the FSD make some kind of decision that put itself there? 

Again, this slow rollout of FSD: is not a technology issue, its a litigation issue.

**NOTE**I cannot wait for FSD to be market wide, offers an opportunity to ditch the 2nd car in our family, not to mention my daughter and friends will be safer...etc. so i am not bashing the tech, just do not think this will be sorted in a year.**NOTE**"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm doing nothing but waiting now but I like the advice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Until you get exercised at a fat loss of course. The plan is to hit these calls, sell enough to exercise the rest, then sell the wheel. Now isn‚Äôt the time for my money to generate income but it will be in a couple years"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sayin the FSD beta V9 that‚Äôs coming in a few weeks is in essence ‚Äúfeature complete.‚Äù They won‚Äôt be able to say that for a while but they‚Äôll still be able to monetize it, it‚Äôs game over from there"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hugs and kisses :)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôll just make a law making it legal, immunity.
Literally where have you been?

Tsla already has killed people.
The gov‚Äôt wants this to happen.
FSD is coming whether it kills 1 person or a hundred.

You think USA‚Äôs top priority is saving lives you are the crazy one here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but on the other hand it's tesla you'd get stuck with on the puts, it'll probably go back up. I hope for your sake musk tweets out something spicy and the stock spikes again, that'd be some great anti-loss porn."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This Toyota rumor lines up nicely with FSD becoming more valuable than the physical car. Look into some of Toyota‚Äôs recent releases about their new joint venture of Isuzu, it‚Äôs highly likely this is Tesla‚Äôs payment to get into the fiercely loyal market of Japan without the barrier of import duties.

Plus Toyota gets the clout associated with ‚Äútaking steps to EV adoption‚Äù... lmao"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So we think that insurance companies are going to bear the responsibility of the software and hardware? Could be. And no...I do not think the feds give a rats ass about lives, but attorneys do. And would you operate a vehicle without your control that could make you responsible without insurance coverage? So if we are assuming the law is to have insurance companies hold the bag, and customers are protected and tesla is immune to their mistakes...yea that all adds up. And that's how this guy's DD reads. So we just hope that the money that the underwriters stand to save by FSD incentifies the coverage of what amounts to the consumer beta tests...still think this is a more than 12 mo problem. 

I do need to see what came of the cases where the Tesla fucked up....but I am pretty sure the insurance and tesla hide behind that the driver is responsible. So just like a normal traffic accident. But true FSD means you do not need to be responsible...and that's the point I make."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like selling puts, like I‚Äôm gonna do it, but Step 3 of my plan for getting rich is to focus on capital appreciation before income generation. I‚Äôm not focusing on income until I have enough capital to make the income substantial"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wholemarsblog shitting on that rumor this AM. I'm doubting anything comes of it
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People already are operating Tesla while asleep.
Your point is mute. It‚Äôs already happening. The world will adjust. 

Just like it did when the government told everyone they had to live inside, stay six feet apart, and put on a face diaper.

You have too much confidence in common sense, decency, laws, logic, all that jazz.

They‚Äôll just put the standard boiler plate warning that ultimately the driver must remain alert and ready at all times, problem solved."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I totally get it. I only brought it up because put premium on tesla is bonkers and completely out of the norm compared to other tech stocks for options that are unlikely to come into the money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm doing something similar by putting part of my income towards shares, part of it to use for wheeling stocks, and part to straight-up YOLO on $CUM and $SEX FDs. I was about to buy a house but then learned about theta and decided to focus on that. I think I could live a modest life with 100k to use for writing options."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They shit on the idea of Tesla producing drive train / vehicle, but sounds like Tesla installing their software platform and infotainment is still in the realm of possibility IMO."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess that's why they call it a casino. 

We both want the tech. I just think there are more hurtles. 

Time will tell. 

RemindMe! 360 days ""what happened with tesla autopilot"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fa sho, lots of opportunities, $250k in cash right now is not my best bet though"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i've seen a few fresh writeups of it this AM. Must be something of a solid rumor.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with both your points. I don't want to jump in or drag this out since y'all already hashed it out. I think the main thing to take away is if you consider u/AruiMD point, ""They‚Äôll just put the standard boiler plate warning that ultimately  the driver must remain alert and ready at all times, problem solved.""

That's the main takeaway. Tesla will tag/sell it as FSD but have regulatory fail safes in place, i.e. having to touch the steering wheel to remain in FSD or what have you.

The multiple catalyst upcoming for this play and considering his price points, I think this could print. I did whence a bit at the calls above a grand but who knows at this point. Personally, I would have kept it under a thousand after considering this recent dip, then again not 3mo ago TSLA ATH was $900 so idk. I'll definitely be following this play and wish I had the means to make a similar one"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thinking about getting long term QQQ calls. The hype train stopped for now in my portfolio
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If it dips again today buy... If we break below $21.04. Get ready prices in the teens. The suits want cheap shares. Especially Morgan Stanley

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm done with PLTR. Alex Karp himself said he does not care about stock price.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the time, I thought I was getting a huge discount. Started buying at the 29 mark. Blew my mind this thing is below 30, let alone 22."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Give it a few years. They're dropping along with the rest of the market on very little news. Buy the dip because once they release news about new partnerships it will be too late. I'm holding my 325@25 until 2025 minimum. These guys have great long term scaling potential.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GS recommended to go long that‚Äôs the sign to buy puts instead

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,karma points duh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does robinhood allow that?

>  No one really knows what it does, how it works

Me:  Watch their promo videos

You:

> its financials are BS but they keep promising positive EPS sometime in the future...

Me: All companies do

You're truly and honestly an idiot.  Alex Karp and PLTR aren't trying to make daytraders rich, they are trying to revolutionize their software which breaks down the barriers of departmental data siloing.  If you've ever worked for a company larger than Wendy's you'd know that this is an incredibly important and large hurdle to overcome.  That's what they do.  How will it make money?  Because every company over 200 people needs this.  Not everyone is a moron, some people actually understand that AI is the future and few players actually have the technical competence to integrate it into useful software.  PLTR may be one of the only players in this space in a decade and they already have military level clearance.  They are lightyears ahead of the competition and anyone who gets that doesn't care that last quarter they only made an adjusted $0.01 per share.  I'm sorry that it doesn't fit with your return schedule of 50% in 5 days yelling ""DIAMOND HANDS APES"" but PLTR is truly a rare elephant.  Also fuck you."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If ""Pros"" can have their control taken by gas station employees making $300 contributions, we're they really ""Pros"" to begin with?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Meanwhile, in the real world... the ‚Äúpros‚Äù are having to close out billions of dollars worth of positions, tanking stock after stock, because of margin calls and changes in the IRS financial requirements now that the pandemic is being properly tackled. Whereas retail investors are returning to work, getting Biden bucks, receiving some necessary tax breaks, still buying, holding, and watching the price of their meme stocks steadily rising above their ‚Äúprofessionally predicted price points‚Äù. 

L O FUCKING L"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately gets margin called
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAO. Do they not know that we bought the fucking dip?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Loathesome creature. Be gone.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The Pros are taking back loss porn today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I DIDN'T HEAR NO BELL!?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, the pros just got liquidated, so..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What a goofy fuck
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jokes on him! 

RETAIL IS HERE TO STAY! üöÄ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I find this so ironic in light of the Archegos Capital melt down that just happened. This is what happens when 'the pros' take control, LOL."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Bane Voice]

‚ÄúDo you feel in control?‚Äù"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally he acknowledge us as ‚Äúpros‚Äù
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is basically offensive to all five senses. 

Looks like a tool

Sounds like a fool

Appears to be covered in a thin veneer of gravy that would make him sticky

Probably smells like network producer dick which as you can imagine tastes like entitlement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When Cramer puts ketchup on his eggs, he only uses the watery pre-ketchup at the top of the bottle"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taking back control by leveraging yourself to the hilt and having your entire book liquidated, bringing down telecom and GS and MS prime brokerage."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looks like some of the ""pros"" also getting liquidated....üòÇüòÇüòÇ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"retail had control... haha!  retail discovered the flaw, big money playing chicken now... next shoe to fall coming soon, no one will see it coming... just as no one saw archie..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pros lmao we all should prolly hand our money over to the pros so they can bankrupt us with shorts then? Bald bitch has lost his mind sorry but not sorry
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt be mean guys!   As a Mom I know what it feels like to be irrelevant!    Bless his little heart (and thank you mods for unblocking me after 3 days!).   HARSH!

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer takes a shower with a raincoat on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is just a stupid narrative.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim Cramer has 'I BELIEVE IN YOU' written in big, bubble letters in his diary."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure what he means is that they've decided on a market manipulation strategy to best hurt retail
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol pros. They're your cunty older cousin that cheats at monopoly when nobody looks.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So that was posted on Friday morning and a few hours later a 15 billion dollar hedge fund blew up because they leveraged themselves up to the eyeballs, losing a total of 80 billion for various investment banks, who all ran for the doors, trying to one up themselves who can throw the other one under the bus first.


Great to see normality is back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i love how they are trying to turn this into us versus them‚Ä¶ they are us. get fucked.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer crams Krispy Kream creamers (say that fast 5 times)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"We are the pros, Wall Street is the criminals"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck pros, fuck retail, fuck it all!   Anyone have any bananas I can borrow????    I just need a few hits to get me through to the weekend......"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He can control deez nutz
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So he's saying openly that there are groups of people that are so experienced at **controlling the stock market** that they're qualified as professionals at it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cramer makes me want to pull out his teeth and feed him steak
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"what does ""taking back control"" entail? getting your lunch eaten by retail and having to cry to mommy to get a bail out?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,How does Jim Cramer still have a job?  Who wakes up in the morning and actually listens to what this clown has to say?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer the type of dude to close a drawer with his hips.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This sententious cunt is still pissed that the proles are doing something besides following his instructions.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are giant block sales what ‚Äòtaking back control‚Äô looks like?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So ‚Äúpros‚Äù are losing billions and that means ‚Äútaking back control‚Äù
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck Cramer, he‚Äôs a fraud and a hack, I am still waiting for one of his ‚Äúpredictions‚Äù to come true. I have not seen anyone in this business who is wrong 100% of the time, never ever right, about anything."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This mofo is so far up Citadel's ass if Ken Griffin sneezes you can see the top of Cramer's head in Ken's mouth. 

Griffin has Cramer spouting all manner of bullshit on command.  If Cramer refuses (Which he doesn't want to refuse anyway), Cramer's TV career goes poof.  Cramer will say whatever K.G. instructs him to say.  

If these Hedgie mofos had control, the stock would be 50-80 per share and bloody stay there.  Control my eye!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The class warfare is so naked and brazen. Might as well read ""Nobles take back control from pesky serfs""."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did this article come out after Bill Hwang torched his fund? Because that would be peak Cramer.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And hedgies get margin called now who has money in stonks lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""you guys, the pros just called me up and reassured me they're in control now. here's what it means for you stupid retail fucks. #JimmyChill"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Jim Cramer ate his own twin in the womb
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt that statement a proof he‚Äôs actually working against the retailers ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, I'm just gonna say it. This Cramer guy is not a very good person.

Pardon my French."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look at the picture, he‚Äôs actually grunting in code. Low key. 

Apes strong together!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol this guy agian, suck my ape banana"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why do you guys give this guy so much attention?

This dude is living in your head rent free and you just advertise for him all day every day.

Like if he isn't paying you to post this shit, he is a fucking marketing genius to get you to do it for free."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So uh... ahem. Who's gonna tell him?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kramerica Industries?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pros like Bill Hwang?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,F*ck Jim Cramer
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fraud
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck you Cramer,,"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cramer remains me when he gets mad he looks like a British Bulldog (bottom teeth)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a damn scary headline. Taking anything away from retail investors should be a headline they dont want to make a positive. Just shows you how blatant it is nowadays
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dwight taught me showing your teeth is a sign of submission for apes. WE ARE WINNING! üí™ü¶ç
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It for sure looks like the Pros are back in control... taking massive risks and crashing the market with bets on companies like Chinese Education Technology and Discovery Communications...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bet Cramer haven't shat a solid dukie, since January."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What does this even mean? The margin call absolutely cucked investment banks but all the people that bought gamestop below $50 when he told us to sell are up 300%
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ENTIRE MARKET:BLOOD RED

PROFESSIONAL TRADERS: this is what we call a pro gamer moveüòéüòéüòé"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys realize that Cramer thrives from attention and publicity. And that when he thrives, the narrative he promotes gets strengthened.  


Lose the obsession with this guy. He's become irrelevant. Don't make him relevant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Statements like this really do make me legitimately angry. How is this whole ""attack the little guys"" approach to everything not being completely rejected and denounced by at least most of the THREE HUNDRED MILLION ""little guys"" in this country??? The way we have let all the money funnel upward for so long makes me sick. There are so many people that do everything they can to jack up their own best interests, only making it worse for any of us who try to do something to try to help ourselves and/or fight back with whatever limited options we have to do so.

Every single person that isn't considered a ""Pro"" or whatever else should be appalled by stuff like this, whether they've ever traded stocks or not. Hell, this kind of thing should even anger some of the ""Pros"" themselves if they actually care about things being un-American and undemocratic. Then again, I guess that's to be expected in an oligarchy.

P.S. Just for the record, I'd have used the term ""middle class"" instead of ""little guys"" if we still had one."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya it really takes a PRO to fk things up as much as they have.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The Pros"" LMAO they aren't exactly good at doing their job if they lost control to begin with. Retards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sometimes I feel like Cramer is to us what Kim Kardashian or Paris Hilton are to a lot of other people. Is there some reason to pay attention to this guy other than that he's famous?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Professional retard reporting for duty Mr. Camry
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"no one making money = ""pros taking back control"""

The market is fucked and has always been fucked, but stuff like this is cringy. You aren't some hero taking back control from the 1% by buying 10 GME shares. If anything, you're helping them, at tiny, tiny level.

Hedge funds and 1% investors own like 85% of gamestop, so when you spend all your time pumping it on WSB and getting new traders to buy in, you're doing exactly what they want you to do. Which, as depressing as it is, lends credence to Cramer's point.

The fact that they've convinced you that you're hurting them, as you work for them for free, is legitimately one of the most amazing moves I've ever seen the hedge funds pull off."

Since last week Jim Snake Cramer had started this narrative of ""young investors"" are leaving the scene, based on nothing and something that he totally pulled off his ass. (if by young he means retards, wasn't that fuckface Gabe Melvin too young when he started his shady business?)

Now delusional Cramer is carrying on with his fairytale, we have left, and the pro is taking over.

I guess he managed to block almost every one on twitter, and after receiving no more messages he concluded that we left."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay... you are taking this way to literally. I know a few people that are in the 1%, albeit closer to the 30-50M mark not the B mark. They're mostly normal people like anyone else, but they either were born into it or made some really nice moves in business and sold their companies. I don't want anything bad to happen to these folks. I think most of them know they didn't earn every dollar they have, even though they tell themselves they did. It's all just the bs people tell themselves to sleep at night and get through life. There are absolutely some members of that group though who are just greedy - and their time to pay the piper is happening now. Am I doing this alone? No. But as a group of investors and small fund managers, many of these people have fallen and will continue to leverage and fall. A new 1% will rise up in their place, and the hope is if enough of them fall, they start to learn some lessons as the rules change. This is a movement, and the 1% has lost control many times in the past and will continue to do so. They're humans and they're not showing signs at improving under the same system - thus history repeats itself."

It's been an open secret on Street that there are a couple funds quite literally trapped in their GME short positions- unable to escape due to lack of liquidity and available shares.  They are content bleeding out through interest and praying that WSB sniffs out something else to let the price collapse because the unrealized losses are more than they can afford.

&#x200B;

They are a time bomb on the entire market.  The reason this sub has been so preachy about ""time being our weapon"" is because they lack an escape hatch at this price point and will incur bankruptcy level losses.  Their positions are simply untenable.  GME was supposed to get delisted at the end of all this, it was a slam dunk play.  Everyone on Wall Street signed on for the free short tendies, some of them naked, and went back to watching homeless people fight.

Some of their short positions began when GME was a single digit price, they will go to great lengths to avoid eating a big fat retail dick - and we have certainly seen that with our own eyes."

If we do not hear from you, Goldman Sachs will assume that you are comfortable with, and responsible for, the trading activity in your account(s). Goldman Sachs will not be responsible for any margin call(s) that may occur. If you would like more information on how to trade with GS, please visit gs.com.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"very well said. It's crazy I have a lot of ""smart"" friends or family who just ignore this or pretend everything is fine and that GME going up is just a magical thing with nothing behind it. I mean yeah.... I sound like a conspiracy nut sometimes explaining it but a lot of it boils down to just blankley trusting the market or not. It's like..... do you not remember 2008? And all these other financial crashes. Walstreet and big money have lied before you think they just all of a sudden stopped? REALLY? Now whose being fucking na√Øve. I mean hell.... had a buddy link me a fucking CNBC article the other day. I have seen with my own eyes CNBC blatantly lie about GME this entire time. It doesn't take that much research to see this thing.

So fuck it. I might sound crazy at times but this whole thing just seems plain as day to me. Yes....... it helps GME is actually transitioning into a real company again. Yes this has gone on a lot longer than I expected. But I personally vastly underestimated Big monies power to manipulate the market. But I am here for when it comes crashing down on top of them and await the payout. I will not rub it in the face of those who didn't invest I can see why. But I will no longer feel guilty about not telling people and them missing out on the gains. In my eyes.... they have had their chances it's not my fault they too na√Øve to see what's right in front of their faces."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait till you hear about social security. They take ~4% income tax, use it as a slush fund for the government, invest solely in low yield assets, and give shit payouts that are taxable if you were able to actually save for retirement.

All because you can't be trusted it invest or plan for a retirement, the government couldn't be fucked creating a safety net that functions well, and doesn't bother to teach these actual life skills to children in school."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just make enough money so that you can invest as an accredited investor rather than a retail investor.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the difference between being a customer and being a client. Unless you have megabucks you're just a faceless customer. You are guaranteed a basic pedestrian level of service and nothing is assumed about your knowledge level, risk appetite or activity. They lump you in with the huge basket of other customers who all have different understanding, risk appetites and goals, but who do not offer enough in trading commission to warrant any further attention or service. Because they want to focus resources on the megabucks, you are treated as the lowest common denominator in that basket, ie someone with no experience investing who needs handholding and protecting from their own actions. Any wild or non-conformative action from this bucket of traders is seen as risky, volatile, not considered or thought through, you must be throwing your money away on wild impulse - if it is seen as a conscious play there must be a ringleader with institutional experience 
or a wannabe out with ill intent trying to 'stir up trouble'. You can't take large risks with your own money without being vilified or belittled due to stereotypes about the motivations and experience of retail investors.

If you're a client bringing millions to the firm per year, you are treated as an intelligent, rational and measured human being, regardless of your past wire fraud. Managers at the firm will support your extremely leveraged position and meet with you to discuss options and strategies. You are assumed to be a good actor who makes reasonable decisions and can be trusted with billions in loaned capital, even if the compliance department barred the firm from taking him on as a client for years because you were too much of a risk."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is one of those things I have ranted about maybe a bit too much. So I'll just say I agree.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, I think individually, at least me, we may not be as financially smart as an individual Wall Street Trader. It's only because we're all in this together that we're doing better than Wall Street."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, profit before all.

Why do you think army recruiters concentrate on recruiting teenagers the most? Because they take advantage of teenagers not knowing any better, or being so hopeless with their options that‚Äôd even commit violence against strangers for a job. Yay hegemony."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Social security as a concept is good. The fact that younger generations are paying into it and will never see a cent is not. It is being looted by the same generation that looted everything else from the younger generations.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a classic greentext
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I was premature. I'm used to lazy journalism whenever a blog or site mentions what's happening on reddit. Most of them just cherry pick a few comments and call it a day. This piece was actually very thorough and put the events in context pretty clearly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck no

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm a millennial and my own father tried hitting me with both of these examples. Tried pushing me into a trade school instead of traditional college for a long time, told me it was my fault I wasn't getting paid enough to live on my own, that I'd amount to nothing and that I needed to just ""put my nose to the grindstone"" to get anywhere in life. Got kicked out of his house for wanting privacy in the room I paid 1 bedroom apartment levels of rent.

No thanks, I'm not going to be a worn down husk of a human being after grinding my body down to nothing working for slave wages. But damn I must be literal scum of the earth to want anything more than that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the problem is with some millennial definition of 'not be exploited' and 'treated with some shred of dignity'.  The whole snowflake MEME is there for a reason.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But thanks to inflation we're much worse off then every ever were..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm gen x and yes student loan interest was still 8% which is  robbery credit cart type interest. Survived a 1991 recession, a 2008 crash and a 2020 pandemic. Basically you can say the working economy has never been really good my whole life. In  fact my credit union credit card charges 8 1/2%.  That interest rate was for student loansf@#$ing terrible. Glad to have slayed that monster."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They had the credit card debt, though. And paved the way for video games and personal computers being a thing"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Or rock? Seems more ape.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">people will not become hungry for more why would they  
  
Because getting rich is addictive? Rich people still feel peer pressure? And just like us poors will be bombarded with things to spend their wealth on. Not everyone would react like that but human psychology says many still would."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably, yes. Have you watched The big short? Probably not comparable, but the mortgages were also ""guaranteed money"", but the market crashed.
Idk how this stuff works, but from an Europoor view it looks like US is exploiting its youth."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's starting to turn around in some cases. A case went through a couple days ago where a woman in *pro per* had her student loans discharged as part of her bankruptcy. The fact that she had paid back the full amount borrowed, plus some of the interest factored in, but assuming the ruling survives appeal, there's beginning to be precedence."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can confirm, in most circumstances, that student debt is rarely dismissed in a bankruptcy case in the US.  However, there are potential legal arguments (only occasionally applied to date) that, if embraced more by liberally construing judges, could open that up to broader relief even without statutory change.

TL;DR: fuck the system, it needs to change one way or the other.  Also try not to go bankrupt with student debt for the foreseeable future."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're right...I seem to remember student loans being on the short list of debts that are not discharged in bankruptcy (unlike mortgages.) That shit will stick with you forever. Like herpes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What European country doesn't buy vaccines?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes I am aware, but we also live in a world where saying ""I am self taught at a library"" will rarely get you as far as having a degree from an accredited institution unless you have solid documentation of work you have done yourself. Even then, I still think people should be able to receive higher education even if not directly tied to a career. I believe that an educated populace is a strong populace."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you watch TV? Do you play video games? Do you have art on your wall? Do you go to museums? Art is everywhere in our lives and the world would be pretty bland without it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You did the right thing not going to trade school.

For some reason all boomers think tradesmen make 100k+ per year, when that just is not even close to reality. 

Then when confronted with the reality, they usually say I just don't believe that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dunno, i think those are quite universal and standard the problem is previous generations took it to a whole different and unsustainable level."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is also the issue of increased global competition. The 1950‚Äôs-70‚Äôs were really good for Americans because Europe was still rebuilding after ww2 and Asia wasn‚Äôt a huge player yet on the global scene. Quite a bit of manufacturing was still in the US. Not so much anymore.

My understanding is that she paid back more than she borrowed, but not the full amount owed after interest. The remaining balance was still normal people large (5+ digits IIRC). I didn't see anything on whether it was allocated as interest or principle, but I would expect that it would be a combination of both principle and interest because in my experience that's how payments on loans are generally allocated; you're set up to pay a combination of interest and principle to streatch the payments out farther."

You could then use the proceeds from that sale to purchase a different ETF (or multiple ETFs) with similar but not identical assets, such as an ETF that tracks the Russell 1000¬Æ Index. By doing this you are able to take a loss on your current year tax return and still remain in the market with about the same asset allocation in your portfolio."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fun fact wash sales are only for losses... Uncle Sam wants his profit on all day trades even if you are still holding a similar security at end of year

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Basically it's a tax rule that says any similar trades you do on a security 30 days before or 30 days after get rolled into one ""wash sale"". 

One way you can get a tax bill like that, is if you closed at a loss in December, then in January, reopened that same or similar similar position ( this triggering the 30-day wash rule) meaning that loss you had last year, just got rolled into that purchase you made in January. 

Becareful of that 30-day rule. This mainly affects open positions end of year or January of next year. Close out your positions, and wait atleast 30days before you take a new positions to avoid this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he just rolled his gains into the next year without selling them as others mentioned. I traded like an ape last year but sold all before the end of the year. Had a bunch of wash sales but didn't pay much or any capital gains because of previous rollover year losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Timely article.... damn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To sum it up, if you‚Äôre scared this will happen to you; sell any stock if you‚Äôve been moving in and out of last week of December. This guy didn‚Äôt do that so the differed losses accumulated were rolled into the following years taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wow.  Dude got wrecked by the wash sale rule.  He had to have had all his profits booked, but none of his losses.  Imagine starting an account with $30k and having millions of dollars of profit booked, but really only have $45k, and all those millions are getting taxed because you didn't wait 30 days when leaving a losing position before buying back in.  Should have sold out all his positions in December."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok so the TLDR is that this is clickbait. The bottom line is that if you sell any position and wait 30 days you will be taxed accordingly. Just do it before December, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It sounds like if this guy had sold all his stock before the end of the year, he would have been ok, even with the wash sale rules, as the cost/losses are rolled forward into the cost basis of the next purchase."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I understand this correctly, you have to wait 31 days from the initial investment to exit your position for a loss if you want it to be deducted?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kek. The wash sale rule is basically a ""this exists so you don't fucking money launder you little shit"" rule. Selling securities with an intent to generate a loss, to lower tax liability and then buying that back later is basically money laundering and tax evasion. If you engage in this shit, and get fucked by a magnitude order diff tax bill, that's the IRS basically going ""I fucking told you it was a bad idea but you didn't listen, well buckle up cowboy and bite the sheets."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Simple math for apes. 

Sell and repurchase same stock less then 30 days = no loss claim for you and you owe IRS

Sell and wait 30 day to repurchase same stock = loss claim for you and you owe IRS less

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So even with wash sales, if you go all cash the last 2 weeks of the year you should be safe, right? The risk is just having a loss carry into the next year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It was his 60K job that tripped this dude up

if he had not had that 60k job he could have easily claimed he did daytrading for living and gotten Trader Tax Status.  Then wash rules would not have applied"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Electing mark-to-market accounting fixes this (Section 475(F)).  Sounds like he qualifies for trader tax status with that amount of trades.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is why it's easier and more straightforward to not have gains and just claim the losses ($3k a year) for however long.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically, you can day trade all you want
...but if you ever sell for a loss, the IRS doesnt care and looks the other way. So if you daytrade for 10k in profits but lose 5k in profits...the IRS still thinks you made 10k."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems needlessly convoluted.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don‚Äôt worry, the article called for more regulations on retail traders. We will be safe soon!!!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I recommend to read again. Or - even better - read outside of Reddit about Wash Sale Rule from the IRS and then take a deep reflection on your personal trading behavior.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"assuming I understand it correctly.

You buy $100 stock. it goes up $5 you sell it (gain $105 Minus your cost of $100) you pay tax on $5

Simple enough.

You buy and sell the same stock constantly. you gain $5 10 times and lose $5 10 times. mathematically you are even but because of this literal bullshit rule each of those $5 gains counts as income and you are not allowed to DEDUCT from them each of the $5 losses. so to the IRS you have a $50 gain ($5 times 10 positive trades) and you are now allowed to counts the $50 loss ($5 times 10 Negative trades)

So even though you have NO MONEY you have ""gains"" they count and tax you on."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here is what happens for tax purposes:

You buy $100 stock. You now have $100 basis in that stock, which is used to calculate tax gain/loss.

You sell for $105. You have a $5 taxable gain (105-100=5).

You buy the same $100 stock again. You now have $100 basis in that stock. You sell for $95. You have a $5 tax loss (95-100=-5).

You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100.

As long as you sell and then wait for 30 days before rebuying the same stock at any point in the year, you will realize the losses.

The problem is when people accumulate huge losses that are disallowed by wash sales, and they never wait past the wash period during the year. The losses carry forward via increased basis to the next year, but will not be able to offset gains made in the current year.

Important to note that the losses are not ‚Äúlost‚Äù, they are carried via increased basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, so I read the article a few times and I think I get it.

When you buy a stock and sell for a profit, you have a profit. Simple. When you buy a stock and sell it for a loss, and don't touch that stock again for 30 days, you have a valid loss which can counteract your gains. Cool.

When you buy a stock, sell it for a loss, and buy back shortly thereafter, you can't book the loss. The loss is not counted. Instead, your cost basis on your 2nd purchase is ~~lowered~~ raised by the amount of your loss. So if you bought 100 xyz for $10 each ($1000), sold at $9 ($900), have a $1 loss per share ($100), and rebuy at $8 within 30 days, your official cost basis is now ~~$7~~  $9. You can't book any loss yet. You have a new entry and your cost basis (despite buying at $8) is actually ~~$7~~ $9 ($8 ~~minus~~ plus the $1 loss from the last trade).

However, when you sell your 2nd trade, you can book your profit or loss just fine, IF YOU DONT TRADE THE STOCK AGAIN FOR 30 days.

The guy could have avoided the huge tax bill if he simply sold any time in December and didn't rebuy the same positions until 30 days later. All of his losses would have become valid losses. He held until January though, or repurchased within 30 days, or likely every day."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What I wanna know is why this doesn't shut down corporate high frequency traders.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How to avoid problems:

1. If you've been day trading a stock, sell it before year end (shouldn't be a problem; if you're day trading then you're probably selling every day).

2. Find a different ball to play with in January. Throughout the entire month of January, don't buy anything that you day traded in December. This ends the 30-day countdown and allows your gains/losses to all apply to the same tax year.

3. If you make big gains, stop gambling for a bit. Bare minimum, set aside enough to cover taxes. People have been hosed by making big taxable gains in December, then losing it all in January.

[Edit: This should go without saying, but I'm not a tax professional. If you're moving a lot of money around, spending a few hundred to get advice from a tax professional is good insurance.]"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure this person traded and made a ton of money, but realized his gains on the way up, thus owing $800k in taxes on those gains since he sold and they were realized. However, in the end, he blew up his account to an overall profit of $45k. Basically - if you sell and realize your gains, say $2M, you OWE taxes on ALL realized gains, even if you lose it all and break even, or in this case 45K overall profit.

\*I may be wrong, but something like the above could happen with a new trader. Something to be aware of."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy in the article filled out his own tax return on Turbo Tax. Basically in trying to save money on a professional he messed up how he filed his taxes due to incompetence and not knowing the loopholes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They sold at a loss in December and then re-bought in January. The loss in December was disallowed and added to the cost basis of new shares in January.

End result is a ton of unrealized losses pushed to the next tax year, taxed for 'gains' this year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs more likely that this dude entered his shit into TurboTax wrong and it‚Äôs giving him the wrong answer. 

As a few other comments noted, this scenario is mathematically possible but he would have had to realize some massive, massive gains and then huge losses afterwards while also re-entering all of his positions too soon. And then, not exiting those positions before year end as well.

Is it possible? Sure, but I find it quite unlikely."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the article is written so any high school student could understand it and it literally answers your question.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If the future is the morning of April 15th and your running late to your H&R Block appointment with Greg who has called you 27 times since January reminding you it‚Äôs tax season because you can‚Äôt find your sons SSN then yes this is in fact from the future.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,3k is just the total tax deductible loss amount. He can make 100k this year and sell some to book a loss of 103k to essentially pay zero tax on 103k of income. Even then it would take nearly 8 years to make it all back... it all depends on how successful he can be trading each year lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,traded 45 mill for checks notes 45k... guy made a return of 0.1%.... when almost any stock is up 80-100% from the dip.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have watched videos and read posts about this, but still don't fully understand (brain to smooth). 

So trader status + mark to market seems like it would've negated all wash sales and this guy (possibly) wouldn't have as big a problem? Like each trade would've been treated as it's own trade.

I don't yet qualify for trader status and thus mark to market if I'm understanding right. Is this something where if I don't qualify for active trader by years end it's basically ""too bad, should have waited a month before buying back in to stuff""? 

Do people actually plan a strategy around this rule or is this just an extreme case that most swing traders don't really have to be concerned with? I have no problem just dumping everything years end and trading other stuff for a month if that ""makes it regular""."

That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm planning to do this year if I lose most of the money earned on GME in January"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You and me both. I‚Äôm going to call around tomorrow and see an actual accounting professional. I‚Äôm getting a bit anxious seeing as how I just hit the day trader amount this past January and have made fuck tons of trades since then. Should make for some fun conversations given how accountants rarely have a sense of humor about these things.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should speak with a tax professional.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Alright, one of my bffs is a CPA‚Äîyou don‚Äôt pay tax on wash loss disallowed, you‚Äôre just paying on the net gain. Still a hefty sum but what I expected. Threat averted"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What it‚Äôs starting to seem like is you basically add wash sale disallowed to net gains, then tax that at your income tax rate. 

If this is right, a) that is a simple concept that nowhere explains in quick, actionable English, and b) mega fuck"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"you owe income taxes on the full 39k gains as your wash sale disallowed prevents you from claiming any losses to offset your gains. assuming you are the ""Average"" tax payer expect to pay around 20-25% of that 39k in taxes (in addition to your regular income taxes).

&#x200B;

you should speak to an accountant if this doesn't mean anything to you.. and file your taxes on time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You would owe taxes on the 39k based on your income tax rate assuming those gains alre a day have the wash sales deducted.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,would think this would hit any short-term options strategy but turbo tax never did anything like that to me. :/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think your taxed on the two added together. But maybe not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,See if you qualify for trader tax status. You never have to worry about wash sale if you qualify.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I believe you will be taxed at your income tax rate the sum of the two, so 92k. Basically you had a net gain of 39k, so that‚Äôs obviously taxed BUT 53k of your losses that got you down to a net gain of 39 are disallowed, so you have to pay taxes as though you actually earned 92k... if you sell those securities in 2021 (and don‚Äôt repurchase within 30 days) you will book a loss of 53k then assuming the price doesn‚Äôt change. So in 2021 you will have a far lower taxable income and essentially make that money back, but you have to fork it over for 2020 first. The only thing I‚Äôm not clear on is I believe there is a 3k tax deductible limit for reported losses. So... if you make 53k this year you can book that old loss and get all your money back (because you won‚Äôt have to pay taxes on any of your gains this year in that case). I think you just need to avoid booking it if you are going to have total loss of over 3k, cuz then you can‚Äôt tax deduct it. 
I‚Äôm not a professional and this is not financial or tax advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You just pay tax on the gains, that's it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You pay taxes on your economic gain, which is your net capital gain (the 39k only). Wash sale rule is about disallowed losses. Bunch of people in here and even that article don't know wtf they talking about."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The only sensible (and correct) comment in this entire thread.. congrats
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure he can, in his 2021 tax filing. Now through prob is coming up for 800k for the tax bill, ouch."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beware making large gains at year end then losing your gains in January, you'll still owe the taxes on the gains for the previous year with your losses being in the next tax year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Zero time. You need to set it up the year before
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Read up about wash sales
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Happened
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think both. I think the guy they were talking about made a shit ton one year and then lost it all on weekly FDs a few days into the next tax year. Extremely unlikely for the average person but still important to learn the tax rules.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true. Bunch of noobs in here don't  know wtf they talking about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they actually end up having to pay ? Because in his case it‚Äôs kind of a bullshit rule he wasn‚Äôt actually trying to manipulate tax losses
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let‚Äôs say you‚Äôve been day trading a stock and you make the following trades in the last 30 days of the year.

Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

Trade 2: Buy @ $45, sell @ $90 = $45 gain

Trade 3: Buy @ $80, sell @ $60 = $20 loss

Trade 4: Buy @ $65, hold through 12/31

While it looks like you have a realized net loss of $25, from a tax perspective, you actually owe tax on the entire $45 gain from trade 2 because the $70 in losses from trades 1 and 3 would be disallowed due to wash sale rules. Instead the $70 loss gets added to the cost basis of trade 4. So cost basis isn‚Äôt $65, it‚Äôs $135."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale rule will disallow the $2 loss and add to your $4 cost basis, which would be $6 cost basis. Ultimatley still at $1 loss but you sold it all, so now it can be written off.  The guy in the article probably still held onto the washed positions over into the new year.  So his cost basis is now ginormous. If he sells them this year, he may have a huge loss for large tax writeoff, but unfortunately he can only write off $3k per year.  He should have sold it all before last year ended."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not tax advice (not putting this disclaimer for shits and giggles, I have my personal reasons, do your own fucking research):

If you rebuy the same shit (or almost the same shit) within 30 days (that's the rule in Canada at least, pretty sure we copied it off of the USA) something you sold for a loss, that loss is considered a ""wash sale"", aka you didn't really want to be out of the position so you should've just held. Your fake ass loss can go fuck itself."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash rule says profit of 1$  i believe
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre not allowed to declare a loss if you bought back the equity or similar within 30 days. So even though you are down 1$. IRS sees a gain of 1$ because your new cost basis is 4 bucks not 5 and that you sold at 5. 

If from what I‚Äôm reading is correct."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy for $25 sell for $5 

Buy back in at $4 sell for $10 (within 30 days) 

This would completely negate the $20 in loss and leave you with $6 in short term capital gains"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hoping someone with a great understanding in this area will chime in for you and me both. I can‚Äôt wrap my head around it either.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect example would be buying a Meme Stock at say $250 a share x40 and then it drops to 100 and you decide to close the position. You now have a loss of $6k BUT if you Fomo back in your remaining $4k at say $40 a share you now immediately negate the loss and say you sell again for $39 this time you are now able to write off $100 not $6,100"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Following.


Please help us great apes!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks all for clearimg that up. Turns out i shoulda done more than glance over that rule. Gonna go look over my trade history lol...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sale rule says you have a loss of $1 on the tax year you sold the stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash rule would still say you lost $1 total on the two trades combined. What changes is what taxes you owe on each individual trade.

Here's how the taxes would look without the wash rule:

Trade 1: You bought for $5 and sold for $3. You get a tax write-off of $2 for this trade. 

Trade 2: You bought for $4 and sold for $5. You owe taxes on your $1 profit for this trade.

With the wash rule applied, they remove that tax write-off from the cost basis of trade 1 and add it to the cost basis of trade 2. So now the taxes look like:

Trade 1: You bought for ~~$5~~$3 and sold for $3. You made $0 on this trade, and neither owe taxes on it nor can write it off.

Trade 2: You bought for ~~$4~~$6 and sold for $5. You get a $1 tax write-off on this trade.

In both cases, you ultimately lost a dollar and would ultimately get to write off that dollar loss. But without the wash rule, if you sell trade 1 in 2020 and don't sell trade 2 until 2021, you're effectively deferring paying taxes you owe on *another* dollar you made in 2020 somewhere else until 2021 without paying penalties, which the IRS doesn't want you to do. As such, they don't let you claim the loss until you ""prove"" that you've ""really"" sold the stock (which they define as having divested it for a full 30 days)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing.

But take this:
>I buy 1 share @5$ Sell it @3$ (2$ loss) Rebuy @4$

The IRS says you have no losses but you bought at $6. That $2 loss gets added to your cost of $4."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,do your own research but i believe they dont care about it being in a roth ira unless you buy the same stock in your brokerage accounts this could be completely wrong tho
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think wash sales rules are for taxable accounts only.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sales in an IRA are [permanently disallowed](https://finance.zacks.com/ira-rules-wash-sales-9068.html).
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trade different stocks/ETFs last month of the year. Although I believe the SPY and SPX are considered fundamentally the same asset.

Individual stock are even easier.

I wonder exactly how this works with Options on the same underlying. Is a Jan 2022 $30C the same as a Feb 2022 $35C or are the consider different because different Exp and strike?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. This is way too complicated for a normal person to understand before trading. IRS.....................sigh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you could have a 20m tax billing using this article formula? Just kidding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No not necessarily - vanguard hit me with a wash sale in the middle of the year because my etf to etf trade wasn't substantially different enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"For individuals, this loss is limited to $3,000 per year, or $1,500 if married and filing a separate return. 

Corporations have more rights than individuals in this sense. They can write off infinite losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They apply
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good example. You are technically up $100k but your Proceeds would have been $2.1M with a cost basis of $2M and a Wash Sale Loss Disallowed of $500k and Realized Gain of $100k

Hence Realized Gain $100k + Wash Sale Loss of $500k = $600k Gain for the tax man.

Gotta be wary. It also only applies on a per share basis which can also make a big difference as some stocks like GME were 3 to 4x more expensive end of 2020 than earlier in the year ($15 to $20 compared to $4 in the summer). Will be worse in 2021. Someone is going to get completely hosed on GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about.  The wash sale rule was created to prevent an end of year tax write off if you are at an unrealized loss (but realized gain) in December and try to get clever by planning to sell in December and rebuy in January. 

The 500k loss would not be allowed to be claimed as a realized loss (offsetting other realized stock gains) when doing doing taxes because that loss was rolled into the new cost basis of the stock when repurchased. 

For smooth brains: The new cost basis of the stock when it is was bought back within 30 days would be 800k (100k @ $3 purchase price + 500k wash sale loss rollover). 

Meaning if that stock is sold for $900k.  Taxes will only be owned on the 100k gain.   ($900k sale - 800k cost basis)

The 500k loss incurred did not disappear forever because of the wash rule .....

Edit: also taxes are not paid on the 500k cash from the loss sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last 31 days.

Or just make sure you don't buy anything you've sold at the end of the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes I think he got screwed because he held through end of year. Why do you say 2 weeks tho?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guy didn‚Äôt know how to do his taxes. The article states he did them on his own on Turbo tax. 

Even with a job if he spent 4-6 hours a day on most market days working on his trades he can still file under Trader Tax Status. That article is FUD so retail trades less. The wash sale rule can help reduce your tax amount if you keep detailed notes on your trades.

Not tax advise BTW."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He did not make $45 million, that was his total trading volume. 225 $10K round trips (about one round trip per trading day) would get you there. His total profit was only $45K, or 0.1%."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone can get to 25k.  Fuck in January with GME I had 1 option go from like 10$ to 25k

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,wash sale rule also applies to options.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Call it month trade? Haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically.... if you trade in and out of the same stock your losses get ""suspended"" for 30 days.... 

So does that just mean you can avoid this all together by exiting your position in december so the loss is realized?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the fuck HOW MUCH DO I OWE
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok can we dumb this down a lot to just see how it works

I buy one share for $10

I sell it for $15 (net gain $5)

I buy it back for $10

I sell it for $5 (net gain $0)

Within 30 days I buy it again for $7 

The selling for $5 is a wash sale correct?

I then sell it for $5

Now my net  was $0, I lost from there $2 so I have a net loss of $2

However wash sale eliminates my $5 loss from counting so IRS is going to claim that I have a $3 gain??

Or am I missing how it counts? It seems like why the wash sale happened it should have counted at the end..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've read so many articles, and still don't know if I'm fucked.

I have -10k for a NET loss, but 25k in ""wash sale disallowed"" on my statement.

Does this mean I'm going to fucking OWE taxes on 15k? Or was the wash sale disallowed subtracted from my cost basis, and whatever is in my Net column is my tax implication? 

I have a tax guy, but I haven't filed yet. I just want to know how pissed off I'm about to be."

lol. Someone's been brainswashed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wash sales also apply in Canada which is why the guy in the article had such a huge tax bill.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's bullshit, you don't pay double the taxes we do. Plus, you get more for those taxes you pay than we do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like both the US and Canada have wash sale rules and both allow the capital losses to be added to the cost basis on the buy side. So when he finally sells he can get that big capital loss in the sell year.

Canada allows for the capital loss to offset against capital gains from the previous three years and future years cap gains. The IRS doesn't seem to do this and can only apply to current year or future capital gains; or to $3,000 per year of other income.

The Canadian side seems nicer here. But maybe some accountants could chime in if I made some mistakes.."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Net gain/loss makes sense if you are trading frequently.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> This is 1 time that being a Canadian works out. 

ZZZZ

Here tax is automatically reduced before you receive your gain when selling stocks and also loss is calculated in on your next sell"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre wrong. Capital gains are counted as 50% of the total amount and then added as income. Wash sales also 100% apply with pretty much the same wording as the US.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Truly I am, and can‚Äôt make sense of it.
Will sell everything at a loss tomorrow and never invest again. Thanks for your explanation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you trade on fidelity or TOS I believe it alerts you when a wash sale has occurred
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not exactly.

>You buy and sell the same stock constantly. you gain $5 10 times and lose $5 10 times. 

Here is what happens for tax purposes:

You buy $100 stock. You now have $100 basis in that stock, which is used to calculate tax gain/loss.

You sell for $105. You have a $5 taxable gain (105-100=5).

You buy the same $100 stock again. You now have $100 basis in that stock. You sell for $95. You have a $5 tax loss (95-100=-5).

You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100 and made $5.

As long as you sell and then wait for 30 days (BOTH DIRECTIONS, before AND after) before rebuying the same stock at any point in the year, you will get to realize the losses.

The problem is when people accumulate huge losses that are disallowed by wash sales, and they never wait past the wash period during the year. The losses carry forward via increased basis to the next year, but will not be able to offset gains made in the current year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"and this is total bullshit. Just another rule to screw retail traders, while hedge funds and their algos are doing this millions of times of day without any ""wash sale rule"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck, I did this in elementary school with chocolate bars.

My friend and I were selling chocolate bars in school for a school fundraising event, and being the smoothbrains that we were, figured we could buy it all ourselves. I gave him a dollar for a chocolate bar, then he gave me that same dollar for a chocolate bar. Rinse and repeat until we both *technically* sold all of our chocolate but only had exactly $1 to show for it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do people day trade then? I don‚Äôt understand
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. The losses are rolled into the gains as if the stock cost you more. 

Basically I FOMO and buy 100üöÄshares for $30. I miss my exit and sell all 100 for $25. I have a $500 loss. 
Three days later üöÄ looks like it will go nuclear again and I buy 100 shares at $20 for $2,000. Due to wash sale for tax purposes my cost is $2,500 ($2,000 + $500 loss from previous sale). Let‚Äôs say I sell the stock for a profit at $40 per share (4,000 total). Due to wash sale my profit from üöÄ is $1,500 ($4,000 - $2,500). 

The wash sale rule can actually help you if you understand it and have the time to keep track of the sales."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No that is bullshit: fuck the IRS dude. That can‚Äôt be true, and if it is true, then it is completely asinine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When that happens to me, I buy a stock for 10 dollars and sell at a 5 dollars loss, if I rebuy that stock again when it hits 10 dollars I will find out that they took my loss and it actually shows I paid $15 dollars per share rather then $10 because they attached my $5 loss to it.

If anything it's a good deterrent for buying and selling the same stock at a loss in a short period of time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This. Exactly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is all correct except that your loss is added to your cost basis, not subtracted."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not correct.  The problem is you make a bad trade and lose money on a stock trade.  A realized loss.  Let‚Äôs say $100 loss.  However, you decide that you just had bad timing and believe the stock will moon.  So you buy back some portion of the stock.  Doesn‚Äôt matter how many shares.  But don‚Äôt realize you rebought within the 30 day Wash Sale window.  This instantly no longer allows you to use the loss against your gains.  So with your new stock, the price goes up and you sell for $200 profit.  In your mind (and your net balance) you have a net profit of $100.  But for the IRS, you owe taxes on the $200 profit, not $100.  Keep repeating this with the same stock and your taxable gains can be huge even though your actual balance shows minimal gains or even a loss."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah LLC doesn't do anything for wash sales. only section 475 MTM election does
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes but the IRS is a dick about giving people the daytrade status and will fight you on it. llc is easier.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, even owning an LLC in California costs $800 per year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you would automatically qualify for professional trader status if you create a business entity and trade through that.  Could be an LLC as suggested above, or maybe S-Corp?  Then you can petition for MTM accounting with no problems."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they‚Äôre suggesting this because you could just let the LLC go under and not be on the hook for the taxes? Only in the event of getting an $800k Tax Bill though (or something similarly life ruining). I would assume you‚Äôd pay diff taxes under the LLC as well.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people in the thread explained it better than I can, but in short, what it does is it allows you to get mark to market easier, so wash sales doesn't effect you. It is easier going this route than having to prove day trader status to the IRS, because they're really dicks about giving it out. They really frown upon anyone day trading and having a job. I got mine on Nolo for around $700 (you can get it way cheaper from them, I just wanted it fast and with a representative), and I can deduct the different trading groups I'm in, software, memberships, books, etc. Eventually, I want to turn it into a C-Corp to deduct healthcare and retirement savings."

The guy in the article's net worth only increased by $45k year-on-year but he's paying tax on his *total* gains, including the ones he already lost, because those losses are disallowed from being counted under the wash sale rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously. When I started trading I popped in and out of the same stock a couple times in a week. Weren‚Äôt day trades, but I realized a loss a few days before I bought back in. I noticed my cost average popped up the next day and I was so confused because it ate up a days gain... thankfully it was only like $200 of buying and got a google lesson in wash sales.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it's more that he held the positions through 2020 and into 2021 so the losses never counted because he didn't sell in 2020. Basically don't hold your shit through to the next year or you're screwed.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the only guy in here that knows wtf hes talking about. You should never pay taxes on a anything more than your economic gain. Wash sale rule is about disallowed losses. It has nothing to do with adding it to your gains.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That makes me hopeful. Yeah, seems like this would devastate any short term trader if I‚Äôm right here"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's not true. You should never pay taxes on a anything more than your economic gain. Wash sale rule is about disallowed losses. It has nothing to do with adding it to your gains
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gain from the very first buy price over all buy price an after going up? Or gain from the last sale?  Maybe you had 3 or 4 bad sales befor you cought back up to the first price then what
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He can but only 3k a year at that point so... Ouch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thx for the clarification
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will do, thanks for the info"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not exactly. Theoretically you can always take profits and not fall under the appropriate criterion of a wash sale. Alternatively you can offset this by intentionally taking losses elsewhere to adjust your taxable gains. Or donate like 25 laptop batteries to a group of third graders.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true.  You can write off losses you just have to be careful they are not being pushed into the next year by wash sale rules. The losses are there in the new cost basis just don't count until you don't trade that stock for 30 days.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a lot of taxes, wouldn‚Äôt the risk alone make it something you‚Äôd kinda wanna stay away from?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not true at all
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The IRS isn't exactly known for its leniency, and I don't think this guy can afford a lawyer good enough to handle this."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course you have to pay, just ask Al Capone.
The IRS doesn't f around. Likely, he will need to work out something with the IRS but it will get complex because he still has his heightened basis. He could sell this year but $760k or whatever of ST losses is going to take a long time to write off."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But what if you close trade 4 before 12/31?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, what the IRS sees is:

>Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

>Trade 2: Buy @ $45(wash rule triggered, $50 loss is added to $45 cost  to total $95), sell @ $90 = $5 loss

>Trade 3: Buy @ $80(wash rule triggered, $5 loss is added to $80 cost to total $85) sell @ $60 = $25 loss

>Trade 4: Buy @ $65(wash rule triggered, $25 loss added to $65 to total $80), hold through 12/31. You have disallowed losses of $65.

But swap Trade 1 and 2:

>Trade 2: Buy @ $45, sell @ $90 = $45 profit.

>Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

>Trade 3: Buy @ $80(wash rule triggered, $50 loss is added to $80 cost to total $130) sell @ $60 = $70 loss

>Trade 4: Buy @ $65(wash rule triggered, $70 loss added to $65 to total $135), hold through 12/31. You have disallowed losses of $70. And you owe take on the $45 profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What if you just dont wash?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So close out all short-held, day traded  positions b4 the year end each year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you are right. This was my first conclusion and took me too long to find someone who agrees lmfao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well thanks for your time and lovely disclaimer but that doesn‚Äôt explain fuck all.

Toronto is great though."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like i get that, but how do you profit 45k and owe a bajillion. I think i need a scenario with made up numbers to help me understand how that works lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Does it with with options? For example same DTE different strike, or same strike but different DTE."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But in TD Ameritrade they don‚Äôt let you buy in at a lower price.  The price stays higher than purchased?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe that is correct. Wash sale effectively changes your cost basis; it does not nullify your loss entirely if you sell again.

Buy for $25 sell for $5.

Buy back in at $4 (within 30 days). Your cost basis here is adjusted to reflect your wash sale, so your cost basis is $24.

Sell for $10. You realize a $14 loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you Sir
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $20 loss isn‚Äôt gone forever tho, it‚Äôs just added to cost basis of the 2nd buy. Just need to lock it in before yearend."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Incorrect.  You would be able to write off the whole $6100 if you stop trading that stock for at least 30 days. The issue happens when the transaction are across years and the loss is disallowed in 2020 and pushed to 2021. 

Using your example if you sell the second transaction on Jan 1st 2021 the $6100 loss would show up in 2021.  If you had sold on November 30, 2020 and not bought that stock again then it would be a loss in 2020. 

Wash sale rule doesn't take away the loss it just delays when you can realize it until you stop trading that stock for more than 30 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got it,so really can screw you if you have a big loss, then rebuy and hold or sell through/at the end of year? (But trade 2 shows a profit)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So lets say it then goes to 3$ and i sell. At that point it would be a 3 dollar loss, now realized, if i do not then repurchase? And they guy from the article basiclly held after rebuying, so his losses became yet unrealized, therefore non clqimable, and since he held through the new year,he got facked. Man no womder tax attorneys get paid so much. Dipshits like me think they have it all figured out.....


Edit:nvm, i just realized his profit of 45k was unrealized, so if he would have sold those positions b4 year end and not rebought,then his 800,000 gain would have been cancelled out qt that point with what i assume as 735,000 loss. Since he held, once he now sells, he will show the loss, but can not claim it against any gains (assuming he did no more trading). Like really he would have to actaully profit over 800000 this year to claim no loss or gain"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought so but wanted to be sure and I‚Äôm not pulling it out anytime soon but thanks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, I think if you sell to realize the loss, even on dec 31, then you are okay? As long as you don‚Äôt trigger _another_ wash sale by repurchasing within 30 days"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's so fucking stupid that they don't teach this shit in school or that taxes are so complicated that you need a program or professional to do them for you.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Across different trades, yes. Each trade is a single event and attributes to your tax buckets. If I am not totally wrong you have a bucket for interest, stocks, options and other (ETFs and certificates).

Gains received on the capital markets less than 801‚Ç¨ are free, everything else is getting taxed by 25%. That's usually less than your income tax rate. 
These taxes cannot be calculated against personal income tax or any other category.
Losses can be taken to the next year or if you move to another broker they are kept there as well.
Only if you request the losses from Broker A to deduct the losses from gains at Broker B, then all the losses are set to 0 at Broker A. (So think about you made -5k loss at Broker A but have gains of 10k at Broker B you can request from Broker B the losses to declare them in your income tax report to get some taxes back paid at Broker A. But remember, only if it is the same tax bucket.
Usually, if you trade with any German Broker you do not have to think about these rules as systems are properly set. 
When it comes to ETFs, it geht's really difficult... but biggest joke are the non deductable losses greater than 10k in options trading. That is just generating tax money for the German state out of nothing...

So far only losses so I am not affected by this rule anyways ;)

THAT IS NOT A TAX ADVISE. You should consult your tax advisor."

there are tricks to make money and avoid wash sale rule"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As long as you don't re-enter it in January.

As far as I understand wash sales just prevent you from realizing your losses. They don't really go anywhere, they just get added to the new purchase. The fuck up is selling at a loss in December and buying in January creating a tax issue."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not an expert but I don‚Äôt believe the answer is necessarily always ‚Äúyes‚Äù. The 30 day period basically extends into the new year. Examples, if you sell a position at a loss December 10 and buy back January 5 then you committed a wash sale. Or if you sell the loss position December 29 then buy back replacement shares on January 25 then you still committed a wash sale and can‚Äôt realize your loss on your previous year‚Äôs taxes. 

Also remember the wash sale rule takes effect for replacement securities purchased 30 days after OR BEFORE your sale of the original at a loss. Example, if you buy 10 shares June 15, then sell those for a loss on December 20 but also you purchased 6 replacement shares December 5, then you can only realize the loss on 4 of the shares purchases in June on that year‚Äôs taxes. The rest of the losses would add to your cost basis on the 6 shares for your future potential tax burden. So to your point, yes, you would need to make sure you exited any potential replacement share positions too (your entire position)... and then of course not buy replacement shares within 30 days which includes rollover into the new year.

Also, remember that your holding period from your original security will be added to the holding period of your replacement security which at some point could eventually change your tax percent on any potential gains made."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,CHECK YUR 1099 bro it says there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash sale = You buy PLTR at $25. Sell at $21. 5 Days later you buy PLTR at $23, your losses from your original trading loss are erased in a wash sale, cause you bought back within 30 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if all that happens in the same year, it's not a problem. when your tax year ends, you have to report on your gains/losses as of that moment. due to the wash sale rule, losses are deferred. so you pay taxes on your gains and then the next year you'll be able to claim your losses and...wash out...the taxes paid. tax law changes so it's still not a good idea because your tax rate may change year to year but you still have the same cap gain treatment as anybody else

the real fuckery comes when you sell in your taxable account and buy in your IRA. as far as i've read your losses are obliterated"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">I buy one share for $10

>I sell it for $15 (net gain $5)

This trade is done and has no effect on future trade tax implications.

>I buy it back for $10

>I sell it for $5 (net gain $0)

You can claim a loss here for $5 per share.

>Within 30 days I buy it again for $7

>The selling for $5 is a wash sale correct?

The rebuying of the stock within 30 days triggers the wash sale rule.  The $5 loss gets added to your cost so as far as taxes are concerned, you paid $12. You made $5/share this year and own stock at $12/share.

(1)


>I then sell it for $5

>Now my net was $0, I lost from there $2 so I have a net loss of $2

Yes. Then you get $7 loss you can claim against your $5 gain for a loss of $2.

But these too last points don't really matter. So lets go back to (1).

At this point, lets say you don't take your losses, the wash sale is still in place and your losses are disallowed.  So the IRS will say you made $5/share.  That loss you took on that trade cannot be used against your gains.

TLDR: If you want to use your losses, take the loss and make sure you don't buy back share within 30 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If it says disallowed, you should also see an adjusted gain/loss and an adjusted cost basis for your remaining position. The adjusted gain/loss is what you are taxed on.

when you're totally out of a position, you get to claim exactly what you lost in total"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what the fuck is the point of the rule?  It just makes more taxes to be paid this year but reduces next year's taxes?  Why not just... Tax gains and deduct losses?  It accomplishes the same exact thing with fewer steps and makes less paperwork.

Oh, I know why.  It's to fuck over poor people who don't fully understand tax law and don't have cash on hand to cover significantly higher than expected taxes.  If it forces them to liquidate, it forces them to take more losses.

The whole fucking system is retarded in the worst ways."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is you sell dec 31 and dont trigger a wash sale by buying in Jan, then the loss is realized in the prior year right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> You buy the same $100 stock again within 30 days. You have now triggered a wash sale. You no longer have the $5 loss from the previous sale. HOWEVER, the disallowed loss is added to your cost basis for this stock. You now have $105 basis in the stock, even though you paid $100. If you sell the stock at $105, you will not have a taxable gain, even though you bought at $100.

What happens if you then sell at $95, and again buy back at $100? Are you allowed to carry on both losses or only the last one?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lost $200 on GME. if I buy again, then i sell all in october. Would I just use my actual profit / loss then because by year end it will have been over 31 days?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it's not. It's to prevent rich fucks from selling all of their stocks that are down, negating tax liability, then buying them back.

It's *literally* a rule that only serves to prevent the 1% from dodging taxes. And you are wrong that hedge funds aren't subject to the wash sale rule, because they 100% are. 

Retail traders are almost never affected by the wash sale rule, because even if you trigger a wash sale, it raises your cost basis. This only fucks you if you are a complete moron and do some really dumb shit at the end of the year, or like take losses in a tax-advantaged account and gains in a brokerage account.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because people here don't understand the rule. The loss doesn't disappear, it gets added to your cost basis when you repurchase the stock. Thus when you eventually close your position, your adjusted cost basis reduces your net gain by the amount of your original loss."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs because in order to choose mark to market accounting where you can avoid wash sale rules you have to be designated as a trader by the irs. This is easier for LLCs and corporations because a trader by their definition derive their sole income from actively trading the market day to day and profiting off swings. You can also then deduct qualified business expenses such as a home office or trading software which a regular investor generally cannot do. However the flip side is that M2M accounting is calculated using the appreciated value of all your stocks and gains at year end even if you haven‚Äôt sold them yet. As always talk to professional. 
There‚Äôs risks to picking mark to market accounting since you will be accountable for all the capital appreciation of your stocks at the end of the year even if you haven‚Äôt sold them. You also have to choose M2M the year before you start trading in this manner. Finally you will need permission from the irs if you wish to opt out of M2M as you will be permanently locked to this style of accounting from this day forward. Source

Also yes _long term_ you will be taxed on net gains, but this is about a particular year. Check the article, if you are only taxed on a net gain _in a given year_, then why does this guy owe 800k on a 45k net gain? The answer is because he had millions in wash sales and the losses were never realized in 2020. Adding those to his net gain gave him a taxable gain in the millions, for which the tax burden was 800k."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Where it can hurt you is if you make a big profit on one stock, then sink those profits into another stock and lose that value w/o realizing the loss. For example:

Trade 1: buy stock A at $20k, it moons, sell at $100k
Trade 2: buy stock B at $100k, it tanks, sell at $30k
Trade 3: stock B keeps tanking and stabilizes at $10k 2 days later, rebuy there and hold.

So you've made a total investing profit of $10k for the year that's currently re-invested in stock B. But because of the stock B wash sale, you still owe taxes on the full $80k you made on A because you haven't ""really"" sold stock B yet.

*edit: On further thought, I think this could actually happen with all one stock as well. I was thinking the profit stock would have to be different from the loss stock, but if you initially sell for a profit and then rebuy in under 30 days I don't think the wash sale applies there. So only the second rebuy would be washed and you would still owe taxes on the first trade's profit in full."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> So lets say it then goes to 3$ and i sell. At that point it would be a 3 dollar loss, now realized, if i do not then repurchase? 

Yes. Or if your only repurchase after 31 days.

I'm curious what they mean by tax bill. Does he owe $800k or does he owe on $800k?  It doesn't make sense he'd pay $800k for $1.4M of profit.  The numbers don't add up in the article."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say they have 10k invested into a stock, then sell at 5k. That's a 5k loss. Without the rule, they re-buy the stock(within 30 days) at the same price or even at a lower price, lowering the cost basis, but also being able to claim a 5k loss in their taxes.

Not only do they get to claim 5k loss on taxes, but now their cost basis on the stock is lower from their initial investment."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I accidentally triggered a wash sale on GME and it feels like I'm jumping without a parachute sometimes.

I don't even day trade."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So for most who bought and day traded gme you aren't in wash?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Excellent even for the smoothest brained ape. My mom read it to me and now I will totally wait 30 days between eating the yellow crayons.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So at the end when i have to pay capital gains tax i could still deduct my losses from other stocks in my port an that would shave off some gains tax i would have had to pay right?    It doesnt have to be a loss from that one perticular stock correct?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in that example, the person bought stock for 1000, sold for 800, then bought back in for 600 (200 left unspent from previous 800) and then sold for 1000 which results in final 1200 sum if you add that 200$ that was unspent on buying back in.

That means the person started with 1000 and improved to 1200, 200 capital gain total, as the article states. There must be more to it as that seems like a standard capital gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice so is that a wash sale 

Edit:
Was kidding with this one"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just fcking sell it and open a new account lmao. This is stupid.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Open a spread next time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Does it count if you just let an option expire?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can sell at the loss but just don‚Äôt then go and buy the same stock within 30 days before or after. This rule was made to prevent people abusing the tax loss harvesting system. Supposedly üôÑ
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Don‚Äôt sell shit for a loss and then buy it back in under a month, especially in December."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you have a position that you want to harvest losses on, you need to not buy that same position for both 30 days before and after the sale date.

Specific example, if you sell a position with a loss on 12/31, you need to not buy that same position in December nor January to avoid a wash sale."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell things for a loss in December. Just don't buy them back until February (this is overly simplified but a safe rule).
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read up on tax loss harvesting. The purpose of wash sales is so investors don‚Äôt just dump all their losing positions at the end of the year to claim the loss, then buy it right back the first trading day of the next year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, BUT it is 30 days in either direction. For a 12/31 sale at a loss, you need to not buy for both 30 days before and after."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Works the exact same way. Your cost basis was 105, you sold for 95 = -10 net gain. You buy back at 100, wash sale is triggered and your -10 loss is disallowed and added to your new cost basis, which is 110 even though you bought at 100."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule has no effect on the total losses or impact of those losses that you will eventually realize. The rule ONLY affects the timing of when you might be able to use those losses for tax purposes.

Yes, with some special exceptions that will never affect the average investor, all gains and losses are pooled for tax reporting."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's just a us tax rule, so I doubt it, although from Googling it looks like Australia has their own wash sale rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The rule is applied on a share-by-share basis.

If you sell 100 shares, and then immediately rebuy 50, you apply the rule to 50 of the 100 shares that you sold. You would realize the other 50% of the loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It seems to hurt average traders with limited capital that need to get in-and-out of trades quickly.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What the actual fuck?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then it's still net zero but with more hoops, so what's the point? Like I get the purpose is for the government to realize less tax reductions because you aren't allowed to claim the loss, but by adding it to the cost basis they just delay that loss in taxes until after the next time you realize gains. So it washes out, so why do it? I just don't get the point.

EDIT: I guess it represents tax revenue *now*, which is better than tax revenue *later*. And if you do buy back in immediately, there's also the chance that the price never recovers... but since your cost basis is increased, isn't that just am even *bigger* loss claim next year?! What are they hoping for, that you'll die in 30 days and never realize the wash?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He should be talking about the taxable amount based on that gain (put in 2k cashed out 4k but only pays taxes on 1.5k instead of the 2k gains because of the wash sale ""backlog"" adding to the cost basis).

But he got lost in his own example."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can make an LLC on Nolo for less than 1000 (I wanted mine in a jiffy because I daytrade too much so it was 700-800? So that's the worst you'll pay). It just saves you so much of a headache come tax time. That's really the whole point.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Corporations have more rights than people. Go figure. Especially when it comes to ""tax sheltering."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perfect summary. I know that a lot of people are saying you just need day trader status. That is true. But the IRS is a dick about giving it out and they don't bother LLCs as much. They are especially assholes if this isn't your full time job, and I imagine for most of reddit, this isn't their full time job. And M2M is helpful if you don't have any capital appreciation, because you sell everything off at the end of the day (some daytraders are very serious about not holding anything, so M2M really helps them). You can be an investor under your name, a trader under your company's name. If you make enough that going the C-corp route makes sense, you can even deduct retirement contributions and Healthcare contributions. The real benefit for the LLC is having an easier time circumventing the IRS scrutiny so you can get M2M easier. If you don't do wash sales, then this might not be worth it. But if you do daytrades frequently, it is almost inevitable."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,username checks out
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They lost a lot but gained a lot and wash sold the losses making the IRS ignore the loss and only look at the 1.5 mil ""gain"" when the real gain was only 45k. If they were smart they would have just lost everything and not had to pay taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't really know shit either but I think the point is to prevent people from using dips to offset taxes by claiming a loss and immediately rebuying to maintain a position.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">gamification

This is a meme to attack apps like Robinhood."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a discussion forum, man. I‚Äôm not blaming anyone for my fuck up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Are there any brokerages that do?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it does. Have you ever bought something you sold at a loss within the last month on Fidelity?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Disallowed losses are losses you cannot deduct off your gains. It cannot add to your gain. It can only reduce your gain so you pay less in taxes. In OPs case in the article, he is not allowed to deduct those wash sales against his 45k net gain. He will owe taxes on the full 45k.

You have no clue what you are speaking of."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let's say you make 100k in 2020, sell, and immediately rebuy. You'll owe taxes on 100k. Then say Jan 1 2021 you lose all 100k. You can only write off 3k per year.

If in 2020 you lost our 100k you gained, there's nothing to write off. You just made 0 that year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bingo.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This happens when people don't understand the market and taxes the proceed to write articles.

I would love to see his tax form.  My guess is he/she bought and sold the same securities multiple times with losses.  These losses never would have been realized and would have just kept stacking.  So he had all the gains with none of the losses to cancel it out.

Think about GME.  Buy and sell 200 shares multiple times a day with losses and your cost basis would keep increasing but never count against the gains. He started with $30k and had net gains of $45k so had $75k in his account.  If he was using margin could be 3 to 4x that in daily trades so up to $300k that he could buy and sell daily.  I could see gains of $800k if you can't count your losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"From the way I am understanding the article, he basically day traded with the same stocks over and over again all year long, hundreds or thousands of times.  In order to realize his losses, he would have to go 30 days without buying those stocks.  I'm guessing he almost never went a week.  That probably carried over into the next year, right up until he started doing his taxes."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you‚Äôve ever sold a stock/option at a loss and then bought a share or option on the same symbol within 30 days then you too have triggered a wash sale
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there any source for this?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, he will need to use that 45k gain for a good tax lawyer to help him navigate it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense taken. I am not a tax lawyer, I don't know anything. Not accusing someone of anything. The article states the poor fella was hit by the wash sale rule and hence the predicament. Also a wash sale is not ""evading taxes"" or something to be ""accused of"". Simply it just means that your basis is adjusted upward on your new purchase and you are disallowed the loss. It's actually a real informative story because a lot of folks are not familiar about the 30 day rule."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But doesn't the wash sale adjustment get applied when you re-open the position? Or is there something special that happens when you close a position that was previously opened as a wash sale?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, you're right.

>Trade 1: Buy @ $100, sell @ $50 = $50 loss

>Trade 2: Buy @ $45(wash rule triggered, $50 loss is added to $45 cost to total $95), sell @ $90 = $5 loss. 

>Trade 3: Buy @ $80(wash rule triggered, trade 2 now becomes: Buy @45 sell at $90, $45 gain. $50 loss from Trade 1 is added to $80 cost to total $130) sell @ $60 = $70 loss. 

>Trade 4: Buy @ $65(wash rule triggered, $70 loss added to $65 to total $135), hold through 12/31. You have disallowed losses of $70 and gains of $45."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Yes, but you cannot buy back until 30 days later. For example, if you sell on the last day of December, you cannot buy back until Jan 30th.

Bingo bango.

If you really think it will take off, you can buy an call option outside that 30 day period. like The first friday after those 31 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Others in this thread have said the positions must be closed by Nov. 30. But I have not verified that outside this thread. And you definitely cannot buy back in until Jan.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"what if you buy for 5, sell for 4, buy for 4, sell for 3?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn‚Äôt the wash sale rule make your Day 3 buy have a cost basis of 6? So only if you hold that position would you not be able to realize the loss on day 2. By selling on day 4 aren‚Äôt you effectively closing that position with a gain of 0?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is only accurate if day 4 is in a different tax year than day 3
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did this in my tfsa for a week before I wisened up and started reading rules.

My accountant is going to hate me next year :(

Needless to say, lesson learnt!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I‚Äôm not sure how it works. Then it said I had 1 round trip.  And something with 5 round trips they will consider me a day trader.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Tax this dick
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So if you exit your positions before december... these losses will all count? Or am i as retarded as i think i am?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if you're holding onto that security after the repurchase, they're just unrealized losses still? You'd have to sell those securities that you repurchased to get the actual realized gain/losses for the tax year?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do I ever get to realize the original loss? By the article it seems not.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not an accountant, certainly not for the USA, but I believe the $4 loss gets folded into your second purchase. So they treat it like you bought at $27 and sold at $20. 

The reason for the rule is because people were selling and rebuying whenever their stock was down, to lock in a tax loss, yes it would cancel out when they eventually sold the stock for money for real but that could be decades away. Basically getting a free loan from the IRS. The IRS didn't like that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any call purchase within 30 days will be a wash on your previous loss. The loss needs to be added to your call‚Äôs cost basis. Your call‚Äôs strike price and expiration do not matter.  You cannot count on your broker to flag it, but per IRS rules it‚Äôs a wash sale. A deep in the money short put as it‚Äôs considered substantially identical at that point. If you sell the put at or out of the money most accountants will say that‚Äôs OK. There is no number specified in IRS publication 550 though. Another thing that people forget or ignore, wash sales apply across accounts and across spouses and corporations. So if you sell in your personal account to harvest a loss. Then later buy in a Roth within 30-days it washes your individual loss."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options and shares don‚Äôt conflict with the wash sale rule its only for shares of the same stock, so yeah you should be able to do it that way"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To me it seems like you could've reported 35k in losses, but since 25k of that 35k is wash sales you can only report 10k in net losess."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think for most people the net loss should be normal. The article describes special cases where he made huge profit throughout the year and didn't withheld tax on that and somehow managed to lose it all near the very end of the year. If you trade normally, this shouldn't affect you.  Net = WashSale - (Cost Basis - Proceeds)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can do level 1 and level 2 only which means buying calls/puts and selling covered calls. 

You can't do any strategies that involve selling one of the sides ""naked"" ie: no spreads, wheels,..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think yea everything but selling puts, as long as it‚Äôs covered eg no naked calls. Should double check tho to be sure"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeh it doesn't make any sense. Why have that rule for retail, while hedge funds and algos can do that shit without penalty?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yee fuck that noise son
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes and also the 'dangers of free trading' tagline is of course dogshit since the same situation would occur with any broker.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if you have a margin account and meet PDT requirements then you can trade as much as you want, you don't have to wait for T+2 cash settlement"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he would have to trade his whole account (including margin) around 300 times a day to hit 2mill in volume
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But doesn't that just leave them with the same stock and a 5k loss at that moment? I don't see why the 30 days would matter.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Simple solution... Don't sell for a loss.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"HODL is all you have to do , thus avoiding the wash sale stuff"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah I‚Äôm pretty sure we are
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, that's Pattern Day Trader (PDT) rule.  Also a good rule to study up on if your platform doesn't keep track of it for you like ToS does."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,After your Edit. FU and well played.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that‚Äôs the Day Trading rule for retail investors as we are. Really, read up. You can only buy and sell the same stock/option at the same business day (24hrs +1min ) four times within 5 business days. Business days excludes weekends or holidays."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly can‚Äôt answer that question. I don‚Äôt know, so before putting up some bullshit- anyone else can answer that?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This. All that really matters is the tax year.  Which is why the wash sale is really fucking stupid and for simplicity should only apply to stocks rebought within the month of January if you sold in December.  Because it was put in place to avoid tax shenanigans, the only time that matters is Dec-Jan."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you not be able to buy a position on 12/30 then sell it for a loss on 12/31? Just don't rebuy the same position for 30 days and you should be able to claim the loss, right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But then their buy in price for the next year is so much lower, meaning it has significantly more room to run, meaning when they do eventually sell it (assuming it's an overall gain) then they will pay taxes on all of that gain then.

It's literally the same calculations with extra steps.  Who gives a shit if they claim it as a loss on their taxes this year if they claim it as a bigger taxable gain next year?  It makes no god damn sense."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah thank you for the clarification. In the case where you did buy within 30 days prior though, when does the loss get realized? Say I add one share to my position on dec 15 and sell everything for a loss on dec 31. You are saying that‚Äôs a wash sale and that loss won‚Äôt be realized in that year. When does it get realized? Since I no longer have any shares to adjust cost basis on?

Edit: I believe I‚Äôve found the answer. If you sell everything on dec 31st and do not rebuy within 30 days then you are fine no matter what. But if you sell only a portion on dec 31, the loss will be added to the cost basis of any shares purchased within the last 30 days. But if you sell _those_ then it‚Äôs fine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh so you are allowed to keep carrying over, it does not seem that bad then, assuming you do sell and stop the whole wash before the end of the year.

Thank you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This makes sense, thank you!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It doesnt, as a wash sale raises your cost basis, therefore it doesn't actually increase tax liability (again, unless you do something stupid)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They are hoping that you won‚Äôt cash out on position for a loss and then go long for 10 years thus forcing the IRS to give you a 10 year interest free deferment on your taxes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and it's the same outcome with extra steps."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if I understand this correctly... As long as I sell for a net profit after the adjusted cost basis, I will be good?

e.g. if I bought 10 shares at $15 (10 x $15 = $150), sold at $10 each ($100) for $5 loss each, and bought back 10 at $8 each ($80), my adjusted total cost basis would be $(80 + 5\*10) = $130. My adjusted cost basis per share is $13.

So

1. If I sold before the share price reaches $13, say at $10, my taxable amount would still be calculated like a gain: $(10-8)\*10 = $20; i.e. I owe the IRS taxes on a technical net loss.
2. But if I sold at $13, I break even and owe no taxes.
3. If I sold above $13, say $15, I pay taxes on $(15-13)\*10 = $20, but I also covered my initial cost?

Is item (1.) the thing that happened to this day trader, or am I not understanding this correctly?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro. You use too many words to say what you want to say but only saying what you‚Äôre saying because youre saying it to say.

Yet someone like you thinks having a pop up screen would do anything, so *you can* at least blame someone or something when shit hits the fan, just like you are doing now. ""Man, why couldn't they give me a pop up so I know what I'm getting into (yeah, like you guys can actually read and not randomly click the colorful buttons) and can be responsible?"" As I said, you want them to hold your hand like a little bitch."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I didn't see any notification regarding a wash sale, that was on the fidelity app. I do get warnings about potential good faith violations before trying to sell too early, it would seem wise to have the same for wash sales."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same here. Always get the good faith violation warnings. But my Fidelity only identifies the wash sales after I make them :/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean the article literally says he may owe $800k in taxes, which is clearly larger than the $45k net gain. It seems that nobody here knows what they're talking about."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"His tax bill is 800k, so his gains had to be multi millions, but ya still easy to believe"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So he rode the price both up and down, taking several small gains and losses along the way, but always within a short time period. End of year, he's realized significant taxable gain, significant *dissallowable* losses, but only a net difference of ~45k. In other words, he acted like a high frequency algorithm, but since he's a normal ass human being (aka not a qualified trader), IRS says ""Fuck you buddy.""

Whatever problem wash sale rules are designed to fix, this clearly isn't it. What a fucked up system."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Important to remember it‚Äôs within 30 days on both sides too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was a joke about how basically every waiter/waitress doesn't report cash tips. Which is far more illegal than accidentally owing taxes due to stock trading.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's hard to believe our country is stupid enough to stick this guy with a bill that large for more or less no reason at all. It is clear the wash sale rule is out there for a reason, and this IS NOT that reason."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk but the way Im understanding it you could close on dec 31 and be fine as long as you don‚Äôt buy again in Jan
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You have to close positions by Dec 31st. The person who said Nov.30th was not correct.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The wash sale rule only disallows claiming losses on open positions.

If he had closed all of his positions before EOY, he'd have only had to pay tax on the net gains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you sell on december 20 and buy back the same stock on jan 5, that's still a wash sale. If you buy a different stock in jan, thats tax loss harvesting (good thing)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $4 loss in the PLTR example is added to the cost basis of the $23 PLTR you subsequently buy. Now you've got PLTR worth $27, and if you sell below $27 you get a loss or above $27 a gain.

If the guy in the article sold everything by 12/31, he'd have been fine."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The article is click bait crap and designed to advertise the need for tax professionals.

At the bottom of the article there is one sentence that tells the truth ‚ÄúThe loss in the wash sale will be added to the cost basis of the next buy‚Äù

Meaning if you sell everything then you realize all of the losses along the way.

So if you lost 5, then 5 again, then 5 again, then gained 10, if you don‚Äôt sell that final stock that gained you 10 then you have officially gained 10 for tax purposes.

If you sell that 10 gainer then you realize all the losses and have your -5 for tax purposes.

So if you‚Äôre not sure about your wash sales because you bought and sold the same stocks over and over again then just sell all positions before the end of the year.

Your tax bill will be equivalent to all of your gains/losses for the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think once you sell your position in that stock and don‚Äôt repurchase for 30 days

And the -10k is very close to my actual incurred losses, so I'm willing to bet the wash sale rules inflated my cost basis (but then disallowed losses in about the same amount)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's right, and it's ""normal"" in the sense that most people lose money, at least on this sub. u/better_with_syrup, you're not going to be taxed on losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No cash-secured puts?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They create a business entity, like a corporation, to trade in, elect mark-to-market accounting, and poof, no more wash sale rules."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And there is no way he really had an 800,000 tax bill on a 40,000 profit."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They still give you a ""today's day trade limit"". Just go to account info and you'll see it if u are still on rh that is but every broker has it. It's a very high number."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So like this: https://old.reddit.com/r/Daytrading/comments/hji1dv/some_guru_said_trade_like_a_sniper_me_i_said/
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So I sell stock A at 20k, where my cost basis was at 10k. That's a 10k profit.

I sell stock B at 5k, where my cost basis was at 10k. That's a 5k loss.

I rebuy stock B **after** 30 days, so it doesn't go against the wash sale rule.

My net profit is 10k - 5k = 5k gain. Because I sold at a loss of stock B at a 5k loss, I only have to pay taxes for 5k, instead of 10k and I still have a position in stock B.

Essentially it's called tax loss harvesting, where investors will sell their losses towards the end of the year to offset their gains. However, because of the wash sale rule, you have to wait 30 days to buy back into the same stock, otherwise, you can't claim losses on your taxes. This is why I assume the guy in the article got screwed. He made 45k profit total, but because of his selling within 30 days, he can't claim any of it on his taxes and got a huge tax bill.

**edit: changed within to after on the rebuy**;"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What amongthewolves said. Essentially, you already loss money on the stock at the moment. Why not sell now, be at 5k loss to deduct from your capital gains and then buy back the stock? The end result is exactly the same except now you can deduct 5k from your capital gains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was trying to average down. I was selling for a loss of less than $100 and then bought back in although I'm a grade A dongus and managed to average up lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"All I see is ""sell by year end"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I stand corrected. Thx
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"there are ways to get around this don't resign yourself to thinking you're screwed over because itll be your 4th trade in 5 days. For example say you have the $10 call on stock XYZ expiring Friday, but you can't sell because it would be the 4th trade. Instead of being forced to hold overnight, you can sell the $11 call expiring Friday. This essentially locks in your gains and then you can buy back the $11 call and sell the $10 call the next day. LMK if you want me to explain further"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't it only apply to margin accounts? If you have settled cash, you shouldnt have to worry about it.

I think.  I'm kinda dumb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what I‚Äôm foggy on too, would love an answer."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Thats exactly what the rule was for. Otherwise if the stock drops say 5%, you could insta sell and buy. And book in the losses and get a tax write off for 3k or whatever. So they make you wait 1 month."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can do that. Just don't buy it again for 30 days afterward.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"1)  3k loss can offset income as opposed to other cap gains. So you can come out ahead. 2) deferring taxes owed is better. Let's say I have 50k due this year. If I have 50k of losses to artificially harvest, I can just offset all those and maybe not owe them for years or decades. That's worse for the government. With stepped up basis at death, I could potentially even never pay them (although I think Biden is getting rid of this rule)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Ah thank you for the clarification. In the case where you did buy within 30 days prior though, when does the loss get realized? Say I add one share to my position on dec 15 and sell everything for a loss on dec 31. You are saying that‚Äôs a wash sale and that loss won‚Äôt be realized in that year. When does it get realized? Since I no longer have any shares to adjust cost basis on?

If you close the position and keep it closed for 30 days there is no wash sale"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"From my understanding, it would have to get realized on Dec 31st. I'm not sure why buying 30 days prior matters."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ty
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I don't get, it's just extra steps. The benefits I can think of for the IRS are 1) less losses claimed on Dec31, so simplified accounting (for now!), and 2) tax revenue *now* is better than tax revenue *later*. It's the same tax revenue, but they get to nab it earlier.

Also, think about that fella in the article: He'll pay $800k in taxes this year. Next year he'll get to effectively claim $800k in losses via increased cost basis, but with an $800k tax bill due *now* he'll have to liquidate everything to pay up... there won't be a next year for his portfolio. So they get to limit your actions, claim taxes *now* instead of later, and if you fuck up, they... end your trading career? Eliminating a tax revenue stream? I guess I really don't get it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You've got it and are on it. 

The day trader in the article did that x1000 and ended up with a realized gain but all his losses tied up as adjusted cost basis."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why use less words when more words confuse
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol the article is sensationalist...it's what sellls. he does not owe that. it doesnt matter if his wash sales are 1 billion dollars, you only pay taxes on your net economic gain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just wanted you to know that you can't just say the word ""bankruptcy"" and expect anything to happen."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh honestly glossed over the second half of your post. Was just curious on how trustworthy the IRS could be.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hm, ok. Nov. 30 seemed right to ensure the 30 days has passed before the tax year closes. It might not be a law, but could be good practice in my opinion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Liberty or death, ramen or lambo üöÄ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh 

So maybe i was too broad in my solution. 

If you keep positions open but dont trade in it at all for the last month of the year so the 30 days goes by, would that solve the problem?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So in a just world he would get a huge tax refund next year to cover this right?  But since they only allow a 3k claimed loss, I'm assuming he's fucked?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"One caveat on that which the article says

1) yes sell by end of the year
2) Can't buy any of them back in the first 30 days of the NEXT year

The wash sale rule for 30 days carries into the year for purchasing those assets back"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok this makes more sense. I traded a SHIT ton of spy last year and didn‚Äôt have any wash issues in my taxes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, I see, makes more sense now. Misleading article scaring me away from investing the $0 spare dollars I have."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just as long as we're only getting taxed on our year end net im cool, but I sure as fck ain't paying taxes on losses I incurred. Im already retarded which causes me to lose money, I ain't paying the loser tax too (not that I even could anyways lmao)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs exactly what happened, assuming you sold any positions with a wash sale added to the cost basis before the end of the year."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not in a tfsa
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs risks to picking mark to market accounting since you will be accountable for all the capital appreciation of your stocks at the end of the year even if you haven‚Äôt sold them.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so set up a corp and then trade like normal?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is how you know the story is BS.

If you have margin turned off, no instant settlement, you can say trade with no limit, but you have to wait for the funds to settle which takes 2 days, no way to trade more than your account balance.

If you have margin enabled you have a margin day trade limit dollar amount.


This story is fake, it‚Äôs designed to scare people into consulting with tax experts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i've been day trading for four years with a margin PDT account and have never been limited in the number of trades i can take

i use td ameritrade

i have heard that they will close your account if you do something extreme like HFT with your account but i average over 20 trades per day (lots of scalps) and have never had an issue"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you were trying to average down you didn't need to sell.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,And wait 30 days to reopen a position
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, thx buddy. Will go and smarten up on this topic to avoid $20 lessons in the future. Appreciate it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt lock in all of your gains  though, only some."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I figured it out, wash sales apply to buying a similar security to replace the one you claim a loss on.

So buying on 12/30 is not a replacement purchase, so no wash sale is triggered.

The ""30 days before"" is important to specify so someone can't get around wash sales by simply buying the same amount of stock right before selling the stock. For example, buy 100 shares AAPL on 12/15, buy 100 replacement shares on 12/29, then sell your first 100 shares on 12/30. The wash sale would trigger and apply the new cost basis to the 12/29 shares you are holding.

Also, wash sales are done intelligently. If you buy 200 shares of AAPL, sell 200, then rebuy 100; you get to claim losses on the 100 and the other half carries over as cost basis.

In conclusion, the only thing to care about is if you are making many wash sales and carrying a large cost basis to the next year while realizing fake gains this year. This is how you get stuck paying heavy gain taxes in 1 year and having many losses to claim in the next; like the guy in the article."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What's wrong with that though? Rebuying would reset your cost basis so you can't claim the same losses in the future.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm trying to understand also, but I think the idea is to stop this scenario:

I am heavily invested in 2 stocks A and B.

I buy A high at $100. A is way down at $20. 
I buy B low at $20. B is doing great and sitting at $150.

I want to realize gains from B, but it is also the end of the year and i want to try and minimize my taxes. But i'm also not really wanting to sell my A stock because i think it will recover. 

In a 3-d chess move, i sell B and realize those huge gains. I then sell A, realize that sweet, sweet tax write off and then _immediately_ buy back my position in A.

I just offset my capital gains on B, but i'm also still long on A.

(Wash rule aside) Of course if A moons now i'd have to pay that, but maybe it won't and so the reality is i just skirted real capital gains on B at the sake of potential gains on A. The idea is basically minimizing real gains at the ""cost"" of theoretical gains. 

If i could do this i'd basically be getting a tax free ""loan"" on my A stock ""losses"" for as long as I hold A. Or if A tanked further, id use it for further write offs. I'm keeping more money that actually should have gone to taxes and i'm tying that money up for as long as I feel like. 

Anyone know if i'm way off here? I think the key thing is most people are thinking of this in terms of a single stock, but this is about avoiding taxes from one stock by using another as a pawn."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be able to buy in Jan 1st, then maybe that is why they suggest Nov 30th."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope.

Wash sales disallow the loss from being claimed, because they adjust the cost basis of the open position. Essentially, your previously realized loss is incorporated into your unrealized gain/loss from your current position.

Unrealized losses can't be claimed on taxes, so you have to close the position (before year-end) in order to get the tax benefits of your previous losses."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah. If he sells everything right now he'll have a massive 2021 loss (let's say $1M) that he can apply to all his 2021 gains (let's say he'll make $10k this year) but can't have more than net 3k of loss for 2021. So his 2021 income is reduced by 3k, then $987K of loss gets carried forward to 2022, applies against his capital gains but not more than 3k of net loss, carry forward to 2023, etc etc.

I think the ideal treatment would be letting him extend his 2020 tax year to activity over 1/1/20 to 3/31/21 so the gains and losses cancel out, and then shorten his 2021 year to 4/1/21 to 12/31/21."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i have a 100k account with margin and buying power of 400k, i can take a 400k trade, close it, take another 400k trade, close it, etc. i have never hit a limit on trades with td ameritrade in years of trading every day with margin.

i don't trade with full margin very often but there are some days where i've done it more than once.

i have racked up high eight figure annual trading volumes on a low six figure account, so an 800k reported income from wash sales seems plausible to me if someone has no clue about the wash trade rule and they trade excessively on a certain ticker all year.

fwiw the worst i ever had to report was 90k income from wash sales. that sucked but i made enough money that year to easily cover the tax hit. it's possible for someone to lose money on the year but still have to report income from wash sales. that's when it really hurts"

However, I've not seen too many posts drawing attention to the price of the golden arches being used to gauge market confidence. America's favorite drive-thru restaurant is FUCKING HUGE, and world wide, and even if Hedgie's blow up the market with financial fuckery, investors can always trust in the ice-cream machines working! **THAT DOESNT MEAN BUY IT NOW!**!! It still falls like everything else, BUT let's see how it compares to the overall market...

Below I've provided a comparison to MickeyDee's against the S&P 500 going back to 2015.

By the comparison you see that when MickeyDee's rises a significant amount, outside of it's given trend, we see the market dip pretty soon after, usually within 2-4 weeks.

Some people that finished high school argue that it's due to investors not being sure of the economy and wanting to hedge their bets. Think of it like investing in gold when shit hits the fan, only it's the Golden Arches.

And something about investors finding cyclicals, but I still haven't found my wife's yet.

Did you scan for x% increase within x weeks and if so what were those values?

If you just marked shit by eye on a graph, can you elucidate why you left out other key points in time where mcd had a significant rise? Marking this kind of thing by eye seems highly liable to confirmation bias."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm pretty sure COVID bought us more time before the üåàüêª crash.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"One off ""*witty*"" comments are the BEST!

You're also probably just assuming that the above post shows that stocks peak right before they drop ( Great OBSERVATION You Made Batman!) and you sure as shit can pick damn near any stock to show that....

But, if you take more time to look at the chart then it took you to come up with your witty take, you'd see that McD's shoots up weeks before, not the day before, everything goes to hell, and there's even a case to be made that when McD comes back down to it's original trending channel, it can signify investor confidence returning in the market....

But hey, if you're here reading these shitty posts, you're just as dumb as the rest of us. Welcome Brother!"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not sure why you're being down voted, but you're 100% correct. In the past, most McD's franchises have been forced into paying minimum wage due to extremely high franchise fees by corporate McD's and the forced low prices (that are also set by regional corporate McD's). Recently McD's everywhere have began raising there prices across the board and improving on quality. They will eventually dig themselves out of the hole they are in and be able to provide quality product and service comparable to chik-fil-a."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks as though you may have spelled ""Chick-fil-A"" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The touchscreen you've mentioned saves less than one job. It is more about convenience and speed for the customer. It would only eliminate a job in an extremely high volume restaurant with multiple touchscreen ordering stations. Even then the job would be just be moved to another part of the restaurant. The ""automated cooking"" you mentioned is nowhere near possible at this point and honestly not worth mentioning. Your entire comment seems condescending towards quick service restaurants as a whole and there is probably a lot that you do not understand about those businesses."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options are limited time contracts that let you buy 100 shares of stock at a set price if and when a stock is above a certain price.  They do not give you any stock, you have the -option- to pay additional money to buy up the stock once the conditions are met, until the option expires.  If the conditions of the option aren't met, it is worthless and nothing happens.

Options that seem impossible to reach (eg, requires the stock to double by the end of the day) can be bought for very cheap, which can make you a ton of money if the impossible happens (stock quadruples before the day ends, so you get to buy stock for only the doubled price stated in the option.)

It goes deeper when you write options on the stocks you own to sell to other people to get a stream of income, (if the options conditions aren't met, you keep your stock while pocketing the money that the option buyer paid for the option, but if the conditions -are- met, and the option buyer decides to exercise, you have to sell your stock to them at the agreed price) but overall it's just one extra layer to gambling on the market."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just look for stocks with good fundamentals that have taken a nosedive recently. Have a look through the option chain, look for a strike price that is over the current price. Now check which strike has the most volume. A lot of good contracts can be had from anywhere between $5-$50. The price for a $5 contract would be listed as . 05 as it represents 100 shares. Don't worry too much about that though. Just look for low price, sell high. Start off small with one contract to get your feet wet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Look for something that downturn buy a bunch of options for .05 or cheaper like 100. Even if it trends up 5 mins later you can double up. If you wait around close to strike could net thousands.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Look up credit and debit spreads. You offset the cost of the option by selling another option at a different strike. There's all sorts of strategies for this. Avoid options with high bid/ask spreads if you can though.

Hedge: protect a position from going tits up

Speculate: lock-in a price expecting to go up.

Example: I buy a call for amc at 4$. Stock goes to 10. I make 6 minus any premium.

Stock goes to 20 after execution of call, you buy a put to protect your nuggets. Up 16 because you got in at 4. You buy a put at 16. Stock goes back to 4 but you close your position and lock in those tendies.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"as someone who just learned and have put some money into them.... what I've figured out is that you don't want to diversify when you play options, as more often than not, they expire worthless.... (unless you buy deep ITM). Pick a really good looking play and play it. Set risk levels to get out when it starts turning the other way. Mathematically there's like a 1/3 chance you get any guac at all.... so if you are only playing a single play, you can get out at a lower profit and your account will be green from it. If you play a wide range across multiple stocks, you have to let your winners really run or else your losers will drown them. 


Also the bid and ask prices can screw you over badly. If the options market for that particular stock isn't busy enough. Try setting your own buy and sell levels for some extra gains. It really adds up."

It was a family office, so all the money it had was this dude Bill Huang's money. I heard earlier that they think he was leveraged 7:1. Let's run with that. Assuming the lower end of the aforementioned range, that means he was worth about $3B.

Three. Billion. Dollars.

And he was levered 7:1.

If I was worth $3B and someone asked me what my risk tolerance was, my answer would be ""fucking ZERO. I am rich as whale milk and all I need to do is not lose all of my money. If it could make a tiny bit over inflation that's fucking wonderful."" I'd be knee deep in top-grade bonds and ancient, boring companies with good dividends and strong balance sheets.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What‚Äôs so funny about Archegos is that Hwang went balls deep in CFDs, one of the most degenerate, if not the most degenerate, financial products around. For the uninformed US retail traders, CFDs are they‚Äôre like options without premiums or limited losses. 

Hwang probably looked at calls and thought ‚Äúnot risky enough. I need unlimited losses.‚Äù"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">  Still, the industry is arguably much better equipped to handle such meltdowns because of rules implemented after the 2008 financial crisis that forced banks to hold significantly more capital as a buffer against losses. 

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA.

normies will never understand finance....

There are two sorts of financial laws for big players:

1) the laws that are so generic that if you applied them, the economy would stop functioning

2) the laws that are so specific that you sidestep them by literally by changing the title of your Word document and creating a new office that does the same thing as the old one but with a different name.

Literally nothing has changed since 2008, it's just that the old fuckers got fired and the new fuckers will be afraid to get fired for a few years or until they get 10+ millions, whichever comes first.

But don't worry, if THOSE new fuckers get fired, a brand new generation is ready to step up and repeat the old mistakes."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I will admit i am a common smooth brain. After reading again I see where I misread OPs article from Yahoo.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs honestly dumb. The bank literally stated that Hwangs family fund would have little impact but the unnamed hedgie  being margin called could result in substantially loses. Yet everyone is focusing on old Hwang while this big US hedgie gets a sentence of mention.

Reporting requirements are also much more loose for hedge funds in general when it comes to derivatives, OTC products, and short stock. Those tend to be reported after the position has been closed.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the reason for the domino effect is the declining shares because of the huge liquidations. $VIAC and $DISCA are already down 50% if other huge HF would be margin called because of their own big positions you would expect the price to fall even further and  other shares starting to tumble as well. Yet yesterday both stocks stabilized and the wider market didn't care at all.

&#x200B;

I am not saying this will not have further ramifications, but if this was such a huge deal for the wider market, I would have expected more unwinding to happen faster, no?

&#x200B;

I also wonder if $20B  to $50B is really so much in HF terms. That is about a week of Powells QE in March 2021."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Six Sigma is a lean initiative. It cuts out unnecessary work from a particular task. It also improves overall cost inefficiency. For instance, I need to move this money across town to the bank. 
Think of ways to improve the process. Let‚Äôs take a more efficient route to avoid the most traffic lights. Let‚Äôs use a bigger truck. Can we use smaller lighter shipping containers to maximize the containers per haul? Is there a better way to stack the money inside the container? Let‚Äôs remove this process because it has no value.

Do you get the idea?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Of that there is a strong possibility. Maybe that's why they keep doing the same routine they are to stupid to do better.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude it hit $40 two months ago.  It has potential to get there in the next 6 months again.  That‚Äôs 100% return from current prices.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cathie secretly funneling all investors money into building an actual ark
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have two shares of PLTR. That's 12% of my whole portfolio

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What potential? For enough retards to gobble it up to 40 again? It‚Äôs a good company, but I feel it‚Äôs overvalued for sure and a long term hold."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Get it right it‚Äôs for GME, AMC and PLTR bro."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What charts are you looking at? I‚Äôm calling the PLTR floor at 19.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Corner handys 1 tug per PLTR share, you do the math."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs been red for two months across the overall market, don‚Äôt worry this will rebound."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. If I can average 1% gain per day (haha!) That's double my money in 2-3 months, 10x return year-over-year. 

To make that baseline, I would need to hit a 10.4% gain in two weeks. 

I bought these two shares at $21.85 on Thursday last week, so I would need it to pass $24.14 either this week or next, which I think has a high probability given all available information.

As long as I can buy back in below that number again..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I bought them last week at $21.85 so I'm still up some
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,We will see who is right soon enough
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That won‚Äôt get me very far, I sold my hands last week for the nth dip.

I have feet, but I‚Äôd feel dirty about it.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,lol. Gains and PLTR. You make me laugh.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought around $23...  it bought a decent amount.
Stings a bit at the moment but I have hope."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,pltr to anything in the teens won't happen...lowest it will go is 19.99 for 1 second before it bounces.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How big is your mouth, can you fit 2 at once.  If so you are laughing!  Mostly gagging, but still laughin!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't worry; it'll hit $27 this week or next before it goes back down
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously can‚Äôt read a chart trading at $21.64 rn so we will see soon enough.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk, I have principles"

Only problem is, A M C took advantage of all of the hype, you‚Äôre literally paying 6 X the valuation for a company that never had near the amount of short interest that GME had, you might squeeze it back to 12 or even 14, but it simply doesn‚Äôt have the dynamics to send it further. I hope you all prove me wrong though, I‚Äôll be watching from the sidelines. God speed soldiers."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, ""un-researched FUD"". This comes straight from the company's SEC filings. You can read them all in the link at the bottom, but you'd probably just prefer to follow sentiment blindly. Not really sure where I've ever referenced a motley fool article either, but whatever. 

I'm not saying that the vote to release another 5 million shares is definitive. What I am saying is they've already released another around 3.5 million shares in the last 6 months. Most of us realize that a stock's price rises with demand which is tied to supply. Take GME for example, it was shorted to 140% of float, and float was around 45 mil (almost 10x less than AMC today, but closer to 2x less four months ago), it didn't take much demand for the price to rise, and for shorts to cover because there weren't that many shares available. Now, we look at AMC, there are roughly 404 mil shares float, with 11% of that volume shorted as of 3/15. This stock peaked in January when there were only 100 mil shares available, and a significant amount of the stock being shorted, it peaked again around the time retail was receiving their stimulus checks. I personally don't see how anyone could hold this stock knowing the intentions of the board members, and the potential for this bubble to pop if they were to release another substantial offering, but to each their own i guess.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another consideration since you're big on $GME. If all investors dumped $AMC, and it goes to $0.00 a share, also taking into consideration both $AMC and $GME follow the same trendline, what does that mean for you?

&#x200B;

How are they always following the same trendline? The answer is ETFs. Okay take $AMC completely out of the equation, the stock falls to $0.00. How much more power does that give the HFs to short the ETFs $GME is in? 

&#x200B;

I wouldn't be so quick to spread FUD on $AMC. It is inadvertently helping the HFs everyone is SUPPOSED to be against. Right now, $AMC is helping spread attention, but take one out of the equation and the house of cards falls, and not in your favor."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs not to release 5 million. It‚Äôs 500 million. AMC shareholders are fucked.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you as a $GME holder should be more concerned with those $70 equity shares that may or may not enter the market depending on what THEY decide (10-K), than what $AMC might do based on a shareholder vote, don't you think?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs got a nice load of shares so CC is the perfect play.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably true. 
He can still turn it down tho, or otherwise amend the bonus structure to kick in (higher) after re-opening nationwide. On the other hand, it is hard to turn down money you are legally due"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Eh, I feel like there's terms and conditions to the bonuses. Would've been nice if he said he'd pass on the bonus until business is back to normal. Their cash flow is already limited & the people at the bottom are suffering for it while he's getting big bonuses... Optics of it don't look great. As for the stock price, tf did he do to contribute üòÇ. Went up mostly cuz retail investors on reddit as far as I know. Don't totally understand the whole diluting shares thing, but I feel like that had something to do with my 80% gains dropping to 0% in 3 days."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean there are people in this thread about AMC denying AMC is currently trying to dilute shares and payout bonuses. So I mean, FOMO is real. It causes bias and people to see what they want and act on emotion."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they did... Parroted opinion about the execs, check. Plus they were in at 2500 and it tanked 567? What the hell price point did they buy in at?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, they keep diluting. I think gme is a better stock if you are banking on a squeeze."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never said I was ""big on GME"", It just makes for a good comparison since they're brought up simultaneously here, and said to ""squeeze"" for the same reasons. 

Big shocker here: Nearly all stocks follow the same trendline, especially those that are grouped into the same industry ( like entertainment, or meme stocks) **most of the time,** with the exception of certain factors like negative news, additional share offerings, lawsuits, etc. that impact the individual stock. Have you asked yourself why GME is up 10.5% now, while AMC is down 1.5%? Maybe the market is factoring in the impending dilution?

&#x200B;

Most people know that the market is comprised of mainly ETFs, index funds, hedge funds, etc. The idea that HF's team up and push one stock goes to zero and then all go and pile on another is laughable, you think they don't compete against each other too? You think they don't have access to short interest data, and understand the metrics of why a stock might rise or fall?

&#x200B;

I wouldn't be so quick to accuse others of spreading FUD, I'm only trying to bring attention to the actual factors that will drive the price up or down in an attempt to warn new investors of the repercussions should there be further dilution.

&#x200B;

With all the time you spend on here defending AMC in every bearish comment, I'm not convinced that you aren't working for an institution of some sort that seeks to gain by keeping the price inflated. That or you bought in at $20 and are desperate for some sort of confirmation bias. I've already made my money on this one, and I'm moving on. Good luck."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right, I was looking at an X .01 abbreviated chart and mistyped. Fucked for sure if that passes, I highly doubt retail is organized enough to vote against it, or if they even have the amount of votes required. Institutional investors hold AMC's debt and want a return on their investment long term, the only way for them to get there is to sell more shares, cover debt, and do a buyback further down the road. There is little upside to the short term here."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At 88% retail holding, it would take a literal act of God for that to pass, but lets ignore that. Not one single person that has received a voting form is voting yes to the 500,000,000 shares.

&#x200B;

Also, where are you getting ""release"" from? It is to add 500,000,000 shares which WOULD not enter the market until a later vote. This vote is just to add them, an additional vote has to take place to put them on the market."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. Theta gang all the way.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you turn that much money down? I wouldn't.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are people in here that are even worse. They think a shareholder vote, to which AMC holders are voting on as we speak, means that the shares have ALREADY been diluted even though the outcome won't even be announced until May 4th. One of the dangers of relying on random Reddit users instead of reading the documents there selves.

&#x200B;

I also saw a bunch of people who said they would sell GME the moment any additional stock options were announced, but I'm guessing they're still ""Diamond hands"" after a bunch of Reddit users told them what they think the 10K is implying.

&#x200B;

Case in point, everyone is full of shit. Don't listen to Reddit users for financial advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They don‚Äôt have that many shares outstanding compared to some businesses. Apes are just going to keep buying these shares and holding. Might not have a major short squeeze but gamma squeezes are likely with a wild option chain.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have some GME not as much as id like to have tho. Soemthings better than nothing
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"--Maybe the market is factoring in the impending dilution?

Then they would be as foolish as most of the people that post the dilution has already happened, because markets don't usually speculate on what happens in a month, but retail investors do! Dilution and equity offerings are typically signs of GROWTH to most of the market, it means partnerships or other company based incentives, but it isn't good for stockholders. Most look at earnings, fundamentals, and annual data. Both AMC and GME are not trading on the fundamentals, one is a theater that risked bankruptcy during a pandemic, the other closed business on very few locations still allowing foot traffic and STILL had to close almost 700 locations; needless to say, none of us are trading fundamentals, it is ALL speculation. Just look at what happened to $GME  when the ""considering additional equity options"" was mentioned. That didn't seem to affect the stock or sentiment all that much, it also isn't being parroted as fact widely, because we all want to believe that Cohen would rather ride bankruptcy than cost us tendies, lol, get real. In fact, with all the big promises Cohen is laying out they would be stupid NOT to introduce shares for equity on those projects, i.e. you lose, Gamestop wins.

2021-03-30 03:46:51,wallstreetbets,"QQQ Priced for Perfection Can Only Go Down Short Term Greetings boner biting bastards,

I've been wondering for the past couple weeks what the bull case for the nasdaq 100 is. Let's see if you smooth brains can handle this next level vaccine boosted (both doses) thought process. 

**Booming economy leading to inflation**

This should be obvious. Pandemic goes away, everyone goes out and spends lots of money, prices increase to meet demand, inflation ensues. Some are arguing this will only be temporary, like Papa Powell. Papa is so against real inflation he's said he's gonna let inflation run hot for a while, maybe as high as 2.4% this year.

[https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio](https://www.npr.org/2021/03/17/978136117/light-at-end-of-tunnel-fed-sees-faster-economic-growth-with-only-modest-inflatio)

But you know what? Powell doesn't control interest rates (kinda but not really). And if the bond market starts to feel like yields are not getting enough bang for their buck, Uncle Sam will have a hard time finding buyers at the next treasury auction. If interest rates rise and depending on how quickly, the Nasdaq will have a real pullback since all these unicorns won't have access to cheap money anymore.

**Pandemic 2.0**

Just when you thought it was safe to kiss grandma, new variants are making covid cool again. Brazil is seeing an uptick in deaths among younger patients as a result of new variants. 

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-26/younger-brazilians-are-dying-from-covid-in-an-alarming-new-shift)

Parts of Europe are going into lockdowns again because of poor vaccine rollouts, pussies. Lets imagine covid doesn't go away as planned and continues to cause problems. This would lead to another general stock market pullback. Maybe not as big as last year, who knows? But all indexes are priced far above pre pandemic levels.

**So what's the bull case?**

I'm asking you, what's the bull case? Perhaps I'll be able to figure it out after my third covid vaccine

Your ‚Äúbooming economy‚Äù point says:

Your lockdown point says: lockdown ‚û°Ô∏è ??? ‚û°Ô∏è stock market crash

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Pent up damand for technology? We're at peak technology. We've already done the pandemic. Going back to a pandemic isn't gonna get ZM thousands more accounts.

But after the selloff QQQ will do well again.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im not saying there's a new lockdown. I'm saying that the overall market is currently priced for a full reopening. If that doesn't happen then the overall market will pull back bringing QQQ with it short term
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's right?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tech has sold off due to sector rotation. If covid lockdowns come back, that money is rotating right back into tech."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"QQQ is only 48% technology, with holdings in travel, consumer staples, energy stocks and health care. Assuming we are at ""peak tech"", which is not an assumption I am comfortable with, rotation would occur into 3 of those.

ZM is roughly 0.0% of QQQs holdings, so nice example.

Your only shot is full on lock-down 2.0, which local governments just won't take anymore and US vaccine roll-out is over a million new people a day. QQQ has and will continue to follow the general market with a slightly higher correlation to tech."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you yourself said that a full reopening would be bearish though. So if the market is priced for reopening then it‚Äôs currently undervalued by your own logic

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok lets look at the top holdings and assume we get another pandemic that doesn't go into lockdown but people still aren't spending like they used to. AAPL, are people going out and buying another MacBook? Or is the lowering of App fees gonna help the bottom line? MSFT, maybe more cloud growth here. AMZN, people are gonna buy more stuff than they already do? I could see higher margins in cloud here. TSLA, we all know this is over priced and now with Voltswagen and other car manufacturers competing I think it's downhill from here. FB and GOOG are facing headwins from congress and the public about their algorithms, I think the bull case is tough until that gets sorted out. 

I just don't see a lot of opportunity here. Anything good is already priced in"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not your friend, pal"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're staring with assuming another pandemic, which does not appear to be the direction for the US and that TSLA is ""overpriced"" when the market clearly has decided otherwise. I'm bearish on TSLA also, but guess what, QQQ can rotate out of it if they want to and momentum takes it that way. Rotation out of tech would cause some downward pressure for QQQ, but it's offset by growth in other areas. There's already talks of stimulus round 4, with a massive vaccination rate.

AAPL sales have already proven to be fairly pandemic resistant.

Look at AMZN's quarterly sales numbers:  
[https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/](https://www.statista.com/statistics/273963/quarterly-revenue-of-amazoncom/)

Consistent growth, every year with massive holidays spikes, so yes people are going to buy more stuff. The same is true with MSFT and cloud/team subscriptions.  


It sounds to me like you're assuming the world is either going to a) completely stop or b) people are going to suddently stop using large cap tech products like they have literally never done before. I find it far more likely we see middle to upper-middle class people who have been able to refi and buy homes at the lowest rates in history, who have been unable to spend discretionary income on anything due to shutdown and are sitting in their houses on a shitload of cash:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I was 16 I strolled into a casino... I could borderline pass for over 18, so I sat at a $5 blackjack table with $200. My dad taught me how to play, so I knew what I was doing. The cards started cold, and I was quickly down over $100. I played about 10 more minutes, slowly bleeding chips. Down to my last $20, I got hot. I had about  2/3 of my money back when the pit boss came over to ask for my ID. Fucker watched me almost lose $200 and had no problem... It wasn‚Äôt until I was about to make money that he suddenly questioned my age"

Lots of plusses yet also minusses to owning.
I don't have a landlord but I have to pay crazy real estate taxes. I don't have any asshole immediate neighbors but I need to keep my house and yard looking good. My appliances are nice but when shit breaks, I need to fix it. Etc.
I think plusses far far outweigh the minusses thus I own a house.

This morning, $HGEN released their great [P3 topline results](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210329005301/en/Humanigen-Reports-Positive-Phase-3-Topline-Results-Demonstrating-That-Lenzilumab%E2%84%A2-Improves-Survival-Without-Need-for-Mechanical-Ventilation-in-Hospitalized-Patients-With-COVID-19) showing a 54%(!!!) relative reduction (Lenzilumab vs. standard of care) in the studies primary endpoint (ventilator free survival through day 28) in the mITT population - which was **statistically significant**. The stock soared to $29.20 (from 13ish) before coming back to earth and settled at $21.61 at market close (on 88.56m volume vs. 32.15m float). This is still a GREAT entry point imo and still below the February high of $23.83 when the market dipped and the shorts increased... I expect the price to rise a lot this week.

The next step for $HGEN is EUA application and (hopefully) approval. This is the big ticket and when the stock will really üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ

Other updates worth noting today - Humanigen announced that they drew the $25m loan from Hercules Capital and suspended their ATM agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-8k-2021-march-29-18715-40)). They also announced an offering of 5m shares ([Source](https://fintel.io/doc/sec-humanigen-inc-424b5-2021-march-29-18715-832)). $HGEN is gearing up for Lenz production.

Things to look out for in the coming days/weeks are the full results of the P3 study, chatter re: FDA/EUA application and approval, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future...

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Originally posted Thursday on r/stocks:

Humanigen ($HGEN), led by CEO Cameron Durant and CSO Dale Chappell, is a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company currently trading at $13.76 (market cap approx $740 million) that most notably makes the Anti-GM-CSF drug \*\*Lenzilumab. It's phase 3 study for severe COVID has been completed and results will be out by end of march. With a successful phase 3 trial, Humanigen will apply and likely be granted Emergency Use authorization (EUA) for production and use of Lenzilumab

**What is it?**

Lenzilumab is a proprietary ( +100 Patents in GM-CSF, CAR-T, CRS, GvHD) Humaneered¬Æ anti-human granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) monoclonal antibody that is designed to prevent and treat an immune hyper-response called cytokine storm, a complication considered to be a leading cause of COVID-19 death. Lenzilumab targets severe COVID ‚Äì patients hospitalized w/ COVID and O2 saturation <94% on room air (90% of hospitalized patients).

**How does it work?**

GM-CSF is an inflammatory signaling protein that causes a multitude of downstream effects. Blah blah blah, the details don‚Äôt matter, but what does matter is that this shit kills people with COVID. Here‚Äôs a recent bombshell article from [Science Immunology](https://immunology.sciencemag.org/content/6/57/eabg9873) that shows the distinct role of GM-CSF in severe COVID-19. What‚Äôs also very important is that this is produced by OUR BODIES. Not the virus. Lenzilumab doesn‚Äôt target the virus ‚Äì it is not susceptible to resistance from mutant strains (\\#variantagnostic)

From the article: ‚ÄúGM-CSF is elevated early, scaled with severity, and is central to the inflammatory response in COVID-19.‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúOur findings support therapeutic targeting of GM-CSF, as previously suggested on theoretical grounds‚Äù

Here‚Äôs another recent study that further implicated GM-CSF in COVID: [Journal of Leukocyte Biology](https://jlb.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/JLB.3COVCRA0920-628RR)

From the article: ""Our findings fully support the emerging notion that GM‚ÄêCSF might be a key feature of SARS‚ÄêCoV‚Äê2‚Äêinduced cytokine storm in COVID‚Äê19 patients""

**Does it work?**

We will find out soon. The company consistently stated Phase 3 results will be released by end of March. 60 days from last date of patient enrollment will be Mar. 29, and with some secondary endpoints being at the 60 day mark, I would not be surprised if data is released on the Monday. Until that day comes, there has been a lot of evidence suggesting that it will be successful. I‚Äôve already talked about GM-CSF and studies implicating it's involvement and role in severe COVID lung pathology, and here's more

1. [Open-label study published by the Mayo Clinic](https://www.mayoclinicproceedings.org/article/S0025-6196(20)30989-7/fulltext) \--> Study showed Clinical Improvement (defined as improvement of at least 2 points on the 8-point ordinal clinical endpoints scale) in 11 of 12 (91.7%) patients treated with lenzilumab and 22 of 27 (81.5%) untreated patients. The time to clinical improvement was significantly shorter for the lenzilumab-treated group compared with the untreated cohort with a median of 5 days versus 11 days (*P*=.006)
2. An interim analysis of HGEN‚Äôs Phase 3 RCT ([NCT04351152](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04351152)) showed promising results ‚Äì with a 37% increase in recovery rate at Day 28 vs. Standard of care treatment. Study size (small sizes being an issue w/ many COVID therapeutics thus far) was increased to help maintain power of the study at 90% based on these results. [Source](https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/humanigen-announces-positive-interim-phase-3-data-of-lenzilumab-in-patients-hospitalized-with-covid-19/).
3. Otilimab ‚Äì a drug from $GSK that also targets GM-CSF ‚Äì recently failed their Phase 3 study. How is that good? Well, despite it being severely underdosed (single 90mg dose w/ shorter half life vs. 1800mg total dose of lenzilumab w/ longer half life) and including patients already on mechanical ventilation (further in disease course), they STILL proved statistical significance in their age 70+ group of patients. Lenzliumab has approx.. 45% of their patients age 65+ (which have a 35-80x risk of hospitalization and 1100-7900x risk of death compared to adolescents as per CDC) as per their interim phase 3 report as compared to 22% in the otilimab trial. The increased dose, greater drug half-life, and better patient population bodes very well for Lenzilumab‚Äôs chance of success
4. Here‚Äôs a recent bullish letter to the editor from \[[Mayo Clinic](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7833532/?fbclid=IwAR3RqXf3i6T9xPnFja_mb5b6p86rLF51SyOXOGimPD5Kgoij0QpBJW87tBs)\]: ‚ÄúAware of the good safety profile of lenzilumab in this current study and previous analysis, the treatment is feasible and safe and the ongoing randomized phase III trial will extensively confirm the lymphocyte recovery in SARS-CoV-2 infection and the impact of the drug on coronavirus disease 2019 clinical improvement‚Äù
5. ACTIV-5 / Big Effect Trial (BET-B) for the Treatment of COVID (NCT04583969)

Funded and selected by the NIH ‚Äì this studies Lenzilumab combined with Remdesvir for the treatment of COVID. Not hard evidence of lenzilumab‚Äôs efficacy, but evidence that Lenzilumab has showed enough promise to warrant being chosen for such a trial

**Competition**

\- There is none right now. All COVID therapeutics that target severe COVID have been dropping like flies. It‚Äôs all for the taking if this phase 3 study succeeds and Emergency Use approval Is granted

**COVID ‚Äì getting worse**

As many of you might‚Äôve heard, COVID isn‚Äôt going away. In fact, there are multiple new variants that are more infectious, more deadly, and more resistant to current vaccinations. Across the globe, COVID cases are rising again and certain areas are being hit especially hard. [CTV news article re: India w/ it‚Äôs new double mutant variant](https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/coronavirus/india-detects-double-mutant-coronavirus-variant-1.5360271), [CNN](https://www.cnn.com/2021/03/19/europe/coronavirus-europe-third-wave-intl/index.html) re: Europe dealing with a surge in cases, and [global news](https://globalnews.ca/news/7720211/brazil-record-cases-covid-19/) re: Brazil hitting record number COVID cases, to name a few. New COVID cases in the US remain pretty low, but between lax restriction and the rise of variant strains [as this nature article shows](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00564-4), we could be seeing another wave in the US as well.

How deadly are these new strains? Still much to be learned, but it‚Äôs looking like current vaccines leave a lot to be desired. [Here‚Äôs a study from the New England Journal of Medicine](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2100362), which studied viral neutralization of some new variants w/ our current vaccines (refer to Table 1). $PFE has decreased (in vitro) efficacy by 2x, 6.7x, <6.5x vs. B117, P1, 501YV2 variants. $MRNA vaccine has decreased efficacy by 1.8x, 4.5x, <8.6x

Google cases worldwide and you will see the # of new COVID cases/day have started to rise after hitting a trough in mid-Feb. Between COVID fatigue and places easing restrictions and the new variants mentioned above, COVID is here to stay and will be for years to come. [Here‚Äôs an article from nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00396-2), which talks about COVID being a endemic virus that we will be dealing with on a year to year basis. Unfortunately, the market is huge for #lenzilumab

6. Not a partnership, but $HGEN recently announced an $80million loan w/ Hercules Capital on Mar. 10 to support manufacturing and commercialization. Bullish move close to P3 data release imo. \[[Source](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20210310005879/en/Humanigen-Announces-80-Million-Loan-Facility-from-Hercules-Capital)\]

**TL;DR - lots of partnerships and agreements in place for manufacturing if EUA approval granted**

**The Market**

Here‚Äôs a PDF PowerPoint of $HGEN corporate presentation: [Humanigen](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx). The whole presentation gives a great overview of the company and I recommend a look through, but skip to slide 18 and you can get a rough sense of the market potential. There are 3 sources of incomes:

1. Stockpiling ‚Äì US and ex-US
2. US market
3. Outside the US market

US market: Conservative estimates from the company believes there will be 1,000,000+ hospitalizations in the US this year, with approximately 100,000 patients as a market for Lenzilumab treatment. At 10k per dose, an approximate 1bil of revenue is up for the taking

Outside the US market:

1. The market is there with cases numbers rising across the globe
2. Humanigen has been in discussion with ex-US governments already about production of lenzilumab (skip to 24:00 on the [Mar 16 fireside chat webcast](https://ir.humanigen.com/events-and-presentations/default.aspx))

**Price forecasting:**

Conservative estimates from the company project 100k doses for the US alone in 2021 if given EUA approval. This gives approximate revenue of 1bil. This doesn‚Äôt include any non-US sales or stockpiling.

With positive phase 3 trial data, I see the price share easily shooting up to 50-60+. The next step would be applying for Emergency Use Approval, with acceptance likely if P3 study is successful. If granted, and going by the very conservative estimate of $1billion in revenue, I think $HGEN‚Äôs market cap will easily be $5bil+, giving it a PPS of roughly $100+.

**BONUS -> HIGH SHORT INTEREST**

$HGEN short interest has almost doubled from Feb 26->Mar 15!!!. Yahoo finance estimates a 26% short interest as of Mar 15 w/ a Short ratio of 4.12 given the stock‚Äôs low trading volume. With the recent drop in price the past couple days, I would not be surprised if this number was higher. TL;DR -> more fuel for the rocket ships

**BONUS BONUS ‚Äì CAR-T implications and more**

Lenzilumab is a cytokine storm drug, not a COVID drug. It is also in a phase 1b/2 study (ZUMA-19) where it is paired w/ a CAR-T drug Yescarta (by $GILD) for the treatment of relapsed/refractory Large B-Cell lymphoma. Car-T therapy is basically genetically engineered T-cells that can target a specific protein, or cancer. The main issue with CAR-T therapy is that it has significant side effects via cytokine storm and neurologic toxicity. Early studies have already shown that Lenzilumab significantly reduces cytokine storm side effects in CAR-T and actually IMPROVES overall efficacy. The readout for this study is planned for this year and there is precedent for CAR-T FDA approval based on phase 2 studies. I don‚Äôt have the energy to go into detail so I will leave it at that, but this has HUGE long term possibilities and gives $HGEN significant long term value outside of COVID

\*\*Edit to expand on CAR-T a bit more: I don‚Äôt want to downplay this, I think it‚Äôs very promising and I‚Äôm very bullish on it, but I‚Äôm admittedly not as researched on the minutia and writing up covid stuff tired me out XD. There‚Äôs 3 main players in the Car-T space and Lenzilumab (which has the patent for preventing Cytokine storm and neurotoxicity related to T cell therapy) could be the missing piece to make this therapy safer. $GILD had dropped another anti-GM-CSF drug from $KNSA and decided to go ahead with just lenzilumab, as well.

Lenzilumab also is in a phase 2/3 study for preventing/treating acute GvHD and also CMML phase 2.

$HGEN also has ifabotuzumab, a drug for treating solid tumors, which is currently in phase 1

**TL;DR: Short term covid play w/ ++high upside (potential 5-10x ROI) and high short-interest w/ long term CAR-T potential.**

Imo, $HGEN is a very appealing short term, high risk phase 3 COVID trial play with extremely high reward. With successful P3 studies, I see the PPS skyrocketing to 60+ and w/ EUA to 100+ (5bil+ market cap) as a conservative estimate. With stockpiling and ex-USA partnerships, the PPS will soar past 100 and w/ CAR-T the potential is even greater. Of course, the downside is a failed trial and price plummets to around $6 I think. Given the stocks low float and low trading volume, it is very volatile and subject to easy price manipulation. It has dropped approx. 25% the past month down to $13.76 and is extremely appealing at this price range. There is downside, but the upside is much much greater.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cheaper than keeping them on a ventilator for 2-3 weeks and then dying
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not a vaccine. It's to keep extremely sick people off vents and from dying which apparently it does well. There were studies done in the USA and Brazil and Humanigen will be looking to sell the drug in both countries. Brazil is particular is in real bad shape with 20-30 year old's dying from the new variant down there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It ran up because it passed phase 3 clinical trials. The next step would be FDA approval for emergency use (EUA). A lot are expecting the same action when it‚Äôs actually approved.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated comment
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I already been waiting 6 months bro
2021-03-30 01:56:04,wallstreetbets,"PSXP, the hidden strangle bet. One day I was looking for long term value stocks, doing some basic screening, high dividends and low P/E ratios. Simple.

I came across PSXP, which has a extremely high distribution of roughly 12%. I looked deeply into the fundamentals of this company, finding it great. Extremely undervalued. They have strong relations with their General Partner (Phillips 66), and no sign of that ending anytime soon. They are a cash machine, with a safe distribution. There is no reason that it shouldn't have risen to about $55, where it was Pre-Covid. It is currently at $30. The units are really cheap. I couldn't wrap my head around it.

&#x200B;

[1 year chart for stock price](https://preview.redd.it/3nmz6depg1q61.png?width=700&format=png&auto=webp&s=f6485fac7902bd05637626096b481c2c1801d29c)

That's when I realized about the Dakota Access Pipeline, which unfortunately, they own about 25%. They are overleveraged about this, representing about 13% of their adjusted EBITDA. The problem with this is that the DAPL (Dakota Access Pipeline) is currently under disputation whether it should be shut down, with most people agreeing that they will shut it down. DAPL took out 2.5 billion in debt, and PSXP will be forced to take their fair share of that debt. The lowering in cash flow, more debt, and potential fees for operating the pipeline without an easement, would most likely bring in a cut to the distribution, and the stock will lose value.

Doing more research, I found the pipeline is currently still operating. There is a court date April 9th, which will determine whether the operator, Energy Transfer, can keep it operating. If it is forced to close, PSXP will probably reach to the low $20s. Naturally this seems like puts are the way to go.

However, there is still a chance that they could keep it open, and the Environment Impact Statement still has a year until finished, so the opportunity for them to keep it operating for even a year is huge. This would probably carry the stock higher, especially without the worry of an dividend cut. The price would most likely exceed $38, potentially as high as $50.

I used to own, but I'm selling for a small gain. The natural bet would be options, in a strangle like pattern. The opportunity is too good to not play. The options are also really cheap, allowing huge upside. For me, I like APR 16 options and MAY 21. $35 and $25 calls/puts is what I will be doing personally. I already have various positions. I also have been trying to get $40 APR 16 calls for $1 per contract. The upside is huge and the return on investment could be easily 100 times on those.

[My current positions in PSXP](https://preview.redd.it/zaytype2h1q61.png?width=466&format=png&auto=webp&s=72de4fb49bcec6ae5e6a49404802f85b643ceaf7)

This option profit calculator contains my current positions and my hopes. I feel like this is a bet that something will happen, which feels like almost a guarantee. However, if they push the court date back, or its a wash, I will probably have a hard time selling the contracts. But I feel like its bound to move.

***This is not financial advice. Please trade and invest at your own risk. I own various option positions in PSXP.***"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow. This is actually really solid DD. I had to check I was in the right sub...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Trial was originally scheduled for Feb 9, 2021, and delayed to April 9.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice DD! I‚Äôm in. Do you have sense of the potential impact on ET?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,People don‚Äôt realize the safest way to transport liquid or gas in large quantities is by pipeline. There is a reason why you don‚Äôt have a tanker of water shipped to your house and a continuous gas line that always runs. I like PSXP the only thing is this dividend is taxed as ordinary income so keep that in mind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You lost me at DAPL, that debt is too scary for me"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha thanks! I really did my research into this one.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still some risk obviously. But I figure that it has potential and is an asymmetric bet in my opinion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing, however it was delayed to discuss with the new administration. This is one of the risks with this, because if it gets pushed back, your taking a loss on those options. However, I find this very unlikely because now the administration has been filled and I do believe they will go forward this time. Not to mention the more they push back the court date, the longer they can run the pipeline.

""The United States Army Corps of Engineers  hereby seeks a continuance of the February 10, 2021 status conference for fifty-eight days in order for the United States Department of Justice to brief new officials regarding this case."" There is totally still a possibility they could push it back. And there is not much warning if they want to do it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I read ET‚Äôs prospectus. It would be ‚Äúadverse‚Äù if DAPL shut down. Maybe another strangle opportunity there.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep totally true, some people are fine with that, especially considering the size of the distribution.

On the note of transportation, totally agree, pipelines are the way to go. That's part of the problem, because if the pipeline gets shutdown, they would be forced through already made contracts, to move the oil in the future, which would be expensive through trains."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but that's why you also buy puts. Because right now, with the odds probably DAPL being shut down, the stock will hit the low twenties."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think ET is not in a bad position, I mean they are the operator. The reason I choose PSXP cause it would be the MOST adverse for PSXP to lose DAPL, they would be forced to cut their distribution. ET already did that, and while it would effect them, I would see them dip on the news then keep chugging along."
2021-03-30 01:52:03,wallstreetbets,Who's the real danger to the market? 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,WSB users can only bankrupt themselves. Hedge funds can take down other firms/investors(small/big/institutional) and in worst case crash the system.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚Äú The European Union regulators said that the Redditors' actions ""could constitute market manipulation""...guys?!...guys?!  Are you thinking what I‚Äôm thinking?...

PUTS ON EUROPE!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So is Bill Hwang an even bigger /u/controlthenarrative?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Biggest danger to the market is you smooth brain apes diamond hand holding.   That will short squeeze the shit out of this market. Goodbye 401k.  

To the moon!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i cant point fingers, i only have thumbs"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky for us Bill Hwang showed up to make us all look good!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,the real danger is the money creation.  tell me how much QE/bail out/ stimulus/ budget deficit to be done and that will reveal approx prices of stonks.  will the brakes be tapped or applied or is it full brrrrrrr ahead?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. Nobody‚Äôs gonna play the game if they let certain players get away with cheating.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I read somewhere that Cramer makes out with his dog.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm holding everything I have across 32 (was 35) stocks. Not giving up a single dime! Fuck ‚Äòem!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The people you are after are the people you depend on.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just uphold the illusion these nobodies can strike it rich and they will keep playing.

Vast majority don't care if someone is cheating someone else. Nobodies only care when it affects them directly, even once something is exposed the blame is easily diverted to some other nobody.

People are stupid and don't care so long as their are others below them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Poor dog
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I might have read that he also gives the dog sleeping pills first.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone call Toyota and let them know there is about to be a high demand for Camrys. Never go full ape on trash stocks unless they have the same elements as GME/AMC
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Still rocking a 00 Camry. Let's see if GME let's me buy a Tesla.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Foodstamps or Ferrari man
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bitch i already drive a 97 camry, dip cant hurt me"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got 27.5 4/30c so I‚Äôll be right next to you in the 99 Camry, brother!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Camry is more reliable
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought that shit at $25 then it dipped for a month and when it came back up I just broke even and called it a day. Checked it just now, no regerts"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You haven't seen a PLTR dip yet.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Camry smells...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk why everyone wants a Lambo; they are terrible for driving around everyday and you will basically spend all of your money just fueling, insuring, and maintaining that thing. Lambo is for the super billionaires otherwise it‚Äôs the same as someone who makes $30k a year driving a Benz."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You need that 93 camry! üî•

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,RKT is in the business of mortgaging and digitization of mortgaging ; improving the customer facing side of things. The company makes a shitload of money but stock price doesn‚Äôt really reflect that. Now also RKT is considered by some as a distraction scheme from GME. Given the fundamentals of the company and the seemingly ongoing fuckery with this stock  I don‚Äôt find that last theory very plausible.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The 20m shares was put up for sale off market and didn't really have anything to do with the price dump
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, RKT did what RKT has done since it‚Äôs run to $40."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I moved all my gme off rh also :-)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its kinda ironic because my etrade was originally my rocket play and gme was my robinhood but after vlad fukked us in gme I pulled out and then etrade fukked me on margin for my rocket so here ya go vlad

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Any ideas for us girth lovers?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"it may look bad, but if you have love, deep deep deep love for that sweet sweet sweet $RKT it all looks good.  To me it looks amazing on a technical basis but thats just me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, sell CC's on your shares, this increases your capital girth for those needing to fill in for what they can't make up for in length"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep. It's meant to be for memes and degenerative gambling. Investing in long stocks for slow growth gains isn't them.
2021-03-30 00:56:35,wallstreetbets,$BB YOLO because MarketWatch can kiss my gorilla ass for spreading FUD before earnings 
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I yolo 2k on $10 call for this week ü•≤
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB will go up. It‚Äôs definitely a long hold with a crazy upside to come. John Chen is guiding this company the same way he did with Sybase. I will stay for the whole ride happily.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,LET'S GO BB! I'm stoked to the tits on this rocket ship!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Its been a while since I saw a BB post get traction like this. We got shoved in the dark ever since GME/AMC

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So should I put 10k into this bitch?

Edit: guys I did not. Sorry I overslept and bought GME instead."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah, I forgot about BB.... Is it a good time to average down? I'm fucked."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB was the first stock I ever bought. I think you will do well getting it this low.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold apes will will get you at $25 we‚Äôre coming for you
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this. I‚Äôve had BB since last year. At one point I was up $50k and rode it back down to about break even. Really hoping to see a bounce back in the near future!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have so much BB... but it seems like I still need to buy more.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold is the bottom line. BB has growth potential that could lead the tech market
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 1100 shares. Might buy more depending what tomorrow brings. GL
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"checking the google machine... it says EPS expected is 0.03 and Revenue expected is between 245.11M to 247.87M depending on source.

last quarter  BB reported 0.02 and Revenue of 224.00M.

Last year same quarter BB reported EPS 0.09 on 291.00M Revenue.

That said, banks/institutions/HF all see to have the inside scoops days before on everything, and this stock has been on the decline these last few days - maybe they know something?  Maybe its just a correction?  Maybe its because its a meme stock and slightly high in price?

I might transfer some money around and take a chance and jump in tomorrow, or buy a call."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Canadian here holding 1375 shares.

And typing on a blackberry phone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB is coming good. They are bringing the fight now and ready to compete for their slice of security market. Price is artificially low...

Good deal!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubled my longterm position in BB also, bringing my total basis down.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like BB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now is the time to buy, I wish I could get more. If it's this low in a few weeks I will be buying!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre up now
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, did you sell your GME or did you just have another 460k sitting around to invest?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude how did that work out for you? Its like Eddie Mush bet on that horse to
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Kinda odd that most people have an avg well above the current price. No manipulation going on here
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve got about 40 years. Maybe I‚Äôll break even.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like I'll have enought time to buy up more shares. Between my two accounts I'm at 45 shares. I'll continue buying more since it's still cheap. I've been looking at calls too. I told my buddies that BB will be long hold.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Real question: is this a good stock to buy or not?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I doubled up at that exact price too.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is there any good DD on BB? üßê

Because I haven't a clue how they are staying a float anymore."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Do we know what time the earnings are to be released ?

Tho, it's still a great long play."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just have a quick question about options. And yes if you want you can downvote me. 

If I believe a stock is at its lowest point but will take time to move up and I mean move up a ton so long options sound like the best thing to do or just buy the stock

I am 20 with a 40hr work week making 25$/hr. And about a year with minimal investing experience when it comes to options. I‚Äôve just started doing hours upon hours of research. So I‚Äôm starting to understand it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since your post BB is down almost 10%. How the hell did I get into this with 3k shares, I still don't know."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiot

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,my avg is about 23CAD. 211 shares. PAIN
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. At least when it was a meme the way otm call premium was good and took a 25% loss (of value) down to only like 20%. I'm sure by the end of the year even if it stays in the 9s I'll recoup the value loss in selling calls.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,780 at 17 hope to have 1000 shares before our BB lands on moon to fuel up so it can leave the Galaxy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been averaging down almost every day the past 2 weeks to the point that it‚Äôs now 35% of my portfolio

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed. I grabbed 10.5 C
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm Canadian so it feels like my patriotic duty to yolo on them. Bring in earnings I guess.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I made money on GME and on APPH (because tomatoes) but not BB. What kind of upside down world is this
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,BB and NOK should consider a merger or a collab of some kind
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What does BB do now that the ""crackberry"" fad is long gone?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">Last guy who YOLOd 6 figures online, did great the next day. So I‚Äôm in on BB now


I've seen far worse rationale for buying in. Makes as much sense as most anything else."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hell yes!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wouldn't worry too much. Many people will be left feeling empty after GME and looking to reinvest their earnings. 

I'm in on $BB and looking forward to everyone tendies going into $9 shares"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a great time to average down. I have a few hundred shares at $12 and was thinking of doubling down when the market opens to lower my average. Glad to see others who still have faith in BB here.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,9 is a great price to average down at tbh
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm stuck at an 18.70 average.  I can't decide if I double down or leave it be.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the phase you were looking for is ‚ÄúI‚Äôm jacked to the tits in BB.‚Äù

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,$18 what up
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long play, not earnings IMO. I really don‚Äôt see this moving an inch. Even if they blow earnings out, which they won‚Äôt, it‚Äôll pop for a day, if even that.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol a 4% unrealized loss hardly compares to what happened to that guy's YOLO.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,These fluctuations are all short term BS. We're holding a great company.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, $10 seems like a solid average.  I'm at 13 still trying to work my way down still.  I've dumped so much money into already though that it barely moves when I pick up new shares."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Today was your chance to get out alive! This is not financial advice, I just can‚Äôt stand that piece of shit BlackBerry phone. I do hope you fuk the hedgiez but at the end of the day,  the blackberrie is such a piece of shit, I can‚Äôt even wrap my head around it."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Options let you use little capital to place a bet. So instead pf buying 100 shares (can be pricey, like tesla) you can buy 1 option contract. Lets say its 5k 

But if it doesnt workout u can lose half the bet fast"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Start selling weekly OTM calls and recover the losses. Atleast thats what Im doing.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm at $18 myself üò•. Afraid to cut my losses now because it will shoot up if I do.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too. $20.59. Will just have to hold it a bit longer. Sticking to initial plan. DGAF. Have enough time.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"24,30 ! Good thing i just bought a single share ahah"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I averaged down to $14. It'll go up

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"i mean, technically, you weren't wrong. GME just had more apes [or whoever is really drawing the strings] behind it to shoot the price up again"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did the same. 

I usually invest my monthly savings in index funds, but decided set aside a small amount to gamble on the meme stocks (guess I am not completely retarded). So I bought 250$ GME @56$ and 1000$ BB @12$.

Wish I had put it all, or at least the larger sum, into GME."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bought a billy today too. Only at 350. Picking up another after earnings plays out.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cyber security suites and operating systems for automotive. Most vehicles produced today run BlackBerry‚Äôs QNX OS and bull cases for BB usually predict that self-driving/autonomous vehicles will need a well established platform that puts particular emphasis on secure communications and real-time data analytics

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lockdown has changed a lot of things for sure. Meme culture in stocks is something no one ever thought of lol..

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you basically YOLOed over $580k into GME a few weeks back (currently worth $1.9M) and now about another half million into BB eh. I aspire to be like you some day lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I wasnt knocking you, i follwed you in."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting, I will have to dig more into this. Thanks.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"sell please,"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's how I feel about ocgn. I bought high and have leveraged down a bit but still not enough. My share count rises and my losses grow larger and larger everyday. I refuse to give up on it. I know if I do it will skyrocket. I have faith in that vaccine and what I've learned about them. It's not a loss until I sell and gme has taught me to hold.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Take one for the team bro pls
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1600 @ $15 - Where's my membership card?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah at this point I believe in both so I'm holding
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeahhhhh I started buying BB back in jan and I dumped way more in to BB and just bought 3 GME at first in the 30s lol. By the time I was a full believer the price was much higher but whatever I'm already up plenty so it's hard to complain
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was torn at buying UWMC or BB this morning as they both dipped. 

UWMC dipped harder, BB still might dip more after earnings because everyone eats crayons at earnings."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I'm anticipating a climb tomorrow followed by a dip on Wednesday after earnings. It's a long term play for me anyway so it doesn't really matter what it does but it'd be nice to pick up a few more shares while the price is still depressed.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously never heard of Mama Su or $MUney
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,...This sub existed before lockdown and DEFINITELY had a meme culture
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I take this as an endorsement to buy significant amounts of bb. Thank you for your financial advise.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You got it brother
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No need to focus on these small percentages in the short term. We're holding a great company at great prices. This will be evident soon.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks!!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The patent sales for their phone related software is already done afaik
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No I meant SELL otm calls not buy them. If you have atleast 100 shares then you can sell call contracts and make a little money.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You can try looking up on YouTube. I'm sure someone has posted how to do it.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea coz of less volatility üòî
Unless you have enough to sell multiple contracts you wont have a good margin."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,ha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 @ 13.30 checking in...yay!!!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao I was totally right, I have the final 1k in powder I can hurl at this meme roth and it's gonna go into BB as soon as I see a spicy entry tomorrow."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah i keep averaging down on uwmc and bb and its pretty much my portfolio now.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oooooh my bad. Yeah I know I still can‚Äôt do that unfortunately because I have just under 100..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So what do you buy them for? Im in a similar situation. I dont see how you can profit off them. Ive got about 500 shares
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"100 @ 20.60. 

Jesus did you grab the tippiest top?

Also, I bought on the way up. I coulda profited but held strong bb"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,60 @ 10.60..... gonna buy more today as it‚Äôs under $9
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you're going to be freakin rich one day!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh okay. The loss shouldn't be terrible then. I'm bag-holding 300 shares of Canadian version of BB avg 21 lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you still believe that BB is worth investing in and you really are close to 100 shares, it might be worth buying the remaining shares you need to get to 100 so you can start selling calls.  Just pick an OTM price target that you'd be OK with exiting your position if that happens to hit. You may only end up making a couple bucks a week on it, but it will eventually add up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't buy the contracts I sell covered calls for a premium. Since you have 500 shares you can sell 5 contracts. You can pick the expiry date and the strike price. The longer the expiry the greater the premium. But you cant sell your shares until the contract expires or you buy back those call contracts for what ever price it is at that time.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, also holding 100 NOK @ 6.60 I am a certified retard"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy fuck this whole thread makes me feel smart with my 100 @ 11.05

But i am not. lol"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it‚Äôs not but between all my ‚Äúmeme‚Äù stock losses they add upüòÇ but yeah that sucks.. if you felt like you needed to add to those shares you could always average down lol

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Am I the only one that doesn‚Äôt fully understand the screen shots? So it the floor for VIAC around 46 since that‚Äôs where most of the block trades were
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like their plan is to unload slowly instead of in one session. Maybe several weeks of this. At least it protects the broader market from plunging
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Toss a block of $FTCH my way tank that sh*t some more

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They need to liquidate or come up with cash on their own, they aren't doing this because they want to or don't like the stock, they are doing it because they have to cover big-dong-hwang's option positions as they are essentially assuming those positions, so they are selling this stuff to hedge out that risk... Of course there will be some risk they are willing to hold on to, but not much if the rumors of how bad Hwangs trades were are accurate."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Factset- I get it for free courtesy of my college.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol i feel like with financial products the quality of the data/platform is inversely related to the quality of the GUI - Robbinhood vs Bloomberg Terminal 

this is factset btw"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That *was* their plan: Archegos's Prime Brokers ($GS, $MS, $CS $NMR) supposedly got together last week and decided to slowly liquidate their positions but then Goldman decided to go against their gentlemen's agreement, buy a load of puts and dump shares on Friday, then Morgan Stanley did the same thing leaving $CS and $NMR with Billions in losses since many of these stocks fell over 50% from the liquidations."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Valaris
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could the sell be more related to poor performance by their new discovery+ streaming service?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't what gs did the exact definition of insider trading?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think they've released any numbers yet. Next earnings call is in may I believe. I can say beyond a shadow of doubt, the news they release for subscriptions will be positive. Reality TV will always be in demand, and they really do a lot of it. 
It's all due to the margin call on that hedge fund."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Not really. Insider trading is if GS had specific non public information about the company itself such as non public earning reports or some future product release. But in this case the non-public information was just about the changes in ownership of the stock itself which the company probably didn‚Äôt even know about.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but the real question will be whether people want to pay for that as a separate service. Lots of homes already have Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu or some combination of those. Add HBO Max on top for some households, it gets to be a lot. CBS All Access and Discovery+ can't be doing that well. All of those services also have some amount of reality shows in their library."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I share some of your sentiment, I hate subscription services, I hate cable more.  But people who watch the brands on Discovery+ already, love it.  Discovery makes good money already.  They are green all the way back to ten years.  They are going to appeal to their market, and then more.  Do you watch any of their shows.  They have some of the craziest reality tv shows, and people just eat that stuff up.  They are going to have exclusive shows and extras that can only be had on Discovery+.  It will work.  Which is why I took my shot already and bought calls.  Hopefully my DD is good and I didn't fool myself, lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They sat at ~$20 for years and only started gaining exponential growth in January.  Almost seems like a regression to the mean regardless of the reason for the price drop.  Where is the value that justifies a bigger price? DD?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I got rid of my cable subscription around 2016 so I don't know what's on their much anymore. I believe they turn a profit with their shows but I'll be on the lookout for their numbers whenever they get released. I hope you make a profit at least.

Continued shortages and supply/logistical problems have caused the costs of many basic materials like aluminium to spike up and often double/triple, meaning that there's possibly some significant price inflation on the horizon. 

Steel price is up 190% from last year

Several materials needed for solar panel production like glass and polysilicon are in short supply too

The price of shipping a container across the world has gone up from +-$2000 to $8000-$12000

And that's not nearly all of it, stuff like wood and ofcourse semiconductors are also suffering significant shortages

But more than anything, I just want a single butterfly, just ONE to land on my dick. Every evening after work I coat my my penis in different concentrations of sugar water and I head outside, waiting, searching for one sweet fluttery suitor. Most nights I don't even see any. On the few occasions I do, they're uninterested in my high fructose member. 

I've decided to cultivate my own brood now. I'm going to grow them from caterpillars.  Watch them delicately complete their metamorphosis.  Whisper to them gently and softly as they evolve. And, eventually, I'll release them, waiting with bated breath in the hopes that one of them lands on my nether regions. It will have no idea what it's done. It won't understand the importance of its seemingly meaningless brief rest. Like a sacrificial lamb being lead to the Lord on the proverbial stone table. 

And in that moment I imagine I'll glance down, sighing a sigh of immense relief after weeks and weeks of fruitless attempts. Ill watch those beautiful, colorful wings close, then open, EVER so slowly. As if winking at me and saying ""hey, pal. You did it.""

Then I'll snap a photo for all the retards here that believed in me, and also those that didn't. And in that moment, I'll know. Everything is going to be just fine."

He had such a knowledge of the dark pools that he could even keep the ones he cared about from debt. The darkpools of the Farce is a pathway to many analyses some consider to be unnatural. He became so rich... the only thing he was afraid of was losing his money, which eventually, of course, he did.

I didn't know shit about dick, WSB wasn't around, so I yolo'd some bullshit short play on oil 3x ETF with as much margin as they let me have. I got margin called the next day or the day after and a call from E-trade and the guy on the other end was like, WTF are you doing?!?! Who told you to do that?!?!? I lied and said my Dad.

My Dad is advising me."

I mean you are leveraging 743X here. But- anything is possible. If I‚Äôm these 3 days pltr gains 70%- you officially become a millionaire."

2021-03-29 23:29:55,wallstreetbets,"National Security risks of hedge fund over-leveraging This is brushing up against politics a bit, so we'll see if it survives mod attention.

With two recent high profile incidents of hedge funds becoming irresponsibly overleveraged in the market (Melvin Capital and Archegos) and causing market wide effects, it seems worth exploring the national security implications of continued poor oversight of institutional leverage in equities markets, and the potential economic effects. 

With numerous countries with adversarial relationships to the US and NATO powers having a much more managed approach to their citizens business ventures and economic output, it is not far fetched to consider that overleveraging can become a tactic of economic warfare, and a way of winning or setting advantageous conditions for wars without firing a shot. 

China is the classic and most probable candidate for this, so we'll start with them as an example. Consider their practice of internment and reeducation for Chinese leaders of businesses who become problematic for the state, such as Jack Ma with Alibaba. Consider also their fairly commonly known practice of leveraging western students and workers of Chinese descent in order to commit industrial espionage. From these two points, we can consider a hypothetical scenario where the CCP could engineer a domino crash through planned use of leveraging and defaults, either through a single action (apply pressure to an economic agent to both become overleveraged and then insolvent) or multistep (apply pressure to one or several agents to become over-leveraged, and then act seperately to cause a disruption in that area and subsequent defaults).

The utility of this sort of attack is twofold. It can be used to provide a distraction on demand, where unwanted attention on international affairs could be diverted by engineering a domestic economic crisis, compounded with social media campaigns. It could also be used as a prelude to military action, in order to attack a country's defense contracting and solvency for defense spending indirectly, while at the same time sowing internal strife to reduce the capability for a decisive and coherent response to provocation.

This type of attack would be difficult to predict and mitigate the effects of as either a retail or institutional investor, as it could be triggered with little to no warning from traditional indicators. Hedging against it would be tricky as well, but would most likely be found with plays on defense contractors such as $OSK, $BA, $LMT, ect. if the situation escalated to armed conflict. In this case, the saying ""an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure"" holds very true, as the best course of action would be addressing the use of leverage by institutional investors before a state actor uses it as an instrument of war. 

TLDR; Institutional leverage can and will be exploited at some point as a form of economic warfare by state actors, causing pre-planned recessions or economic crashes.

Edit: I'm for $GME going up and did well myself off of it, but everyone commenting ""GME hodl"" on every single post, no matter how unrelated, you are ruining this sub and helping to reduce the same kind of content that led to the sub discovering and getting on board with $GME to begin with. Dont kill the golden goose over one fucking egg."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If China systematically dumped stocks in the US trying to crash the market it would probably work, but only in the short term. Buyers would step in and buy the assets that are now undervalued. Nobody would see aapl trading at 4x earnings and not buy it. The stock market is not the economy."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm with you but every major event of the last 12+ months can be thought of as a national security risk and we haven't done much about it (30m Covid cases, 550k deaths, civil unrest, grid and infrastructure failures) and we (collectively) haven't really been able to get those rooted out"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thankfully the stock market isn‚Äôt the economy, so you‚Äôre right that over-leveraging should be looked at~ but ur also retarded~"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This type of economic intrusion is already happening, but it isnt something new. The US did it to the Americas with the Monroe doctrine, and now China is starting to take on that role. They are sending huge fishing fleets to central america under threat of calling back loans made to countries as part of their belt and road initiative. Right now China has a lot of countries under extreme economic pressure because they came with cheap loans to invest in infrastructure. I believe China is also the largest owner of America foreign debt. Debt is the largest market in the world and it's not even close to number 2. China and Russia are collaborating in refining an alternative to the SWIFT system which facilitates most international bank transactions and which the US closely monitors to enforce economic sanctions and track threats to their national security. They are also trying to replace the US dollar as their reserve currency. What OP is discussing is already under way. Another rename is Hawei and 5G. Look up Nortel networks and how the canadian government and the company basically allowed Hawei to become the front runner in the 5G race for no other reason than political miscalculations and poor managerial decisions. 

There are other examples, but I'm tired of typing. And I'm sorry for the lack of links but if you google any of what I wrote it's really easy to find legit sources. 

TLDR: Western economies have allowed China and other state actors to gain dominance in the economicand financial systems worldwide for a while now."

They wouldn‚Äôt be bounded by the ostensible psychological restraints of rationality hedge funds are subjected to.

Also, rogue governments are now well aware that since market makers apparently don‚Äôt hedge their calls, with enough capital they could force a gamma squeeze that takes out a number of hedge funds and then their prime brokers. Should the rogue government obtain good intelligence about the positions of over-leveraged or over-exposed funds, they might be able to place a clever domino. 

This is actually fucking ridiculous. Both enforcement and intelligence agencies should be figuring out how to anticipate this. If they don‚Äôt then I would reasonably expect an attempted financial attack of this sort within the decade."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good thoughts, thanks for sharing.  I've been dwelling upon this lately with the whole Suez canal headache we've been having... Given that all-out warfare between nuclear superpowers is extremely unlikely, we're surely going to be seeing more economic warfare like you suggest, and I worry that it will be extremely effective on the US.  I mean hell, Russia sat around in our government's computer networks for months before we realized, who's to say that can't worm into, say, the Fedwire and grind the market and the economy to a halt?  Seems to me that the US's international rivals would love to erode trust in the dollar to the point that it is no longer the world's reserve currency."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Large scale economic attacks don't really work, not for states. Every nation's economy is heavily connected to their neighbours as well as the global market. Someone like China crashing the US economy could end up hurting China more than the US. The global economy is so hard to predict, there's no telling what sort of fallout it could cause.

I think that ultimately, anyone who wields enough economic power to cause something like this, also has enough at risk so that it's not worth trying. It's a similar reason as to why no one goes to war with their neighbours any more (barring ideology, I guess)."

If the global stock markets could be manipulated it would be a powerful weapon, seeing how people have tried with varying degrees of success to manipulate the market for positive gains, I would suggest that a bad actor in this space would be equally challenged in trying to intentionally ""kill"" the markets. the system is too open, resilient and has so many inputs, variables it would make targeting effects very difficult, but not impossible. also there is always a cost. in a competition environment where cyber effects can achieve more precision, and at far less cost, would a weaponized hedge fund be worth it?

PRC still claims Soros was responsible for the Asian financial crisis. the 2007 financial crisis -which no one wanted, fucked over the entire world by an incalculable sum.

In this scenario, their play would be to knock down the US as an economic powerhouse to level the playing field. Yes, it would likely hurt them in the short term over the next several years, but in the long run it would give them the opportunity to surpass the US.

If you combine a market crash with our continuous money printing and inevitable devaluation of the US dollar it seems like everything could be playing right into their hands.

Not to get political here, but this is exactly why we absolutely cannot downplay the CCP as a threat to the US. Even more alarming is all the ties to the CCP by many of our politicians (on both sides) either directly or indirectly. Politicians can be bought off. They can be used as pawns each playing a small role.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The biggest issue China has with exerting military power abroad is that they're laughably behind the US militarily. Despite the posturing and media headlines that would have you think otherwise, China is still very much a regional power that can't exert force far outside it's territorial waters/neighbors. 

Their Navy is a coastal defense fleet, competent enough to patrol their waters but not at all capable of patrolling oceans like the US. Similarly their fighters and bombers are just bad copies of either US or Russian equipment from a generation ago. China is technologically 20-30 years behind the US, and honestly about a decade behind Russia in a lot of places as well."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I for one welcome our Chinese overlords.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Myanmar is a weird political situation.

My understanding is the military junta is actually anti-China (or at least thought the democratic government was still too cosy). However they were one of the communist nations that has recently come out supporting the military on its most recent parade day.

At the moment China doesn't seem to want to act hypocritical by calling for democracy, but Aung San Suu Kyi is the better choice for them in the short term.

I imagine as with everything they're sticking with long term goals of continuing infrastructure investment there and owning that when they default.

It isn't as simple as ""military junta good for China"" though.

China has favourable options with both nations that don't require military intervention.

From my understanding anyway (I know politics isn't allowed, but it does help to understand the realer risks/opportunities in investment out there)

I'd agree with your other points but there's a whole bunch of stuff in the way for China to realise it's long term ambitions for the throughput it's after for their population. 

Aging population and lack of immigration being a *huge* one."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets," Not to mention a looming demographics crisis where they are about to have a large percentage age out at once and not be replaced by similar numbers due to the short sightedness of the one child policy.

While the point could be made they're not a Blue Water navy...an aircraft carrier is an aircraft carrier. PLAN < USN, unquestionably, and yes, there is certainly interplay between my point and yours.

When considering air superiority, the F-35 says ""Hello.""  

Err...the J-20*. 

As for airframe reliably, the DO of ACC was quoted as saying something akin to fixes to the F-22 Raptor's oxygen problem are coming back in April of '20. That would be eight years after the problem was identified. They J-20 does indeed appear to suffer from a slew of it's own problems as well.

Every organization's most valuable resource is their people: 1.4B > 330M.  

While I'll concede they're behind the US militarily, they're potentially capable of accelerating more quickly. The US has long held supremacy and its senior-most leaders (SECDEF/4-stars) have been pushing an agenda of, to paraphrase, ""Get better/faster/stronger or lose the next fight,"" since the days of Gen James Mattis (ret).  

This approach seems wise. It injects humility into the most dominate military power. A military that has been preeminent for most living humans' entire lives. That being said, those leaders are saying what they're saying for a reason; I'd wager it's not just motivational. 

To see the story from the other side, I'd recommend ""Unrestricted Warfare."" Things get lost in translation but China has been watching hard for awhile."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The top purchasers of real estate in South and Central Florida are Chinese. This is straight info from the National Association of Realtors, released in an article my wife just received in their monthly magazine.

It has brought the market to a blazing standstill. If you have the money the Chinese do, you can outrace everyone, pay way too high of a price, afford to hold the property long-term even if empty.

The result is an extremely fast moving market for overpriced properties. But, paradoxically, an extremely shallow market for local residents who are pretty much excluded from the buying pool.

We have such limited inventory that prices have skyrocketed as foreign investors move in and cut off the locals.

Trying to buy a place right now is a fool's errand. They often sell before even seeing the MLS.

It is a bizarre situation with no upside I can see, other than for China gaining a serious foothold in local politics in Florida.

I have no doubt it is happening all over the country."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,sounds like the American strategy in Nazi territory circa 1945.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd like to think if shit ever really hit the fan, that the American economy could shift to building shit again, but we have pretty much entirely transformed to a service economy and it would be an arduous, expensive project to start making shit again. Only saving grace imo is that we won‚Äôt ever have to do this because nuclear weapons keep everyone from getting too far out of line. I really do struggle to envision a shift like we saw during WW2 in today‚Äôs time‚Äôs. But when you‚Äôre the biggest, baddest dog on the block, it‚Äôs easy for complacency to set it. This sort of discredits how much technology is in a F35 compared to a WW2 fighter, but the greater point still stands. We have outsourced so much production capacity that scaling up in a total war situation would be extremely painful and difficult. Hopefully we never have to find out."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The point is that China can't operate and support intercontinental military missions. It's not easy, and the US is only able to do it because we've been doing it for almost a century, and not always successfully. 

A good example of how difficult these kinds of missions are for major regional powers is to look at the Russian intervention in Syria. Their Navy barely made the trip from St. Petersburg to Syria, and once there they still managed to take casualties on a pure support mission against a technologically inept enemy, that wasn't being supported in a way to directly challenge them. And the Russian military has a lot more experience running these kinds of operations. 

Think about if China sent a military mission to an African nation and had to fight an enemy supported by the CIA; it would very quickly become an unmitigated disaster."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely right, although I doubt their ability to close the technology gap any time soon. Maybe it's just my experience as an engineer seeing how things are run over there, but they have a long, long way to go before they can match the US without stealing and trying to copy US designs like they did with the J-20"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have no idea of Chinas military capabilities and quite frankly they probably don‚Äôt have a clue either. Combined arms is hard shit and China has not been tested in real world situations like the US has for the better part of this century. They could be very good, or conversely very bad or even somewhere in between. Their technology and doctrine is unproven and we at least have some idea of how our shit works in a real world, combat environment. All the testing in the world goes out the window when the other guy actually shoots back. Doctrine is literally built in blood, and China doesn‚Äôt have much practice outside of putting down internal dissent."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The height of Chinese military capability is trying to steal US military capabilities. Not exactly a sign of strength, especially when you look at the actual equipment they produce, which struggles to compete with our last generation hard ware."

and that combined w some social factors like friends leaving and parents not getting why my performance went down (last time I vent to them lol) led to a real shitty time. but I found a great therapist and things got better brain wise and socially I was somewhat making moves and my job I was feeling better about and things were finally looking up, I have a journal entry in feb 2020 saying this like man I‚Äôm starting to feel stoked again. and then covid and everything just fucked it up. 

anyways tho after typing all that I‚Äôm like ok I‚Äôm back for the first time in 9 mo in my apartment and where I was living (and I guess still do live), I should hit my therapist up. I was gonna delete this word vomit but idk maybe someone else might see it and hit their therapist/a therapist up too or something. so thank you so much for your comment dude (I use dude as gender neutral and all so dudette if you prefer), I hope you see w this a nice gesture can go a long way"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,">someone with family in a 5G controlled enemy nation state could be leveraged to commit espionage

This I agree with, but this does not equate to a particular race. Many Americans of Chinese descent have no family overseas. Why not just say people with foreign citizenship, or people who grew up overseas, or people who have family overseas, are at higher risk. All that is fair. There's just no need to bring race into it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this sub ain‚Äôt the place for this but I‚Äôll agree It‚Äôs good to enjoy life. I‚Äôd like to share some unorthodox ideas I‚Äôve come across this last year that have helped me to enjoy life. I‚Äôm a retard. This is literally not financial advice. I apologize to WSB for filibustering. I have a TLDR at the end, peace.

Heidegger talks of this idea of ‚Äúthrowness‚Äù and not choosing birth. On the other hand, we are free to define ourselves because of this.

Nietzsche admired the Ancient Greek god Dionysus, since he was twice born and twice killed but lived passionately regardless. Nietzsche believed suffering and joy alike were meant to be embraced, that the thrill and passion of life held meaning above these. He claimed a human would rather will itself to nothingness than surrender his will entirely. Life only needed to be affirmed by the living for a single moment for the whole experience to be affirmed. He seemed to think we could just ‚Äúchoose to live‚Äù even if we don‚Äôt choose to be born. Some interpret Nietzsche to mean reality may ultimately be power (in an abstract, creative sense). Any experience we have empowers us and reality. Reality and our own existence is thereby endlessly empowering and generative in some way or another. We experience this power as energy, as our senses, as our abstract thoughts, and so on. ‚ÄòTis everywhere and is everything. The greatest humans love humanity and the world for this reason: it is mutually empowering.

In the films of Stanley Kubrick, he juxtaposes birth and death frequently. In between these bookends is life, which is erotically linked to sex. The abyss of nihilism is ultimately positive: a void for endless potentials, a womb. A being should engage with this void as a phallus does a vulva. A lesson from him I take is that we should expect suffering and joy alike, but ultimately they both empower us to live intimately and live more.

TLDR
Hell, read/watch/listen to any philosophical, artistic, theological work. I‚Äôd argue they all arrive at the intimate and powerful connection of the human experience to reality. It is unconditional. You only need to be conscious to enjoy that connection. Even long after you die you always will have been. What was once you becomes other things.

Hope you find some peace."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude same on so many levels. Graduated college in 2011 with a 3.9 GPA. Worked for multiple startups out of the gates, all of which had massive layoffs about a month after I started. The jobs I've had since then have either paid poorly or been incredibly exploitative.

My primary care doctor always says he thinks my generation and those after it are going to be remembered as the one that got the short end of the stick and expects more and more hopeless disillusioned kids with each passing year.
 
I was also just coming out of a crippling black hole when the pandemic hit, felt alive again for the first time in forever. I spend a lot of time wondering how damaging the past year will be on my mental health longterm. 

My only plan is to load up on as much GameStop stock as possible and cross my fingers it'll solve all my problems. Not advice, probably terrible ideaüòà"

So I prayed, and believe me, it helped.  Best to you, and never, never give up hope.  It's the last thing you can lose....."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure there is, but if you don't understand basic linear relationships you are not going to be able to understand most things.  You do realize that computers, algorithms, growth(markets, viruses, nuclear reactions, etc) all depend on mathematics?

If you can't do basic mathematics you are ignorant, it's that simple. You can down play it all day long but how the fuck do you know what you are missing if you can't comprehend it?

Mathematics has proven what it can do and there is absolutely no modern subject matter that doesn't use mathematics in some form or fashion. Logic, that is mathematics(mathematics is logic)... but you will say learning logic is not relevant.

It's morons like you that think allowing some politician lead humanity is a great thing even if all they can do is talk. Why? Because you can relate to them. Literally the whole reason humanity is in the mess it is is because the masses are idiots who vote for people like them since they cannot relate to actual intelligent people. They feel inferior because they can't do basic intellectual things. 

You are literally saying that it's ok for a politician not to actually be able to extrapolate data they get in reports because mathematics is ""not all there is in the world"". Trump, is that you? YOU GOT THE DAMN CHART UPSIDE DOWN!

Stop trying to project and justify your own ignorance."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well yeah we still build a lot of stuff here and there is still some tremendous innovation but we won‚Äôt ever see something like the entire city of Detroit building tanks and Jeep‚Äôs for the war effort instead of cars for the domestic audience. I also worry that we as a society are for lack of a better word, too soft to make the sacrifices needed to have this gigantic shift. I mean how many of the electronics that make our lives so easy and we take for granted are made cheap as fuck overseas? What happens when those have to be made locally and costs oodles more? Can the American public really deal with something like that? I mean we all saw how wonderfully we dealt with this pandemic... gives me lot of hope for our government in crisis.... Luckily though, I think it‚Äôs a moot point as the world is too interconnected for anyone to ever really win a global war. Not to mention we now have the ability to end humanity as we know it and I don‚Äôt see how large scale conflict between great powers doesn‚Äôt end up going nuclear. We‚Äôre simply too good at killing each other now to make war really worth it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Our defense spending is about 3.5% of our GDP. During the height of the Cold War it was as high as 12% so while the numbers are still massive, we have cut military spending significantly without the Soviet boogeyman to justify the expenditure."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know everyone loves to shit on the Iraq war and rightfully so for many reasons, but the initial invasion in 03 was some seriously incredible stuff. We had the logistical capabilities to feed and maintain an invasion force half way across the world and then ransack a country of over 30 million in less than a month. Yes, the occupation was a debacle, but the actual invasion was damn impressive and I feel pretty confident in saying there isn‚Äôt another nation on earth who could have done that."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a guess but maybe they mean Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan but yeah that‚Äôs not China
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is fair. OP used China as an example and it just went down that path. Considering the trifecta to accomplish removing USD would be a strong self sufficient China, India, and Russia all 3 would have considerable risks. Think Coyote with Mexican refugees/immigrants.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a follow up, if you have some kind of ambition to change the world for the betterment of humanity and yourself, that‚Äôs awesome. Just don‚Äôt cause your own suffering.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cranky, that‚Äôs deep. I know the Nazi‚Äôs loved Nietzsche, which probably ruined him as a philosopher to take seriously forevermore. However, the phallus/vulva point of view deserves a deep dive..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think Nietzsche ends up doing an incredible job of describing the Paschal Mystery. The idea that a will IS power and is alive, and that our wills collectively interact and nourish each other. 

The will of a tyrant (""I will be above all others"") provides us a choice: submit (""I will be beneath you""), rebel (""I will overthrow you""), or - the most preferred option - do some dialectics and arrive at ""I am equal to you, and so one day you will acknowledge this.""

In this way, our suffering is always frameable as opportunity, to help others and the self. Then the last step is letting go of the distinction of self and you're all set to transcend to the astral plane or sea of tranquility or whatever"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The thing is, if we stop having kids and families, there really will be no stopping the ego from devouring everything.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is it you make all these assumptions about me or politicians?  My undergrad was computer science.  Graduate work in atmospheric science and social sciences. Yes, I had to take calc, linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, etc.  And even in that field we rarely have to actually solve those problems by hand. The computer did it, so long as you can spot check. But too many people with a CS degree seem to think they can do everyone else's job better than them.

Most people can learn to program if they put effort into it. Plenty can learn to solve calc problems if taught properly.  But the world needs more skillsets than just CS and mathematics.

I work in research.  I work with lots of brilliant people.  But many of them do not have the social skills required to be a politician, nor to relate important knowledge to the world.  But many aren't interested in that and are content working in their research fields.

But this arrogance that if you have a political science degree instead of a CS degree you are somehow incompetent is silly. It always irritated me."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah those are good points. Hoepfully it's true about not annihilating each other. But hoepfully that doesnt mean too much compromise.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I said Chinese, as in the nation state, which encompasses a large number of people of a multitude of ethnicities and races. You're the one who brought race into it. Also, ""commonly known"" means that people are aware of the issue rather than that it is the majority of a particular group. Its a common enough occurrence to be a problem and something to be aware of, but that does not mean that every Asian person is a spy. You jumping to that was a result of your own biases and assumptions of China being a homogeneous whole coloring your perceptions."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You're absolutely right. They'll change over time and there's a solid chance that launch providers will end up in here sooner or later.

2021-03-29 22:40:54,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock selling off $PENN Hear me out... a couple others have mentioned that it may have actually been Blackrock that liquidated shares on Friday. Given the size of the sell offs, some are saying that it only makes sense that it must have been a fund the size of Blackrock or Vanguard.

Blackrock and Vanguard also happen to be the two largest holders of shitco $PENN (Blackrock owns 12.5% while Vanguard holds 9%). Now I believe that this stock was ponzi scheme from the beginning, given that it ran up 1500% based on no fundamentals and a significant loss in income.

I just wanted to point this out because FUCK Dave Portnoy. He has been all over Twitter tryna convince his followers to buy the dip on shitty $PENN stock while insiders have been dumping it like their life depends on it. AVOID THIS STOCK LIKE THE PLAGUE.

Now I'm not quite sure what Blackrock dumping shitco $PENN has on the broader market but it would be interesting to see if there were other companies that are largely held by Blackrock/Vanguard that are being dumped right now.

Edit: For those of you that are stupid enough to still be buying into this garbage - look at the recent insider transactions. They're dumping all their shares to all you retards that think Portnoy is on your side.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Blackrock holds a ton of rkt
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,There is no reason to fuck Dave Portnoy he is saving business around the country. Barstool is bigger than you think. NY NJ and TX have not been touched by its app yet. I‚Äôm long 80k Penn @125
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock and Vanguard are not active manager, they are passive (for most part) and just the nature of business requires them to buy or sell as per the benchmark they are following.

When prices fall, so does the weight of security in their benchmark and hence they have to readjust. They dont have any nefarious plans behind the selling and their trading is completely automated, so this conspiracy is poo poo on a stick."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly Dave Portnoy is a wanker but you implying PENN is a shitter and your support for it is retarded

Edit: looking at your post history, did Dave Portnoy trigger you or some shit lmfao."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"PENN today: $98.21.  
PENN 1 year ago: $11.66

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question though, I see penn going way up as they operate in more states. What am I missing?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I would say any stock Dave Portnoy sells after a $700k loss is worth buying into

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is no conspiracy. As someone else pointed out, it is likely that Blackrock already dumped their shares of $PENN last week. The only conspiracy here is that $PENN managed to make it to the S&P500"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao did you even read my support or have you even bothered looking at their financials? You‚Äôre an absolute clown if you think this stock is fairly valued
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao I find it hilarious how many people are still bullish on PENN. I hope they post their loss porn
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but they‚Äôre huge holdings and property all over the country. Small markets elsewhere and the mobile app seems to be doing very well
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm long on penn for the mobile gaming
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This discount, yes. Yes discount them are sell, we buy up go back yes discount us them sell."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm long on penn. they are top 3 in each state and spend a fraction of marketing as draft kings because barstool is becoming a top 5-10 publisher in us (above discover channel)

Avg cost is low 80s right now I‚Äôm considering averaging up before casinos open up and sports gambling blows up. Can‚Äôt say how high it will go but it will be higher than now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is their net down because the purchase of a large portion of barstool is added into that calculation?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Got you homeboy

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope its green as well. But with market manipulation. I dont trust wallstreet.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did both. Congrats on comparing an EPS of -5 mostly occurring in Q1 2020 with Q3 and Q4 actually turning positive genius. There‚Äôs also other indicators besides EPS, genius.

Look at this entire market. All this shit is (and has been) over valued. I actually do hope and have been hoping all this shit continues to dip. I just think solely focusing on an extreme outlier per your EPS argument is idiotic and you‚Äôre just horned up for Davey"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah . I thought so too . I‚Äôve  not into draft kings specifically .. yet . Any insights ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"ü¶ç at 245 , subjectiveness right"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,idk... someone may need a Capitol...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Right so he‚Äôs watching his net worth tumble and instructing his followers to prop up the stock
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You should try learn a thing or two about valuation metrics
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"And, you know the pandemic keeping people out of their casinos"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just casinos closing and they were later to market than draft kings. They‚Äôre catching up quick though and barstool does add additional revenue opportunities
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i wish this sub was under a milly people again
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL the funny thing is I didn‚Äôt even focus on EPS, that was someone else‚Äôs comment. How about you tell me, which indicators suggest it is NOT overvalued? Cause it is literally overvalued by every single metric. Now combine that with the sheer amount of insider selling. Anyway I hope you‚Äôre only arguing cause you‚Äôre long on the stock, in which case please post your loss porn in a few months"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Sup
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blackrock is the biggest whale in GME, and shittadel sqrewed them over in a Tesla position a few years back. (look in to it) and now blackrock owns 13-18mill shares in GME.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Additions to an ETF? When did I once even mention an ETF. Looking at your comment history you clearly just get off tryna play the devils advocate on people‚Äôs posts to sound like you‚Äôre smart but you‚Äôre actually a complete idiot hahaha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúOverall market too uncertain‚Äù. There‚Äôs still good plays out there. Tbh sounds like you‚Äôre the one that‚Äôs uncertain, despite ironically how certain you try to come off üòÇ"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's all good. Not trying to bust your balls. Blackrock is likely the primary whale backing GME and they have a history with Ryan Cohen (backed him and Chewy). If Blackrock was unloading any blocks, it's to fund their war against the shorts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,9 million shares or so long I believe. Also their position has increased. Also...Blackrock was an original funder of RC/Chewy....

2021-03-29 22:38:39,wallstreetbets,"ARKX Holdings Early Thoughts üöÄüõ∞üõ∏ ARKX Launches on March 30th, 2021 and the first 39 holdings have been unveiled today (Monday 29th).

At first glance many investors will be surprised and maybe even disappointed not to see more Pure Space companies. Let‚Äôs do some digging. 

From their [website:](https://ark-funds.com/arkx)

*Why invest in ARKX*

*Exposure to space exploration, including orbital and sub-orbital aerospace, enabling technologies, and beneficiaries of aerospace activities, such as agriculture, Internet access, global positioning system (GPS), construction, and imaging.*

*The Adviser defines ‚ÄúSpace Exploration‚Äù as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.*

**why big caps?** such as Amazon, Baba, Google and even Netflix? while one could argue that being big tech companies they would benefit from increased business activity due to a wider broadband coverage through future space constellations (such as Starlink or Space Mobile) it seems that these holdings could actually serve as ‚Äúcash-like‚Äù for a potential future rotation into long-duration space companies. 

Cathie Wood has explained this process in a video that they sometimes treat FAANGS as cash-like instruments as they are less volatile (per the sub rules I can not link the video so you will have to search the keywords). 

The presence of US dollar as holding #26 could also be consistent with this idea (keeping cash and liquid lower beta stocks to deploy later when opportunities arise). 

Note also that Amazon and Baba would profit from an increased use of air drones for last mile delivery (which falls into one of the 4 themes of ARKX specifically Aerospace Beneficiary Companies).

**39 holdings so far but aims for 40 to 55**: that‚Äôs actually the first thing I‚Äôve noticed. In the Fund Details they write that the typical # of holdings will be 40 to 55. So up to 17 more names could be added assuming USD could be liquidated at some point. 

**only 2 special pur-pose acqui-sition so far** namely Arch-er and Jo-by which are both very forward-looking air drones companies **and** trading very near their redemption price of $10. This last point seems to me to be the reason why only 2 specials are included so far. Companies like Momen-tus, Space Phones, Black Sky, üöÄ Lab, Astra, Spi-re, could still be in at some point whether before or after their respective business combinations. I believe the safety net of near NAV trading was prioritized given the current increased volatility and risks on growth names (moreover on space tech). 

**their own 3D Printing ETF** as holding #2. I guess why making it complicated when you can make it simple. ARK said 3D printing is one of the highest growth potential industries in the economy and is set to transform the manufacturing landscape. And it‚Äôs absolutely needed for space tech whether it‚Äôs printed on earth or beyond. Instead of going for individual names they went for their own ETF. Kind of smart and self-glorifying at the same time. 

**actual revenue vs future projections**: as value stocks and reopening trade control the narrative right now I also notice that their 36 top holdings (excluding USD) have current revenue and financial stability as opposed to negative FCF for the next few years to come (last 2 holdings). Again a sign of lowered risks taken given the current equities market. 

**TLDR**: while initially underwhelming ARKX composition could very well be increased and even reshuffled as market conditions normalize (and/or market crash). Doesn‚Äôt look like very spacey nor ultra innovative right now but it feels like Cathie Wood hasn‚Äôt shown her hand yet. 

Not a recommendation to buy, hold nor sell any securities. üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ because it‚Äôs space + WSB."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,how is the starting price set up for etf ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Boeing is disappointing to see here. The corporate focus is value extraction. They actively suppress innovation because R&D money doesn't impress shareholders who want high dividends now not great things later. Just my opinion.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What time are they releasing tmrw?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks to the OP for writing this up.  Also, thanks to everyone else in the comments.  I have some ARKQ and ARKF.  I was curious what all would be in ARKX and what people‚Äôs reactions would be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ark has a 0.75% expense ratio. Why would I ever invest in them when I could just buy their holdings and save .75% per year?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Arkx not up on rh?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i was holding funds for this all month so i got in at 250 on my main account and 18 on an off that may go up to 250 depending on how im feeling about GME and AMC.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in rocket for 100 since Jan. It was heavily shorted. But it's cheap and it pays dividends and is undervalued some. I like it and have. I just don't want GME gang getting in on it. They stress me the fuck out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I would say this is bullish. A fund had to liquidate 20m shares yet the price ended flat, means there's plenty of big money buyers at this price. Compare what happened to Viacom's stock and Discovery's stock when they had to liquidate. 

Full disclosure, I'm not a professional and I do have a relatively large position in RKT."

I like the stock"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's irrelevant except in the sense that short interest is holding down the value of RKT from where it should be.

If you look at any price target, any metric released about RKT, you'll see it's over sold and undervalued. If you're hoping for a squeeze maybe, but probably not. That said, if they wanna fuck with the shorts, now sounds like a good time to start buying back shares as was indicated earlier in the month. With a big hedge fund getting slapped with a margin call dragging down the market, buying back shares could put the hurt on other large shorts and the combination of their longs dropping and shorts climbing could get more margin calls going accelerating the effect."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fintel showed a decrease of 500k shares to short from morning to midday. From 3.1 to 2.6 available.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If anything the UWMC bs was a distraction from us taking this rocket off in the first place.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what happens when you put blinders on. I'm riding the long haul and really hoping this one doesn't get meme raped
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would say that's generally very bullish. 20m shares was absorbed liked nothing. It means Institutions have a hard on for the stock. 

Compared what happened to RKT to what happened to VIAC and DISCA, those two got annihilated. RKT ended pretty flat.   

I will warn you I have YOLOed into RKT with 25k shares and a bunch of calls so take that how you will."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were selling a block (or blocks idk) of RKT in the process of liquidating their positions and if all the blocks are already sold, then there's less selling pressure on the stock and a greater chance the price would increase.  This is not financial advice, just a commonly made speculation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was in on RKT on day one and got out next day, 29 in 33 out, sadly ""waited for the first 30 minutes of the day volatility to be over"". What's the deal with RKT blowing up to 26 the other day?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this happens more than we want to give credit to. Fomo is a huge money maker for them no doubt. I don't necessarily think that was the case this morning though.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,hahahahaha this shall be my most favorite reply today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It doesn't pay dividends. It payed a single one time special dividend.

Thanks! I also just realized another redditor asked same question earlier today. Thank you for your time! :)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. 20M shares of RKT were eaten up so fast by someone who speculates that RKT will be valued as a fintech rather than mortgage firm. Thanks for responding!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i hope. i have april 16 25c that i've been sitting on since it shot up to $42 back in february. i'd like to say i didn't get left bag holding.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt. I think they dumped blocks and said we're done before the initial sale even got reported.

This was the first indication it was happening."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. The buyback is basically a guarantee it won‚Äôt go below IPO price and nothing more. They don‚Äôt need to use the buyback of it stays where it is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too... a lot of them.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm still learning, but what scenario does it not get exercised, with it being so far ITM?  Like I could see them getting traded around a bunch, but at the end of the day won‚Äôt someone own them and be faced with the decision to lose a bunch, or exercise and lose far less?  Genuinely curious how calls with so much intrinsic value wouldn‚Äôt get exercised."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At current prices, yes. It's a massively successful company with solid fundamentals. The stock price has been suppressed by shorts for months, but this won't last forever as more investors realize its value. RKT's CEO has also publicly addressed short sellers and will continue to make moves so the shorts can fuck off. Earlier this month they issued a one time special divvy (which the shorts had to pay for) and RKT also has a $1B stock buyback ready to go. Worst case scenario is it keeps trading sideways in the 20 to 25 range."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs what WSB is all about, my friend. If DFV posted his GME DD in r/investing then it would still probably be $15. WSB is a different breed of apes."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling a 20M block can be just as much a bearish flag as it can be a bullish one, especially depending on the seller. 








The fact it was absorbed doesn't necessarily mean it's good. It could just mean the toxicity of the asset is not well seen. This happened a lot right before the 2008 crash, firms selling very toxic assets in huge blocks to people who thought they were absorbing a healthy asset








Ultimately you have to know the reason they wanted this asset gone. Typically a firm isn't dumping a stock that everyone else has a hard on for. There's a plethora of reasons they could be dumping it."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not only that the block was sold at above market, at 25.25 according to another thread here."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So that is different that when fuckery is at hand
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre saying this isn‚Äôt as bullish as the comments are suggesting
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,my momma never learnt me
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whoa, whoa! You hackin' my account because it sure sounds like it? What's the password?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The shares will get called away upon expiration if in the money unless he buys to close the short calls. There isn't a scenario where he keeps his shares plus the initial premium unless the share price tanks out of the money. 


And RKT isn't going to tank to $12.89 by April 1 unless we see a market wide crash."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Essentially, whoever bought those $12.89 calls with a premium of $12.83 is paying roughly $25.72 per share if they choose to exercise. So it wouldn't be worth to exercise the call option because whoever bought it would still be under unless it reaches $25.72 I am assuming this is a way to reduce risk and losses. You pay a heavier premium but reduce the downside if you're not above the $25.72 per share price. On the chance that it does raise above that target the rewards are still minimal because of high pricing. On the chance that OP does get assigned, he still wins because his cost basis is lower then what he would receive for the price per share and the premium combined so he would net the 2K+ in pure profit. 

Low risk and low reward for the buyer. 

&#x200B;

That's how I am perceiving it at least. Hope that helps ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|feels_good_man)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,yea its same one.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They supposedly get a lot of information before everyone else, a lot of times you'll see articles there with typos in words because they churn out first hand information fast and don't proof edit.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No because rocket mortgage doesn't do commercial loans
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw it being pushed by MSM and that was a warning sign.  Just like they said Reddit was going after Viacom and Discovery.  

What did I miss?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,First start with 10m
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Counter to what others may assume, I was actually born poor, immigrated to the US my family after the Vietnam war. Served in the military to pay for college. Not that it matters, I just generally think the whole circle jerk of assuming everyone who has money is some asshole is not healthy.

As for the reason why I YOLOed, I guess it boiled down to 3.

1. The company has a history of ethical behavior. During the 2008 crisis, they DID NOT engage in subprime lending. When it came down to it, they chose to be ethical instead of being Profitable. [You can see that in this interview with the founder.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=560s)

On top of that, they have an astronomical NPS score relative to the competition. That's the customer satisfaction score. It's like 74 vs 16. [You can see that in this analysis.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1uQ6ltMaq8&t=450s)

What that tells me is that in a continued bull market, they should grow market share as word spreads about their ethical behavior and how well they treat their customers. BUT, in a bear market, when things go to shit, I also know that they probably did not engage in whatever risky behavior that fucked other firms. They're more likely to come out ahead (like they did during the 2008 crisis).

2. They're fundamentally mis-priced (I believe). They're priced as a mortgage company when they are really a fintech. Some people debate this of course, that the whole crux of the Bear/Bull fight. But what convinced me is that the founder Dan Gilbert and the CEO Jay Farner seem to understand technology and embrace change and innovation. You can see that here in these interviews.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j\_KPc1ZefOg&t=30s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_KPc1ZefOg&t=30s)

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=1002s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=1002s)

What this tells me (if I'm correct) is that the price will rise in the future as the market begins to price it as a fintech.

3. The price is (I believe) being artificially suppressed. You can see that in my DD about RKT here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big\_catalyst\_tomorrow\_for\_rkt/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/maubsk/big_catalyst_tomorrow_for_rkt/)

If I'm correct, that tells me the fair value is somewhere higher. Actually, what happened today also confirmed that since 20m shares were bought up like crack at $25.25 to $26.25. [You can find a discussion about that here.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mfvovp/what_morgan_stanleys_offering_of_rkt_20m_share/)

The fundamentals are great too, they're making gobs of money.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmcjbw/simple\_short\_and\_sweet\_smooth\_brain\_dd\_for\_why/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/lmcjbw/simple_short_and_sweet_smooth_brain_dd_for_why/)

In fact, RKT did NOT go public for the money, they went public to attract talent to rebuild Detroit and build the next Amazon.[Here's an article from when they first went Public.](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/2020/08/05/rocket-companies-quicken-loans-ipo/3298571001/)

>While Quicken's coffers do¬†not necessarily need the capital from an IPO, Gordon said,¬†**going public could be a valuable recruiting opportunity¬†for the company competing for young talent in technology and software development. Gordon has had students recruited for positions in Detroit only to be wooed by other firms with offers that include stock options with the potential to grow over time.**  
>  
>**""That‚Äôs a lot easier to do when you‚Äôre a public company,"" he said. ""If anything, it might help Detroit become a little more techy and more attractive to tech people and¬†software people.""**

Not an expert, not financial advice, those are just my thoughts, good luck to you.

Edit: Also u/TreeImmediate added below why the P/E ratio is not accurate for RKT. Worth a read if you're interested. He pegs the fair value even as just a mortgage company at $50."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Saw a üöÄ emoji
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guess is they sold off that many, and then people found and they confirmed they were done."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good catch
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehh, could be delays from different news agencies, maybe they found a buyer for RKT  before other offerings and hadn‚Äôt announced it, Bloomberg isn‚Äôt the same as the mainstream news services like CNBC, they‚Äôre more reliable. There‚Äôs a reason people pay 20k a year for the terminal(other reasons also of course)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Given the timing, it's MOST LIKELY due to that hedge fund going bust. Given the history of RKT, especially given that they came out of the 2008 crisis on top because they DID NOT engage in sub-prime lending while everyone else was tells me that MOST LIKELY their stock is not toxic. 

You can see that in this interview: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=560s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=moGO6tsqh5w&t=560s)

But you're right, we don't really know. 

Not a Pro, not financial advice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have no idea, maybe because the market doesn't really know what to make of what happened yet. There still seems to be an uneasiness about other funds going bust and a chain reaction? That's my guess, not a pro by any means."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Picture some retard Redditor getting 5X leverage by just tricking system into giving him more margin than he‚Äôs allowed and then that retard buying a shit load of OTM Tech calls right before a crash.   

Now picture he owns a shit load of other random stock 

He would lose all his money including the other stuff he owns cause he has to pay for it. 

However since he‚Äôs being forced to liquidate all his positions to cover all his losses the major players want to get their allotted shares before it happens to all the positions they were all in.  


I mean I think that‚Äôs kinda what happened"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah but unlike CS and Nomura, MS has had a stellar year and is considerably more complex institution. So a loss for them here might end up being immaterial to the bottom lime overall. We also don't know how much business GS and MS did with Archegos compared with the others.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Exit strategies are necessary for options
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, whether or not Dan Gilbert is the one that bought back the stock is just speculation.  They did recently authorize a $1 Billion buyback before all of this. 

I was just explaining why they might have authorized the buyback in the first place. 

It would still be bullish if they were the ones that bought it back since 1. That means they think the price is cheap and 2. they definitely won't be lending out those shares to shorters. 

But in a way, you would be right because them buying it back themselves wouldn't be AS bullish as institutions gobbling it up. We'll never know which situation it was I guess. Or maybe we will tomorrow who knows."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol same here. Any stock I buy drops when I purchase and anything I sell shoots up. I need to wash this mushhh off of me.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha! I did that just last week. True story.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok.  I thought something was up about his comment.  Since the calls he sold were like 99% intrinsic value, basically anything over 25.72 is a loss for OP because he‚Äôs missing out on gains right?  It seems like just selling all his shares at 25.72 is effectively the same as selling the deep ITM calls."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm saying it‚Äôs more worth it to exercise than it is to let it expire worthless, especially if you already paid 1/2 the share price in premium.  So maybe the option buyer can trade it to cut losses, but in the end isn‚Äôt someone buying and exercising it?

Also where is the 2k number coming from?  Is that under the assumption that it finishes the week where it is currently priced?  The premium was 99% intrinsic value, so wouldn‚Äôt any EOW price over $25.72 be a loss for OP?  Meaning he would have been better off not selling a call because he missed out on gains?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Just looked it up. I don't think it's available in Canada.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I ended up with 1k shares of RKT from some puts I wrote.  I have written some weekly calls against half over the last month,  but I totally agree with your thesis, and am holding them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> The company has a history of ethical behavior. During the 2008 crisis, they DID NOT engage in subprime lending. When it came down to it, they chose to be ethical instead of being Profitable. You can see that in this interview with the founder.

Wow. I knew everything else, but not this. You should probably add the fact that almost every source out there has listed RKT with an incorrect P/E Ratio of over 13x. It's actually way more underpriced than people realize. The reason why is brokers are using the GAAP Diluted EPS to calculate the P/E Ratio. But if you take a look at the [earnings transcript](https://s25.q4cdn.com/509921419/files/doc_financials/2020/q4/Q4-2020-Earnings-Release-v-final-web.pdf), you'll see that the GAAP Diluted EPS actually misses all of Q1, Q2 and a month of Q3.
 
>""GAAP"" stands for Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the U.S. On August 6, 2020, Rocket Companies' stock began trading on the NYSE and it did not have any shares outstanding or calculations of earnings per share for any periods prior to this date. Under GAAP, the basic and diluted earnings per share calculations for the three and twelve months ended December31, 2020, include only the period from August 6, 2020 to December 31, 2020.

Comparison between incorrect and correct P/E calculations:

Share price (24) / Gaap Diluted EPS (1.76) = 13.636x P/E Ratio (incorrect)

Share Price (24) / Adjusted Diluted EPS (4.11) = 5.839x P/E Ratio (correct)

So yeah, RKT fair value is over $50 per share even if it were to be priced as a mortgage company. US Mortgage Industry average is 13.7x P/E ratio. Edit: And FYI, it does happen to be America's *largest* mortgage lender. It's not a question of whether RKT will go up, but *when* will it go up? Patience will be rewarded."

The only practical reason to sell a deep ITM covered call is if you think there is a high probability of the underlying tanking which would protect you from some downside. Ideally you want to be profiting off of theta/extrinsic value of an option, which as you know deep ITM calls have little to no extrinsic value.


And yep it really hurts if you are holding an ITM call you sold and the underlying moons, that profit goes straight to the counter party, the option buyer."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's a pretty superficial understanding of the financial crisis and society's problems.

Per the wikipedia:  

>Government policies that encouraged home ownership, providing easier access to loans for subprime borrowers; overvaluation of bundled subprime mortgages based on the theory that housing prices would continue to escalate; questionable trading practices on behalf of both buyers and sellers; compensation structures by banks and mortgage originators that prioritize short-term deal flow over long-term value creation; and a lack of adequate capital holdings from banks and insurance companies to back the financial commitments they were making. 

So encourage home ownership, that's great, but without proper regulation that leads to sub-prime lending. That has nothing to do with the rich since they are obviously not the recipients of sub prime loans. 

Did people make huge sums of money from it? Sure. Is wealth inequality a problem? Of course. But just blatantly blaming the rich misses the underlying problem and that is the fundamentals of the American economy has changed. We are no longer a manufacturing economy. The government has not kept up and the public education system has not kept up. Politicians are too scared to tax and too scared to stop spending so they run up the debt and kick the can down the road. There are rich people who don't mind being taxed more but that tax money has to go to good use. Running around screaming eat the rich doesn't solve anything. And frankly, we're running out of time for such simplistic immaturity and stupidity. I wish the world was so simple, but it's not.

What's my point? We're all in this together, rich, poor, black, white, asian, latino, male, female, whatever. We're all in this together."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been itching to watch the big short again for weeks. can't put it off any longer
2021-03-29 22:12:11,wallstreetbets,"What Morgan Stanley's offering of RKT 20m share block at $25.25 means MS is liquidating stocks to recover capital, including a 20m share block of RKT. Instead of selling on the open market like what the other banks did for VIAC and chinese stocks, MS knows if they do this for RKT they will decimate RKT's stock price because this is like 15% of the float, so they are selling it as a block trade. Usually they would price this below market value, because they want to recover capital quickly, especially on a volatile stock like RKT. Just like when you buyout a stock you offer a premium, when you sell a large block you generally offer below market value.

However, they are offering at a 5% premium to the market price at the time of offering. This means two important things:

1. MS thinks fair value of RKT is above $25.25. They know the short interest is high and the stock value is artificially depressed.
2. If someone buys it, they can orchestrate a giant short squeeze and send their share value flying. Short interest for RKT has been rising and was above GME end of last week. Normally if you try to force the short squeeze through market buying then the price would shoot up before you can accumulate a good amount of stock and you don't gain much value, but if they get a large block through private exchange then they can benefit a LOT from doing a short squeeze.

Another possible outcome is that shorts will exit through buying in this block trade - which would mean that short interest will be gone and the price can go to its fair value (above $25.25)

Something big is brewing with RKT and be ready for it to explode.

Edit: apparently the shares are already sold out now

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like your logic but you‚Äôre missing one key thing that could throw this all off. They may have had other incentives to offer that price for the block trade. i.e. we‚Äôll give you a discount on this trade if you let us borrow shares xyz at a lower rate or sell us some other shares at a lower price, or even hookers and blow.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"this offering was probably done for shorts. 

Short interest reduced by about 18 million shares per [shortsqueeze.com](https://shortsqueeze.com)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"First off, thank you for the time you put into your learning and answering. I always recall the Picasso drawing analogy in the situations in which someone spent years learning a skill to be able to produce answers quickly. So thank you for your explanation. 

If I'm understanding you correctly: Even in a special circumstance like this one, RKT wouldn't legally be able to purchase the block in its entirety, which means they probably didn't get any of it. The entire block going at once to one buyer seems to be what was reported. 

That would indicate some other institution has purchased it (~$505M). I figured RKT might simply to try and keep this out of the hands of the HF's (who might not buy it because its above the average but I don't know if this would be a valid way to hedge 20M shares to neutralize their short positions). What I'm hearing you say is that it wasn't likely an available option for them?

Thanks again!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because the market price doesn‚Äôt stay flat when you start making huge purchases

**THIS IS A CHEAPER WAY TO COVER SHORTS THAN BUYING AT MARKET**

Why? Because if you buy 1,000,000 shares at $24, the price becomes $25. If you buy 1,000,000 shares at $25, the price is $27. You buy 1,000,000 more shares, it's now $31. You start running out of sell orders between $24 and $35.

Now buy all from this block at $25, what happens to the price? Still <$25, you've covered lots of your $26-40 shorts for profit."

2021-03-29 21:41:06,wallstreetbets,"Biocryst ($BCRX) continues to remain undervalued First off, I am not giving you advice. I'm not a financial advisor, nor do I work in the pharma industry. I'm just sharing some research I did, and I'm open to all feedback and comments. Additionally (in full disclosure) based on what I found, I'm holding 450 shares because I'm still afraid of options.

Lets start off with some TLDR for the bullish thoughts and bearish thoughts.

Bullish points:

Based on fairly conservative COGS I have a share target of $19, but if that turns out to be overly conservative a more realistic value could easily push the share target to $24-$30. These values also assume fairly conservative adoption among the patient pool. The recent injection of liquidity also gives them plenty of runway to start cashing in on a fully approved drug (Orladeyo). Additionally none of this accounts for their developmental drug (BCX9930) at all which [has been racking up some big wins in clinical trials fairly recently](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) and could push this to another level entirely. Considering that their Orladeyo drug on its own would support nearly double the current share price this makes a 10$ entry point fairly attractive with a potential bonus moonshot if BCX9930 takes off.

Bearish points:

Despite being approved, the rate of adoption of Orladeyo could take years to secure my estimated market share (I cant find any data to help estimate adoption rates). Drug trials can be a shot in the dark, and while currently there is no bad news regarding their up and coming drug BCX9930, a bad result would certainly draw enough negative sentiment to tank the price, despite Orladeyo easily supporting a share price of 19$ on its own. Additionally BCX9930 will need to complete trials for all of the numerous diseases they plan to market it for. Those trials will cost time and money and drag out for years. Lastly drug prices are in the focus of media pressure in the US which could likely have a negative impact on the pharma industry as a whole.

Now for the details. I'm going to talk through Liquidity, Revenue estimates, Cost estimates, and eventually arrive at my price target estimates. Lastly I'll speculate on some risks.

* Liquidity: In the 3rd quarter, they lost around 45M and had around 150M cash.¬† In Dec., they secured an additional 325M in liquidity (200M as a line of credit, and 125M as a 1-time gain which results in them paying a royalty on Orladeyo).¬† They have plenty of liquidity.¬†¬†
* Revenue:¬† they have 2 drugs that I consider material.¬† Orladeyo which was approved in US¬†and¬†Japan, and is about to be approved in Europe.¬† BCX9930 which is far from approval in all¬†but 1 disease in the US.¬†¬†  

   * Orladeyo is the only oral treatment for a¬†rare disease known as HAE.¬†¬†
   * Orladeyo will likely be sold for around 300000 per patient per year.¬† Biocryst set a price for sales in US of 485000, and will likely be sold for less in Europe, but I figure it averages 300000.¬† This price might sound obscene but is actually cheaper then its competition¬†Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda, which cost over 500000 per year.¬†¬†
   * Orladeyo was actually only 30-44% effective in reducing HAE attacks,¬†whereas Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda are both around 80% effective.¬† However, Orladeyo is the only oral medication while Takhzyro¬†and Haegarda both require injections.¬† The keys to Orledeyo are that it is a much more convenient and less invasive treatment, and despite its seemingly low effectiveness, it turns out that 50% of patients¬†had a 70% reduction in attacks (while the other 50% probably saw little or no benefit, averaging to 30-44%).¬†¬†
   * Also, in Biocryst's 3rd quarter conference call, management discussed a¬†survey that they¬†conducted, and found that about half of patients receiving injection treatments would consider switching to Orladeyo.¬† Since Orladeyo is effective in half of patients, and half of patients would consider switching, I conclude that Orladeyo could likely secure roughly a 25% market share
   * There are 7500 patients in US¬†and 6500 in Europe.¬† If I conservatively assume 20% market share, their revenue would be .2\*14000\*300000=840M.¬† FYI, their guidance is ""north of 500M"".¬†¬†
   * For sales in Japan, Biocryst made a deal with a pharma company called Torii.¬† Torii will sell Orladeyo in Japan and pay a royalty to Biocryst of between 20-40%, which will amount to around 15M in royalty revenue for Biocryst.¬†¬†
* Costs  

   * After looking at various income statements, it looks like cost-of-goods-sold is generally 15-33% in the pharma¬†industry.¬† I'll conservatively assume 33% for Orladeyo.¬† Gross profit is 840M\*.67 + 15M royalties=575M
   * In the [4th quarter](https://ir.biocryst.com/node/22286/pdf) they¬†had 605000 in product sales (100000 was Orladeyo).¬† COGS was¬†only¬†33000.¬† It's unclear how much of this COGS is attributable to Orladeyo or how much noise there is due to revenue still being so small, but 33000/605000 implies a COGS of just 5.5%.¬† This leads me to think my 33% assumption may be high.¬† If COGS turns out to be 25%, then gross profit would be 645M.¬†¬† If COGS turns out to be 16%, then gross profit would be 715M.¬† I can't imagine COGS being any lower (otherwise the drug wouldn't cost 485000).¬†¬†
   * As a result of securing additional liquidity, Biocryst will¬†pay a¬†royalty of 8.75% on the first 350M of sales, then 2.75% on sales between 350M and 550M, then 0 thereafter.¬† This¬†amounts¬†to a¬†maximum annual royalty expense of 350\*8.75%¬†+ 200\*2.75% = 36M
   * SG&A + R&D + interest expenses were 50M in 3rd quarter, and increased to 62M in the 4th quarter.¬† They said they had infrastructure set up to market/distribute Orladeyo¬†so I imagine SG&A won't increase much, but R&D will likely increase to fund further research of¬†BCX9930 as well as other drugs.¬† I'll assume these expenses rise to 75M per quarter, or 300M annually.¬†¬†
* Based on these assumptions that leaves profit of 575M - 36M - 300M = 239M.¬† Again, COGS is a major unknown in my model, but profit could be as large as 309M (in my 25% scenario) or 379M (in my 16% scenario)
* Share count was 176M in 3rd quarter, and increased from 110M last year.¬† I'll assume risk of further dilution to 200M.¬†¬†
* EPS is 239/200=1.19.¬† I estimate a $19 share price based on P/E of 16 and COGS of 33% (This improves to $24 and $30 share¬†prices in my 25% or 16% COGS scenarios respectively, both of which are more realistic than a conservative 33%).¬†¬†**This is** ***before*** **considering the BC.0X9930 drug, which actually seems to be their primary asset.**¬† I did not see any revenue estimates for BCX9930.¬†¬†But lets look at what we do know:  

   * 9930 is already close to approval to treat PNH in the US (here is some great [DD thats focused more on this new drug](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/mckprn/bcrx_biocrysts_factor_d_inhibitor_bcx9930_hit_it/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) from [u/BIO9999](https://www.reddit.com/user/BIO9999/)), but there would only be around 300 patients in the US.¬† I found a presentation on Biocryst's [IR page](https://ir.biocryst.com/static-files/41ee0771-0acc-479e-a39e-2842101c6aa9) that listed other diseases that 9930 could treat, and I googled the prevalence of each in the US:¬†  

      * aHUS - 600
      * ANCA vasculitis - 6000
      * Lupus nephritis - 12000
      * IgAN vasculitis - 66000
      * glomerulonephritis - inconclusive
      * primary membranous nephropathy - 3000
      * IgA nephropathy - 7500
   * It's unclear how many of these patients would need treatment with 9930 or what the price of 9930 would be, but there seems to be a **huge opportunity for 9930 to easily double my revenue/profit¬†forecasts**.¬† This revenue is many years and many clinical trials away though,¬†and may eventually face competition from other¬†drugs, so I didn't include it in my analysis.¬†¬†
* Risks:¬† (1) I did not consider corporate tax on their profit (though they probably won't pay much tax due to years of losses to carry forward).¬† (2) I've seen politicians¬†tweet about obscene drug prices, and the bad press/political pressure may cause price reductions and instantly hurt the share price.¬† (3) According to Seeking Alpha, analyst consensus revenue estimates are only 56.8M in 2021 and 144M in 2022 (as opposed to my long-term estimate of 855M).¬† It seems it might be some time before they reach my revenue targets.¬†¬†
* Again, I'm not that familiar with the pharma industry so I'm not really sure what will happen with COGS, R&D, or SG&A, but I tried to be conservative.¬† I never thought I would consider a pharma stock, but this really looks good around 10.¬† Thoughts?¬†¬†

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mind if i ask some advice?

Should i sell my absolutely fucked options? Or maybe average down? Naked call 15$ by June and a few $13 calls by April. 

I was making really good money and got a little greedy   I‚Äôve been in $BCRX since $4 but I still have under a year of investing experience and I‚Äôm novice with options."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, I think the biggest selling point of Orladeyo is the ease of use (oral vs injectable) because this will be a measurable quality of life improvement for those in which it‚Äôs effective.

Alexion has other drugs, but Soliris is their big one.  The point is that inhibitors of the alternative complement pathway (like Soliris and BCX9930) are attractive assets, because of the wide variety of ""complement mediated"" diseases that these drugs can treat."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, I think one of your older posts was what tipped me off in the first place to look into $BCRX in more detail."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What exactly is your game here my dude? You are mega bearish, discounting any positive literature on this stock, and you spend a good amount of time on the subreddit to do so. Did you short the stock so you‚Äôre trying to make sure it doesn‚Äôt pop? Makes no sense to me. At first, I thought I was being skeptical like you, but now I‚Äôve realized you‚Äôre basically spending a good amount of time soft bashing it, and nobody who actually believes in the company would do that. So what, do you not want it to pop? I‚Äôm just curious."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I am ""bashing"" is 

* this factor 7 that everyone is using which is simply false
* the narrative of this stock being riskless



I think a realistic price target as presented here is way more believable and credible than those astronomic pts that bio9999 throws around. Don't get me wrong here, I think the guy know his shit concerning drugs but he has no clue of financials.


What I want is actual discussion but instead all that happens is you get called a bear (or in your case mega bearish) and insulted (for having a pt that is 100% the current price lol). This post does a good job of presenting why the other ""serious"" pts are not going to happen, at least not in the near future."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I appreciate the people that comment with an opposing thesis. I would much rather see the other side's view, regardless of which position I take on it(if one at all). I'm a bull on some tickers and a bear on others. Bear comments on bull posts have helped me find profitable positions with higher accuracy than bull posts, thus far (although my bull winners pay off bigger when they win)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go through your post history again. Maybe you should tone back your criticisms just a bit if you want people to believe you‚Äôre actually long on the stock. Your idea of actual discussion involves generating concern wherever possible. I can‚Äôt tell if you are trying to drive new potential investors away, because if one of your comments was the first they saw when they visited the subreddit, it would be a terrible first impression. 

For all Bio9999‚Äôs shortcomings being a little too blindly optimistic on the stock, he‚Äôs still contributing infinitely more to the discussion than you have or will, even if your goal is to spread FUD. Just saying."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Appreciate the motivation, but no need to defend me to others, let's keep our comments focused on this excellent post."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are free to address my comments, show me they are invalid. This is what I actually want and would prefer, I want to be wrong. But instead we are here again with baseless accusations of me not really holding a position, which means to me that you can't address them."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, just really dislike these consistently pessimistic posters."
2021-03-29 21:36:34,wallstreetbets,"Canadian LPs WILL be allowed in the US markets *WHEN* MSOs are allowed to uplist. $APHA/TLRY üöÄüöÄüöÄ I **truly** don't understand how this concept is so difficult for most investors (""MSO gAnG"" in particular) to understand, but I'll make this nice and easy for you. 

Although the SAFE banking bill does **not** have specific language to allow MSOs to uplist, it *is* expected to happen. No one really expects to see ""pot stonks uplist allowed"" in the bill, it's more of an expectation with being allowed access to financial institutions. Cannabis investors on both sides would be appalled (investing in $ROPE) if uplisting wasn't allowed, so let's just assume it will be from here on out. 

 Currently the only thing stopping canadian LP's such as TilAphria or Canopy from purchasing MSOs is the threat of being delisted. That's *literally* it. If uplisting is allowed for MSOs, then LPs can own them and not be delisted. Simple concept, simple path into the US. 

There **is** a magical wall stopping LP's from sending their weed across the border, but **there is no magical wall stopping their money from purchasing portions or entire publicly listed companies.** 

Also, it would make next to no sense for LPs to purchase any of the ""big"" MSOs. Those companies have had to pay millions and millions to expand State by State and vertically integrate. It will make much more sense for LPs to purchase companies based on location and build them out to meet demand for the surrounding states, in the near future. Most likely southern States, since they can just wait on the northern border to open to their existing facilities. I say *mostly* because I expect some NY news from TilAphria shortly after uplisting for MSOs is a reality. Considering they set the TilAphria merger for 4/20, I'd imagine them announcing a merger that closes the day after the SAFE bill passes. They're cheeky like that, I like it.  

For example, Aphria owns Sweetwater. Sweetwater just so happens to own a 50m+ [distribution center in Indiana](https://www.wane.com/top-stories/sweetwater-unveils-new-52-5m-warehouse/) . I imagine one of their first purchases will be a MSO with large operations in Illinois to capture the current market there while waiting on Indiana to pull the red outta their ass. It wouldn't really benefit them much to pay a massive premium for someone like Trulieve who is a glorified SSO (Single State Operator) and doesn't really bring anything to the table for them. Trulieve just sells weed in a massive market. TilAphria can grow their own weed, they just want the market. Lol

Most MSOs are just being propped up by the **markets** they are in. Markets like Florida are massive, yet controlled by a handful of companies due to their laws. Same with PA, just a smaller market. Markets like California are bigger than entire countries. Regardless, the one thing that's definitely going to get bigger is the market size in US states as more people use and accept legal marijuana, and the one thing that's definitely going to get smaller is market share for companies who currently don't really have any competition yet. 

The hilarious part of this is: ""Trulievers"" still somehow see a path to continuing to be ""the most profitable"" company once they lose their monopoly on the 3rd most populous state in the US. Considering NY's clear signal **against** oligarchy type markets, I'd be very concerned as a Trulieve investor. Also, save the ""New York is just one State"" bullshit. Schumer is in the driver's seat for Marijuana reform and there's no reason to expect him to introduce a bill that doesn't resemble his States bill, and there's **no reason** to expect one that contradicts his State's bill. 

Also, while I'm shitting on Trulieve, I just want to mention that the **only** thing that could save them will be a national market. If they get State level legalization years before a national market, then they're **fucked.** They currently operate over 1 **million** square feet worth of grow space in Florida. That's easy to sell when you have 50% market share due to being 1 of 5 companies who control over 80% of the marijuana businesses in Florida. That's going to be a lot harder to do once there's **hundreds** of new growers and **hundreds/thousands** of new stores. Sure, booming demand from the switch from medical to legal should help, but it won't be long until they are a US version of an LP the last couple years. Just sitting on a big ol mountain of weed waiting on a bigger market to open. If they can keep up with quality in a highly competitive legal market, that is.  As I've said before, the numbers don't lie. Florida's medical marijuana market currently has a dispensary to 100k people ratio of 1.1, while legal marijuana states like Oregon have well over 10 to 100k ratio. 10x the current ratio, 10x the amount of competition on price, 10x the amount of competition on quality..etc. Trulieve will have a lot to prove in a legal market, and legalization isn't always amazing for everything weed related. 

Weedmaps for example: they're just a complicated google search. For online menus and traceability software, that's gonna be Dutchie. For strain info, that's Leafly. Weedmaps doesn't really bring anything to the table after Apple/Google stop blocking pot stores on their maps. ü§∑ 

Anyway, $APHA/$TLRY üöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄüöÄ, eventually."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ain't that the truth. When the first stimmy checks went out, pregnant women couldn't get an extra $500 because the child in the womb wasn't a ""child,"". But you can't abort a fetus because you're a baby killer. 
Moral of the story: those conservative states change their social positions when it comes to them losing money."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Like they say, ""if you want to give your life a second time to your country, go to the VA."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The world is large yes but have you thought about it? The cultural differences, population, along with wealth play a huge role in what is plausible when thinking about where this market will flourish . 90% of the 2019 and 2020 legal cannabis sales were in the US which is yet to be even half legalized. Other parts of the world 1) don't consume like we do in the US. 2) have the disposal income to spend on it. I mean the possibility of it becoming legal in Mexico doesn't mean much because it's citizens can't afford to buy it for much money. How much could you sell a  joint for in Mexico?? 10 to 20 pesos from what I read or 1 US dollar. Unless it was to a US tourist not much. 3) Have the population anywhere near the size of the US. Europe might come around and do well. Though that is many countries with individual governments far behind the US in progress to legalize. Other than that most Asian countries are very against legalization. Some have the death penalty for selling large quantities and years jail time for small offenses. The Middle East has a similar veiw. South America is similar to a Mexico situation where I don't imagine you could sell it for much. Africa?  Does anyone honesty think African countries will have big legal cannabis markets?? Basically the US (currently largest) , Europe (though that is many countries that have yet to legalize some will some won't) , Australia and Canada (small populations)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,at this point i would be happy for 30 EOY
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a pretty reasonable prediction.
I keep buying on the dips, I'm averaged at about $24, it's dropped lower than I thought it would. Stuck in the mud. next moment we will see middle of April they have an expose, and then the earnings report in May somewhere between the 18th and the 24th we may see some movement then. if they can beat the street I'll be happy"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,My man
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's pretty much over. that only happened when the restricted shares were released.
so far as I know they only dumped that first week, and that was it, of course just Mr Cohen was $45 million dollars alone
I don't think that's the reason"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be fine
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, this will hit $50 way before Amazon hits $6000... in fact this will hit $75 before Amazon hits $6000"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep telling myself this as well, it‚Äôs okay"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs virtually every tech company.

Imagine having half or 90% of your TC over a decade or two locked up in private shares 

At some point you want that $100k car and that $3MM house 

I üíé üôå my company‚Äôs equity because I know this shit will moon, but I have coworkers who sell on the private market or to ESO funds because they need that Porsche right now. The funniest was my teammate who meme‚Äôd the ‚Äúit‚Äôs my money and I want it now‚Äù ad before he sold some during a tender offer

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with people selling positions in a recently IPO‚Äôd company. If 90-95% of your TNW was locked up shares, you would too even if you believed in the company"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya if this breaks $20 its goin lower
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. I bought more
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I see what you did there
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs technique only

Edit: were they weeklies or monthlies?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm hopefully on $20-22 support level, I haven‚Äôt seen it break it yet.  If it does it‚Äôs going to be ugly for everyone holding Palantir unless they bought in around $10 back at IPO.  Lowest I saw a month ago was in the high $20s, fingers crossed, holding my nuts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don‚Äôt think this is the bottom yet
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The red can‚Äôt continue, it‚Äôs got to bounce soon.  Good days are coming.  Double click day is the nearest positive event for us."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I bought in I wasn't thinking ""I can't believe this company thinks it's worth $50,000,000,000"" I was thinking ""For the product offering, yoy revenue generation, and value proposition for its customers I would definitely be willing to pay $28 per share for a stake in this company.""
Should I be changing my way of thinking about how I invest in companies?
Also, I wasn't really looking for a quick move on this I was prepared to hang onto the shares for a while I just wish I was in the green now."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Going deep itm can be good for the reasons you state... but going 90% deep itm is rarely good. It doesn't provide you the leverage you would really want to make it worthwhile. To get great spreads and a near-1:1 movement with the underlying, going 40-70% deep itm would be better. Yeah, it may only move 93c to the dollar instead of 98, but, that still allows you to capture the vast majority of the move with very minimal theta decay. You don't need to go down to the $2 range lol."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can only lose $28 per share, while I can gain infinity per share. Obvious buy.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on sector, but generally the big ones are revenue, EBITDA, CAGR, etc. and using those to create some ratio."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I also use meth while looking at the stonk charts before I buy.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I wonder if a machine learning model could be built to guestimate what the true value of a company is based on the factors you provided. That would be pretty cool
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"RemindMe! 5 months (pltr tendies or not?)

GME has significant implications, but any DD should take into account this monumental shift in financial policy over the next 9 months to protect people from reading into things that are much greater in scope than GME."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,All accumulation of money is evil. When one person has more money than necessary really all they are doing is keeping the ability from others to buy needed goods and services. The actual value disparity is irrelevant. The hoarding of wealth is a sickness of Capitalism which itself is self destructive in the end.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When you borrow money from your broker to play stocks, the broker requires you keep a certain amount of cash in your account to help reduce their risk in case you go tits-up in debt.  That security deposit funded by you is your margin.

When things in your account start looking bad, the broker can make a margin call, which is a request for you to increase that security deposit to an amount that's acceptable to them.  If you can't dump more of your money into your margin, the broker can decide to seize your margin and liquidate all the stocks that you have with them."

Nope, completely separate OS by IBM. NeXT was cool, but required specialty hardware. All of these operating systems had true multitasking and protected memory, making a stark contrast to Windows which didn't have them until NT and arguably no OS delivered to mass market (or for general consumption) by MS had these basic operating system features until 2000 (when they merged NT and 95 into Windows 2000)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof..yup..the little guys get caught...the other big guys..it's the price of business..it's wrong .
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They're holding $7000 from me for 2015 where I may have made 30k that year. Everytime I call them it says we're to busy call again tomorrow.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean disclaimer - I did know from everyone who has ever dealt with the IRS ever - don't fuck with the IRS. I should have spent the day on hold - which I *tried* calling them a few times prior - always gave up for various reasons after holding for a few hours... don't do that, no matter how small, take the day off to wait to talk to them. 

What bothers me is - why the fuck did you audit some random scrub's tax return from 2016 in late 2018???

I got laid off, had multiple w-2's & unemployment which I didn't even exhaust and was back in school for a bit to change careers. 

I made what was clearly an accidental mistake on a return that was complex enough to merit having a professional double check it, but I was fucking unemployed due to the price of oil falling not my inability to do my job 5 months of that year and exhausted my savings living & paying for education and such.

I couldn't afford a professional same as I couldn't afford taxACT's audit protection. I exhausted my savings & partially cashed out a 401k - I was fucking broke!

Also bootstrapped, I make significantly more now, they make more money off me than they do Warren Buffett for fucks sake. 

Why? Over a $600-$800 error???

Why can you afford to audit that & then get a fucking judgement over an amount no sane profitable fucking debt collector would chase beyond the occasional phone call would chase? 

Especially when you by your own fucking balance sheets know you're already holding 75% of the total amount - with interest & fines - of my fucking money?!?!

Yet... Too expensive to audit the rich. 

Common."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I finally got through I was on hold for like ~5 hours? 

I smoked a blunt, pooped, showered, played video games, made a late lunch, and then went back to video games while listening to their hold script. 

After a 10 minute conversation waited the requisite half hour possible delay as they batch their faxes before calling work HR lady to confirm they'd received the form lifting the garnishment around 4pm...

Got call from HR on my way in at 8:15ish on my way in & went straight there, poked my head in my boss's office on my way back down to cya taking day off to deal with thing... Had a 5 min walk from my apt to work... Started holding ~9:30am. Literally took a whole business day to talk to them. 

Sorry man :/ be persistent - the employees are actually nice/helpful if you can actually get through to them. I didn't complain about the hold time as pretty sure they're aware they're understaffed. Just said here's my situation and how I was planning to resolve it. How do I meet you in the middle? It was super easy from there..."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Woah slow down. Im not calling it a short squeeze. The company is a fintech and also extremely profitable. The price its been hovering around has been due to the low float which has made it attractive for short sellers. (Not saying its gonna be a short squeeze) Everyone knows that RKT price is being suppressed. The price action has been very predictable for months.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyone knows the price is being suppressed? Sauce?

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you I didn‚Äôt feel like reading a book this morning haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sounds like you've been reading too much of those Seeking Alpha articles. I hate to break it to you but Chapter 11 is bankruptcy #Theycantpaynobills #MeNoPayBank. There are some benefits of going into bankruptcy but if bankruptcy is so great as per your description then we would of seen mass bankruptcy across airlines, cruises lines, and hotels over the past year. So why is everyone reluctant to do so and will only do it as a last resort? Simply because going into bankruptcy makes you lose control of the company and your assets and everything is at the mercy of bankruptcy court who would arbitrate the negotiation between the debtholders and the company. So how happy do you think those debtholders will be when the company asks for more cash and debt forgiveness? No very happy at all as you can imagine. This is why most of those offshore companies coming out of bankruptcy so far are working with less than $50 million in cash. Sounds a lot? If you do work in the industry then you would also know, on average it costs over $32 Million just to take a ship out of cold storage, doesn't sound that much now huh? In comparison, Transocean has more than $1 Billion in cash, just sitting there. 

Also, as a bank, how comfortable are you to loan money to a company who has a history of bankruptcy? Its like you walking into the bank with a 200 credit score asking for 200k loan. Even if you as a bank get conned into loaning that money, you'd be asking for insane borrowing costs that would definitely affect the bottom line of the borrower to offset that risk. This is why these same companies who had been in bankruptcy continues to go back into bankruptcy. Simple as that and the debtholders know it.

This also means if demand does increase, these new companies who came out of bankruptcy can no longer afford to take more ships out of cold storage or build/update their ships thus can't grow = bad for business.

I'm glad you touched the point of scrapping rigs. That would only happen if oil does not recover and demand does not go up which all current fundamental factors go against this. But if you been listening to their earnings calls, you would know that Transocean has been diversifying some of their unused rigs in overseas oil storage and its been paying off. I don't see any Seeking Alpha or Motley Fool articles covering this, they are just repeating the same bear news/analysis like Eljefe2800 said...hmm I wonder why.

You also missed the point that Transocean did restructured a good portion of their debt without going into bankruptcy thus the lawsuit.

One last thing, besides numerous earnings calls and analysts confirming this, it is also just logical; you are Chevon, planning to pay millions for a large contract to develop a well. You expect the project will be done over 3 years, so after knowing that SDRL just came out of bankruptcy and knowing that they were also in bankruptcy less than 3 years ago who would you trust? So don't assume this does not affect the oil clients. 

A word of advice, in the future, stop reading those seeking alpha articles and instead read the actual 10K, 10Q and actually listen to the earnings calls."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,XOM is a double if we get $90-100 oil again. RIG would be more like a 10x.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that's pretty well said. Kudos for putting everything in laymens terms lmao
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're right about one thing. If they enter Chapter 11 the valuation of the company is out of their hands & the original shareholders lose out partially or completely. So they don't YOLO into it for that reason but there are some positives such as wiping out BILLIONS of debt that would handcuff them in years to come. 

Where you're wrong...Companies are not exiting Ch11 with <$50m available its closer to $500m if you look at Diamond, Noble, Valaris who are some of the most relatable examples. In fact most of them have additional credit lines established as part of the restructuring. OK sure RIG has more at $1B but they also have upcoming payments on new equipment which is a huge chunk of money (hello 20k BOP's). And that's in addition to paying back debt at some point

Reactivation costs are actually closer to $50-75m for cold stacked floating rigs by the way. The latest gen rigs had a lot more toys on them than earlier versions. If you see the state of them now you'd see why the costs are so high. Almost a full renovation is needed which is also why scrapping them becomes the easy way out when cash is tight.

As for repurposing rigs for oil storage, I wasn't aware of this. Seems odd though as if you had ever stepped foot on a drillship you'd know how small they are compared to other vessels. Maybe a WSB retard hired one last April to store their negative value oil futures. Who knows, but its not going to save the day for them and they wouldn't be the only ones in a position to do it.

I still don't see any cases where oil companies are selecting rigs based solely on financial history. They want the safest rigs possible from companies with a good safety track record. (RIG is strong in this regard I will admit)

So if the ex-Ch11 companies have almost no debt, cash & credit available to reactivate rigs & invest in upgrades to meet new demands. Then I'm not sure your case makes as much sense any more? They're not completely FUK but it's not quite the walk in the park that you're expecting 

No positions by the way & not copy pasta from Seeking Alpha. Just 10+ years working in this industry. I hope I'm wrong"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs awesome he‚Äôs 5400 down and it says the risk is ‚ÄúSafe‚Äù. Even the app is aware of the squeeze

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so we're clear;

You were all-in on a stock that was up over 300% in the last 6 months, and somehow managed to take a 75% hit to your portfolio?

Sir, there are no words.  In the future, try staying away from the silver crayons. They are the fastest killers of brain cells."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But if you sold CCs you made some juicy premiums and you can wait for the stock to rebound. I would continue selling ccs and average down here on stock.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, sorry for your loss, but I think you need to open to the possibility that they haven't stopped the sell-off.  Maybe sell off the margin?"

Bill Hwang is the ultimate autist here. Sorry you got caught in the crossfire but I'm also amazed at your balls for holding and not buying back the calls and just dumping all the shares.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So many places to sell calls, where do you think that someone selling calls would have left these particular ones? If someone wanted to buy them?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It could drop, but if I was willing to buy at 70 I'm definitely willing to buy at 45. Nothing about the company itself has changed so I'm here at least through next earnings when they hopefully give a good update on subscribers (if the stock doesnt drop too much lol)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôd be absolutely shocked if Chopped films in 12 hours. It‚Äôs more likely they film 3 episodes a day. 

My father had a food network show. They were so efficient they would film it ‚Äúlive to tape‚Äù which means that a 30 minute show took around 30 minutes to film and they even switched between cameras in a control room live. When it was done filming it was already edited and ready to air. They‚Äôd film a full season of edited and ready to air shows in 3 days. And this was with a tiny crew too. They have more kitchen workers than high-paying production workers. And the kitchen workers also create a ton of online recipes that make more ad dollars."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,But I got this notion that the motion in your ocean meets small craft advisories.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interviews online seem to back up the 12 hour thing - and I know other shows like Cupcake Wars used to film over 1-2 days, and I'm pretty sure Netflix's ""Sugar Rush"" actually films over 2-3, but I can certainly see a ton of these shows that don't allow for retakes.

I know on Chopped & Cupcake Wars the vast majority of that time is simply prep time - moving ingredients into place, getting shots of the food, doing pickups of the bakers pretending to ""decide"" what to make on the spot, etc. 

& good point about the recipe, just last night my wife was on one of the sites looking for some specific recipe we saw on a competition show. They get the residuals, they often have a huge stake in the participants if any of them blow up as well."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,DUR
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had to go look that up myself, it‚Äôs so different than my experience at FN. You are correct. While it‚Äôs clear these cooking competition shows are heavily edited to keep things moving, I just figured that meant they filmed for 3 hours instead of 1. 

It annoys me, because I had such a bad experience at FN! My father was on back when they still did regular cooking shows. The crew was all the same as Emeril Live which was filmed with an audience, so they were a machine of efficiency. But I was 18, just on as a guest, and did not go through any media training as my father had. 

They‚Äôd wheel in a cart and 4 kitchen people would stage the kitchen in 5 minutes as the kitchen producer would give specific instructions. They‚Äôd tell me exactly which eggplant to grab out of a basket, which cutting board, and which knife to use. How thick to cut it and then to slide it into the pan and put the cutting board in the sink. A ton of directions in 5 minutes as everything got put in place. Then they‚Äôd start filming and literally play the opening of the show for no reason as this was being taped. Then my father would start the show using a teleprompter and an ear piece for stage directions (I had neither as a guest). 

We had to accomplish everything that needed done in the time before a commercial break because, even though it was filmed, they treated it like it was live for no reason. I‚Äôd grab the eggplant start cutting and they‚Äôd yell CUT. Then they‚Äôd immediately reset the whole show and explain to me that I wasn‚Äôt looking into the camera as I cut the eggplant. We‚Äôd start entirely over, I‚Äôd get all the way to the end and I‚Äôd turn around to put the cutting board in the sink and they‚Äôd yell cut because I turned my back to the camera instead of walking backwards. We‚Äôd do everything again. But first they‚Äôd explain to me that this was the LAST eggplant just to add more pressure. 

It was stupid and awful. I‚Äôm an indie film director now and I STILL don‚Äôt understand why it would have been the end of the world to just pick back up from me walking to the sink instead of throwing all the food away and starting over. (They‚Äôd start from the last commercial break, not the whole show). 

When I was on it probably took twice as long as an episode without a guest. But they‚Äôd still get 3 episodes a day. They‚Äôd film full seasons of like 3 cooking shows during a break of Emeril Live (which had like 150+ episodes a year). 

Don‚Äôt know why I explained all of that other than because it still gives me nightmares."

Problem is, not much is known at this point. We don't know if there will be more liquidations related to this HF or if those sudden drops will cause domino effect to other HFs. You could try to time a bottom based on feels and greed WSB style, but always be careful when catching a falling knife."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Avatar has to have pretty much lost its leverage by now. They did a great job with Disney on doing the park, but the movie came out so long ago..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you're definitely right, Gonna be cautius with this one"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,lol i bought in at $45.6 and sold 53 calls for a $1 premium. That's almost a 20% move on to hit that strike. If it does I dont care i make 20%. If it doesn't Ill keep selling calls and hold the stock. It's got a 11 PE with a whole shit ton of trademarks I dont mind at all.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,i think he meant sell puts
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Avatar the last airbender not the stupid movie
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My problem is I am always overly cautious so I might not be best source of advice. Premarket on VIAC and DISCA looks optimistic. But then again, we don't know what will happen in next few days or weeks. If you only invest what you're willing to lose, you're good."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,For some reason I presumed you were talking about selling calls naked or in a spread. Your CC play makes a lot of sense since you believe in the company at the current price.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure... that, and people who were interested in this sub for reasons other than one damn stock."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"People believing that the stock is a good stock and then complaining that they didn't buy the dip need to check their brains. If it is a good stock, and it's worth more than now, then IT IS the dip. Buy the dip and hold, don't be smooth popsicle brain."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean.. yes.. I am very much looking forward to WSB moving on and taking the fight to the broader market.

Noone wants that sort of attention.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, I eat paste.


When you buy stock, you should always have an exit plan envisioned. Something that lets you cut a profit, isn't stupid, but also isn't ""lets cut my losses."" Remember, were it any other stock, cashing out at a 30% gain is pretty swell for an average stock. But if you're extremely bullish about a stock's ability to grow, maybe that plan looks something like, ""I sell enough shares to cover my initial investment but not if it involves selling more than 1/5th of my total shares."" 


That then becomes your law. You do not deviate from the plan. If you did your job up front and didn't invest money you *need* elsewhere, then watching your investment crash and burn isn't going to set you back either."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs like ninety hundred dollars!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's called fractional shares. They can/should buy now then average down if they need to. I need the price of the stock to go up so I can justify buying a $20 share for $200
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucked up part for me is I expected this current situation after the first drop and was convinced it would find support between 70-90. Clearly it didn't so I lost out on buying a shit ton of shares. The second run up did convince people though so now we have proper support which is nice. I can't complain because for the first run up I averaged up to the 30s before it took off.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have over 10k ready if it cracks duble digi but thats the hard rule i set. Except 100 ill do 100. But calling 200->170 a dip is a stretch for me in the context of GME. If it happens every other day its not a dip. If it drops to 120 and holds for a few weeks thats a dip.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, in January I was gobbling shares at this price and higher, thrilled to even.  I liked the stock.

Today, I like the stock.  Now anything I can generate selling covered calls on my greenstonks goes directly into GME and any left over change goes into AMC.  In other words still buying when I can and diamond handing what's already bought.

It's still cheap and the ride is worth it, an opportunity like this is literally once in a lifetime thing.  The potential imo is excellent and a bit speculative,  a meteoric rise will make me rich a 100% loss gives me a war story and will NOT ruin me. 

It's a great game, fun.  And the company behind it will transform itself into a great platform and will NOT go bankrupt,  unlike the evil shitadel."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got back in at $50 a month ago. Foolishly set a stop loss that triggered when it dipped below $150 after getting near $300. Still made money and bought back in at $184. I know it's high, but it's money I don't need anytime soon and if it squeezes like everyone thinks then I don't mind the high buy-in."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"THANK YOU. 

I got in at $40 back when WSB was still at 1 mil members and I was only in it because there was the huge (141% float) squeeze and the insurance that GME had solid fundamentals to take it above $40. 

Now it‚Äôs not a sure bet for but everyone keeps posting about GME and confirming this bias. I just wanna see some decent DD on other tickers for once instead of  third rate memes on GME every day. Like seriously, the entire front page is filled with GME. 

I‚Äôm a supporter of GME as well but I would also like to see other content for once. If I wanted pure GME content, I would have gone to /r/GME"

GME is a once in a lifetime event. Whining about it being the center of attention is like whining about the moon landing being in all the news in 1969. This sub doesn't exist to cater to your exact needs."

With things like Jupyter/Streamlit/ELK stack making it easier and easier for relatively novice analysts to pull in, manipulate, and present data, I can't see many companies paying for PLTR when there are free alternatives that allow much more freedom.

Military, of course. Military ethos seems to be 'why take free when we can spend money'.

Financial companies will build their own proprietary systems. Biotechs and academics will want their own systems that they can tweak according to their needs.

These are all companies where the development-and-growth-part of their problems are mostly classical optimization and industrial engineering applications, where a small in-house team of research wizards can do the heavy lifting.  However, the production-part of their problems is going to increasingly be driven by sentiment analysis, consumer trends, secondary market effects, climate events, and other factors.  You can't pay a small in-house team to do anywhere near as well at managing, organizing, and mining all the data for that as you can to pay an expert company to help you set it up, maintain it, and provide support for your classic-problem specialists as they continue to design future growth and operations.

These are all industries where a fraction of a percent improvement that can be eked out by active management and crunching of all that data translates to tens of billions of dollars a year.  If Palantir is making a 5% commission on that business intelligence and data analytics, they're a company doing 100Bn/yr in business easily (note that this isn't realistic because competitors *will* arise, but it's a reference scale).

The key is that the quantity of data is way, way higher than what academics can realistically handle or crunch on, while also being more sophisticated and powerful than what novice platforms can support with the platforms you listed.

It's not a question of whether other folks can do things.  It's a question of the combination of things all at once--as I said, I'm not impressed by their AI or analytics effects even if they are top-notch in the industry.  I'm impressed by the *systems engineering* they've gone through floor-to-ceiling to ensure that what they have is scalable, maintainable, reliable, and *fast*."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You expect a turnaround of this scale instantaneously? If BB was to ipo today, it'd open at $40. Let's be real"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same. Been asked by younger coworkers, how could you have passed. It‚Äôs real simple, Netflix at $7 wasn‚Äôt looking great. The early streaming experience was kind of meh is why I didn‚Äôt take buy in at $7. And honestly would have dumped it all at $12-14 anyway, I know damn well I wouldn‚Äôt have held it long past the price doubling."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you‚Äôre saying there‚Äôs no downside. Or, you‚Äôre implying that there are classified details, while still refusing to speak in generalities."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't get me wrong, I like BB. I think Chen is a smart guy. It's just that BB needs to shake off their perception of being an old phone maker. Hopefully their IVY platform will open a lot of peoples eyes."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I rather trust my guts and go with it and face the consequences of those decisions, than to listen to somebody else and feel like a tool afterwards."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"More that I can't list a downside that wasn't self-imposed.  I'm sure other clients have *seen* downsides, but from where I sit/sat all the problems were our (the customer's) fault, either on an individual or systemic level.

Edit: granted, this was the senior leader view, and for a 9 figure contract I'm sure the best of their best were doing the work visible to the General Officer level folks.

Also, refusing to speak in generalities is what the law requires regarding classified info; we can't even comment ""no comment"" in public.  So, if there were problems involving classified materials, nobody would discuss them anyway--that'd be a violation of the law and at the senior pentagon level, they go after folks for that if it makes news b/c headlines are bad optics."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not trying to insinuate an answer either way, but how would you explain how every etf that has GME in it trading almost exactly the same today?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Eh I kind of agree but the rim jokes would be plentiful and blackberry is a household name for alot of people.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"At the time, Netflix could have gone either way. I don‚Äôt feel like an idiot for not buying inüòë. But I‚Äôve made and lost and made plenty in the 10 years since. Easy to look back 10 years."

The signals don‚Äôt go through buildings so in cities they will all need to be line of sight.  Remote highways will also need at least 5 per mile to hit that 1000ft range (probably more to make sure).   And routers/signal boosters."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'd like to read what he has to say too. Can't tell if genuinely bullish or gone insane...

There was a rumour that his broker wouldn't let him sell on 3/2 for some legit but bullshit reason or other. So, yeah, I'm wondering whether the trauma of watching his thesis play out two days before he was able to cash out has turned him into a batshit crazy jungle colonel a la Apocalypse Now. Then again, like you said, the dude's a millionaire so he knows better than I do. I'm in significantly on RKT, but I just keep my average price below $24 cos I think that's what SirJack's cost basis is. Somehow, this logic makes sense to me üòÇ

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are people saying VIAC is an opportunity?  AFAICT, the fall is part of the reason margin calls were triggered on the fund, which then decided to sell-off.  It wasn't the sell-off which caused it lose 50% of its value, which is what it seems like some people are implying.  I'm reading reporting (MSM) that the sell-off only dropped the value by \~7%.

Are folks thinking that VIAC is fundamentally more sound?  It's only traded above the current value for half of its lifetime.  It struggled in the recent past b/c they were playing a traditional media company's game in a streaming media's market...

Is there some reason (b/c Paramount+ doesn't seem enough) to think that VIAC will make a comeback?"

Also I didn't apply/get approved for option trading for Vanguard, so they were confused why I had an option in my account (part of why they were telling me my transfer should have never went through the first time). It just seemed like the reps I was talking to didn't know what they were doing.

Hope your transfer goes through smoothly though!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I was told by fidelity that RH just transfers a lot of their securities out as margin and that messes with a lot of peoples transfers. I'm not sure if it's related to RH Gold or if is due to options turned on but that's the reason for why you get margin. At least that's what I was told by the fidelity rep.

>	So in 2013, Hwang converted the firm into a ‚Äúfamily office,‚Äù set up to manage his private wealth. The family office, Archegos Capital Management, appears to be massive, not just in size and scope, but also in risk appetite. However, its status as a family office exempts it from the Securities and Exchange Commission‚Äôs reporting requirements for investment firms. Historically, family offices weren‚Äôt required to register with the SEC under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 because of an exemption provided to firms with fewer than 15 clients. When the Dodd-Frank Act was signed into law in 2010, the 15-client exemption was removed, dramatically increasing transparency on hedge funds and private equity firms. The Act included a provision that explicitly exempted family offices from reporting requirements. Thus, as a family office, Hwang‚Äôs firm wasn't required to disclose much."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Madoff did get called out, the SEC ignored it.

> The second case of concerns about Madoff's operation was raised in May 2000, when Harry Markopolos, a financial analyst and portfolio manager at Boston options trader Rampart Investment Management, alerted the SEC about his suspicions. A year earlier, Rampart had learned that Access International Advisors, one of its trading partners, had significant investments with Madoff. Markopolos' bosses at Rampart asked him to design a product that could replicate Madoff's returns.[11] However, Markopolos concluded that Madoff's numbers didn't add up. After four hours of trying and failing to replicate Madoff's returns, Markopolos concluded Madoff was a fraud. He told the SEC that based on his analysis of Madoff's returns, it was mathematically impossible for Madoff to deliver them using the strategies he claimed to use. In his view, there were only two ways to explain the figures‚Äîeither Madoff was front running his order flow, or his wealth management business was a massive Ponzi scheme. This submission, along with three others, passed with no substantive action from the SEC.[88][89]"

Since there was no info to be found about the Oct interview I have no way of telling if anyone from gamestop was involved, and so can't determine if they may be at this one. No information about tomorrow's event is available outside of the one Bloomberg terminal screenshot. At this point I place no expectations on the March 30 ""interview"" being an event available to the public, including any spokesperson from gamestop, or including anything other than analysis of previously released information. If anyone has information available to fill in any details please let me know. It would be nice of we could proceed with realistic expectations.

So by the Black Rock reducing their positions in all the stocks that drop, citadel was one of the main holders of those shares, it pushed citadel closer to a margin call.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Understanding the Primary Dealer Credit Facility (PDCF)
The Primary Dealer Credit Facility was established in order to encourage financial markets to function more effectively. Primary dealers borrow overnight loans from the PDCF through their clearing banks at the primary credit rate offered by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

A frequency-based fee is assigned to primary dealers who borrow from the PDCF on more than 45 business days.

Financial Crisis
The facility was one of a number of steps taken by the government to free up credit during the financial crisis. The 2008 financial crisis was the worst economic disaster since the Great Depression of 1929. The crisis was the result of a sequence of events, each with its own trigger and culminating in the near collapse of the banking system. It has been argued that the seeds of the crisis were sown as far back as the 1970s with the Community Development Act, which forced banks to loosen their credit requirements for lower-income minorities creating a market for subprime mortgages.

The Federal Reserve made loans totaling $8.95 trillion to primary dealers in exchange for a wide range of collateral under its Primary Dealer Credit Facility.  Citigroup, Merrill Lynch, and Morgan Stanley each received loans that total more than $1 trillion. However, these were overnight loans, which were frequently rolled over into new loans. Some 21,000 transactions with financial companies and foreign central banks were made using the facility."

&#x200B;

OP is wrong for pretty easy reasons. He flat out doesn't understand what Archegos is and why it matters that they're not a HF:

>Archegos never filed anything with the SEC and they have ties to blackrock

Archegos is a family office, not a hedge fund or a RIA. They are not obligated to file anything with the SEC.

Furthermore, Archegos notoriously trades their equity positions through swaps which does not require any 13F filings as they don't actually own the stock, just the economic exposure. The actual stock gets owned by the bank as a hedge or internalized with other PB/swap positions (if I'm a bank and a client wants a swap to long TSLA and I've already got another client with a swap to short tsla, I just use one swap to hedge another instead of having to use up my balance sheet on both).

Back during my years as a synthetics trader (at one of the majors), we looked at onboarding Archegos in 2016 but couldn't get past relationship risk committee. They'd be exclusively a swap client which was pretty lucrative for us given we had a bit of pb shorts in us listed chinese equities that we could internalize with."

BBY is 1) going down the tubes, and 2) entered into that deal with Apple (and MS, and Amazon, and Google, and to a lesser degree Samsung, Sony, and LG in the Home Theater Dept) so that they could a) actually sell those companies' products, and b) get the white glove support treatment (each of those companies have reps that visit stores regularly to train the sales team).

Gamestop doesn't make products that BBY would sell. Gamestop already has a ton of locations around the country. So neither of them need each other in the way BBY and those product suppliers do."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,GameStop has locations throughout the country. Apple wants Apple stores to be a premium experience. But they want extra retail space. So they can piggyback on Best Buy. GameStop has plenty of retail space. And Best Buy (while I personally like it) isn‚Äôt some amazing name. GameStop doesn‚Äôt need BB logistics. They have their own supply chain. There are way fewer Bb locations than GameStops. This just wouldn‚Äôt make sense for either business.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That's how catalysts work. The speed up or otherwise help the reaction take place without being consumed or being part of the final product. Otherwise they would be a reactant.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Aluminum powder will do it too
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Its pronounced shitadel

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's called ""The Haber Process"", they compress gasious hydrogen and nitrogen in 3:1 molar ratio respectively, in the presence of iron (as a catalyst; the substance that lowers the energy threshold for the desired reaction/speeds up reaction time) - creates ammonia (NH3). Described in basic terms."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oasis and Taxi Driver reference in one post. Amazing!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah I‚Äôd be more worried if he was talking about cesium and water
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That could be part of a transformation though. If GME took over video game sales for Best Buy they could effectively reduce the number of their brick and mortar locations that are solely GameStops. It would represent a massive cut in their overhead and allow them to focus more resources on their major e-commerce shift.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cohen's advantage here is the move towards experiences. Leveraging the brick and mortar to increase overall sales but not sinking all your revenue into leases. Get me in the store and let me try an HTC Vive on, I'm a lot more likely to buy one. Do a payment plan, the people have more access to it. Go to HTC and say ""Hey, I'm offering payment plans for your hardware. You should give me a % of your digital sales. Also I prevent scalping/botting."" They've definitely got a lot of opportunities."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,this is uuuuuuuuuuge

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,...oh sweet summer child...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If so I can‚Äôt resist a discount
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No.. they don‚Äôt have to sell GME shares due to its inherent risk / volatility.  They can continue carrying risky investments.  The difference is they have to have higher levels of cash in hand to back their investments.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between holding shares of a stock and having a short position that can lose more money than you could afford to pay back.

EDIT: In a long position, you're losses are limited to whatever you have invested in the stock. This is because a stock can only drop to zero. However, in a short position, you could theoretically lose an infinite amount of money, because there is no hard limit on how much a stock can go up."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Hedge funds ‚â† banks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Coolalias is correct üòé

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What he wrote down status: keeps on forgetting
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I went to buy stuff from the closest GameStop store today only to find it is permanently closed. (I‚Äôm so sad it was 5 mins from my house and was open a month ago). Now I will have to go to one of the other 3 locations in a 10 mile radius

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shot only 1 GameStop outta 4 around me remain but I got what I wanted
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Im sorry my post bored you(not really). There‚Äôs a target across the street and I almost went to buy what I needed from them but decided not to as that target sucks and never has what I‚Äôm looking for.  I‚Äôll just swing by the GameStop on my way to work in the morning
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,""" Do you think holding is safe?"" - The real question you should ask is do I think holding is safer than a call contract which everyone with a brain would say yes. Its one thing to lose a dollar on a price in a day, its something completely different to lose 150.00 in a day because of that negative dollar. Im not even sure why this needed to be explained."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,500 + shares at average above 9.00.  and 4/16 calls. im in too deep

April is historically a great month for the market, ER on 5/5 (or sooner), and potential news of russel inclusion (again...). 5/21 covers all of the short term catalysts.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,spend millions in tech vs rkt spend billions in advertising.......uwmc focus on technology and apps  just like uber or ABNB they have brokers around country work for them ... they just sit at home and processing loans ( closing in 17 days ) and make profit.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,> You see the news today about notes and offering? IS that good or bad for us holders?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh they mean annually but 1.25% per quarter
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it‚Äôs quarterly. And there‚Äôs talk of another special div offer on the table
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The senior notes are not convertible and have a non-dilutive impact on shareholders. While it increases our debt, it also increases our cash and our overall debt is still within target. Good Move"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Uwmc dont own any loans they sell it to third party .....they use this money to leverage their MSR so they can have more power to issue more loan volume
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,[MSR ](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/msr.asp)

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It meant they didn't get added to the Russel index which caused a natural dip as investors sold so short term there was no value we were left bagholding, long term it looks solid analysts rate it 10-12$."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The enforcement is that UWMC will no longer do business with any broker that also does business with Rocket. How aggressively will they be tracking the brokers is anyone's guess right now. It'll be another 5 months before we see the earnings reports from either company to determine the full effect of the ultimatum. But since UWMC closes loans in 1/3 the time and for an average of 15 basis points lower interest, brokers would find it beneficial to stick with UWMC. They can shop around to anyone else that isn't Rocket if they'd like to compare rates. Rocket doesn't seem too worried about it. Time will tell."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Good cause I‚Äôm 8% down lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd love for it to get back to that range just to clear my $9c...  To say nothing of the $11c.

I guess in 2015 or 2016, a lot of ships started going around Africa due to lower fuel costs at that time and even though it added something like 7-10 days of extra transit time, it was still far cheaper than the tolls and saved time and mileage traversing the Suez canal."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"She would be

Disappointed.

Although I have tiny tits too though so if she's a boob girl she'd still be disappointed.  I just realized why I'm single."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It was funny at first but it got old :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Big if true

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,didnt they try to short squeeze a coal miner too?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What is moral hazard?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,No one knows. Everyone is punting. Wear a Brioni suit and you are still just a punter.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, and this time, it‚Äôs NOT ok. I‚Äôll be looking forward to my delicious golden tendies served hot on a silver platter, soon."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Did they break? Why are they letting this air
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're gonna blame us. We have to keep doing positive things in the community, because we definitely are gonna get blamed."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banks are in the business of hiding all the risk they can. They create this ridiculous positions to try to imprint an image of professionalism. When they go tits up, and they will, guess who bails them out? Your taxes. This will NEVER change unless we demand our governments to stop the bailouts. Let those fuckers crash and burn.

This is not just a saying, just go check the list of banks that were bailed out with your money.  I guarantee your bank is either in that list or will be."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Difference is I‚Äôll and most apes payed 1,50$ for a library card where you got free information or a boomer that payed 1,5 mill on an education that don‚Äôt give any advantage to a moron ape, I‚Äôm not educated I‚Äôm inspired, if I‚Äôll was an educated man I‚Äôll be a damn fool."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"He mispronounced, ""this racket."""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Voice does not match the face creeped me out lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it really gambling when you know you‚Äôre going to be bailed out if things get really bad?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop your crazy talk. Ape no like crazy talk. Now I go to therapy
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,when wallstreet does it its being responsible
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ever heard someone say ‚Äúmonkeys in suits‚Äù?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,More financially advise?  What the fuck does that mean?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a ‚Äúfinancial professional‚Äù I have to disagree. 

In fact, many know what they‚Äôre talking about, but they end up losing their personal money anyway. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre a professional or retail trader, the house will eventually win the longer you are at the casino."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the sparkly crayons ‚ú®
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, they're apes wearing monkey masks. Why didn't we think about that?..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Cats don't call on congress to bail them out.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,you should invest in lean hogs
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,that shit is so fugging diverse man.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> There is no skill in banking. It's an ""industry"" full of prom kings.

what the hell am I reading right now. you seriously think bankers are the Chads? lol

there is knowledge and skill in finance. and there are plenty of resources to help the average investor"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. We need to rent some office space on Wall St and set up a brokerage house and all become ""Ape Advisors"" a couple of the smoothest brained apes will have to start off as banana pickers and then work their way up to ""Jr Ape Advisors"". We have to show that we have an internal training program so, we look legit and all, we can't have them thinking we're all crayon dust sniffing fiends. We'll specialize in Yolos (don't worry, we're professionals and know how to mitigate risk) and when we go tits up we'll get bailed out. I overheard a few monkies talking about such a scheme. I'm Ape and can't think crazy shit like that by myself. I call it collaboration because stealing idea like Mark Zuckerberg make Ape feel bad. Ape like to help other apes learn about collaboration."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. whoops.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No insult snek!  They useful, kill vermin!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would go lean hogs, fat chicks and anything in-between. I'm soo fucking hooked I would try to find a market for dead Russian hookers if it would keep me in the green."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. ""former GS traders are two a penny,"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The guys working at Goldman are the chads for sure.

If you're in a Chase branch in Des Moines, you're a retail employee feeding chads. 

Prove me wrong.

Yeah you got me on the skill part. There's also skill in MLM and conning old ladies over the phone. But it's not ""work."""

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, banks are taking the losses.  Hrm."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If those HFs own a lot of Tesla, and sell all of their Tesla to cover loses, then Tesla price drops. 

Has nothing to do with the company itself, only matters how many shares are being sold vs how many are being bought. If supply outweighs demand, the price goes down."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The senior guys - who know it's all BS and just punting - get off on making the wannabes do the reports. Nothing more.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If you watch the Foundry video on Vimeo the sales lead says that word about 10000x
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There's a difference between being a üåàüêª and wanting the market to exist on actual money instead of leveraged funds that are backed by hopes and dreams.  The leverage gotta go, but the actual money can stay and stonks can still go up."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So this shows margin account increases, does it maybe reflect the increase in retail traders through apps and margin accts on robinhood and such?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So. Should we go cash gang?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the only known stock with a negative beta.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep cash on your account to scoop up deals once this market fucking craters.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone get Ja. Find Ja Rule!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He has been saying it for 12 months.... The market is highly overvalued and is setting itself up for a crash. Expectations >>> value/ fundamentals drives the hype
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,JPOW provided infinite liquidity
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,McDoubles have been $1 my entire life. Makes me think inflation isn't real.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've still got my hat in the ring and keeping some cash on the side.

I'd assume this is but one of many dominoes to fall yet."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,cash gang?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, already did that"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao you want the guy who lost all of his 15B of personal wealth to go to jail for losing it? If losing money is now illegal many here are fucked.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs actually inversely related to the general market in some respects. When the market tanks, the big boys have to deleverage some of their holdings due to loss of capital in their long positions. This leads them to close some of their GME shorts, shooting GME upwards when SPY dumps"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Back in your day you could actually afford a house on a high school diploma job. These days you have an MD/PHD and pay rent to the wife's boyfriend cuz you can't get a loan. Damn your old üëçüòÇüòú
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I understand it, he was hiding stock ownership and avoiding reporting limits by doing swaps where the counter party was holding title to the stock but he was at risk for the loss or profit from the gain. Not a lawyer,  but I think that's illegal.  And thank God stupid investments aren't illegal.  I would have done serious time."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm on board with cardboard. They ain't taking my schtonka trucks tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldnt that be true for every other shorted stock too then?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Born in '72 here. I am in cold sweats thinking back to those phone calls ... thanks!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea but we got to see all the good bands.  We got to see them cheap too.  You'd be hard pressed to name a classic rock band we didn't see for less than $10.  Many of them on their very first tours.

70's = classic cars, classic rock, classic clothes, classic tv, even classic porn!  Back before porn was gay midget aliens with smooth brains....no wait."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless you're rentech that is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Shorts will be covered in a down turn however HFs may choose not to cover companies they think will be bankrupted in the next crash and cash out when the chart hits 0$.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a certain nostalgia for the 70s. At least people were real not just teenage trolls on the internet. I have a firm belief that music went to shit with the advancement of technology regarding availability of electronics to young people. The children of the world are just that, children and cannot therefore understand deeper meaning in music and lyrics. Metaphors are above their head and they just jump on a band wagon ( pun intended) pushing crap to the top of the charts. Just today I put on a YouTube playlist for new hip hop releases...... Every song sounded the same. No lyrical ingenuity, no metaphors and derivative as fuck.even the instrumentals and beats are basic af.  I was born too late i think."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't realize they generate enormous fees. I haven't seen them cause I am just a retail dude.

CFD's is what I heard as well. Sounded like goldman started working with hwang cause he was generating too much in fees."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it might have been CFD's? Jury seems out still (bloomberg)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,The bus is pretty reliable.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ahh *67... I remember the first time someone called back. I was shook haha
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, that's what I've read as well.  All very hinky."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,As reliable as a volvo?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you watch the big short? If you have enough money you can ask for anything. 

""I have 12 billion dollars and i want to short the standard deviation of the spy500""  


Goldman rep- ""Yes sir, we will get back to you"""
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, Big Short, Wolf of Wall Street, Boiler Room is one of my favorites, pre-fame Vin Diesel.  And Barbarians at the Gates is underrated."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in for a few months and even got my dad to buy in. Genuinely believe they could compete with FUTU. If it got to those level $100-$200 I‚Äôd be so happy. Good DD OP!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn‚Äôt them buying puts just hedging like any market maker/HEDGE fund does?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so they bought puts before they did a massive dump of shares?  Hmnn nothing illegal about that?  Lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They really need to tack on a few zeros to the fines they give for this type of shit.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Goldman Sachs is so scummy I'm not sure why anybody still does business with them. They consistently fuck their own clients in the ass.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,so goldman was buying puts on their own stock?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,You summarized everything completely in ONE sentence... good job.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Stop wrinkling my brain.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did do that didn't they?

Bought some GS calls today when SP was down... they certainly are a lot of things but ""bagholders""...  they aren't."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok.... lots of stupid wsb kids today... GS was holding the equity position because Archegos had swaps.  So you don‚Äôt even know wtf you‚Äôre talking about to start with.  Putting in a hedge is good for the bank risk management since again - they‚Äôre holding the equity and sold archegos the swap.  You do know what a swap is right?  Is today your first day?  Are you new here?  Why are half of you here?  You‚Äôre mostly incompetent af.  Go home.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not at all what insider trading is
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly I respect and admire that goddamn company. That company has a special place in my heart like that fucking stripper loving executive at Enron who got a court order, through divorce, to sell his Enron holdings before shit hit the fan. No jail time resulted and he got top price.

God bless you pieces of shit. üíï"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They already dumped. That's why they booked the losses.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"While true, timing of such trades could definitely suggest insider trading. Their massive dump last week may have been intended to hide exactly that sort of fuckery. That said, SEC doesn't do shit to GS anyway. So, all of this conjecture is pretty irrelevant."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes Goldman is holding the assets in the TRS but they no doubt increased their hedge just before they liquidated Hwang. Because why wouldn‚Äôt they. 

Thanks mate try again."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs funny seeing the apes here railing against the hedge funds while it was investment bankers who always called the shots
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't know enough about how these sort of operations work, like the true dynamics of the relationship between a prime broker and a fund like the one that blew up in this situation. So I'm going guessing that this was part of the normal risk management procedures. Now the front running after all agreeing to an orderly sell off, that's the Ruthless GS I know and love."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No one is ""railing against hedge funds"".

It's against very specific hedge funds that engage in wide spread criminal activity like Melvin, wolverine, citadel, point72, Maplelane.


Find someone pissing on Bridgewater or renaissance. Go on, show me posts."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs called hedging
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúImpossible to be smarter‚Äù

I‚Äôd phrase it differently. It‚Äôs impossible to more correctly incorporate past information to generate a range of expected future results. 

AI can‚Äôt predict the future, and if there are new fact patterns that it hasn‚Äôt seen before then it‚Äôs predictions can still be wildly wrong.  It is still possible to be smarter."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why learn advanced maths when the computers can do it better and faster?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo Ray Dalio is the GOAT. Too bad their interview process is weird as fuck so I didn't get to work there lol.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My impression is that most of his leverage was in contracts for difference, not holding shares.  The shares he did hold were posted as collateral for margin."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs not insider trading retard
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, wait, the AI that predicted Muskrat de Methe ice cream might not have been right?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who programmes those computers with what?

Computers a good at computing like the name suggests. They are not good at the math underpinning the calculations, I. e. Knowing why they are doing what and what to do next to get which result why."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think that would count to the 5% rule he was trying to hid and did hide  from the SEC.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would AI development allow computers to do everything themselves? I.E. the computers can think for themselves and trade independently from human input. That would be amazing.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not being a previously-convicted hedge fund manager, I'm not sure how these things work."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,By your next update I need you to do some illegal shit and be able to provide updates.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"West coast guy, they've decided to legalize my crimes ü§®"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Planning on removing the grow your own. Also setting it up so his buddies get all the permits. I can't imagine the low quality shit that will be produced.  Missoula is a fantastic area, getting pricey but compared to some West Coast locations you probably wont notice."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oddly WA doesn't allow for homegrown, there should be a model law and regulation that every state follows.

I'm in south Seattle so I should have sufficient equity to do it.  We'll see, real estate around Big Sky (my original plan) is effed up, Jackson Hole and WYO too."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Missoula is pretty bad now. Most homes going for 50-80K above asking price. Median is up to 470ish K. 
If you got a million to drop on a place you can get some amazing places.
I need to find my groove on the market to get to early retirement."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"What about a bit outside of town?  The beauty of being a former glacier stomping ground, the valley is wide and looooong."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how far you want to go outside of town. Its pricey all the way to Hamilton in the south, Ronan to the north and Superior the West and only getting worse.
How soon do you plan on exiting? Also political leaning can affect how you feel about some of these areas. Missoula very liberal in a sea of militia red Q-believers"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I lived in Spokane during Ruby Ridge, I'm familiar with the political dynamic.

I may have gotten priced out, maybe I'll just get a trailer in the desert.  We'll see how my meme stocks play out."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you luck out and don't mind a condo, you might be able to get a 2br/1/5 ba for about 225K. If you are good with reparis its possible to find a fixer upper for less 300K"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fixer upper it is, hold the shiplap."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Strange how the dates are. I tend to try and stay away from everything on 4/1 but this year....
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah don‚Äôt buy calls this week theta will fuck you to climax faster this time
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Absurd
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,More like bad Friday am I right
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll probably beat off and check stocks regardless
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well we can't fuckin eat Chicken Tendies, 'cause it's a Lenten Friday.

All that leaves is work and masturbation."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,hahah I can relate to this.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Call the manager and ask
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Bounce back not happening till liquidation over lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,If that‚Äôs your Thursday what‚Äôs your Saturday?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"So how much longer do we think the liquidation will continue for? I‚Äôm seeing it increase today - short interest per Bloomberg is still 18.64%...

If you are long VIAC you think it‚Äôs worth buying at any price less <$50 a share?  Just curious others thoughts on it

I‚Äôm thinking long term it might get acquired by another media firm"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wouldn't you like to find out ;)
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems hard to beat 50% from peak. I bought in this morning
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have got DISCB instead... damn.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Remember Thor in end game? Pretty similar to that with less clothes and more Colfax hookers.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha Looks like it! I should have bought some of both..
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,DFV now has a contender for godship in WSB

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Biggest lost porn so far
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy is actually my college roommates Uncle. I never understood how he could spend so freely. Was a good friend tho.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So... how does his loss porn rate?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,he‚Äôll be ok he can take 3k in losses per year off his taxes
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,So you are telling me its a good Idea to buy the BIDU dip ?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good fucking lord, Chinese markets are like open PVP area. Shit just goes down there immediately, anyone old enough to remember $LK?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Because with small dick energy like that he wouldn‚Äôt have gotten to a billion in the first place.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin call the movie lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's funny because 'Son' can mean 'loss' in Japanese: Êêç
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,They took him off the site now lol
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Average up or bust. This is WSB
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"pretty sure he rolled up and out instead

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit balls. ME TOO. Second generation gay here, and those FotF bastards basically indoctrinated a whole branch of my family. Turned them into weapons of hate telling me my respective family was gonna burn in the fires of hell for all eternity. For the last 30 years. Why am I not surprised their money management guru was an admitted, convicted criminal."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes. Because WSB martinis taste like pee
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"didn't the internal do almost 100% ? 

I don't think it is a ponzi the two funds are just entirely different. The one that is down is just a boomer equity holding fund. 

Simmon's cash cow fund uses all the quantitative shit and manages a much smaller amount of money allowing it to exploit things all across the markets (bonds, fx, small cap, etc. ) without being as limited by position sizing. The position sizing thing is why he bought out all of the earlier investors. 

Not much point in ponziing your own money"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Medallion is small I think they cap at $10B? They found if they got too big they couldn't execute and it exposed them to risks

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. The bald goblin finally realized it's more fun to pull the strings behind the scenes without having the accountability as CEO.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Can‚Äôt bleed a turnip.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when you owe the bank $20 billion
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,He was. They removed him like a month ago :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,2 months ago :(
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"This story isn‚Äôt over.  We need the postmortem for this clusterfuck.  Who else went under with him?  Have a feeling a few well-to-do Korean-American families who also thought the church was the way to riches, are now speechless."

Late 2008 was the bottom, and ANYONE who bought into the market at the bottom is now a very rich man.

You NEVER sell at the bottom, you buy into it. If you didn't heed the warnings in 2007, you had to buy in during 2008 to lower your average cost while eating humble pie about how the ""bears were wrong""."

https://m.economictimes.com/markets/stocks/news/wealthy-facing-margin-calls-show-pitfalls-of-pledged-shares/articleshow/74732173.cms

There were lots of other articles leading up to Friday. And on Friday AM pre-market, I believe an article on SA mentioned the share auction by GS.

They cannot ‚Äòimmediately‚Äô execute stock sales of this magnitude. It‚Äôs not a ‚Äòsnap your fingers‚Äô and all your stock is sold sort of process, they need to find enough buyers. When blocks of this size hit the market, they always lose a ton in the process of dumping shares. The loss during the sale is amplified by the number of shares. The more shares you have to move, the more selling pressure it creates, and the stock usually craters in the process. 

For instance on this particular margin call, Credit Suisse (and other creditors) dumped an absolute shit ton of ViacomCBS, which is now down by about 50% in the past 4 trading days. They were losing money all the way down, as they continued to sell at lower and lower prices."

One could trade this with confidence. The other couldn't.

I wanted to buy bidu but had no way of knowing whether there is some scandal about to blow, or if it was gonna get delisted as some bazinga or motley fool articles were saying. If I knew it's dropping cause a fund was getting liquidated I'd go all in and make a killing. 

It's not about ER numbers and market reaction. It's about real time immediate knowledge of whether something is a crisis or a blip. 

It's the context that made the difference.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been trying to do as much research on options as possible, but applying this knowledge I've received from videos/reading isn't translating over to when I'm actually buying these options on my app. It sounds so easy then I see the options chain and start wondering why wouldn't I just pick the longest expiration date (is it just the increase in premium?) and in that case can I exercise at any time before expiration? What if I can't afford the exercise? How do I just sell the option? So many questions and I'm tempted to just buy an AMC call at $10 to expire next month or something to test it all out, but then, if it's currently trading at $10, what's stopping me from buying an option with a strike of $8 and exercising immediately? I feel dumber for having asked that question but seriously, the best way for me to learn is by trial and error, this is just too risky to do that with though, and simulators just don't do it for me."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Answered in other comments friend. The shareholder lawsuits are worthless IMO, and the Lavvan lawsuit is a risk but I think it's likely to get settled out of court for a fraction of the headline number. It also only relates to cannabis which is not a significant part of AMRS's business yet - so a bit of a stretch for Lavvan to claim huge damages when their isn't much evidence to support that AMRS got much benefit from their partnership at all

On dilution - the strategic transactions mentioned in the DD are a validation of the company's business model - they generate a significant amount of up front cash as well as recurring revenues over a multi-year period. This is huge as it allows the company to raise cash from operations instead of diluting existing investors by raising new money. Prior to these deals, AMRS didn't have a sustainable business model to go along with with its incredible technology. The strategic transactions will provide proof that they can monetize their tech and end the years of significant dilution"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Notice the disclosure at the bottom of the piece?

""Disclosure: I am/we are short AMRS.""

As pointed out in the DD, this is a turnaround story that really began in November 2020. That is a big part of why the opportunity exists. You just have to decide if you believe it or not."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like the response given in the stocktwits board this morning. It went something like this:

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha yep!
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thank you for sending these. If you look at the company's history, they struggled for a long time with the more complex stuff (biofuels, etc) before focusing on the more simple niches. I particularly love that they are have leaned into the high-margin consumer channels - what they've done with Biossance is particularly inspiring. PureCane has huge potential (think it needs some branding work) and Pipette just needs to gain a wider audience. The others in the pipeline are also fantastic. 

The retail channels make them less dependent on monetizing molecules with industrial counterparties as their consumer brands continue to gain scale, they will inevitably lead to significant cash flow generation. The balance sheet continues to improve as the overhang from equity dilution continues to be cleaned up while the top-line on the income statement will continue to gain steam. Any leftover excess capital will be reinvested in the business and the technology, allowing them to circle back to the more complex and world-changing applications you alluded to. All in all, what an exciting time"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"good luck retard, I¬¥m in with the same (10 25$)"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem sir. Love this company and happy to try to help. It's a complicated story with lots happening, enjoy the ride!"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think its fair to think they're partially priced in but the market also discounts stocks that have failed to deliver in the past. So if they don't deliver i think they tank. If they do deliver than I think it's fair to say that the stock price will react positively to the delivered expectations. That's why this is inherently riskier play than other already risky options. They have shown in the past that they can't be relied on to act in the stock owners best interest. However, the DD is trying to say that ***THIS*** time they will actually deliver and there will be tendies for everyone"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gotcha. Not all of these are necessarily applicable to AMRS, but I generally use a handful of tools for investment research. The most valuable to me by far is BamSEC. There is no better way to track, analyze, and read up on public companies in my opinion. Another one I use a bunch is Koyfin, which is free (crazy - it's insanely useful). I can't recommend it enough. I also read a significant amount of equity research both from professionals (get BofA for free through my Merrill Edge accounts, Morningstar, ValueLine, etc) and also amateurs on forums like Seeking Alpha or online communities like StockTwits (awesome AMRS community) + a few others

Lots of data to sort through when first starting out, but looking up definitions and figuing out how the number affect one another is essential to getting a deeper understanding of what to look for. You can get a good feel of how things look for companies in different sectors and start to see similarities and differences between them. You‚Äôll probably find some oddities faster than you would expect and can look in the news or 10-k for explanations."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Timelines tend to get moved when you can cut the biggest line item in the budget by a factor of three or four. Starship will be that much cheaper.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"> We have no idea if there's a real market for Starship.  

Starship will probably be cheaper than Falcon 9 both in terms of cost per kg \*and\* in absolute terms. There's a huge market even if that isn't the case, as long as they can get Starship below $100m per launch. Even if launch demand doesn't pick up, at $100m per launch they can merge missions that would normally go on multiple Falcon 9 flights, or bundle them with Starlink missions and have much higher margins on their launches. They can't do that now with Falcon Heavy due to the fairing size. Why do you think they aren't launching Starlink on Falcon Heavy even though it's cheaper on a cost per kg basis?

Starship is going to consume the entire commercial launch market when it's up and running, and eventually most government contracts as well. I have no doubts about this. The question for Rocket Lab is, what do they provide that makes it worth paying three or four times as much for a launch?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I have made a huge mistake.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure where the floor is on this, but listening to that call gave me zero short term confidence (and I really love their designs). Long term I can understand their thinking, but there are some huge questions. Who will be their manufacturing partner and what will that deal look like? Since they now want to handle manufacturing themselves long term, how much is it going to cost to build a factory and how long will that take? If they don‚Äôt already have a manufacturing partner, are they going to be able to stay on track for delivering vehicles in 2022? They didn‚Äôt even get into how the chip shortage is currently affecting them, so how likely are delays in the production schedule? Yes, they have a decent amount of cash on hand, but if they‚Äôre going to eventually take on manufacturing themselves won‚Äôt they need to raise more capital? Since they got rid of their engineering services, when will they be taking in revenue? Talking about strong demand for the MPDV in Europe made me nervous. That‚Äôs a 2023 vehicle, and without knowing what their manufacturing deal is, it‚Äôs fair to ask if they can build and deliver vehicles to Europe at scale to meet demand. They talked about interest from TNCs, but the statements were extremely vague, and it‚Äôs hard to imagine the interest was that strong when they can‚Äôt meaningfully say when they can start production. My feeling was Tony‚Äôs focus was more on the pickup and the MPDV. The lifestyle vehicle is supposed to be their first release. That makes me feel like there isn‚Äôt much demand for it at this point in time (the website primarily highlights the truck and MPDV as well). 

The executive turn over and lack of communication to investors are also huge red flags. My take away from investor relations not communicating is they don‚Äôt fucking know what to say because there isn‚Äôt a concrete plan in place. It could also be why Tony was telling investors to call him directly. It‚Äôs easier for Tony to spin things if he‚Äôs the one handling the communication. 

Until their manufacturing partnership is announced this is fucked. Without that information there‚Äôs no reason to believe they‚Äôll be able to produce and deliver vehicles within the next two years. 

Only thing I can do is pray they announce something big before April 16th. Fuck"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Proper fucked
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I think he did the right thing for the company. Investors paid 200million for intellectual property that was being sold for pennies to a competitor... They literally just charged for the engineers time...  what people are paying for now is the inexperience of the previous management, toby wouldn't have walked away from the Hyundai deal if it was good

Additionally everyone that was replaced in upper management was replaced with people with more experience... This is bullish and a sign that those people are willing to place their careers in a startup.


Tony took the harder road on Earnings and for longs that will pay 100x.  Literally everything he said was legit... And I think Institutions will I best especially if he announces manufacturing partner... That might be hurried up now to prevent the floor from completely falling out... 


This started out as a short Squeeze bear hunt for me but I ended up falling in love... I should have sold at 16 and bought warrants today...

Today effectively cleaned out most of my account I'll post loss porn later perhaps."

I wanted something greater from hyundai but I am extremely bullish about Tony's ability to bring this home... I think the hard changes he's made show institutional investors that they can trust him..."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,This will hurt bad. What a complete shit show that CC was.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not sure how to respond at open. Were full on drill team 6 right now. I liked the company and the vehicles/tech but this is hard to watch after that call.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nope, just when my calls are set to expire! 

The real play on this now are shares/warrants if you believe in Tony‚Äôs ability to create a successful long term strategy. There are still positives here (lots of cash on hand, thoughtfully designed product, cost efficient design). But until there‚Äôs more concrete information there‚Äôs still a lot of risk."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"There seems to be a lot of similarities in both Arrival and Canoo, their business model and manufacturing process now seems identical, even their websites are basically the same... I can see them combining to be honest, GOEV on the consumer/light enterprise and Arrival on the heavy commercial side, match made in heaven?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I just ended up buying more GOEV stock yesterday and then it tanked, feels bad! So right now I have a decent long position and if I sold right now, I would take 35% hit.

But with there new strategy, revenue generation happens at a later date because they would not be counting on engineering consulting and only on selling EVs, heck even subscription model is out, don't you think? 

I am thinking about getting May $10 calls, why are you buying warrants?"

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Well I‚Äôm gona pretend like I lost all my money on goev and lay Low for 2 weeks
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,what's with the slaughter during premarket now?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens in April? Are they planning to announce something?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Why? Did you read the part where Hyundai bwas just paying for the engineers time vs for the intellectual property?  Straight up walking away from that was the right thing to do
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok that makes sense. I am debating whether to get $10 calls for May or August, at least profit from some upside movement, if any. 

I am long in GOEV with 251 shares and so far they have been disappointing. There vehicles look cool, but since they don't have there own production they do not control there destiny."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what ? 
There is another common things 

The only 2 EV , Hyundai invested"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would buy warrants if I had any money lol because they are essentially like long term options..  the subscription model is just being moved to the bracket of ""it won't make us the most money we need to figure out b2b fleet stuff first and then crack that egg"" 

The only way that the engineering thing made sense was if it produced them royalties which it doesn't seem like it did.. there's literally no way Hyundai bent that far over for Canoo..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,It's huge... And again I credit tony for violently unfucking the previous managements lack of business acumen so we can move on... He does now need to save the stock price as it will be very pivitoal to the eventual direct offering needed to pay for the Factory...
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,I should have split them before earnings and bought puts to benifit either way. but no Im out.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, me too I still have 17 days for my calls to mean something...  Well see"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs because of the change in leadership and direction. Seems to be a good move for the company but not what hyped it and so is concerning for investors.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That I do agree with. But 

The problems as I see it, and these are short term:
- CEO not present
- Total pivot
- EV is in the shit for now in general, sentiment around SPAC also.

I cant really see any positivity that this will result in. Maybe my 40Cs are fine for august but my April calls are gone. 30k away. bye bye.

I want this stock to rocket, but I cant really see it right now."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah this makes it sound that they are quite a ways before they can deliver vehicles. Did Tony say in call yesterday that they are still on track to deliver vehicles in 2022?

Good point about warrants! Do you know when GOEV warrants will expire or would have to be exercised?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Where have I heard that before?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe, honestly I think I institutions looked at the long term approach of Tony and saw that it was different.. Tony basically said the previous management didn't know what they were doing, the IP of the company is great, and oh here's my team of solid rock stars to turn this into a great performing company. Institutions would 100 percent rather you delay a manufacturing announcement than get the shitshow deal that Fisker got...  I honestly think if I 17 mil short at 16 I would be fucking nervous right now... 

I do wish I had may calls to be honest"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a /u/planereflection question about warrants...

Yes they are on time  because contract manufacturing will be the bridge to ramp..."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would love if institutions went it. Hope you're right, we'll see. 

I mean this stock have gone down 27-30% the last 2 weeks. I wonder where the bottom is."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/pchampn - Warrants expire in 2025. They can call earlier if GOEV trades over $18 for 20 of 30 trading days. At that point, the warrants will be over twice what they are today (around $7)."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you visited papa Manpreet on Twitter?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Could they use warrants to pay for factory?
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks!  /u/planereflection and  /u/BrotherLuminous 

Several of you are referring to April 16 or generally April. Are you expecting some news from Canoo next month?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you mind elaborating more on this? Thank you sir.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have not, good?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt believe the warrants can. They can have an offering to raise additional capital. However, seeing they have $700m+ in cash, there‚Äôs no need for an offering at this time. To put in perspective, $RIDE bought their factory for $20m."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Warrants are like LEAPs. They allow you to buy one share for $11.50, until 2025. If GOEV is say $20, warrants would have an intrinsic value of $8.50 ($20 - $11.50 = $8.50) + time value. Compare this to calls, a November $12.50 call is currently $1.65. It has a higher strike, shorter expiry, and not much less (currently $2.75 per warrant).

Having covered GOEV since August, calls have been incredibly difficult to time. Warrants on the other hand, have been much more stable and don‚Äôt have the risk of expiring worthless (soon, anyways). 

Key difference between warrants and calls is that warrants ultimately dilute the commons, whereas calls don‚Äôt. You can‚Äôt write options on warrants. You also can‚Äôt purchase them on Robinhood or WeBull. Warrants can be called earlier by the company, but at that point, you would‚Äôve atleast doubled your money (from here), so you can‚Äôt really complain."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also, where do you get the $11.50 from?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not too much into TA, but yeah if he's right then Im all for it and a super happy person. :>"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"The $11.50 was from the SEC filings. As a word of caution, other SPACs gives the right for a fraction of a share, whereas $GOEVW allows 1 share for 1 warrant. The only way to know is to dig into the SEC filings. I really like warrants because they allow similar leverage like calls (especially once GOEV > $18) without the terrible theta burn. For example, when GOEV is $30 (323%), GOEVW would be $18.50 (642%)."

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"My question is, what's to stop Trulieve, Curaleaf, etc. who already have a lot of locations in major markets from just opening their stores to selling other products?"
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing at all. That's the point though. 

Let's say they have to give up 40% of shelf space to other brands. First, that's 40% across all 70+ stores. That's going to add up quickly, and they are going to have an excess of product to move. 

As long as they are both heavily retail and heavily wholesale, I doubt many other retail stores are going to be eager to carry Trulieve products. Why would you? Why carry a brand tied to a competitor's retail store over another brand that has no retail and is wholesale only. Especially if you're located near a Trulieve location. That wholesaler is on your side. They want customers in YOUR door, where their products are. See what I'm getting at? 


So selling 1,000,000sqft of grow space is easy when you monopolize the stores **and** the products in those stores. It isn't easy when you lose your monopoly on both. They are far too over built for a competitive state level legal market, and they will be a USA version of an LP by being over built for their current day market, while praying for the future market (US national market) to open up and save their asses. 

At least LPs have a global market like the EU (expected to have **more** long term potential than the US, per Curaleaf) and Mexico (coming soon) to tackle while everyone waits on US politicians to get the job done."
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude what's to stop Trulieve from selling different brands at their stores once it's totally legal? They have the locations, people are used to going there, they'd be happy to see other brands available at their local dispensary."

I am a fucking 15 years old kid  
When my reddit account was created i bet my life savings to GME, it was only 2k, i ask my mom if i can do stocks, she just give me a yes, she doesnt know what a stock is, or if the thing she sign was a contract with a broker or a marriage document.  
At that day i bought 7 shares of gme around the 260 a share, next day i wake up and see that gme was going to the fucking moon, i dont remember how much a share was at that point, i just remember how 5 minutes later GME was going to THE FUCKING FLOOR, so as a noob trader with gme being my first stock i sold my 7 shares and lose 1k, at that point i reconsider and decided to buy again, at that point i just can buy 4 shares, so i did, i didnt have more cash so i started saving money again and 3 or 4 days ago when gme went to 120 a share i down my position and buy another 3 shares again to have my fucking 7 shares.  
Now i am just waiting to watch each share at 200k and buy a girlfriend or something.  
Wish me luck

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Nonsense. You have no idea what you're talking about. Don't believe everything you read.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"How did it go down? Did she stand up and announce she was pissing herself because the bathrooms are so far away? 

Look, idk what's the story, and I'm not sure your brother in law does. Needless to say, no place is perfect and in such a big company it's inevitable that there'll be some horrible managers, too. 

But some people prefer to hold in any complaints they have until they implode. Amazon is really not a good place for office drones; it has a DIY vibe and tends to reward folks with backbone who work hard to fix broken shit. That's true for Corporate as well as FC. 

FCs are run by folks a few years out of MBA, mostly great people but lack the experience. Which makes it all the more crucial that employees engage with their managers and work together to address issues rather than expect Bezos to come over and change their diaper, or the union fairy to get them free unicorns.

03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,Earnings changed to tomorrow after close and it went down 7% so far today.
03/30/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure! I'm still pretty new to this as my post suggests (only started back in late November), so some of this advice might be incomplete, but I'll do my best.

1. Always, ALWAYS save money for dips. If you think that it won't drop lower and wanna go all in, definitely don't. Think of how many times a stock ""dips."" So many times. The chance that you actually hit the lowest point, esp. when the stock market has been trading sideways these past two months, is very little. Stocks don't just go up. They will pullback at some point for you to buy the dip again.
2. If a stock ran up already, NEVER FOMO. There will always be more plays. And if you like a stock that has had a bull run and want to hold it for long, wait for the pullback. It will happen at some point, and the longer the bull run, generally the greater chance it will have a pullback soon. Even if you miss the boat, again, it will dip back at some point, and there are other plays to get in on as well.
3. Do NOT buy off of margin when the market is trading sideways or in deep shit. (Some would even say to minimize your margin as much as possible or never buy off margin. It's helpful though if you feel really confident about a play and are still waiting on some cash.) I would've lost only like...20% if I had not used the margin I was using at the start of February. It's just too risky. You can use margin if you're confident that the market is bullish, but it's still risky. Be aware of when the risks outweight the potential rewards.
4. Valuations are actually very important. Pls, for the love of God, DO YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND CONSIDER HOW MUCH A STOCK HAS GONE UP ALREADY as well as how the current price compares to revenue, company forecasts, other things. Oh yeah, and take price/revenue estimates with a MASSIVE grain of salt. Do they seem realistic given the current state of the company and its future plans?
5. HOLD if you like the stock for good reason. Do not be afraid to hold. If the stock seems overvalued and is no longer a valuable investment, then you should sell. But if a stock plummets off of little news or only something relatively minor, and if that doesn't change how you feel about the investment in the long run, then just hold. I've sold things countless times for a loss or for only small gains, only to see it  run up afterwards. And this has probably happened more often than I've sold and avoided a loss. 
6. Be wary of survivorship bias and response bias. These are very common here on Reddit and throughout investing circles. Stocks don't always go up (even if the US market as a whole generally does), and many have killed themselves over bad trades. There is a lot to learn from the winners as well as the losers. 
7. Take what ANYBODY says with a grain - no, a pile of salt. Do your own research and trust that first, because who knows what kinda motivations are behind what somebody says, or how much they may or may not know. Follow up on certain claims ppl make. Don't just listen to empty words and sentiment, and this goes for both bullish and bearish sentiments. 

I also have a lot of advice regarding specific types of stocks. Feel free to PM me if you're interested!"

DFV's Potential profits from his 16th Apr $12 Calls. I know Warden was saying he's only holding for a statement to keep retail motivated, but this is only partially true in my opinion. (RISK/REWARD) Implied volatility turbo charges the theta on these options. With current Implied volatility he'll still profit $14M if it only goes to $320 per share by 4/16 expiration. If something crazy happens and it goes to $780, he'll make approximately $37M plus."
