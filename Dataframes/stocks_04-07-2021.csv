2021-04-07 19:59:19,stocks,I feel the future is priced in right now. It may grow into its evaluation eventually but holding a stagnant fund deprives you of making gains with that money.
2021-04-07 19:56:21,stocks,"What am I reading?

Why exclude other Reits? what’s special about these 3?  Why segregate these from the multitude of REITs?"
2021-04-07 19:59:23,stocks,"You’re reading “Manufactured Homes REIT Sector Overview”, by NAREIT classification. They list only those 3 as Manufactured Home REITs."
2021-04-07 19:23:39,stocks,LMT is better imo
2021-04-07 19:47:24,stocks,BOY! (for my GOW fans that also invest)
2021-04-07 19:49:33,stocks,"Been there, done that. A few months ago they were “big” too-they even got a contract but still barely anything moved."
2021-04-07 19:16:18,stocks,U.S. has no desire to work with them. I know personally.
2021-04-07 19:45:40,stocks,They literally design the unmanned aircraft used DARPA’s Gremlin program. Like what???
2021-04-07 19:38:23,stocks,So who then
2021-04-07 19:57:29,stocks,That technology has been around for years. Much larger defense companies in the US are more advanced. I’m not providing any other details.
2021-04-07 19:46:10,stocks,See my comment to him. He’s wrong. DARPA is already working with Kratos.
2021-04-07 19:42:28,stocks,I have no idea who wants to use them. I just know no one in the US wants anything to do with them.
2021-04-07 18:47:14,stocks,"I got in at 30 expecting a ramp up before the test flight just like in February, just be on the lookout for any news, should they delay this test again, imo, the stock will hit new lows in record time. So long as it flatlines its been decent for CC's."
2021-04-07 19:54:23,stocks,"My gut feeling based on what the rest of private space is doing tells me this is dead in the water. I might be wrong, but a quarter of a million USD is a lot of money to pay for a brief couple of moments above the karman line. Kinda limits your customer base. If you have that kind of money there's probably going to be better alternatives down the road"
2021-04-07 19:29:09,stocks,"I’m in at 17 and now at 29.50. Feels like $50 is legitimately in play if the May test flight happens. More import of its successful. If it fails, could be back to the low teens."
2021-04-07 18:34:49,stocks,"pls fly again

SPCE should run up again as they approach their next test flight.  A successful one and it could definitely hit $60 again.  If they ever get Bronson into space and back alive you could even say ""the sky's the limit"" for SPCE stock price.

They also hovered in the teens last year so if that May flight is delayed would not shock me to see sub $20 again."
2021-04-07 18:50:01,stocks,I like it and am long term too. Also got UFO cuz that is fun. I’ve heard that someone is building a space hotel with an opening in 2027?? Anyways lots of fun stuff happening in space
2021-04-07 19:51:35,stocks,"Seems like they will fly in May, what I don’t get is why there is such a large gap between the May test flight and when commercial flights start in early 2022.  But maybe I am over analyzing it"
2021-04-07 19:57:28,stocks,"If it’s up and running by next year they will be the only option if you want a space experience.  While yes $250k seems high, if one wanted to go to the ISS via a Russian rocket costs $50 million"
2021-04-07 19:24:07,stocks,"I think there has been a marked change over the last few months.  Last year you could easily gauge the interest in SPA Cs and meme stocks by the ""excitement"" on social media like Reddit subs.   Now the signal-to-noise ratio has plummeted in a morass of pumping and dumping, bot activity, conspiracy nutters, etc.  I tend to think you would need to combine social media activity with other signals, and timeliness is probably paramount."
2021-04-07 19:07:18,stocks,"Sell covered calls. Sell them as much as you can, and always so that if they hit, you made some profit. Reinvest the gains in stocks you wouldn’t mind owning. Sell covered calls on those too.

Even if it ends up with you selling the shares, you made money. This is not for bag holding stocks that are speculative, this is a middle ground play.

Retail traders love options."
2021-04-07 19:44:15,stocks,"momentum trading is buying up, to sell higher and that's the only strategy that will work. it requires a lot of capital and discipline and technical analysis know how."
2021-04-07 19:01:43,stocks,"1) stocktwit is just bots meaning its just conformation bias

2) retail traders have no power. it's all instutituions and algos controlling the market"

2021-04-07 18:45:43,stocks,Isn’t that basically what $BUZZ is doing?
2021-04-07 18:50:18,stocks,"The best way is to just be hands on and browse the internet yourself. Surf the suggested videos on YouTube and check what YT's algorithms are suggesting to the average investor. If something is trending on Twitter, you might not be early, but you probably aren't late either as long as it's still trending. There are pump and dump telegram groups with hundreds of thousands of members, and of course Wallstreet bets

&#x200B;

I don't really like investing with this outlook because it's more inline with pyramid scheming and pump and dumps. You aren't really investing in anything other than hype."
2021-04-07 19:22:11,stocks,"Point #2 feels off-base to me. Even if institutions and algos control the market, they tend to take advantage of retail traders, meaning that they're taking into account what retail traders are doing (this includes inversing retail) and thus retail traders have a measurable effect on the market (even if it's a 3rd party relation happening as a result of algos reacting to retail traders)."
2021-04-07 19:18:05,stocks,"I more or less agree, but those institutions and algos also happen to be part of the process that retails traders rely on to execute their trades and could very well amplify trends in retail, giving retail a roundabout amount of added influence."
2021-04-07 19:16:10,stocks,From what I understand $BUZZ is trading on monthly sentiment which feels a bit too wide-reaching to pick up on social sentiment reliably. Even GME which still has a bit of conversation surrounding it would have been most reliably traded within a 2-week period.
2021-04-07 19:19:47,stocks,I think there's a line between social sentiment momentum trading and P&D because the social sentiment can be based on actual fundamentals or changes to the company that were brought into the spotlight by long term holders. The question is how can you use sentiment to your benefit to pick up on major company moves after they've become likely but before people are taking profits on the priced-in news. It's basically the difference between making one massive 5-years-in-the-making trade vs 200 smaller 2-weeks-in-the-making-trade.
2021-04-07 19:44:29,stocks,">I think there's a line between social sentiment momentum trading and P&D because

Your explanation is more of a virtue signal justifying it rather than defining how trading based on social media hype is different than trading a pyramid pump. I think they are very similar concepts and quite possibly the exact same concept just repackaged."
2021-04-07 18:45:52,stocks,"Stop buying dips without confirmation of an uptrend, otherwise you'll be digging a deeper grave everytime"
2021-04-07 17:58:46,stocks,What’s the symbol?
2021-04-07 17:59:31,stocks,"When your vision or plan has gone to shit, it’s a good sign youre chasing loses. If you find yourself buying to only average down, you’re better off not. Just my opinion"
2021-04-07 18:04:40,stocks,This sounds like me when I’m thinking about my 400 shares of AMWL @ 29.7.  SMFH
2021-04-07 18:20:06,stocks,"You should have a plan/goal for the stock: *Why* did you buy it?    

When you wind up in this situation, go DD and figure out what is going wrong, and if your plan/goals still holds. Test your own thought process for buying the stock. If facts have changed, or you feel like you made errors buying it to begin with: Sell, otherwise hold.   

Typically, I've sold because new facts have come to light, or I re-evaluated *why* I purchased it (e.g. FOMO) and realized I fucked up."
2021-04-07 18:49:01,stocks,Isn’t that really a personal thing? I put stop losses on my stocks at a percent I’m comfortable with and keep adjusting it as it grows.
2021-04-07 19:16:09,stocks,Depends on the stock
2021-04-07 18:51:32,stocks,""" When do you know when to realize loss and cut it out of your portfolio? "" This depends on your risk tolerance. Why is the stock down today? Is it bad news? Investors taking profits? Overpriced? Point is, you need to make a strategic and educated decision. The market is probably one of the most dynamic structures you will ever come across. It all comes down to planning an proper entry and exit strategy. Never invest money that you have not done you're own DD on and made a plan for."
2021-04-07 19:41:42,stocks,"Check the balance sheet.  If I feel it's a systemic issue and the company isn't making revenue - then you could cut it out.  But i don't like taking a loss and usually wait for better days.  

If it's making some money or just in a rough sector taking a hit.  I look at its performance relative to its primary index (superimpose the charts).  If it moves with the index but with a significant negative slope, it's got stink on it.  Same if there's significant insider selling or low volume (lack of interest).   It could be a decent company that's has lost its popularity for awhile.  


An example: DOCU (Docusign).   Makes money, it's just not popular right now."
2021-04-07 18:51:04,stocks,Just commit to a percent allocation
2021-04-07 19:40:24,stocks,"Your few words say so much. Take the upvote. 

A dip without a bottom is just throwing money at a problem mindlessly. Technical analysis can identify support and resistance but you need to see these levels hold. 

If the stocks drop and immediately recover, you missed nothing. If the stock drops but continues to drop it has to find a new level before you get the green light to invest more. 

Look at NIO MRNA ALB and QCOM to name a few. I can’t find a good entry point to trade. They are all over the place. 

What do I need to invest $10k right now! Make a Watchlist and invest at the right entry point in the future."

2021-04-07 18:29:10,stocks,"I've been downvoted a lot for saying this before: But averaging down is largely a lie we tell ourselves to *feel better*.   

The average on your ***individual lots*** within a holding have individual prices and individual value, when you sell they are either a gain or a loss. The average is a useful quick **summary**, but people treat it like a **trading strategy**.  The average as info is useful, the average as a trading strategy is suicide.        

You should buy more in red for exactly one reason: You believe in the underlying, and think you're getting it at a *discount*.    

Buying for the sake of changing your average *alone* is utterly insane, and you're trading on feelings. Averaging down teaches people to increase their risk exposure to a failing investment, instead of going back to fundamentals and re-evaluating/testing their assumptions."
2021-04-07 18:04:03,stocks,Exactly. Suck it up and hold.
2021-04-07 18:08:19,stocks,Hang in there man 🙌🏻 what comes down must come up
2021-04-07 18:36:45,stocks,"Yeah I get downvoted when I comment risk adverse things which I think is completely ridiculous. But it’s true, averaging down to just average down changes nothing in the long run because you’re just throwing more money into a losing position, on the very rare chance it jumps up higher than ever before. It’s insane to me. I will only average down in companies I truly believe in long term and when I do average down, I double the size of my position. No room to be fucking around with lots that have terrible cost basis. Keeping it simple and keeping it sweet."
2021-04-07 18:47:25,stocks,I disagree. Averaging down can be a very valuable tool. Let me give you the latest example of how it helped me. I purchased RMO at $33. Terrible decision. It tanked. I averaged down at $15 to get a cost basis of $27. Continues to dip. I finally averaged down hard at $8ish to get a cost basis of $13. Yesterday It jumped up to $13.60 and I sold all at a small profit. That is how DCA works
2021-04-07 18:10:01,stocks,Nice sentiment but as far as market is concerned that’s not necessarily true. Look at Cisco at its peak near 2000 and see how long it took for the share price to recover despite the business being much more robust in that timeframe.
2021-04-07 18:09:39,stocks,Heavy bags indeed but I’m holding to the bitter end
2021-04-07 19:00:15,stocks,"You spent all that money, time and stress, for a 60 cent gain. Opportunity costs outweigh that gain.."
2021-04-07 18:52:43,stocks,"Yeah there's a lot of people here that assume that since the stock market as a whole eventually goes back up, that all stocks eventually go back up. That's just not true, there are tons and tons of stocks that hit all time highs then crash and stay there. And it's not just speculative companies, look at GE, Exelon, AT&T, and Macy's, and those are just the companies I can think of off the top of my head"
2021-04-07 19:57:45,stocks,"I’ve been bag holding FL and SIX for over a year. Covered calls at my purchase price really helped me profit on these stocks. And I think I am about to be out soon with profit. 

I agree with your strategy and tenacity but try to incrementally improve your position with CC’s (covered calls). 

Options can enhance your stock trading. And help you claw back. 

Good luck trading."
2021-04-07 19:03:06,stocks,No you’re not understanding. My goal wasn’t to buy rmo at $33 and have it tank. But shit happens. If I didn’t DCA I would still be holding the bag on RMO with a cost basis of $33; which it’ll probably never go back to. So instead of taking a loss or holding the bag for years I was able to unload without losing

2021-04-07 18:14:31,stocks,"Yahoo finance does have an feature where you can create a portfolio. Within a portfolio you can select what stocks you have and then add lots to the each of them. They do have some integration with exchanges, but I'm not sure which ones. Most likely you will be manually entering all of the data though, so I am not sure if that is fully what you would want to do.   


If someone does have something that is a little more automated, I would be interested to know as well. I have Mint as well, and it is a good summary overview of totals for me."

2021-04-07 17:47:06,stocks,it's not gonna effect their bottom and top line so not sure why the market would care
2021-04-07 17:58:14,stocks,"Yeah. A lot of hullaballoo was made about the hack. Nothing happened. Nobody stopped using Facebook, in fact, if all your info that was supposed to be protected got out there, what risk could there possibly be to continue using Facebook?"
2021-04-07 19:02:21,stocks,Market didn't care about the news. In fact FB's up 8% since it happened

2021-04-07 17:46:49,stocks,Doesn’t matter
2021-04-07 18:10:16,stocks,This news is years old and a majority if it was gathered straight from user's profiles that they publically posted.  The rest was actually hacked.

2021-04-07 17:56:43,stocks,"My take: The market rode the hype up on anything renewable with hype that Biden was going to pump money in to transitioning, but even in the most optimistic scenario the stocks rose years worth of growth in a few months and are now correcting. Depending the name, there looks like room for more near term downside."
2021-04-07 19:23:17,stocks,"I’m sticking w/ clean energy that has already established themselves as capable of generating revenue and profit. The valuations on those will fluctuate as well, but their longer term upward trends (AMRC, CWEN, TPIC) will ultimately prevail. Without a realistic and developing path to profitability (looking at you, PLUG/FCEL/WKHS), the future is very much a wild card."
2021-04-07 17:47:42,stocks,"Nice analysis, yeah I bought up a bunch of green energy at the February peak and I’m still hurting from it. I think it’s still a nice play long term, but I have been buying at dips and then selling at only a small % over my cost basis because I believe it will be stagnant for a while yet and always subject to market dips when I can buy back in. 

Generally though I still have a ton of shares and I wouldn’t mind if they shot up next week."
2021-04-07 18:59:25,stocks,"Renewables had a huge run before biden was elected, then when he was elected it put them into overdrive. A lot of renewables have yet to fall to their October levels and as you pointed out they are a bit more sensitive to rising interest rates than other growth stocks, so in the short term there could be a bit of downside. I'm still long on a few names though as renewables have a good future ahead of them."
2021-04-07 18:03:28,stocks,"Yeah, that's my worry too. I had started investing in renewables months before, so was surprised by the wave. But as mentioned in the original post, the fundamentals for green energy are more sound than ever. If this has all been about politics, then both the rise and the fall are based on the wrong info imo."
2021-04-07 17:51:41,stocks,"Same. I've been thinking a lot about how buyers of Amazon would have been in the red for 10 years after the dot com bubble. But people who kept buying Amazon dips for that lost decade would have made out like bandits much later. My hope (and plan) for green energy is to follow this strategy, and take a % each month's income to do it. I don't need the money now, and I can't think of anything better it can do than backstop the technologies needed to make my son's life better."
2021-04-07 18:48:27,stocks,"That’s fair, but you may make more money just adding to a broad index fund overtime while green energy is sideways. I have some ICLN and I plan on holding it for years, but I don’t think it’s going to spike again anytime soon."
2021-04-07 18:56:53,stocks,"Most of my holdings were ETFs prior to the first big drop - but I was worried about a) the inclusion of hydrogen in ICLN and b) the high P/E for many of the holdings in other ETFs. I reshuffled to solar companies with lower P/E due to the educated guess that they'd be less impacted by interest rates. But as the interest rates explanation doesn't seem to be the whole story, I regret that decision."
2021-04-07 19:01:20,stocks,"If you’re holding for awhile, no need to worry about it. Clean energy will probably spike again at some point in the next 5 years. Personally, I am not adding more to my position though."
2021-04-07 18:02:04,stocks,I think sideways is a reasonable guess. Most companies seem overpriced to me but they could grow into those valuations with strong earnings if the economic growth is as strong as forecast. That would leave us with lots of red and green days where we don't really go anywhere for a while. Who knows.

Basically we are in a derivatives feuled bubble."
2021-04-07 19:53:08,stocks,"I'm pretty sure even Shiller said he wouldn't say the 37 right now means we are in a bubble. I forget his exact comment but you can Google it.

2021-04-07 18:38:09,stocks,"Every major medical system and local PCP now offers telehealth services.  Major systems provide chronic dz management and behavioral health services via telehealth.  Small community hospitals offer the same telehealth services.  PCP’s and specialty services offer telehealth.  If you’re insured through an employer, they will steer you to in network providers, not Teledoc.  Rural and poor communities likely have access through FQHC’s or sole community hospitals.  IMO, Teledoc offered a niche service at a time of crisis, but the healthcare system caught up...quickly.  Even at the most opportune time for their business, Teledoc failed to show an operating profit.  This does not give me confidence at long term success when competition is rampant.  Obviously I’m bearish, and probably wrong. 😂"

Have the AI do most of the intake of your symptoms, try to diagnose, and fill a prescription if needed. This would reduce your healthcare costs so much since it’s scalable vs. real docs. 

Real doctors would then be able to focus their time completely on the big issues instead of small repetitive tasks. Really exciting, idk if TDOC is the winner long term (Microsoft is doing a bit here too) though"

They are severely overvalued and there is no way to tell who comes out on top yet. The research is too young, the tech still not proven enough. The most money that can be made with CRISPR right now is diagnostics and plant editing. None of the best companies focusing on those applications are publicly traded."

2021-04-07 17:58:35,stocks,Do they own the patent on CRISPR?
2021-04-07 19:38:53,stocks,"They don’t own the technology and new, better versions of CRISPR engineering come out nearly every month. They DO NOT have the market cornered."

2021-04-07 17:54:33,stocks,Does this company have the IP for this technique? I am not an investor in this so I don't know the specifics. I do know the technology a little though from my work environment.
2021-04-07 18:50:48,stocks,THIS. So much truth. Thank you for pointing that out
2021-04-07 18:11:22,stocks,They license it.
2021-04-07 18:51:32,stocks,"There's no IP for CRISPR or genomics as a whole. CRISPR Therapeutics is one of the more advanced ones in the field, but there's no telling which ones will have the most success. Unless you're extremely knowledgeable about the subject, I don't see why anyone would want to stock pick over owning ARKG in this field tbh."
2021-04-07 18:12:35,stocks,And anyone else can as well?
2021-04-07 18:19:03,stocks,"I think you may want to look it up. Not trying to be a dick, but it seems complicated. Looks like the companies that have licenses have exclusive licenses for specific applications. I’m not in any of those companies so the finer points elude me. I know that the CRISPR tech was originally developed by some universities. Sorry, that’s all I got 🤷🏻‍♂️"
2021-04-07 18:21:35,stocks,Thanks. I actually don't care that much but was asking so people reading this might be more cautious about making an investment in a company without a real moat.
2021-04-07 17:21:02,stocks,It's basically an ETF with no expense ratio
2021-04-07 19:14:34,stocks,"I really like Berkshire but it dropped like 25% during the pandemic while the S&P dropped a little over 30%.  In 09 it dropped about 50% while the S&P dropped about 50%. Its a little defensive but if youre looking for something defensive I'm not sure thats where I'd go.

I do love it at this price and would absolutely buy however."
2021-04-07 18:28:29,stocks,">Layers of successful businesses in their own rights (Geico, Duracell, Dairy Queen, Fruit of the Loom, Helzberg, etc)

iirc, i owned berkshire for a while and their only significant streams of revenue are their insurance, railroad, and energy businesses, so i just added those three and the value of their stock portfolio when i did the valuation, none of the other subsidiaries contribute a significant amount of revenue relative to their market cap"
2021-04-07 17:29:21,stocks,"i mean like an etf that underperforms the s&p and doesn't provide dividends doesn't seem that great imo but if you're happy with your purchase, that's all that matters"
2021-04-07 18:59:18,stocks,Ilike this stock
2021-04-07 17:37:53,stocks,And an ETF with a large cash pile. Some get mad because it doesn’t maximize returns but damn is that a nice cushion/opportunistic to have for extended market downturns
2021-04-07 19:21:51,stocks,I like to think they learn from their mistakes and try and makes themselves stronger and better positioned for the future. That’s why I think they dropped airlines immediately even though they could have played that position more aggressively. Agree totally about liking it for the price. If I wanted a total hedge I would buy bonds or something. Berkshire feels like a decent middle ground leaning towards safety but maintaining respectable growth
2021-04-07 18:37:13,stocks,"I feel like you’re saying only their railroad, insurance and energy businesses as if that’s not enough lol even still they have several nationally known name brands under their umbrella, a massive stock portfolio and an equally massive cash pile. That’s a fortress to capitalize on both healthy markets and downturns. It’s a great defensive capstone to a portfolio.

While the ancillary businesses may not seem like huge revenue movers it’s really because of the size of Berkshire itself. A hugely profitable multimillion dollar business barely moves the needle. That’s why they have so many"
2021-04-07 17:36:50,stocks,"The S&P metric has nuance to it because it really depends on the timescale we’re talking about. What makes BRK great isn’t the raw performance anymore. It’s that it is pretty heavily insulated from market downturns while still providing a respectable return (30% over 20 months is nothing to sneeze at for a huge company).

Strong portfolios need a balance of risk and stability. BRK is my stability but still earns and grows"
2021-04-07 18:52:52,stocks,"Ya it is like if an ETF had half its assets in cash, their might not be an expense ratio stated, but your paying one all the same. I was disappointed they didn’t really fire their elephant gun this time around and panic sold the airline stocks. Maybe a rotation into the banking sector was the right move for them though, only time will tell. This is not investing advice."
2021-04-07 18:41:19,stocks,"Yeah no doubt berkshire is a fantastic business I feel like they have too much money, which can actually be an issue because they might miss out on good opportunities. If it ever goes to less than 1.1x book again it will possibly be a great buy"
2021-04-07 17:43:44,stocks,"its not even that great of insulation. brk fell 31% vs spy's 36% during covid and 56% vs spy's 57.5% during 08'. that tiny % protection means nothing if the etf severely underperforms after the recovery (that % drop also doesn't include dividends reinvested so technically, the gap is smaller if not nonexistent)"
2021-04-07 18:56:22,stocks,"They aren’t well positioned for short term movements. It’s like trying to turn a Mac truck on a dime. I’m not thrilled about the airline sales either, but hindsight is 20/20. At the end of the day it was right to sell them, although could have been timed or nuanced better. I don’t hate the cash pile and I trust the judgement of waiting for the right opportunities. They piled into pharmaceuticals and consolidated their financials into BAC. Also did a good amount of buybacks. I’m not terrible disappointed in those moves. The Berkshire investing philosophy has always been one of patience so I think they’re still waiting for the right time to fire the elephant gun in full"
2021-04-07 18:45:34,stocks,Fair enough. My goal with Berkshire isn’t to maximize returns necessarily I think smaller companies can provide bigger returns in general. But they carry more risk. I like Berkshire because I feel it hedges against risk while also providing a pretty strong return in its own right. I keep about 10% of my portfolio in Berkshire as a hedge but also as a not planning on selling for decades growth opportunity
2021-04-07 17:49:33,stocks,I show Brk.b at 229.33 on 2/21/20 and falling to a low of 169.25 on 5/15/20. Thats more like 26% fall. I also think the ridiculous plunge and then quick uplift dampened BRKs protector effects. Buffet sold airlines at a loss and barely deployed his free capital. It was too quick and too volatile. I expect it would actually perform better during a longer downturn
2021-04-07 17:53:28,stocks,"oops you're right, i inputted in the wrong number when i was calcing"

2021-04-07 18:13:20,stocks,No I think it’s going back up quickly. It’s a bargain right now.  It must have been caught up in some ETF shorting.  It dropped on no news. Insiders don’t hold it so it wasn’t any kind of ditching.

2021-04-07 19:42:56,stocks,"""Magic mushrooms"" has no problem with inhibition at the synaptic level, and studies have shown increased sensitivity of relevant pathways after consumption with a very low minimal effective dose. MDMA inhibits those same pathways, effective only when the drug is in the body and may cause [HPPD](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3736944/) at a much lower level of consumption compared to Psilocbyin or Psilocyin; as MDMA mainly [responds in the occipital lobe of the brain, and is mostly extracellular at that.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3137209/)  


While MDMA is helpful for breakthrough therapy sessions; magic mushrooms are far safer, cheaper, and have long lasting effects. Unless you have access to peer-reviewed research that shows otherwise, I would stay well away from companies pushing MDMA as a **marketable** treatment tool. If you do have those studies, I would love to see them."

I will only turn to Ket if I'm unable to get shrooms. Also you can consume your body weight in shrooms without having any adverse effects on your body.

2021-04-07 19:07:39,stocks,"I think these companies are focusing on the therapeutic benefits of mushrooms, MDMA, ketamine, etc
They study dosage, intervals, and the effects on various mental disorders. 
If you grow your own, or consume recreationally, then you don't need these company services. If you have been suffering from depression for example, you may want to use mushrooms ""properly"" instead of just buying some of the internet or growing your own, and hoping for the best.
As another example, my parents would use mushrooms from a doctor at a lab, but they wouldn't know where to get it elsewhere, nor would they want to."

&#x200B;

I do have a couple of other questions.

&#x200B;

Since AT&T's dividend is $0.52 the stock on the open on the ex-dividend date drops by the dividend amount which is $0.52. I did not see that today. Does the $0.52 drop happen tomorrow?

&#x200B;

Also since I own 11100 shares of AT&T as of the close today if I sold all those shares tomorrow I will still receive the $0.52 dividend on all those 11100 shares on May 5th. Is that correct?"

You are correct. If you sell your stock on the ex-dividend date, you will still receive the dividend on the distribution date. You have to be holding the stock prior to the ex-dividend date in order to receive the dividend."
2021-04-07 17:39:59,stocks,"> To be more clearer Ex(cluding)-Dividend

False. Ex-dividend does not mean ""excluding dividend"".  It means *after* dividend.  Or more specifically, after the dividend eligibility date.  

Stocks prices are never quoted as ""including"" or ""excluding"" dividend, because a pending dividend payment is only one factor of many that can affect the price at any given second.

You might occasionally hear about long term stock performance that includes or doesn't include the effect of dividends.  But that has nothing to do with the term ""ex-dividend""."

2. Don’t try to time the market. You won’t ever get it at the lowest unless there’s a market crash. Think of buying etfs like doing some savings. It’ll have ups and downs. So research in etfs that has businesses and models that you can understand then go in. 
3. Don’t put money in what you aren’t willing to lose. There are no promises that the market will only go one way and not the other. 
4. People will have opinion both ways about any etf and stock. Realize that everyone’s risk tolerance is different. Just because one person say something doesn’t mean it’s true. You’re a smart person you have a lot of tools to research what’s fact and what’s opinion. 
5. Can’t give you recommendations. But I personally did purchase some vanguard etfs and arkk. So you can do more research into it and see if their investment is right for you.

Unless you’re day trading or gambling, those few cents or dollars really won’t do much difference for you. You can’t go back to the past, so there’s no point in having that mindset you have. The worse decision you can make is by not making one at all.

And the worse case situation for you is that you gotta pick up a few extra shifts at work to make up for the money you lose. 

An honest opinion is to not touch options or margin calls and too much individual stock gambling. If you think you’re missing out now for not buying in before, you gonna regret buying in those tools and end up bag holding or chasing the bag.

Despite an initial falloff due to the Covid pandemic, digital advertising spending grew 12.2% year over year in 2020, according to a new report commissioned by the Interactive Advertising Bureau and conducted by PwC.

But the report also showed the largest players in the ecosystem further entrenched their hold on the U.S. digital ad market in 2020, commanding more share year over year. 

2021 is the reopening of the economy, many businesses and corporations will be spending big on digital ads. People should be buying google, facebook and amazon to ride the momentum. Facebook and google already breaking 52 week high everyday, amazon will be hitting ath soon as amazon digital ads business will keep growing."
2021-04-07 11:37:04,stocks,I would expect digital advertising to do relatively well in the pandemic since we’re presumably more plugged into social and the internet in general than before. How do we know this growth will continue coming out of it?
2021-04-07 12:49:31,stocks,"what is so surprising about that? everyone stays inside on the computer... if anything, I would have expected it to grow more than 12%..."

2021-04-07 14:17:58,stocks,"lol right? what sort of discussion is this post supposed to catalyse? How retailers figured out that people were spending a disproportionate amount of their time online shopping during quarantine, and online storefronts increased their marketing/G&A spend accordingly?"
2021-04-07 16:32:23,stocks,"As a digital marketer of 8 years this is absolutely my take on it. We got a big boost because people are on social more, shopping online more, and also just shopping out of boredom. Plus political ads in the 2020 US presidential campaign saw unprecedented social media spending. If anything I would expect the trend to decrease as people go out more."
2021-04-07 14:27:15,stocks,I'm more interested in which businesses had the money to increase their online digital ad spending and which suffered enough to decrease their spending.
2021-04-07 18:45:05,stocks,"My guess would be that many companies dont spend money on ads if people are not going out, spending money on their products. I remember google had a hard time at the start of the pandemic because they missed a lot of ad revenue."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"NOKIA is being undervalued by the market; price does not reflect treasure of patent chest NOK has invaluable patents which fit right into next generation applications including 5G, Autonomous Vehicle communication etc. These patents are combination of the patents of former Nokia Networks + Lucent Networks+ Alcatel Networks. if and when the licensing accelerates there could be be nice regular cash flows coming in. Example in todays press..

[https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cf5bd832-a713-3a03-901a-3f4a35cc85db/nokia-and-lenovo%E2%80%99s-battle.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/m/cf5bd832-a713-3a03-901a-3f4a35cc85db/nokia-and-lenovo%E2%80%99s-battle.html)

&#x200B;

NOK sits on a pile of patents built up over two decades from more than EUR129 billion in research and development spending. The company's patent portfolio comprises around 20,000 patent families -- inventions patented in more than one country -- including more than 3,500 that have been declared essential to next-generation 5G networks.

Nokia said on Wednesday that it had concluded a multiyear, multi-technology patent cross-licensing agreement with Lenovo , putting an end to all pending patent litigation and other proceedings between the two companies.

""The agreement reflects Nokia's ( [NOK](https://qr.fidelity.com/embeddedquotes/redirect/research?symbol=NOK) ) decades long investments in R&D and contributions to cellular and multimedia standards,"" said Jenni Lukander, the president of patent, technology, and brand licensing business.

The terms of the technology-sharing agreement remain confidential, but Lenovo will make a net balancing payment to Nokia, the Finnish company said.

John Mulgrew, Lenovo's chief intellectual property officer, said the agreement with Nokia reflects the value of both Nokia's technology leadership and Lenovo's continued investment in 5G innovation."" Mulgrew added that the accord will facilitate future collaboration between the two companies."

2021-04-07 11:07:12,stocks,I wouldn't mind picking up a unit and sitting on it to see if it catches some momentum again and adds a buck or two... but that options game is nada. Nokia is just so dead there is nothing to gain there on calls.
2021-04-07 11:04:36,stocks,its market cap of 22B seems pretty fair to me?
2021-04-07 13:14:41,stocks,The play on NOK is to sell the $4p 30 to 45 days out until you get assigned. Then once you get assigned start selling the $4.5c until the shares finally get called away. NOK won't move much as the share float is just too damn large.
2021-04-07 14:11:17,stocks,"Overall, I am bullish on NOK but as a disclaimer, I do not hold any shares/options at this time. NOK faces two big issues. 

1. massive float: 5.6 BILLION outstanding shares. For NOK to move with any significance there needs to be multiple hundreds of millions of shares traded. 
2. earnings per share: decreasing yoy. -20.7% in the past year and -28% in the last five years. The low price for ATM leaps shows that the MM don't expect NOK to move much over the next two years. 

Furthermore, competition from ERIC and other 5G providers are eating up market shares."

2021-04-07 11:51:46,stocks,"Just let it die already.

Losing important deals, bad company outlook, underwhelming earnings, firing 10k people. Dilluted non moving stock.

Why not just choose obvious winners of 5G race ? Ericsson fans are pretty happy and stock is happy too for example.

Also from the pumping post in comments you pumped like '' value is in the eyes of the beholder.'' Beholders have seen it as dog shit, heck even you, you historically been pumping the shit out of it, which means you will unload it first chance you get."

2021-04-07 14:08:44,stocks,"It's baked into the price. Don't crow too much about Nokia. The company is not a great vendor. The only reason carriers still use them is because it's extremely difficult to change.

The usual push in LTE is to get away from locked in patents. The whole point of 3GPP was to create a standard to allow for interoperability between hardware, software, and carriers.

Edit: typos"
2021-04-07 14:47:43,stocks,"I own a fair amount and I'm not super hyped about it. The pros are that Nokia doesn't seem to be going anywhere. They've got a lot of cash on hand. Yes they have a lot of patents and if everything goes right/as planned, they'll be in a great positions. Buuuuuuttttt they've been focusing more on acquisitions instead of actually producing products that can be purchased. They are woefully behind on 5G and the only way they are going to catch up is to acquire other companies. (See Ericsson) Short term, this is probably going to hurt the stock a bit. Long doesn't seem terrible, but its a really long term bet. But what do I know? I'm just an internet person."
2021-04-07 18:48:17,stocks,Not too sure about NOK. They have a massive float which the company loves to grow. Plus I’ve heard they have a terrible reputation with how they run the company. They seems helpless to take full advantage of huawei being barred from many 5G networks
2021-04-07 19:47:36,stocks,"Oh, it must be that time of the week when someone pokes NOK with a stick to see if it moves.

Seriously though, every week, same thing.  Somewhere in bewteen $4 and $4.25, that's where it's pinned.  They could singlehandedly invent, install, and monopolize 8G tomorrow, still $4.  Develop AI for self-driving cars?  Also $4.  Cure cancer?  Believe it or not, $4."

2021-04-07 11:41:17,stocks,I prefer AAPL
2021-04-07 11:51:36,stocks,"I agree with you. NOK’s years of R&D aren’t currently reflected in the price imo. NOK has also been setting itself up to be a major 5G provider all over the world and a 4G provider on the moon. It’s a major telecommunication infrastructure company with research and patents in all areas of tech.

This will either be an extremely long-term play where suddenly 15 years from now we all look around and find that we’ve come to rely on Nokia for global communication, or a catalyst sparks in another area of its research and the company blasts off sooner. Either way, I think it’s a good play."
2021-04-07 16:31:57,stocks,The float is just so big. If they could reduce that i would consider investing

Yogi Berra: try not to make predictions especially about the future !

Possible catalysts for a recovery in NOK stock. One is the NEW CEO announces some dividend in next 3 months and second the earnings in next Q exceeds his very gloomy outlook he presented few months ago at his first earnings call. This is a standard practice of new CE0s called UPOD ( under promise and over deliver and appear smart in front of the ANAL-ysts ); recent examples: GE,WFC and KHC turnarounds where stocks have gone up 80pct.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Handelsblatt: VW will switch to mass-producing electric vehicles with bidirectional charging next year (VOW, VWAGY) [VW will switch to mass-producing electric vehicles with bidirectional charging next year
](https://electrek.co/2021/04/06/vw-electric-vehicles-bi-directional-charging-next-year/)

Background excerpt on V2G:

> The technology is often referred to as “vehicle-to-grid.”

> An electric vehicle with bidirectional charging capacity can send power pack into the grid, or a home, or even another electric vehicle.

Competition:

> The Nissan Leaf is the most popular EV with the capacity, but that’s about it.

> However, there are many new EVs coming with the capacity. The new Hyundai Ioniq 5 is equipped with the technology, and Tesla has commented that all future vehicles will be equipped with bidirectional charging capacity.

Translation of Handelsblatt excerpt:

> “The test vehicles are running, we are in the last pulls with the preparations,” confirms VW Development Board Member Thomas Ulbrich in an interview with the Handelsblatt. From 2022 onwards, **every electric car from the Volkswagen Group that is developed on the basis of the MEB** (“modular electrification kit”) electrical platform can not only charge the electricity but also return it to the grid. In addition to VW, the MEB is also used by the sister brands Audi , Skoda and Seat-Cupra.

Commentary elsewhere:

https://thedriven.io/2021/04/07/volkswagen-wants-to-stabilise-grid-by-adding-v2g-in-all-its-electric-cars/

> Carmakers that dive into the business of smoothing the grid would benefit more than financially, also. By saving unused renewable energy for future use to feed into the power grid, the vehicle industry would also acquire knowledge of how much storage capacity would actually be available at certain times.

> **For the Volkswagen group, it will also set it apart from Tesla, which is more focused on having its cars on the road in service as autonomous taxis.**"

2021-04-07 16:03:50,stocks,"I said in another post and got laughed at. at some point, every oh so innovative company in the EV business has to not only be innovative and hip, but start being a car manufacturer and distributor.

VW has everythin in place. they spent almost 50 billion euros since 2018 into developing this MEB, which is not only this car to grid system (thats actualyl a function of the battery itself) but a totally modular platform that allows the replacement of modules like chassis, motor, etc on the fly without having to reassemble the whole production line.

guess how much money TSLA spent since 2010 ? right. not even 9 billion.

[Link here](https://www.statista.com/statistics/314863/research-and-development-expenses-of-tesla/#:~:text=Tesla%20%2D%20R%26D%20spending%202010%2D2020&text=Tesla's%20research%20and%20development%20spending,a%20million%20vehicles%20in%202020)

only because they didn´t market the way TSLA did, does not mean they sat on their hands and did nothing. they invested shit tons of money in startups, autonomous driving tech, battery development etc etc. all in preparation for stuff everybody knew would come sooner or later.

but guess what they also did at the same time ?- build and sell a shitload of cars

\- increase share prices DESPITE all kinds of crisis, lawsuits and setbacks

\- pay out consistent dividends.

Laughable attempts at announcing SOMETHING different.

2021-04-07 10:56:03,stocks,"I believe it's exactly that. If your car is going to be plugged in while electricity is very expensive it can sell electricity to the grid. Then it will charge itself again when the electricity is cheap.

It also means that your car can act as a battery for your house. So your home electric bill can exploit the same price differentials.

Couple that with solar and you may not need a battery pack for that.

The thing is, plugging all of these electric vehicles into the grid overnight is just going to make overnight the most expensive time of the day."
2021-04-07 10:51:03,stocks,"Solar panels, which are on pretty much every new house here, pretty much give you nothing during peak hours compared to energy cost you'd pay. So you can use the car as a battery during daylight hours and then use the battery in the evening.

I don't know if this is cost effective, because degradation and all."
2021-04-07 11:02:43,stocks,"Pretty much that, and also being able to use your vehicle as a power source for your home in the event of power outages."
2021-04-07 13:03:52,stocks,"It’s much more than power price arbitrage and value varies widely by different regions and different utilities. You could think of all the cars connected to the grid as one huge utility scale power plant. Just having potential capacity available at a given time of day carries a value (called capacity payments) and if these big car makers bid into those capacity markets, that has the net effect of on-demand power (or the opposite, a reduction of load) for regional utilities and system operators in a pinch. 

It’s all super cool stuff and certainly will play a big part of bolstering grid reliability in the not so distant future."
2021-04-07 15:12:46,stocks,"It allows the utilities to better balance the system by smoothing peaks and valleys in usage/production, which is a cause of inefficiencies (and in the end costs the end user). 

I’d imagine we’ll see an opt-in system where we can let the utility manage a percentage of the charge. Right now my utility offers a discount if I opt in to letting them modify my smart thermostat set point. The rules are something like “we can adjust a maximum of 2 degrees and a maximum of 6 times per year, for a maximum of 24 hrs per time”. 

I could see a similar discount system from the electric provider of “we can manage up to 10% of your battery capacity....” for a discount. No major impact on the consumer, and like with my thermostat the consumer could override at any time (say you were gonna go on a long trip and wanted to ensure a battery at 100%). If there are millions of batteries tied into the grid, even a 5 or 10% manipulation of them would offer monstrous efficiencies for the electric company."
2021-04-07 16:39:47,stocks,Isnt it so that you can charge another EV car when that car is out of energy and only seend a couple miles to reach a EV station?
2021-04-07 10:30:59,stocks,"The Tesla roadster had the capacity to do vehicle-to-grid, but nobody used it. It's not difficult to do, it just hasn't been very useful yet. With new software to stabilize the grid with vehicle-to-grid this might change though."
2021-04-07 10:57:48,stocks,"People keep saying stupid shit like ""Tesla is ahead."" Tesla isn't ahead, Tesla is using 10-year-old technology.

2021-04-07 19:57:39,stocks,"If you're just a random consumer buying an EV, this doesn't really matter unless your local utility provides decent incentives (e.g. time of use rates, demand response, etc) that you plan to take advantage of.

2021-04-07 11:32:17,stocks,"Convenience and, predominantly, ensures that you aren't constrained with where you can park and charge. Additionally, current standard for EV charges is 300 miles, far beyond what the average person drives in a day. Couple that with the realistic expectation that you may be charging it at work or will be charging it at home you don't need to consider filling your tank for regular commuting. If you're driving highway at 70mph you're looking at more than 4 hours continuous driving one direction before needing a charge.

With this technology being so new I find it hard to say who among any might even be successful bit to write VW off seems, to me at least, to be ignoring what they do well."
2021-04-07 16:23:02,stocks,A normal home with battery backup disconnects itself from the grid when power from the grid fails and I would expect that the first usage of their bidirectional charging would be just using it for the home.

2021-04-07 15:29:28,stocks,"Increasing load during valleys and decreasing load during peaks is a win.  Power generators and utilities would prefer to plan around flat demand.  Is it possible that you go too far and cause new peaks?  Sure, but this can account for that too.

Using an EV that’s parked at home for most of 24 hours as a house battery is kind of genius IMO."
2021-04-07 11:30:59,stocks,"Yeah it could be useful coupled with solar panels, but I’m not sure I’d want to use my car’s battery life cicles for that. Especially on a luxury car.

I’m more interested in being able to power external appliances, like charging an electric bike or jet board, powering a compressor and maybe AC for an inflatable tent, etc."
2021-04-07 10:58:48,stocks,"I think a good thought experiment is that - if the bidirectional charging is not EV but any other electronics like your phone, will you do it and why?

For me I wouldn't - I want my phone to work anytime that I want and if I need to store extra charge I buy power banks. Same for cars.

Even in emergency situations say hurricane and power is lost, I'd rather have a fully charged EV in my garage than half charged because ""I put it back in the grid.""

This is fluff."

2021-04-07 19:53:10,stocks,"Depending on where you're located, the power provider/utility probably already has the ability to allow EVs to feed power back into the grid. If the utility has net metering for solar, it can probably accept power from EVs. The only concern for them would be the unpredictable nature of when power is fed back into the grid, so limitations might occur, unless the utility has a control system like a DERMS.   


Also the battery backup disconnecting when the grid fails tends to be a safety requirement for workers. Normally it's referred to as anti-islanding."

I understand that meme stocks are not the primary subject of this sub, however, I still think that the lower visibility is a shame, since it was one of the few places where meme stocks could be discussed in a relative civil and sober manner.

Is there another sub that I'm unaware of where meme stocks are discussed, without the whole hivemind/conspiricy nonsense?"

We've had a really bullish week with a lot of great big gains -- so, naturally, Powell and the Feds are dropping by today and tomorrow to make sure our portfolios don't get *too* green.

This time, the Fed's focus is international, with a couple of big market movers coming up:

* [Trade deficit data](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-07/u-s-trade-deficit-widened-to-record-71-1-billion-in-february?utm_source=google&utm_medium=bd&cmpId=google) came out today and is at a record high
* The IMF is [calling for higher taxes](https://www.ft.com/content/5dad2390-8a32-4908-8c96-6d23cd037c38) on wealthy people and nations
* The Fed's FOMC Minutes are coming out at 2:00 PM today. They should be full of bullish comments on the economy, but might make investors nervous about interest rates again
* Powell is talking at an IMF event tomorrow, which, historically, has meant [66% chance of a red day](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/HORAC)

This is one of the harder days to predict. The news is bearish -- but is it bearish enough to make people forget that the economy is booming?

Usually, though, when a day's hard to predict, nothing happens. So I'm calling for a relatively dull, flat day.

Today is going to be a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of 13,698** and a **low of 13,595**.

[See past predictions and visualizations here.](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/944799e4-93a3-4aa3-9a1a-68059d06c4a2/page/yEPBC)

We know that growth recovery is resistant to economic stimuli now. 

We know growth recovery requires continued positive momentum of ALL indices, not just one.  Growth is often the last to recover. Also, Yields are increasing and the economy is fragile - e.g. it appears to be a spinning basketball on a finger and any slight perterburation stops its fragile balance.

We know that growth recovery has priced in the hopeful optimism of Biden's clean energy/infrastructure plans. often times, passing of these plans and execution by government falls FAR short of expectation.

What we essentially have is a sector that requires major indices to remain full bore positive before it can recover in an sensitive economy where there are no more levers to pull to maintain that delicate balance and is also resistant to economic stimuli."

2021-04-07 10:58:51,stocks,"Not exactly related but Harris said marijuana legalization is currently not top of the priority, could also mean that green energy policies perhaps won’t be getting as much focus right now as well. Manchin and a few dem senators also said they won’t agree with all the tax hike, that’s why big techs are coming back big time as these Biden bills will likely be trimmed."
2021-04-07 11:45:47,stocks,"ICLN is supposed to diversify further in the next two weeks, you may see some improvement in the price."
2021-04-07 14:50:02,stocks,I can't decide if I should buy in now or if CHPT is overvalued. All I know is I bought in way too high.
2021-04-07 12:57:50,stocks,Because all EV related stocks are based on hype more than anything else right now.
2021-04-07 13:30:51,stocks,"I'm pretty sure there's been years where the S&P has only gained 8% (although it wasn't in a straight line) and it just recently had two powerful rallies of 5%+ (really 6% I believe) and around 5% (in this case: ???), lmao don't give me that bs (that's not even considering the 24%+ run from early November, and I am fully aware that might be lower after today).

If we're going back to a normal regime, it's going to bore so many people."

2021-04-07 07:43:25,stocks,Would it be wise to buy a few shares today?
2021-04-07 17:23:26,stocks,"Probably, but the thing is to just hold good companies for a long time. Down today doesn’t mean down forever."

2021-04-07 08:56:51,stocks,"Most Chinese stocks are getting wrecked right now as foreign investors flee. What the Chinese government did to Baba was a wakeup call that the CCP can come in and wreak havoc in any company, whenever they please. That kind of uncertainty is driving away investors. I sold off all my Tencent and Baba myself in the past few months, rotating into American companies instead, just out of safety."
2021-04-07 08:48:19,stocks,The only news I see is Naspers selling 2% of their stake.  Which seems like a non-event.  I'm not sure why it's off so much
2021-04-07 09:13:19,stocks,The ones worth investing in are all private. I’ve had my eyes on BlueNalu but I don’t see them going public for a while.

2021-04-07 13:10:38,stocks,"You do get FOMC minutes but that doesn't mean zip with what's going on, QQQ filled its February 22nd gap down on Monday, and I'm guessing that it's now rejected twice at a trendline from early September.

2021-04-07 14:42:08,stocks,"I suppose valuation is bases on growth expectations for the industry as each state is loosening regulations for online gambling. The potential market in America is huge for so many reasons in my opinion. 

Flutter is said to be floating Fanduel in its own right and is in a legal battle with Fox who have an option for a stake in it. Also flutter has a retail chain in the UK which haven't been open for around a year."

2021-04-07 07:47:42,stocks,"I think TTCF is still a decent value around these levels. I've been accumulating shares under $20 myself. I also love ETSY, and I bought a bunch of it on the cheap during the correction. Maybe wait for a greater pullback on that one."

2021-04-07 13:05:42,stocks,Bro just buy VTI or VT. You'd do better long-term than listening to most of the DD on reddit.

2021-04-07 13:48:13,stocks,I use my ROTH for long term and buy index eft's with low cost. My personal account is more for speculation and growth stocks.
2021-04-07 14:49:11,stocks,Consider the tax implications of your holdings. Things that pay out regular dividends or cap gains might be best in Roth since you won't pay taxes on those.
2021-04-07 13:51:01,stocks,Yeah Nano is the one black hole in my portfolio these days. Still holding out for it to at least get back to 10.

2021-04-07 19:08:08,stocks,AAPL is a buy and hold. A year from now your entry at 119 or 127 won't matter nearly so much.
2021-04-07 09:27:12,stocks,"I agree with you, especially with AMZN. A little fun fact that I discovered yesterday:

100% of the time for the past 10 years, AMZN has moved up an average of 22.3% between March 29th and July 20th.

If this holds true, then that means we could see AMZN hitting ATHs in the next 3-4 months!"
2021-04-07 09:59:58,stocks,Dont know but it’s making me sad I didn’t buy when it dipped to $200...maybe it has to do with the Bitcoins news a few days ago?
2021-04-07 10:06:11,stocks,"That stock literally tripled last year. It's not going to continue growing at that rate forever. Buy the dips and wait for the next leg higher later this year, when Etsy trades consistently in the $220s and above."

2021-04-07 12:53:52,stocks,It's a combo of it being speculative so it follows the pattern of other spec stocks the past few weeks along with selling whenever it gets a run going from Biden saying something like he did during the infrastructure announcement

All other years, ARKK trailed behind the market."

Cnk...it's a total maybe at this point in regards to oil. I'd wait a bit. Even if the stock goes up, opec will eventually ramp up production and oil will lose value again thus oil stock will go down. 

I used to have PLYA. Another stock that has already recovered to it's pre-pandemic level. And I read the recovery is already priced in.

2021-04-07 17:32:19,stocks,I think Grab will be huge. The numbers I'm going to keep a close eye on are related to see how much they're planning on growing internationally.

It sucks to see red, but when you think about it, it only means you can buy more for cheap. What matters is what it will be worth in 5 years, and this will be determined by actual earnings.


I have 0 worries that something like amazon or google will pay off. Wether or not PLTR or NIO will pay off depends on how well the actual company will be doing."

1. A surge in consumer spending in the near-term on vacations/discretionary at their physical venues. 

2. A strong earnings surplus from their digital enterprises (Disney+ being the likely factor here)."

Growth is typically last to recover as the gains from value-tech still have wiggle room up.

If the broader market remains strong through the next few months I would expect growth to start to recover, but this would not occur until June/August. 

and you have to define ""recover"". growth stocks will likely ""recover"" to halfway between their points now and the highs. so tesla probably around 750-800, Nio up to 45. 

That's IF the market remains strong. If it doesn't then expect growth to remain flat until it does."

2021-04-07 13:32:16,stocks,"CNK is Cinemark which is the movie theater company lol.

Of the three he mentioned CNK is perhaps the one with the most room to run. As it currently stands it's around 2/3rds of its pre-pandemic price.

However it is also the one that carries the most risk as the pandemic may have permanently changed the movie viewing habits of the population. The big fear is that streaming will become the default way to see new movies and that big theaters will be relegated to a niche experience.

I guess the big question is, how valuable is the ""theater experience"" to the average person? There is surely something unique about theaters that cannot be easily replicated by a streaming service. But being able to pause, bring your own food, and talk during the movie could end up outweighing that for most people. So it's not a guarantee that theaters ever fully recover from this."

2021-04-07 15:13:54,stocks,"Ah alright I plugged the ticker in and it gave me that lol. 

It's just my personal opinion but theaters have had outrageous prices and virtually anything possible to deter movie goers and they still have come. Audiences have been decreasing year over year I believe but it's not new. People who would rather stream movies already didn't go pre-pandemic.  I think the theater experience now is fantastic bc there's nobody around lol.  Hbo max is an attractive option bc of its value. However, Disney+ is demanding 30 bucks to stream a theater movie. Which seems outrageous but parents might be going...hey that's less than if we all went. 

So few people are going right now that even if half the people went back to theaters it would be a boon to the stocks.  That's how I look at it."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"LUCID Motors' future mired in uncertainty Lucid Motors is just a mirage. In 3-4 years all the EV automakers will use solid-state batteries and Lucid's main advantage will simply vanish. 

Volvo, Daimler, and other luxury car makers are launching EVs, better looking and with competitive tech. The difference is that they put more emphasis on comfort, rather than on the 0-60 acceleration. Where are you going to use it? Will you stick it to the guy in the car next to you at the traffic lights? If so, maybe you shouldn't drive at all. Feel the need for adrenaline? Go to an amusement park, don't put other traffic participants in danger.

Your car has 1000 hp and not 400 hp? Cool. My point is that many specs that Rawlinson boasts with are impressive from an engineering perspective, but nothing more.

Having production facilities already in place, other car manufacturers with already established brands can afford to undercut Lucid by a significant margin.
And if they can afford to undercut they can afford to overspend on R&D and hire superstar researchers.

In the end, if the cars don't differ by much on what really matters to you, will you really pay double? If yes, have fun during hail storms and all the other little accidents that happen every day.

That being said, I'm still willing to see Lucid succeed somehow, because if they do, that means they have found something underexplored, and it will force other competitors to improve and move further the innovation frontier. If Tesla didn't succeed, we would be far behind in green technology adoption today."
2021-04-07 14:03:05,stocks,"Some things I don’t really think is clear and is misleading in your post: 1) lucid has a manufacturing facility in AZ, and is building one in SA, 2) the solid state plans are very long term—limited higher priced rollout in 2025, with mass market production in 2030.

And last, Lucid wants to compete with the likes of Mercedes, so yes, clean lines and 1000hp makes a difference in that market."
2021-04-07 03:50:32,stocks,My love affair with Lucid burst like a balloon when they pushed the launch of their mid-range models to some indistinct year in the future. Several companies with big enough wallets can jump into the race in the meantime; VW already heating up.

Also if you doubt ppl buying niche toys with upbeat specs, read this one.. https://carbuzz.com/news/during-a-global-pandemic-luxury-car-sales-skyrocket.

This guy is trying to engineer the fuck out of EV’s and it’s his quiet confidence that leads me to believe he’s going to do it. Volvo , VW , Ford et al are unlikely to set the world on fire with EV tech. They are probably too long in the tooth for that. They all make great cars but they are boring AF with very little depth to there UI’s. That’s not going to change just because they stick a battery in a VW golf. Tesla is the maker to go after and I think this is Peter’s main priority. Teslas are not  luxury EV’s- it’s just arguably the best EV out there at the minute and has a luxury car price tag. Lucid is going to try and better Tesla in performance , tech and interior quality. Whether they achieve that or not is yet to see but I’m excited to be along for the ride."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Interesting, and amusing news about NIO Hey again everyone,

So there's been some interesting news surrounding NIO again; and NIOgang, while we're busy in our day to day lives and jobs, we've always got our finger on the pulse for NIO; or at least trying to, haha.

So we know that NIO's sales in Q1 were very impressive--hitting 20,060--[link](https://ir.nio.com/news-events/news-releases/news-release-details/nio-inc-provides-march-and-first-quarter-2021); increasing 423% year-on-year. At the time this information was released, which was the 1st of April 2020, NIO's cumulative deliveries were 95,701--we've subsequently just learned, as of now, that NIO's 100,000th EV has come off the production line; here a [link](https://twitter.com/42how_/status/1379634663652663299) to see.

I recently learned that NIO is comparing in China very well against the European premium brands Audi, BMW, and Mercedes; here's a [link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377567655813644290/photo/1). As you can see, NIO is doing **considerably better**; this comes courtesy of Marcel Münch--an analyst I sometimes listen to on youtube on my break. Additionally, NIO is even doing considerably better than VW in China--[link](https://twitter.com/_mm85/status/1377634756490366984) to see that too.

So demand is getting stronger for NIO; and as we know from the last earnings call from the Q4 and full year financials, NIO will be increasing production to around 300-600k in early 2022.

Sales are increasing; revenue is increasing. Oh, also, another thing is that NIO signed a deal with the German retail giant Metro AG; here a [link](https://cnevpost.com/2021/03/29/nio-signs-deal-with-german-retail-giant-on-charging-infrastructure-partnership/). Why this is exciting is because we know NIO is planning on European expansion soon, and an infrastructure agreement with one Germany's biggest retailers with over 600 stores, seems like another big hint what's coming for NIO.

Where does amusement come in? That's right, you guessed it: Jim Cramer.

Jim in on twitter claiming that the current chart shows NIO may go down; here's [link](https://twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1379576154810691593). And the price you wonder it supposedly will go? That's right, Citrons price target. Of course, what's interesting here is when we look at the comment section of Cramer's post; some of my favorites are [1](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379590047503065088), [2](https://twitter.com/ajosephb/status/1379627925868212224), [3](https://twitter.com/Dave15161498/status/1379579270465486853), and [4](https://twitter.com/j04776684/status/1379579589568180226), it seems like the tactic used isn't working. In fact I think it's pretty clear that the suits are trying to manipulate NIO's price by trying to effect sentiment--similar to the same tactics used against GME; and from the comments I linked you all to, I don't think it's going to work. What's also funny, is that Cramer was saying months ago how we was wrong about NIO; his flip-flopping is suspicious, at least to me.

Oh also, I just saw this a minute ago, that William Li Bin, CEO of NIO, has said in a recent interview commemorating the 100,000th EV produced, that he is confident that NIO will exceed 1,000,000 EV saes in China; here the [link](https://twitter.com/Klp168/status/1379667417928933376).

Personally I think we'll see NIO go much higher in the future; we know that institutions are [buying](https://twitter.com/NinjaSwinga/status/1379586316795543553) NIO, and I remain very bullish for them. They've really come a long way since I first was interested in them almost 2 years ago now; I work in the health care industry, and I'm confident that NIO will free me, eventually--my hands are made of diamond too!

I just spend my break writing this, so hopefully it helps some of you remain strong.

NIO all the way.

And I can like this stock, and hate their government, in the exact same way I like Tesla, and hate my government!

Thanks everyone.

Edit\* I put 427% rather than the correct number 423%

Edit 2\* HAHA I just looked found out that Jim Cramer deleted his bearish tweet about NIO; here's a few links for proof [1](https://stocktwits.com/liudasbar/message/312761193), [2](https://twitter.com/TheIronGiant8/status/1379776807520542721)"

Jim cramer isn't bringing this stuff out of thin air nios chart is an absolute mess alongside tesla since the decline. I was in nio so I feel a sense of attachment I was in at around 11 but sold at 54 because nio at anything above 20 has priced in decades of growth with the stock, yes I know there is so much good news but that news is irrelevant when the stock is trading at a p/s of 20 and a market cap of 62b if you don't mide what price we're you in at."
2021-04-07 07:25:28,stocks,"Nios market cap is 62B compared to the giant with millions of sales stellantis a 57b. Any reason why it should go higher instead of lower, since they compete in the same space with one selling millions of cars and one selling a few thousands?"

NIO's founder William Li has an amazing track record, having founded multiple companies. I'm bullish about this stock and 10% of my portfolio is NIO and 15% Tesla. Hoping to match Tesla in the coming years or possibly months."
2021-04-07 06:18:23,stocks,"Have you ever liked a stock, and then a few months later not liked it? There’s all sorts of reason this can happen. China and its market valuations over the last few months is an unbelievably compelling reason to reassess how you feel about those companies.

2021-04-07 07:55:37,stocks,"I am not an experienced investor but I bailed on NIO because CCP is being accused of genocide *on the world stage now, and I really don’t see a longterm upward trend resulting from the geopolitical changes going on.

Edit:
To answer some of the comments, all I see is that China is headed towards a demographic disaster and from what I understand, they do not have a favorable geopolitical situation.  So either collapse, or outright war to maintain power such as what is arising in India, Philippines, Taiwan, etc. 

Also, CCP is pivoting from the USD which has caused massive upheavals and wars when it has been tried by other countries in the past.

Companies that are not reliant on the CCP will be able to get out of China if things get bad.
Nike, apple, etc, will probably move to Mexico or India.

2021-04-07 10:49:12,stocks,"Get a grip in what sense?  Most people are blissfully unaware of that.  My point is that the information has been out there for a long time, but people are not aware and no political actions have been taken.  Now we have governments making open accusations/declarations as well as taking political/financial action in opposition to human rights abuses.  

From my perspective, everyone thinking that the CCP reliant companies are a good long term hold need to get a grip.  (If I remember correctly, one of the big selling points of NIO is that it was so heavily funded by the CCP.)  I would love to be educated on this, at a higher/more technical level, but so far people are just hitting me with ""gotchas"".

My point is more about the actual geopolitical position of China, especially due to demographic changes and resulting from tensions which will arise from these accusations.

But, on a side note, I find it confusing that you don't consider profiting off of shady activities to be supporting those activities.  (I'm not saying that you did or did not) But if spending money is free speech, I would consider that to be pretty much directly supporting and agreeing with those activities morally.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"For the youth, just broad strokes what I've learned after 20 years investing. #DON'T PANIC

(This was my response to a young investor here. Thought I might just post it, I like to lurk but whatever. Some edits have been made.)

For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up in life there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

#1 if you see money laying on the ground PICK THAT UP. IT'S FREE MONEY. People throw money down because they don't know what money is really worth or what money can do. PICK IT UP AND POCKET THAT. NEVER THROW MONEY DOWN, NOT EVEN A PENNY. Damn, I hate seeing money on the ground. Even that penny was some time or labor earned, dont disregard that time and labor. 


::
# I cant believe I have to edit this, but some idiot brought it up: If you find a large some of money laying on the ground take it to your local police station. Check your local laws to determine what the minimum amount would be for your state/jurisdiction most are between $500 and $10,000. If you find it in a bag with drugs... well, you do you. 

::

I was really just talking about pocket change 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week, but you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself.

This is NOT thought [edit: or taught] in school. 

You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 (he was 30 when this got intresting to him) till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and tried to teach me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20+ years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still think I'm not all that good at it, but I could still just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. I try to educate my friends and family that will listen, but I feel like a blowhard sometimes. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Don't believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you can't verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

#Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. 

Don't be afraid to gamble a little every now and then, but don't make a r/WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. (You can [and I have] make good money on a meme stock, but pIck an entry and exit; you do NOT need a 1000% gain, a 10% gain is PROFIT, AND PROFIT: IS PROFIT.)

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (don't forget that inflation will take cash out of your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balancing act]) Try some stock picking.

After you have set yourself up  try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs are what I'm in. Go global too. 

Maybe after you are set long term, try short term picks. It really is all about risk and risk tolerance. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Sell cash covered puts for stocks you like or own and want more of for a lesser price. Sell covered calls on stocks you have, and this can lower your cost basis.  

Don't do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. 
If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10, 20, or 30 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns (buy dips and crashes), and ride the waves. This is a lot easier if you are young and have the time to ride it out while you wage slave. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

#DONT PANIC. 

Don't trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis, and. stick. to. your. plan.

Learn how to make a budget and include your investments into it.

Buy 1 or 2 realestate properties. Everything you invest after purchase price is considered a loss and can offset your tax burden (even if it adds value).


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

Do not disregard other avenues of investment either. Realestate, income property, land, art, farms, cattle (it's a big one where I'm from), antiques, clasic cars (but that might be over after all the boomers are gone [I'm gen X and still remember the smell of them (and that is a real thing kids)]. 

Try not to fall into investment fads.

When I was a kid these collectors thought these stupid bennie baby things and pogs were for life.... if those dumb*sses would have bought $AAPL instead they wouldn't still have tubs of useless, multicolored, cute cotton, whatever animal like things they would have yachts. Those damb card games are another one, yes I do have some Magic gathering cards worth some money, but I didn't buy it as an investment, I was a geek who liked playing the game with my friends.

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.


*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*

**last edit: swords for plowshares boys**

PS: I upvoted you all so far, love this late(early) discussion. Going to sleep now. Whether you agree with me or not, I wish you all solid gains. It is not about you or them, or your gains vs his/her loss. I hope you all make gains and that my small insite can lead future generations(or my own or past) to an easy life where we maybe don't have yachts or pent houses, but at the same time.... have to die young of stress and ill health, and can just have the money to be content and happy and be like me,... spending this week digging a new garden, and not be broken old men/women like I see so often.

And if you dont like that, if you say everyone should ""pull up them boot straps"" then I say Fuk you. That didn't work. So I won, and I hope I can teach even one kid to win to

I DO NOT SELF MANAGE MY IRAs.  MY IRAs truck  along just fine. 

But I do manage my margin account. I use every thing I can to make more $$. And options are a big part. I am not making insane call buys. I sell covered calls and buy cash secured puts. I sell iron condors or butterflies (depends on the equity). I follow trends and waves and rotations and I use leaps and verticals. 

(This is me, I am not an advisor, I'm an idiot on the internet.. DO NOT DO WHAT I DO, THIS IS ONLY ME AND ME ALONE. I AM ONLY TELLING THE PUBLIC WHAT I HAVE DONE AS A SOLITARY INVESTOR.)

2021-04-07 11:28:40,stocks,"I have a grand child turning 18 in 5 days. Here is the financial advice that I plan to give to him. On his birthday, I will hand him a hundred dollar bill and a 1 gram 9999 pure gold foil 100 dollar note. Both have a similar value. One is money, the other is currency, a promise to pay issued by the government. Think about how over time, the difference in value each will hold. In 1978, when I was 18, gold was 168.00 an oz. Yesterday it was 1750.00. Has the price of gold increased or the value of the dollar decreased? Food for thought.

Establishing a rock solid foundation is critical. 
Tell yourself that 10% of all I earn is mine to keep. Repeat it daily, take it to heart. 10 PERCENT OF ALL I EARN IS MINE TO KEEP.   Worth repeating, over and over until it gets so deeply ingrained it is what you do without even thinking about it. 
10% to keep and to invest. That's only 10 bucks out of every hundred. You spend that on 2 trips to the drive through coffee place or a fast food meal and never give it a second thought.

Establish an emergency fund. It should be 3 to 6 months of your minimum living expenses. Put this in a bank money market account. Think of this as an insurance policy, something you never spend.  

Establish a long term savings account for major purchases. Amount varies depending on your goal.  If you're planning on purchasing a vehicle or real estate, put aside money to make that happen. 

There is good debt and bad. Stay out of ""bad debt"" like credit cards. Never put anything on a credit card that which you cannot pay off by the end of the billing cycle. 
A good credit rating is like gold in the bank. The better your credit, the better interest rate you get. Establish credit early and use it prudently. 

After you have a solid foundation on which to build  remember that savers are loosers, except for the intended goals stated above. Savings depreciate in value over time.  INVEST! Remember your 10%?  do more if you can. If you have an employer that will contribute matching funds into a retirement account, max it out!  A employer that offers tax deferred 401 k or 457, same thing.  Most all of them are in stock market mutual funds of some kind. That's not an option? Self directed Roth IRA.  Learn the magic power of compounding interest.

Choose investments wisely, investing is a little like gambling. You place your bet that a stock is going to rise in value, not fall. That real estate investment will rise in value. Do your homework. Due diligence pays dividends. I cannot stress the importance of this enough. Diversify your holdings, never put all of your shillings in one basket. I can't tell you what to buy, only what i would do at the moment. 

Stock markets are fluid and ever changing. With experience  comes foresight, the ability to pick more winning investments than loosing ones.  Look at the economy, look at trends. Especially look at investors like Warren Buffet. Emulate what successful investors like him do. If Buffet buys a gold mine and drops airline stocks from his portfolio, what should you do?  Create a power group. Surround yourself with people who know more about a subject than you but have similar goals. United we are strong. Always be willing to listen and learn from everyone. 

With love,
Just a grandpa...."

However, saying ETFs and broad market funds are like the bundled loans is kind of scary. I try to max my ROTH every year but fall kind of short considering I live on my own and go to school. 

Can anyone go into detail about the risks of say an S&P 500 index fund?"

2021-04-07 06:39:43,stocks,"Similar background here except my family didn't know or talk about stocks, finance, budgets - and that wasn't fun. 

I got a job with a Fortune 10 company eons ago & took advantage of the employee stock purchase program - and that changed by life. After that I was hooked on stock market investing. Along the way picked up a bit 'o wisdom but was unable to convince my immediate family (siblings) of how one could become much better off by investing in the stock market. 

I do wish fervently that budgeting and investing were taught in school - and by this I mean elementary, middle and high school. I taught my son in elementary school by helping him create a small portfolio when he was nine. I also showed him how to create reports to show gains/losses or dividends on an as needed basis. 

Keep preaching the good word!"

2021-04-07 09:55:25,stocks,"You had me interested until you said you thought broad market ETF’s were starting to look like bundled loan products from 2008. Huh?  

Broad market ETF’s track a broad market index. They are worth the NAV of the underlying stocks represented in that index. To say they’re going to implode is to say the broad market is going to implode. That may happen if the market is indeed overbought and the fundamentals no longer justify the valuations. But that would be the direct result of market conditions changing not because these products resemble sub prime CMO’s or whatever you were referring to. 

The recommendation of managed (expensive) ETF’s over index ETF’s is also questionable. Sure Ark funds have been killing it these last couple of years. But any circus monkey could throw darts at a board and choose winners these last couple of years. It’s not just me saying this, there’s numbers to support it. A tiny fraction of active money managers can consistently beat the market."

Invest in yourself. Knowledge. Learn how to do things on your own. Plant a garden. Don’t have the space?  Plant a tomato plant in a pot outside. Don’t like tomatoes?  Plant what you will eat.  Learn how to sew on a button, change a tire, basic home maintenance.  The more you can do for yourself, the more value you are to yourself and your loved ones.

2021-04-07 09:05:42,stocks,"Bro... no offense, but I'm 51 years old and I have been trading since the mid 1990s and let me give you my take

This is BS. None of this matters. Money laying on the ground didn't come about from ""some guys hard work"". It came from the Fed.. the Fed is where money comes from. As long as the Fed is adding money to the system, stocks will always go up

So, just put your money in whatever.. (doesn't matter).. Stonks go up.. the longer you put it in and the longer you hold it, the richer you become..

don't think you can time or outsmart the market.. you can't.. I like to trade because its fun.. but do I actually beat the market? Sure.. some months I do.. but other months I lose 20% while the market is up 5%. Its all just entertainment. Its gambling.. that's all it is.. its fun.. its entertainment.. don't think you are doing something productive with it. (just like gambling, you can learn how to be better at it than others.. but there is no system where you will always win or even win most of the time)

If the Fed starts to pull money out of the system or if we fight a war and the US loses dollar hegimony, then all of this will change and you will all lose money, no matter what.. and no matter how many books you read, etc... 

so, let's hope that doesn't happen.

BTW.. ironically enough, I noticed this story today.. this could be a significant game changer for the long term

Can’t beat long term tax deferral w long term compounding."

I know a lot of people who learned their finance on the go, some running successful businesses. None of them fully understands things like yield curves, derivatives, NPV or Black–Scholes.

The reason to learn it all the way is two fold:

1. It is a lot less time than you think if you take a real course. But can be infinite if you read random articles or watch youtube.
2. It is absolutely crucial for Americans living today. The system is set up that if you are not born to money and not good at finance you can be on the street.

This will also be helpful in every aspect of your life."

 Honestly I've saved thousands, literally thousands, of dollars just learning how to use an amortization calculator for my mortgage in combination with our monthly budget. We will save 80k in interest and be finished 15 years early. Learn about PMI and how to avoid it, and then avoid it. Even if that means renting a year or two longer. (Unless your rent is insanely higher than a mortgage with pmi and it eats your monthly income, this is a case by case basis depending on geography, income, and stability)

Please please please, like the OP OG posted, tons of these tools are free, I wish I could say I would've done the research on my own but that's a damn lie.

In other words, the rich get theirs, the rest can go fuck themselves. That’s why you see union jobs lowering every year since, pensions are a thing of the past. Job benefits are not as great. The average American only has $1k or less in savings. Living paycheck to paycheck. Wages stagnant for decades.

#1 is go with what you know. If you work for a company and believe in the future of where that company is going, what should you do? BUY IN. 
     This was the same advice I gave to a buddy 6 years ago who went to work for a hybrid tech-constuction-archecture company, as my poor ass cousin working at Walmart in nowhereville. You work there, you like it, buy it. 

If you are buying products from a company and you like them, don't you think other people are doing that too, and like them too? 

Buy what you know. 

I've been buying Corsair PC parts for maybe close to 20 years, they IPO, I bought that shit ... I've had their RAM in almost every PC I've built... damn right I bought their stock. Don't  care what its doing now, I know in 10 years is going higher. 

After that it's looking for value, or long term dividends. Yes, invest large cap... bit look for good products, after you find a good product look at the company and do your DD. 

Take door dash, good idea, good basis, looks good on paper .. dig a little deeper and its  trainwreck, mis managed, no customer service. It's way over valued and the hammer is coming down on these gig job companies. Ohhhh yea, not for me. Maybe they make it, but not my risk tolerance. 

That's what it is about, risk vs reward.  At the end of the day you win some, you lose some,  but you have to win more than you lose.... or you are broke."

Some people have concern that the index funds are used passively, meaning those 500 companies might be over-valued due to the fact that so many people are buying shares without actively looking at what they are buying.  And maybe that does juice the P/E of those components, but why would that lead to a crash?

Combine my theory with the fact that many people are lazy and like silver bullets, and ETFs cater to that, giving bang for buck and diversification too. This was from a thread about the many red days lately, what I think was an artificial boom, but its the human behaviour part that I think is relevant here. I'm curious to hear other peoples thoughts.

>W shaped recovery. I'm not in the US market, but I stopped buying last August through to the last month as I have had my suspicions about this for a while. My theory is this:

>Many people have been at home a lot over the last year due to covid, often spending less if they can work from home or if their area is largely closed, which for some has lead to a little spare cash to invest. Many Western countries have young people locked out of their housing markets, many of those would be home buyers will be looking for alternative investments (and possibly have more time to research investments if they're stuck at home), and there has been a rise in apps like sharesies that allows them to put the (relatively, for investing) tiny amounts of money they would usually spend on takeaways etc into shares, the overall effect of which has pushed prices up. A lot of investments related to ""trendy"" things like veganism, environmental stuff, Tesla, and that kind of thing have all experienced quite a bit of growth from what I've seen, though I will admit that I haven't looked too far into it, which fits with this idea as people usually invest in what they know.

>Combine this with younger people having notoriusly short attention spans these days and often poor ability to delay gratification, as well as often not being super financially stable and needing to draw from those investments to cover expenses - especially if they've lost their jobs in the later waves of lockdowns - and it's inevitable that they will start selling off what they've brought. It's not like a panic sell, just large numbers of small investors getting bored or broke and gradually selling off what they brought last year. That's what I reckon we are seeing at the moment and will likely see for the next few months."

2021-04-07 09:02:20,stocks,"There is no rule, but it's typically counter productive to purchase many ETFs when few will do. Think of it like this, VTI + VXUS (or something similar) should be the foundation. If you want to invest any of your dollars in something else, and there can be reasons to do so, you should have an argument/explanation for yourself as to why you think this other investment is a better place for some of your dollars. 

When you do this, you start to see that it's actually pretty hard to justify most investments beyond your core ETF holdings. So when you're tempted to buy a popular sector ETF, ask yourself to make the case for why you should divert funds away from the broad market ETFs that make up the foundation of your portfolio."

Great!  Oh it's got 2 years of runway off a few sales? Great!  Elephants are casually getting interested?  Amazing!

Heck even things I know are bad investments (Mining Discovery) are sometimes fun because it's not even so much about what's down there but what people think COULD be down there and how hyped they are about that. To me, this is degenerate gambling so I try to casually observe... but not always.

Even if it tanks, I don't feel the reverse of that. My natural state is always expecting the worst so it doesn't affect me at all me day to day.  Any money I put in, I would have the same emotional connection to as if I walked out and put it on the sidewalk at 8pm and went to sleep. I'll sleep just fine.

That is not most people. Some people can't think at all after work.  Some people just have no interest and would rather spend that time on other hobbies.

2021-04-07 16:52:20,stocks,"I am no expert either but this is the broad argument behind these sorts of comments as I understand it:

* The majority of the money in the market comes from passively invested individuals through their pension funds (Teachers Insurance and Annuity Association of America has the biggest portfolio in the market)
* As the market has recovered since the 2008 crash into such a bull run, valuations of companies in indexes like the S&P 500 increased to levels not seen since the dotcom bubble in 2000. Average price to earnings ratio historically has been 15 compared to 36.7 today
* If some event triggered a large correction in the market and generally less experienced individual investors decided to sell their equity holdings, companies who were included in indexes like the S&P 500 would be disproportionately affected as all that retail investor money got yanked out of the funds of a generation of baby boomers close to retirement
* Many much smarter people than me argue that the current values of many stocks in the S&P have become so detached from their earnings that indexes like the S&P constitute a bubble comparable to the 2007 housing market and consequent crash  (e.g. TESLA which will need to grow its its eps at a rate of 45% for the next 12 years in order to match its current valuation today at the average historic pe ratio)

TLDR: The S&P 500 is in a bubble and buying into index funds today is very risky, this chart shows the degree of the overvaluation [https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe](https://www.multpl.com/shiller-pe)"
2021-04-07 18:15:03,stocks,"Actually the problem with the bundled loans in 2008 wasn't the subprime loans, per se.  The prime loans would have more than covered the subprime, *as long as houses prices continued to rise or at least stay steady.*  The problem is that the whole housing market tanked, therefore not even the prime loans were able to pay up.  The prime loans, on their own, were very reliable, even in the event of the subprimes defaulting.  This is why people thought that the CDOs (bundled loans) were so genius.  The owners of the senior (prime) tranches basically couldn't lose.

But it was all based on the faulty assumption that brick and mortar never loses value.  The housing bubble eventually burst, and when it did, even the prime loans began to enter into default.  The CDOs were reliable in and of themselves, but nobody took into account the *systemic* risk of what would happen if the whole market, particularly the housing market, collapsed at once.

>The passive investors who buy index funds aren’t all at once (and all together) going to decide to sell them.

Why not?  This is *exactly* what happens in a panic.  If a panic comes, in this new age, investors won't be able to dump their low conviction plays and hold on to their blue-chips. No.  If they're all in index funds, they have no choice but to pull out of *everything.*  That means that all 500 companies in the S+P are going to get hit all at the same time.  Huge, huge systemic risk there.

I don't know if we're headed for 2008, but I think the rise of passive investing is uncharted territory, and potentially a cause for concern."

Today I was waiting for my mandatory 15 min after my COVID vaccine and talking to the guy who tells us when we can go. He bought TSLA at some insane low, went up some and he sold half, rolled the rest into his pre-teens collage account. Checks it once a month. Starts at 5k, then 10k, then 20k , then 40k, the 70k then he stopped telling me what it was worth... he sold 2/3 diversified it into big blue chips. Now in 3 years his son can afford to go anywhere he can get admission to. He kept 1/3 of his initial shares and has a FAT blue chip collage fund. 

He sold early, yea he could have had a LOT more $$, but risk vs reward. His risk wasn't worth knowing his son would be set, and good on him. Yea, he could have made more, but was it worth risking his son's  future? 

He didnt think so, he made an solid, informed decision and pulled the trigger. Good on him and good for his son. I call that a solid win.

That's the mentality it takes, know when your risk is ""tolerated"" and step back. Reevaluate and make your next move."

Humans have always been that way, it's just more visible than it used to be and the rise of investing outside of housing is making it impact the share market. I'm a little dubious but ultimately I think the rise of ETF's removes some of the potential harm as shares in a particular company can't just be dropped on a whim, and pretty well everyone knows the buy low sell high mantra, along with time in the market beats timing the market. There is a lot of solid advice being passed around investment forums."

2021-04-07 16:52:51,stocks,"Sounds good. Understanding your own psychology is so beneficial. We see a lot of people buying extremely volatile speculative stocks panicking when they're down a little. Those folks should probably choose a different investment strategy so they don't just panic sell every little dip. 

Myself, I get comfort from holding some dividend yielding stocks/ETFs in my portfolio. I like knowing a portion of my portfolio is productive even when the markets are down - even if I know there is a non-zero chance my strategy is sub-optimal."
2021-04-07 13:42:21,stocks,"They are definitely not all similar. Some track indices, such as the S&P 500 index for example, while others track specific sectors, etc. Some hold stocks from a particular country, others are broad across countries. So there is a wide variety of ETFs to choose from. 

Typically, people will have broad market index funds as the core of their portfolio. So for Americans, this is often VTI + VXUS, which is the whole American market plus the whole global market minus America. This gives one exposure to all sizes of companies in all regions of the world. This is the ultimate diversification strategy. 

From there, some people will choose supplemental ETFs to lean toward whatever they decide to lean into. ARK ETFs are very popular at the moment, clean energy, EVs, etc. are all very popular, but these ETFs may or may not be a good hold longer term, whereas core broad market ETFs will almost certainly be a good investment. The past isn't the future, but in the past, over any long period of time the markets grew. So going forward, if we buy the market (broad index funds), we will perform according to the market, which in the past always went up over long periods.

Someone contacted me, apologized, refunded my order (except the tip), and gave me free delivery on my next order of $10 or more from anywhere.

You should be able to open a taxable account with vanguard, they are a very credible broker. That is to say, keep building a portfolio in vanguard and not Robinhood. 

For example let’s take the ETF VTI. This etf tracks the performance of the entire domestic stock market. Vanguard buys small shares in each company and then packages it in this one security that you can purchase and gain exposure to the entire American market (for a very small fee). There are sector etfs (vnq, xlf, xlk) and ETFs that track certain indexes (qqq, spy, iwm). There is a tab in Robinhood for “ETFs” that will show you some of the most popular ETFs that make up portfolios."
2021-04-07 10:13:19,stocks,You can open a taxable account at the same brokerage as your Roth IRA. ETFs are just like stocks in that they have tickers you can look up and buy. Find one you like and pull the trigger. All they are is diversified funds with different allocations of stocks. Selling sets up a taxable event though in this account to try to hold for a year minimum. I’m sure you’ve heard of the ARK funds? ICLN? All ETFs. An index is similar but it tracks the market in some way. This would be SPY or QQQ for example. Would recommend looking up an equal weighted index fund rather than a weighted one like SPY as they have historically had better returns

Save money whenever you can because you are better than your friends who don't save money.  If your job has a 401(k) match, take it.  Contribute money to index funds whenever you have any money beyond what you need for a spartan lifestyle.  Don't pick individual stocks or sector ETFs, you probably suck at it.  Time in the market beats timing the market, so don't sell.  Watch the numbers on the screen grow alongside your age.  Eventually, retire smug."
2021-04-07 19:24:46,stocks,"That's a good point.

However, I don't think you can compare last year's crash to something like 2008.  Last year's crashed was obviously caused by the pandemic.  I'm sure most everyone had faith that the market would eventually recover.

In 2008 you were looking at something completely different.  We were facing the prospect of liquidity completely drying up and the economy going into cardiac arrest.  In a situation like that, even investors with a long time horizon may go into panic and sell off.  It didn't happen in '08 thanks to the bailout, but it could have.

Will we have another 2008 type event?  No idea.  But if we do, and people really panic, I do see some risk if passive investors all decide to dump their funds at once.

All of that said, I just did some quick google research, and most people who know what they're talking about seem to be on the same page as you.  I also don't know if a crisis so dangerous that even long-term investors drop out is totally realistic.  So I maintain a healthy level of skepticism but in general it looks like there's no need to sound any alarm bells."

New York Gov Cuomo has said he wants to run the state's sports betting industry through the New York Lottery, which is run by the government. Under his plan, the New York state Lottery would issue requests for proposals from only a few mobile betting operators, which it could then license out to other sportsbook operators.

This is somewhat different from how other states run online sports betting. States like Pennsylvania and New Jersey allow for several casinos to legally operate, forcing higher competition for customers.

In this case the state runs the lottery and the state gets the revenue. Stocks like DKNG up 2.52% after hours, MGM 1.13% AH, PENN 1.1% AH. 

As a long time DKNG holder I’m excited and hoping this can be a good catalyst. It’s only a matter of time as more and more states officially legalize online gambling.

The restrictions on stuff like gambling comes from the Puritan heritage of the founding fathers and other law makers from the 18th and 19th centuries. It was also fairly prevalent in the 20th century as well.

So, gambling is heavily restricted in America because of precedent. And precedent is very hard to overcome  in the US and takes years and years of slow changes."

Socialism has nothing to do with your gambling legislation. And even if it did, gambling in a socialist society might still be permitted so long as the proceeds are publicly owned (something that comes slightly close to this is the National Lottery in the UK were something like 30% of the revenue goes to charity, most of it to the cash prizes and only a small percentage of the revenues are available for private profit to the operator. In a socialist society, \*all\* profits would be returned to the public)."

1. Also, he thinks as shareholders, he doesn’t really think that we are ACTUAL owners of the company but rather just slaves and the company is just using our money to grow. He says this is so because other than dividends, we don’t really reap the benefits of the companies actual revenue as if we were self employed business owners. 

2. He says it is a Ponzi scheme and it makes no sense to buy stock at a price just to sell only when someone else wants to buy stock at a certain price. You are betting that someone will buy higher.

How should I respond?"

2021-04-07 01:04:51,stocks,"If you look at the history of the stock market you can answer this question easily. Stocks have value because they pay dividends. A steady steam of money obviously has a total value that other people would be willing to buy from you for the right price. Just like real estate you can charge rent, it's similar. These days most stocks don't pay dividends, but they could in the future. These stocks are called 'growth stocks' because you are betting that they will grow and then eventually pay a nice dividend. Not all do, so it's a speculative bet for traders who think that they will, and sometimes it pays off. Everything that happens between a company IPO and it paying a regular dividend is the realm of trader speculation, but it's not a ponzi scheme."

Real estate can be a good investment too, but again you have to compare risk, reward, and with real estate the ""cost"" of time involved. I've owned real estate and for me the stress and work involved was not worth it to me. I'm better served doing my day job and investing in equities on the side."

You don’t actually own Hank Aaron.  You can’t hang out in his living room.  You can’t even call him up for baseball advice.   (were he still alive)

You essentially own a piece of paper with his name on it.  One that people are willing to give you money for.

Stocks are pieces of paper that people are willing to give you money for.

The difference is that a financial megastructure has been built around those pieces of paper and their value.  

So I won’t wake up one day to the stock market suddenly worth zero forever going forward.

If you buy land you are taking a chance it will go down in value.

If you buy stock you are taking a chance it will go down in value.

Everyone is hoping in 10 years it will go up and all is well.

Most people aren’t actually buying a house they are buying the ***opportunity to owe the bank money for 30 years***.

Buying a house costs extra money every single month even if it’s fully paid for and the deed is fully yours.

I can’t sell 2 sqft of my property.  I might be able to pull some funny stuff with my loan to get a couple bucks and dig my way deeper into debt.

Sure, when I buy a stock I’m just buying a piece of paper.  (Paper they don’t even send you anymore unless you ask.) 

But that piece of paper is mine all mine.  It has no maintenance fees associated with it, I can sell small portions of my total holdings whenever I want. 

And the interest isn’t me paying a bank, it’s a dividend paid to me.

~~

Your friend isn’t wrong that there is money to be made playing landlord or flipping houses.

You aren’t wrong that there is money to be made buying smart and waiting for the right time to sell.

If you both start with 10k, whose got more after tax profit in 3 years?

That’s the question your friend would be wise to research.

Your math is easy.  Your friends math will take an extensive spreadsheet and pile of water bills and maintenance/renovation receipts to calculate.

Your path is certainly far simpler.  Set it and mostly forget it.

~~

In the event of total apocalypse, sure, electricity will be gone, and people likely won’t be trading stocks.  But unless your friend is hiring security detail for all their properties, perceived ownership won’t matter either.

Yes, individual stocks are more of a gamble. But the overall stock market is generally correlated to the growth of the US economy. So, someone who buys real estate is also tying themselves long term to the state of the US economy.

2021-04-07 07:38:43,stocks,"Pump and dumps are effectively Ponzi schemes and when market goes way above intrinsic value then sure, it shares similar characteristics to a Ponzi scheme. Which goes for both stocks and real estate. The mechanism for price appreciation in general between stocks and real estate is the same - ie how much some one is willing to pay for it so his argument is moot. 

Most retail real estate investors make far more money these days from appreciation of home values than from the income from the cash flow received from renting out anyways. And it’s gotten to a point that cap rate for some metro areas are even negative (if you’re getting in now) solely relying on appreciation to build wealth. So effectively these two assets generate value very similarily even if his argument is true.

Stocks does not need to distribute cash dividends to return value to shareholders. They can also buy back shares or reinvest in more productive capacities to generate value for shareholders. Now “how can you guarantee as investors we reap the benefits”? Simple, a stock will have value the same reason cash has value. Because everyone believes in the general principals of what gives it value. For stocks That means earnings, assets, growth, dividends, buybacks etc. The system of ownership in a company is also backed by the full faith of the legal system in which the company is incorporated in giving stocks legitimacy and stock owners undeniable rights to the ownership of the company. 

So there you have it. If stocks are a Ponzi scheme and has no value then neither is real estate or even cash in general.

I’m actually the opposite of him. I don’t feel like owning real estate gives me wealth simply because converting that wealth to cash is both expensive, time consuming, and annoying. Stocks on the other hand I can sell in 2 seconds and that becomes actual cash with almost no cost."

I'm not saying you have to stop being friends with him but definitely stop discussing finances with him. He clearly can't see the difference in buying stocks waiting for it to appreciate and selling it for a higher price is pretty much the same thing as buying real estate waiting for it to appreciate and selling it for a higher price. 

Hell even writing this brief reply my brain is hurting just thinking about how dense this person is.. you are better off not wasting your time and energy trying to save someone who much prefers to drown in their own ignorance then reach out for the lifeboat of enlightenment.

However, if that factory appreciates to 100 mil, I will be able to sell my stake to an interested party for 2 dollars.

This is really a personal and risk question though. Economic theory would probably have you compare your loan interest rate with what you think you can get in the market and put money to whatever is highest. Personally my risk tolerance was low and wanted to pay off student debt even with a very low rate. In retrospect the market would have paid me a few grand more but I don’t regret my decision."
2021-04-07 00:25:43,stocks,"It depends on the interest rate of the loan and the risk and rate of return on the investment.

2021-04-07 05:16:55,stocks,"reducing debt should be number 1 priority. 

depending on returns of investements and interest in loans, usually interest is higher than returns.  
also, only one thing is is guaranteed: the interest you have to pay. market returns are not guaranteed. yes, statistically - on average- the market (S&P) returns about 9-10% / year. but what about slower years or years with a dip ? 

another problem with not paying student debt:   
student debts are not money for you to invest. its money you already owe but cannot use to make money with (thats the major difference between borrowing money to invest and not paying off existing debt).

you only have salary or any other form of income to pay off debt"

There's also the question of whether they'll be forgiven by the government, which will likely happen at some point in the future (at least a sizable portion.)

It's not really an easy question to answer without knowing the specifics of your situation."
2021-04-07 00:22:59,stocks,"It depends. For example, if you're paying 10% a year in loan interest, but can make 20% a year trading stocks, it makes more sense to trade stocks."

Obviously, right now all federal loans are in hold. Let's see what Biden makes happen in this front too. I made a few big payments on mine just to feel good last year, now regretting it to some extent."
2021-04-07 07:50:32,stocks,Pay the loan ASAP. Interest accrues regardless of whether you stop paying because of some kind of financial emergency. You can never declare bankruptcy and have the loan forgiven. It follows you to the grave. You never know what could happen down the road. Pay the loan off sooner rather than later.

My income has gone up,  and my fixed rate loan payment has stayed the same.   Just do a quick calculation,  assume you put the extra money in VOO every month for the last 10 years,  would you have made more than the amount you paid in interest on your loan over that 10 years?  Compare putting $100/month to your loan vs the same amount in VOO,  then decide."

If you hate your loans (depending on your age/upbringing, many feel they were misled) pay the min. and defer as much as possible. Invest instead and do it out of principle. Have fun investing and learn. Pay off your loans eventually when you come across some money randomly you feel you didn't deserve and aren't as attached to yet. 

Not the best financial decision but I'd be dead inside if I was prioritizing paying off my loan rather than building a little wealth too."
2021-04-07 10:47:32,stocks,"IMO pay down your debt first. There is no guarantee that your investments are going to make your money, but there is a guarantee that you will owe more money the more you defer payments on your loans. Unless the Biden administration forgives it that is."
2021-04-07 10:55:09,stocks,"Alternate theory, but not totally contrarian to the 'pay off debt' mantra- I left graduate school in the middle of a major recession with 40K in student debt, absolutely no money, no financial support, and no jobs in my field. That debt is now in default, as I was way too poor for the first few years to pay them as I was a line cook again - BUT, through clever investment and collection of rare physical objects bought and sold for cash, I own a home that I paid for in full with no mortgage. I pay about $1,000 per YEAR in property taxes to live in a modest home in major American city. This has allowed me to build a healthy investment portfolio as well as to make capital investments in a home studio which will continue to provide returns through my creative labor (not to mention major tax benefits). 

My student loans are still there, but that's my only debt- and they can literally sue me for it at this point. Actually, they have- all they can do is garnish wage income at the moment and even that has been suspended during the pandemic. Fine. Let them. I have so little wage income that its irrelevant to my bottom line. 

I'm of the mind that the way much of the world has extended student loan debt is philosophically immoral and economically counterproductive. This is also a problem likely to be ameliorated through policy soon enough. Debt relief is being seriously considered in a number of governments and I think that will be a huge boost to the economy when it happens. The lenders can go fuck themselves for their greed and the damage that their predatory loans have done to two generations is unconscionable. 

To sum up- cut housing costs, don't accrue any more of any kind of debt, avoid wage income, invest in capital goods and trust your skills, set up an investment portfolio even if it's your last $5, finally, be paitent- the only capital you'll have access to is your own and that will take time and sacrifice to build. 

And get an accountant as soon as you can afford it, they pay for themselves many times over."

that was practically free money.

i borrowed 150k for school even though I had the cash to pay it entirely. Back then I consolidated at \~2% interest, and I'm still paying off the loan today, $186 every month."

2021-04-07 02:35:47,stocks,"I once asked myself this same question, and I had the funds to pay it off completely, but paying off is idiotic.

the opportunity cost is too great. You're passing up free money.

a recent college grad should build their credit history by paying off the student loan as SLOWLY as possible.

Also inflation deflates the value of the loan over time.

&#x200B;

invest no matter what.

recent interest rates have only been around 4-5%

You are highly likely to make more parking the cash in the stock market index funds"

2021-04-07 07:35:00,stocks,I guess the idea being the percentage of your investment gains out weigh the interest rate of the loan? Even then I'd want that loan gone as fast as possible
2021-04-07 03:20:53,stocks,"Yup, totally get it and weighed the returns I would probably get in the market (and the off chance a market correction would hit). I just don’t like having that student debt hanging over me and it was worth it to me personally to pay it off. I had a 1.9% interest on it.

Personal decision and tolerance for risk. Hindsight is 20/20 on these things with how the market turned out."
2021-04-07 03:55:06,stocks,Just remember what happened to the people that followed this strategy in March of 2000 and November of 2008. It usually works out but there’s no such thing as short term free money in the equities markets. All depends on OP’s risk tolerance. But do agree with the statement that you are likely to make more parking the cash in the stock market index funds.
2021-04-07 07:50:45,stocks,"You're not passing up free money, it's a loan. And it's not a free loan either. You could (can you? would you?) take out a loan and just invest. When I went to university a lot of people who got full scholarships took out student loans and invested into real estate cause the interest was better than a mortgage and no downpayment."

2021-04-07 07:47:27,stocks,"Yup. Two reason I regret paying off some of my loans - the market kept kicking ass, and I'm under $50k, which is within the foreseeable possibly of being forgiven by the Biden team - far more likely though only $10k, if any, will be forgiven. 

When you pay off debt, you free up that money to be used anyway you want. It is not a future sunk cost. If you need to move here or there - you can. Invest, tackle a future emergency, go on that vacation for you mental health, take out a mortgage.  Being debt free is so much more than just the straight opportunity cost of gain on investing vs. interest payments."

If you plan on sticking to that, I don't know if it's necessarily the way to go to switch them all to FZROX. I was looking at the expense ratios of yours, and they're pretty low. I know things add up, but it's worth doing back-of-the-napkin math to see how much that would cost you eventually.

For nost of the advice I have seen regarding expense ratios, it's usually in the order of 0.015% vs 2.3% or something like that, not 0.015% to 0%.

Also, this is all considering these are in your Roth IRA so transactions should not incur any tax events, if my understanding is correct (a reminder to take all online opinions, anonymous or not, with a grain of salt). If you were talking about a regular individual portfolio, I would have suggested you don't do any switching because the capital tax hit would have made it pretty hard to make it worth it."

I realize never is pushing it, but I'm 47 and so for me never may be literally true.  My portfolio now consists of about 19% AAPL and MSFT and I got to thinking if I had to worry about this .

I thought what if Microsoft or Apple ever went bankrupt and I lose 19% of my portfolio?!

Then I thought - Could either REALLY go bankrupt?

My answer was for all intents and purposes - NO NEVER.

Am I right for the most part?

I tell myself that as long as I get 10% a year from either of them I'm ok.  Heck even 5% is more than my bank account!  Although I think I should hopefully get a little better than that.

So REALISTICALLY . Do you think either of these companies will totally go out of business in the next 10 years or so?

Is it realistically possible for all intents and purposes?

So should I just keep buying msft and AAPL regardless 😆?"

Have you seen what they have done with Teams?  It is what Einstein dreamed of doing with the Unifying Theory….Microsoft may have made the Unifying Software with Teams. It is pretty incredible. I have never used Zoom, but I know it is not even close to Team’s in functionality. Teams unifies Sharepoint, O365, Chat, Web, OneNote, and OneDrive all in one place. 

Then everyone knows Excel rules as a Microsoft product. It is one of those products that is a vocabulary word all by itself.  If you are an Excel guru and have been following its metamorphosis you should be really impressed. VBA, Macros and formulas are now obsolete. Power Query is where it is at. You can skip learning formulas and there is no need for VBA and macros anymore. Power Query does all that for you, and when you are ready to move to big data they have PowerBI. 

PowerBI is insanely impressive. When the next generation of workers masters data with Excel and PowerBI, a Kraken of discovery may be released on non-tech corporations. PowerBI, Excel and PowerQuery create a triumvirate that allows grassroots manipulation of data and data creation that can quickly scale to enterprise level and the triumvirate also allows enterprise data to be digested at the lowest level. 

PowerBI, Power Query, Excel and Teams have quietly left the competition in the dust."

Apple owns the world of smartphones and their global market is still rapidly expanding. Not to mention if Apple is successful in releasing a high end EV it will only help.

As much as I’d like to see Microsoft or windows again, neither company is going anywhere short term. They’re both to the point now of conducting buybacks for the purpose of increasing dividends.

Nothing is for sure but the probability of either going under anytime soon is very low.

Just to compare, think of companies like Xerox and Kodak that had their heyday in the 70s and eventually died or became a acquisition that was a shadow of their former glory. Even more recent, companies like DEC and Sun. Sun was near the peak of it's awesomeness in 2000 and 9 years later got acquired by Oracle for single digit billions.

Don't get me wrong - this is still bad, but way less so than M9.0 or higher (remember, it's a logarithmic scale!).

Also, it's generally thought that 9.0 and above earthquakes can only occur in subduction zones (a convergent plate boundary). And the San Andreas is not one of these.

Edit: Actually, I guess you're referring to the Cascadia Subduction Zone...? which *could* produce a 9.0 earthquake... but it is located off the PNW coast roughly between Vancouver and Seattle.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Is Inflation Making a Comeback? **By** [**Fernando Martin**](https://research.stlouisfed.org/econ/martin/sel/)**, Research Officer and Economist**

[https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback)  


The average price level dropped sharply during the early stages of the COVID-19 pandemic and has gradually recovered since then. As a result, annual inflation has remained low:

* The 12-month change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index reached 0.5% in April 2020, its smallest increase that year.
* Core PCE inflation (which excludes food and energy) registered 0.9% in the same month.

Since then, both measures have remained well below the Federal Reserve’s 2% annual inflation target.

## Recent Trends in Inflation

By January, both PCE and core PCE price indexes were back to their pre-COVID-19 trends. This suggests an interesting exercise: Assuming prices remain on trend, what will inflation be in 2021? We can think of this exercise as informing us of the “mechanical” inflation resulting from things returning to normal.

The figure below shows actual PCE inflation and projected inflation for the remainder of the year.[1](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) I projected inflation by taking the PCE price index from 2015 to 2019 and projecting it onward, and then calculated future inflation as the growth rate between the projected index and the *actual* price index from 12 months prior.



https://imgur.com/a/aLQydnj

As we can see, these estimates project annual inflation above 2% for three months (March, April and May) and converging back to the pre-pandemic average towards the end of the year.

Given the new framework for monetary policy adopted last August, this temporary and mild rise of inflation would be consistent with the Fed’s objective, stated as “following periods when inflation has been running persistently below 2 percent, appropriate monetary policy will likely aim to achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time.”[2](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) In other words, we should not expect the Fed to react to this temporary rise in inflation.

## Inflation Hints from Other Macroeconomic Variables

The exercise I conducted assumes prices will follow their pre-pandemic trend. However, the pandemic and the policies implemented to combat it have significantly altered the economic landscape. Might these changes imply even higher inflation?

The following series of figures display several key macroeconomic variables, which articulate various views on inflation. All these variables suggest the presence of further inflationary pressures.

### Inflation Expectations

We can think of inflation as a self-fulfilling prophecy where actual inflation depends on expected inflation. This view is shared by many central banks to explain long-run inflation. In this view, a successful central bank anchors inflation expectations around its target for inflation. The figure below shows one measure of expected inflation: the difference in the annual yields of five-year Treasury notes and five-year Treasury inflation-protected securities (TIPS).[3](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/BO7JvJ8

According to this measure, expectations about future inflation have been rapidly accelerating. This may be due in part to the adoption of the new monetary policy framework, as the market now understands that the Fed will let inflation temporarily rise above a 2% annual rate to make up for lost ground. However, it is a variable that deserves close monitoring, especially if it goes significantly above the Fed’s target.

### Unemployment

The so-called Phillips curve states a negative relationship between inflation and unemployment. The theory—popular among central banks—leads one to expect higher (lower) inflation as the economy strengthens (weakens). As such, it is mostly used to explain cyclical variations in inflation around some long-run value.

The next figure shows two measures of unemployment:

* The official unemployment rate
* The U-6 rate, which includes those marginally attached to the labor force or employed part time for economic reasons



https://imgur.com/a/UEXkJyo

Both measures have recovered significantly but remain elevated relative to the pre-COVID-19 period. If the economy continues its strong recovery, unemployment is expected to fall even further, which would imply inflationary pressures.

Note, however, that the empirical relationship between inflation and unemployment has diminished significantly in recent years—if not altogether disappeared—and may not be relevant for the current episode, just as it was not during the previous recession.[4](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)

### Monetary Aggregates

Monetarism is the theory that relates the price level to some monetary aggregate (e.g., currency) and inflation to the growth rate of monetary aggregates. In a modern economy, currency accounts for a small fraction of transactions, so economists look at “broader” monetary aggregates. The figure below shows two such aggregates (M2 and MZM), which both grew significantly between February and May 2020.[5](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#)



https://imgur.com/a/S3t7vhG

These increases coincided with the rise in personal savings during the same period, as households not only received substantial transfers from the federal government but also found it difficult to spend as they normally would.[6](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) These additional savings likely imply a surge in the demand for goods and services as the economy returns back to normal, which would put upward pressure on prices.

How much prices increase due to this pent-up demand will also depend on how nimble supply is, and there are good reasons to believe that the recovery in supply may trail demand. Regardless, as evidenced in the chart, this channel would likely have a temporary (rather than permanent) effect on inflation.

### Federal Debt

Various theories link prices or inflation to the level of debt and expected future fiscal surpluses. Though their mechanisms vary, they all predict higher prices or inflation as debt rises. The final figure shows the federal debt in the hands of the public (net of Fed holdings), which rose significantly between March and June 2020.



https://imgur.com/a/LHUcqH4

As with monetary aggregates, debt increased sharply in level, but its growth rate afterward remains roughly the same. As such, the effects, if any, will materialize as a temporary increase in inflation. However, note that current projections estimate deficits to remain large and growing as a fraction of the economy.[7](https://www.stlouisfed.org/on-the-economy/2021/april/inflation-making-comeback#) This trend may put additional pressures on future inflation.

## Conclusion

In the coming months, it is likely that inflation will rise above 2% on an annual basis for a few months. We should neither be surprised nor expect the Fed to react.

However, several reasons point to further inflationary pressures. If these pressures materialize and prove persistent, the Fed will have to eventually step in to lower inflation and achieve its goal of 2% average inflation.

On the other hand, inflation may fail to materialize—as it has in the past—and instead return to its pre-pandemic average. In such a case, the Fed will face a choice: either continue to tolerate persistently undershooting its own target or adopt policies to deliberately raise inflation.

Until interest rates go up we’ll likely hover around this mark especially considering government spending. Once they do hike I’m sure we’ll feel a hard aftershock in equity markets. Until then equity markets are going to keep riding the wave of volatility. My biggest fear is how lending practices have been loosened in concurrence with longterm high inflation.

For reference my current portfolio is

VTI- 57.5%

SCHD-10%

QQQM- 10% (aka QQQ)

SCHF- 10% (International)

QQQJ- 7.5%

VWO- 5% (International emerging market)

But if the US has consistently out performed the International for 120 years (a statement from another post...) are you really going to allocate 20-40% of your portfolio just as a what if? I dont understand the thats performance chasing when a fund has consistently out performed (its not like we are suggesting ARK which had one killer year...). How is it performance chasing to buy into US market when it is consistently a few % higher return? Are you really going to allocate 20-40% of your portfolio to a lower % return in hopes that one or two of those years it does better? What about the other years where us out performs again? Are you going to wish you had such a high weight International? Definitely not. I have 15% to International right now and SERIOUSLY struggle with it. 

I struggle with this when people say QQQ is performance chasing... QQQ has out performed VTI/ VT for the last 10+ years by usually a large amount. Why wouldnt you invest at least a small % in that? Sure tech isnt going to run like 2020 but itll still run consistently for many years. Even after this correction we just had QQQ is performing like its old self. 

Then VTI vs. SCHD.... this one i can see the performance chasing aspect cause its only outperformed VTI for 3 years but has outperformed VT for 5+ (no further back data on etf.com). 

I struggle with this and bonds too... take a fund like BND which many hold/ recommend. VTI has performed 3x-5x it depending on the year. I get that some use this as a play so the money is in the market and lower risk of losing money as they get older so that if they need to pull it they can hopefully be green. But whats the point of taking a risk (especially in 2021) of taking the risk of investing in the bond market which could do something crazy and go negative for a measily 2% return? 

I wanna learn and understand but like i said i feel like the well you cant predict the market or you are performance chasing is super hypocritical and is used to make sense of holdings International. Maybe im just naive? If we cant use the 10+ years of performance as a benchmark what are we supposed to use?"

2021-04-07 06:44:41,stocks,"THE US markets develop faster because the US are usually easier to hype up. 

jokes aside: 

I am from germany and even though we have extremely profitable and well respected companies here and the EU overall, we rarely see the level of growth. 

  
I thought about this one myself and I invest almost 100% of my portfolio in US securities. being ETF´s or individual stocks.   


here is an example: 

  
take SAP:  its the defacto worldwide market leader  for ERP sytems.   
the german stock is up 56% since it was publicly traded.   
the NASDAQ equivalent is 1000% up since inception. and thats the same freakin company.   


if anyone can explain this to me, then please do so.   


but I would be stupid to invest in german stocks."
2021-04-07 16:21:43,stocks,"Europoor checking in :-)  


TL:DR - many things play into how the markets will perform and I think EU and Emerging markets will do good in the comming 5-10 years.

I have 2 accounts - one that I don't mess around with and that holds some funds that consists of Value stocks, Global stocks, a mix fund of gold, bonds, stocks, and a fund of HY company bonds. Chose to give some diverstion in that portefolio. And then I have placed a few stocks form companies from my contry that I believe long term in.  


My second account is more a ""fun"" one, for meme stocks and what else I like to try, so also some serious stocks in thise one. It mostly consists of stocks from the US, but it also contains stocks from Germany and Norway.  


I think that you are fine with also holding some global stocks/fund. My reasoning is, that while the US has been outperformning for a long time, it is no gurantee it will continue. It think one reason the US has been outperforming is that you one country with a massiv economy and tho you also have a stock exchange in Chicago? most is located in NY. Now take EU, you have 27 member states each with their own stock exchange. Don't underestimate the patriotic feeling of national companies - think like disney, a stock many americans like to hold, same in most european countries e.g in Denmark it is Vestas (wind mills) or Novo (meds).  


Before the days of trading apps, most ppl bought stocks at the national stock exchange unless you were wealthy, meaning money was pretty located investing wise. Now money flow more freely so to say between the countries and I think that will push EU to gain more momemtum in the stock market - ofc some of it will also flow towards the US, but I see EU gain more and more.  


Also many EU countries have negativ interest rates - like in Denmark if we have more than 100,000 Danish kroner - roughly 15,000 dollar in a savings account, we have to pay for it. So more and more ppl are now placing their money in the stock market. To give you an idea In the scandinavian countries one of the trading apps is called Nordnet in 2020 they had 200,000 costumers, in the first 3 months of 2021 they have added another 60,000 accounts. And nordnet is not a major bank, so I can only wonder how many have taking up trading through their banks.  


So slowly EU countries will start to get a stock/trading cluture, we have not been that used to that imo compared to the US where it seems like god and everyone have been trading stocks.  
And as that build up and with the neativ interest rates, I think stock markets in EU in the comming 5-10 will close in on the US if not outperform the US. I will be betting on Germany as I think more and more of the older population there will also join the stock market. So I will be opening a position in a fund with a focus on EU stocks.  


Emerging markets - abit the same, more and more ppl comming into stock market plus a middel class that is growing in many of those countries imo will mean, that those markets will also rise. Afterall Asia is the region with most ppl so many companies will benefit from a rising middelclass.  


Another thing that can also play in is if Biden is allowed to rise the corp taxes to 28% here in Denmark they are 21%, and I think many EU countries are in the same range, so if companies in these contries gets to keep more of their money for the stock holders compared to companies in the US, that will make those companies more attactive to investors.  


So like some said in the post the past doesn't tell you all you need to know, as there are many things that can influence the markets, and I think EU and Emerging markets should not be neclected as they will grow."
2021-04-06 23:21:32,stocks,"For US vs International I totally hear you and you have a point. It’s more of a diversifying thing than a gains chasing thing. If you want maximum  gains only then historically you’d be best going 100% US Equities. You also get hit harder in particular years when US Equities are stressed. 

As for bonds, I think you have the wrong understanding of what bonds are for. You don’t chase capital appreciation at all with BND. Their primary purpose is to provide the guaranteed monthly payout with minimal capital risk. They have the secondary benefit of maintaining their value in a crash so you can cash some out and buy stocks at a discount. They serve a totally different purpose than stocks."

For the record, I am against the stock split.  GE has 7.5 billion shares outstanding with 13.2 billion shares authorized. How did these numbers get so big? After the stock split they estimate there will be 1.1 billion shares outstanding and 1.65 billion shares authorized. So after the split, 2/3 of the stock will be outstanding and 1/3 float.

Then there is the question of fractional shares. Right now GE is not planning on issuing fractional shares.

2021-04-07 13:45:49,stocks,"The authorized shares are the total number of shares that the company could have issued. The shares outstanding are shares that were issued. The float is that portion of the shares outstanding that aren't held by the company or company insiders, and are therefore liable to be traded at any time.

According to your numbers about 2/3 of the authorized shares are outstanding. They'd have to do a share issue to change that number, but they wouldn't have to get shareholder approval to do that share issue. Checking elsewhere nearly 100% of the outstanding shares are in the float. A split or reverse split won't do a thing to change these ratios.

For whatever reason they're deciding to reverse split in order to make the stock price higher and the number of shares lower. It's interesting that they've waited this long to do it considering the stock price was much lower last Summer. Maybe now that they're out of the single digits they don't want to go back into the single digits. So they're trying to set a price near 100 so that if they drop by 50% again the price will be $50 and not $6.

TLDR: ""Can (the rest of) Big Auto catch up to *Tesla*?"" will still be a relevant question once it is relegated to second-place market share, because by this point they certainly won't catch up to the future market leader, Volkswagen.

2021-04-06 23:16:07,stocks,Why is everyone assuming that it won’t all end being the same as it is now. Different companies will lead in different parts of the world. There will be 8-10 huge auto makers and some will lead in sedans while others will lead in trucks and others in SUVs. In 20 years it will look like it will now just more EV and not a lot of ICE but I highly doubt you’ll just have 2 big automakers and a few scraps everywhere else.

2021-04-07 02:12:23,stocks,No one manufacturer is going to run away with this in the same way that no one ice manufacturer does today. Cars are going electric and every manufacturer is going with it. People like their brands and it’s likely a lifelong VW owner will buy a VW EV . Personally I’ve only owned one VW and it was a great car but incredibly boring. I currently have a Tesla and it’s both a great car and exciting to own. VW will probably win the battle regarding production numbers but it’s highly unlikely they will offer the prestige or cutting edge features that Tesla has. It’s too straight laced for that . Most legacy auto makers are.

2021-04-06 23:26:41,stocks,"Yeah it’s a solid idea.   Only problem is the market knows about it.   As someone who tried it, it’s very challenging to find and fill a deep ITM order that puts you at break even on the stock.   So the next step is finding one that puts you still profitable after the dividend is collected.   
The bid ask is usually too wide to get a fill when you need it to happen.  And then, you have to let the contract expire or get exercised to maximize profits, and that can mean waiting a full month if they don’t sell weeklies.  
In the end I gave it up because I was tying up thousands of dollars to make 7 bucks over a month, and there’s better uses of your money."
2021-04-07 12:35:46,stocks,"> How long do you need to hold to get the dividend?  


You need to own it before the ex-dividend date. You can sell on or after the ex-dividend date and still get the dividend. 


However realize that on the ex-date the price of the share falls by the amount of the dividend on opening. I don’t do options, but I’ve heard your options drop by the dividend as well."

2021-04-07 11:16:02,stocks,"This was a great read (only halfway through so far but I'll finish by the end of the day) thank you for doing this. I'm probably one of the rare people on here that was into Poshmark before I got interested in investing so here is my personal insight FWIW.

Back in the summer of 2018 I had a goal of selling one Reformation dress I didn't mean to buy at one of their sample sales. I knew about poshmark and depop but for whatever reason I can't recall now, I chose to list it on Poshmark. (Maybe it was the fact they took care of shipping, whereas with depop it was up to the buyer/seller to coordinate shipping labels and that aspect will completely turn me off even if it means I'm making money) Long story short, not only did I sell this dress I hated, I made more money than I bought it for. I started listing more random things I could find in my closet that I didn't like anymore, and at this point I've ""made"" about $3,500 from passive selling. I do have *a lot* of clothes but this is in no way a business for me, just a means of getting rid of unwanted clothes. I never thought I would be using this app long-term like this, I don't even care for the ""social"" aspects of it but goddamn, it works. When I spend time (usually while watching TV) ""sharing"" other peoples' listings, and they in turn share mine, my sales go up. I can't explain it but clearly something is working here.

When I talk to friends who are more interested in the fashion scene than I am, they say depop is definitely the cooler app, esp among Gen z. (we're millennials) At this point, I have about 300 listings in my poshmark closet, and I've been doing just fine, and won't be switching. (this is from the sellers' perspective, obviously as a buyer you can jump around from app to app no problem) I think there is a space for many reselling platforms, and I certainly don't think poshmark is going anywhere anytime soon esp with the infrastructure they've built. I think poshmark should incentive sellers to become buyers on their platform, say, instead of taking a 20% cut for me to cash in my sales, they take a 15% cut and turn my sale money into ""poshmark bucks"" or credit or what have you. 

When I read financial analysts' comments on $posh and they say things like ""why wouldn't you just use Ebay or Facebook Marketplace"" for me personally, I've don't shop for clothes on ebay. about 5 years ago, there was a pair of Frye boots I wanted that were sold out everywhere and eventually I found them on ebay and did buy them but I remember thinking it was weird to buy clothes/shoes on ebay. i think of ebay for tools and antiques, not clothes. and fb marketplace? am I supposed to drive 1.5 hours to the town over to pick up a top I like from some girl selling it maybe $20 less than I could get it in the store? no thanks. clearly these analysts don't understand this app

Anyway, I'm basically brand new to investing, I have about 55 shares of POSH at the moment, I bought in when I thought there was a dip at like $65, clearly it kept dipping so I've been able to average down to $46/share. I'm going to wait till it dips below $40 again to get more. I don't really understand how shorting works, I see the chart, but it cuts off at the end of March. How do we know if it is still being shorted?"
2021-04-07 08:36:24,stocks,"Before you invest, bear in mind the turnover of the comany TTM is 262M. And the total compensation for the CEO COO and CFO total $12.8M per year combined. Serious red flag for a company with only 4M in earnings and a 92.5% debt to equity ratio.  


However I will be considering taking a small position in the near future."

2021-04-07 09:32:19,stocks,Bought POSH at IPO Bc GF uses all the time. Sold a few days later when it went from like 100 to 80. Just looked at price after saw this post and it’s in the 40s. Yikes
2021-04-07 15:56:25,stocks,"Thanks for this, love to see detailed DD like this on the sub. Lots to go through. Some commenters have mentioned competition by Depop, it's worth nothing that Poshmark is still comfortably ahead and the way bigger company, all the while still being tiny compared to the total fashion market and/or the fashion e-commerce opportunity. The IPO price was pretty ludicrous, but at USD 40 I'm kinda interested.

&#x200B;

Actually it seems that in Australia, Poshmark is neck and neck with Depop, and in Canada they're doing great despite just launching 2 years ago (way ahead of Depop and even Etsy or Ebay). It looks like they have a pretty good playbook for expanding to countries, if they do that successfully in UK/Europe, this could be a great stock opportunity. There is technically a lot of competition, but many of those companies (RealReal, Thredup, Depop, Mercari, etc.) were all actually founded at the same time as Poshmark and today have significantly fewer sellers and users than Poshmark. Network effects for marketplaces are quite big, so I think if you believe in fashion-ecommerce and reselling overall, Poshmark is probably the best horse to bet on."

Based on my own experience and others in my community (I am networked with a ton of resellers), our favorite places to resell are: 1) Poshmark 2) eBay 3) Mercari 4) Depop 5) FB Marketplace 6) Tradesy ..Also, we get A LOT of our inventory from Thredup which recently IPOed. You can get killer deals there. They also make massive profits fleecing people who send in items. An example. Random Becky ships them a shirt, ThredUp gives them a measly $1, and then ThredUp turns around and sells it next day on their site for $50."

According to them, they hardly get any traffic and when they do get interest, people lowball them like crazy so they prefer to sell on Poshmark because the userbase on Posh usually is willing to spend a lot more money. Depop target audience seems to be high schoolers and college students buying so I guess that's part of it.

I will definitely look into them more though. Reselling is my second job and I make over 100,000 a year. This last year Poshmark has easily been the most lucrative."

Poshmark is a resale marketplace.  They do not produce or sell a product.  They provide a service to people who sell clothing online in exchange for a percentage of the sale.  Not a MLM at all.  More like Ebay.  There is some social aspect to the marketplace, but it is a marketplace first."

If you expect to need the money in five years, it shouldn’t be in the stock market. You may want to look at several bond funds, including good-quality corporate and junk bonds. 

Other than that, longer term savings can go into index funds, such as VTI, and for retirement, depending on where you live, a target-date/lifecycle fund may be best."
2021-04-06 23:40:47,stocks,If you don’t need the money for 5 years then Honestly spy is a good buy. Yes snp might dip below 4K between now and then but it is very very unlikely to be worth less than 4K in 5 years. Yes asset prices are high but realize that in a high inflation environment bonds and savings accounts are going to safely lose money. If you were to buy in a shorter time frame like 1-2 years then it makes sense to peruse more specialized strategies but at a length of 5 years there is enough time for the good and bad years to average out. Even if price tanks in the 5th year  and you lose 30 percent you will likely have more than you put in.

Ha, I did below a bit. But you have to remember in 2009, Netflix was just mail order DVD's, very little, if any streaming. Blockbuster rolled out their own DVD by mail program and you could return them in store. I personally thought they could take Netflix head on, I didn't realize how leveraged they were though.



Netflix really didn't take off until 2012, so it was still competitive at that time. I bet incorrectly. If I was on WSB, I had diamond hands on BBI and it blew up in my face.



Still had winners though in a few IPO's over the years, like Visa. Point is, I made a few good bets, and several other bad ones. No one knows any better than you do and should do your own research, develop your own strategy, and set your own risk tolerance. None of that can be done for you."

One personal example- I'm in $HGEN right now because I think COVID will be a thing for a while yet- even after vaccination rates approach herd immunity (which will take years in much of the world at the current rate) the fast mutations will mean that infections will continue to spike long after we've gone back to normal. $HGEN has a drug that dramatically reduces the chances that hospitalized patients will need a respirator and will likely get an EUA from the US government and become standard protocol for hospitalized patients globally.

First of all, is it worthwhile if I'm planning on holding them for 5+ years?  

If it is worthwhile -
Do you set stop losses to sell every share? Or do you set the stop loss to sell just the profit you've made and keep your initial investment intact?"

For sure there are some times you get stop hunted, but it prevents you from a much bigger potential loss. But if you can't do TA or do not plan to do swing trading, then you might just want to set a trailing stop to take profit or loss, if it hit it hit, you just admit defeat or take profit. If you are investing blue chip stocks and can wait out a bear market, then you don't need stops. I personally cannot tolerate getting stuck in a losing trade"

\-What are the best/most volatile stocks for day trading in a 1-2 hour period?

\-When are the best daily periods for trading?

\-Should I spread my day trades or focus on one company?

\-When should I absolutely pull out instead of holding the line?

2021-04-06 22:47:06,stocks,"You need to be in the top like 0.4% of day traders to make a fry cook’s salary. It’s literally a waste of time and money. If someone tells you differently, they’re full of shit. Considering the questions you asked, I would highly recommend you don’t give it a go my friend. There are many many other, better, ways to make money in the market."
2021-04-06 22:51:20,stocks,"Start with r/DayTrading. I’ll answer some of these from a bullish day trading perspective. I’d **highly** recommend very deep research and paper trading before ever trying to play both sides or day trading bearish. 

1) There is no best volatile stock. If there were everyone would be rolling TSLA. But the fact is if you game volatile stocks you can only be right so many times before you’re massively wrong. With that said airlines atm are my *favorite* volatile.

2) In my personal experience it’s an early bird’s game. 4-5am pre-market is generally where you can find the best values. By this I mean in characteristic gap downs on pre-market open can sometimes be a solid place to open positions.

3) Always spread. Not ridiculously to where you can’t profit unless the entire market is green, but at least into a few different industries and if you’re targeting one, a few companies in that industry.

4) This is the question. Everyone has their own opinion. In my humble opinion if you’re daytrading never enter a position without setting deadlines and securing stop losses where risk outweighs reward. I tend to rely on mainly fib retracement to determine support levels across a few separate time periods. Regardless, remove emotion and have pre-determined laddered stop-losses.

5) Minute tickers are bad. Just have stop losses and laddered exit points. What happens in a given minute shouldn’t undermine research. This is why I recommend laddered approaches. Start taking profit and minimizing losses softly as either target approaches. 

To follow-up on 5, never give up longterm positions to day trade. If you happened to be wrong on a company you hold longterm don’t be afraid to keep those positions assuming there wasn’t an excess purchased at a high price.

Hope this could be of help. Just be safe and question everything myself or anyone tells you."

&#x200B;

In my opinion, these numbers are absolutely nuts.

Revenue, and earnings for Q1 2021, will higher than the WHOLE of 2020. Put simply, this company makes BANK.

Yes of course, this huge revenue of increase is due to the thing's rise, and we can't extrapolate this data for the whole year, as the thing can go down any time.

But if, and this is a very big IF, the demand stays at these levels, or go up, as many expect, COIN's annualized income could be $3.2 Billion. . (I've calculated this by multiplying q1 expected net income by 4)

I know this is a lot extrapolation and speculation, but I expect this IPO to be pumped to oblivion. So much that I probably won't be participating in it. It's pretty much impossible to get a good deal in IPOs these days

But let's say that this company was given a 50 PE ratio (which is conservative for a company growing at such levels, but also reasonable since it is tied to the thing) Coinbase would be valued at $150 Billion. (if PE ratio is also the same as market cap/net income, )

The combined market caps of ICE and the nasdaq (operating the NYSE and nasdaq exchanges) < $100 Billion.

Crazy.

Company originally was going to set IPO at $15-17 and then lowered it to $12. IPO still in quiet period till April 21st so no  talk of management changes or possible business changes.

I have been struggling a lot recently regarding my portfolio composition. As I am a young and inexperienced investor, I always invested in index funds.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Tuesday, April 6, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Tuesday, April 6, 2021**

Stocks traded roughly flat Tuesday, putting a pause on the recent record-breaking rally. Market participants are encouraged by better-than-expected economic data and President Biden’s infrastructure plan. 

The March Jobs Report blew past consensus estimates to record the fastest pace of job growth since last summer. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 916,000 for the month while the unemployment rate fell to 6% (unemployment rate was 14.6% in April 2020). Economists surveyed by Dow Jones had been looking for an increase of 675,000 and an unemployment rate of 6%. Quincy Krosby, chief market strategist at Prudential Financial said, “It \[the jobs report\] shows that the economy is healing, that those who lost their jobs are coming back into the workforce as the recovery continues and restrictions are lifted.”

As the economy continues to recover, analysts have been expediently raising their estimates for companies' first-quarter earnings results, with earnings season beginning in just a couple weeks. According to FactSet, first-quarter [earnings estimates were increased by a record margin of 6%](https://insight.factset.com/record-high-increase-in-sp-500-eps-estimates-for-q1) over the past several weeks, as analysts adjusted their forecasts for the much stronger-than-expected economic rebound seen so far. Larry Adam, chief investment officer at Raymond James said, “Not only is the economy doing better, but that's actually leading to earnings revisions going higher, and that's taking the market higher. And I don't think we're done yet. I think people are going to continue to see the strength of this economy during the summer, and you're going to see earnings continue to move up significantly throughout this year.""

The vast majority of US states are on track to open vaccine eligibility to all adults before President Biden’s May 1 deadline. An average of more than 3 million individuals are getting vaccinated every day, according to the Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). As vaccine distribution efforts continue, cyclical and reopening stocks have outperformed growth and tech stocks that led the market higher in 2020. We expect this trend to continue moving forward, as more states gradually reopen. 

Looking ahead, this week will be chock full of commentary from Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) members, who will offer their assessment of the latest batch of economic data and how they will proceed. . Chicago Fed President Charles Evans, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin and St. Louis Fed President Jim Bullard are each slated to deliver public remarks later this week, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will speak at an International Monetary Fund (IMF) panel regarding the global economy Thursday afternoon.

**Highlights**

* US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen urged the adoption of a minimum global corporate tax rate during virtual meetings with the World Bank and IMF.
* An index tracking U.S. service sector activity surged to an all-time  high in March, the Institute for Supply Management said Monday
* A U.S. auto industry group on Monday urged the government to help as it warned the global semiconductor shortage could result in 1.28 million fewer vehicles built this year and disrupt production for another six months.
* The International Monetary Fund (IMF) upgraded its forecast for global growth this year amid a better-than-expected outlook for the U.S. and other major economies. The institution now sees worldwide growth increasing 6% this year, up from the 5.5% rise seen previously. This follows a historic contraction of 3.3% in 2020. 
* Credit Suisse said Tuesday it expects to take a writedown work 4.4 billion Swiss franc, or $4.7 billion, as of a result of the implosion of Archegos Capital, Bill Hwang’s hedgefund that got a massive margin-call recently

Would you use a browser/chrome extension that showed you a similar graph anytime you saw a $AAPL link? For example, often on Twitter or in articles, I'll see those links that then go to a search or specific page.

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Reflection on timing the COVID pandemic in the stock market Q4 2019 - Q1 2020 Upon these eventful past 12-18 months with the COVID pandemic (and still counting) I was wondering and reflecting about how Q4 2019 - Q1 2020 played out in the stock markets. Although it is not long ago yet there might be interesting bits and pieces of knowledge in the past.

Specifically my question for those actively engaged in the markets at that time I was wondering if anyone A) strategically sold everything i.e. went fully in cash (or equivalent) and based on which events and how did your timing work with markets up for much longer, B) how did you plan your re-entry and based on which events and when, C) what would you do different next time in hindsight how the events unfolded?

For myself I was too busy with work to notice, even after the first places in China and Italy went into full lockdown and dismissed it as a ""flu"". Then I missed the rally gong in the Fed statement on March 23rd 2020 and still expected more markets corrections. So both times way to late for the big moves (down and then up)."

2021-04-07 10:21:28,stocks,"They basically shut down, I've never seen anything like it. We have a very strong supply chain with many alternate vendors setup for all of our products, and all of them simultaneously shut down. Even our American vendors couldn't do much because they subcontract portions to their own Chinese vendors that were experiencing the same thing.

I've worked in the industry for 10 years and in that industry in particular the lengths that these manufacturers all go to to hit deadlines is insane. They will do anything to keep things moving, there is no length they won't go to, even when I insist it's okay to have delays.

We anticipate periodic shutdowns surrounding chinese new year every year, and that's it. But they are all very well planned and it has little effect on their throughput because they normally work crazy overtime before and after.

But in this case they just straight up started telling us no one is allowed in the facilities and they don't know when they'll be back and there is nothing they can do for us. 

I've never, ever seen anything like that. Our vendors that I have personal relationships with started sending me care packages with masks in case it got here.

I knew something was very, very bad there and that this could have an economic impact. I figured going cash was the most risk averse means of protecting myself, rather than actively putting money up to bet against the market."

2021-04-07 00:00:00,stocks,"Losing Streak Guys I'm on a losing streak here. Last year 80% of my decisions seemed to be right on if I was able to stick by them. Of course 2020 was a bull run for everyone. Lately every pick I make is going red and every pick I decided not to make is going green big time and I have to admit it's got me a bit paralyzed at the moment. I watch the indexes make new highs and I've seen nothing but red since mid-March. 

My next play was going to be semiconductors. Had a limit order for Micron at 86 and missed it only to see it go up into the 90s. Applied Materials same thing. 

It seems like every trade I go to make, either I don't pull the trigger or I'm way late on the rally trying to buy on the back end of overbought. I know this is pretty much textbook bad investing. 

I'm significantly overweight on oil/energy which I am still holding and have some value ETFs but I am afraid to buy anything else. Any tips for me to get out of this rut I'm in? Maybe I am pulling the trigger too quick and need to just buy good companies and not worry so much about the entry price."
2021-04-07 07:49:45,stocks,"My advice is to not buy at ATH or overpriced. This year, while the money is still in the markets, has seen a huge rebalancing from winners to losers. I’d stick to buying the “losers” of the day, even good companies that were winners but dipped significantly.

For example, I greatly reduced Volkswagen, increased BP, holding Apple, and not touching Tesla!"
2021-04-07 08:51:44,stocks,"I am putting my investments into broadly 3 buckets,  “income” , “growth” , “trading”.   The first bucket is the largest (50-60% of total normally) and gives me a recurrent dividend to either spend or reinvest, just in case my other stuff don’t work out; the second bucket is growth (30% or so of the total), these are names that I think will be winners long term and I dollar average these names whenever I have extra cash, the third bucket is the smallest (10-20% of the total), this is for trading purposes, it could be highly speculative bets, or short term, trading the range type of stocks.  This keeps me excited / interested in looking at markets, but won’t kill my overall returns if it goes wrong. 

I set targets to revisit my investment thesis for stocks within each buckets, if something has changed, or a new idea comes up, I would be happy to swap around names, but I would be keeping some “core holding” solid dividend paying stuff for the long term. 

This strategy would likely underperform the market in big bull markets, but I’m trying to aim for 6-7% type of consistent returns over a very long period of time, with small losses that could be recovered in case there are bad years. And hopefully some of the stuff in the third bucket turns out to be multi baggers, that would improve the overall returns as well."
2021-04-07 13:02:52,stocks,I was just thinking the same thing.  Haven't picked a winner in awhile.  SOXL is the only one I consistently have success with.  Other than that my only recent success is a European mining stock that I mistakenly bought when not paying attention.  The kicker is that it cost me a $50 fee to buy so I'm not really that up on it.

When I sell stocks I put in limit orders. For example, if I put in a limit order at 400 for good til cancelled, when I look at the actual sale it sold at 399.98. It's only 2 cents but I like to keep my gains and losses rounded to the dollar if possible. Instead of $200 gains I see $199.98. For a stock that has millions (over 3 million yesterday) in volume each day there shouldn't be a spread from my actual sale price, especially considering that stock passed the limit sale price. Is this built in bid/ask spread a known thing even for limit orders and not market orders, or is this my brokerage taking a cut, or something else?"

Pick an index fund, one with low fees.  Mutual funds, or ETFs.  Find one with low management fees that matches your minimum initial contribution.  An index fund is one that tries to mirror an index, so the feed are very low.  It gets you a lot of diversification.

You can pick a couple different funds if you have the $$ and need to, but avoid individual stocks, and anything that seems “hot”. And don’t mess with it.  Contribute regularly if you can.  If it goes down, leave it.  An index fund will recover.

If you do not have any debt, one of the best things you can do at an early age is to set up a recurring account into one or two quality mutual funds ( proven track record, limited fees, etc), then forget about it. By the time you need it, it’ll be a solid chunk of money, without any substantial sacrifice along the way."

2021-04-06 22:08:47,stocks,"Apple.  IPO'd about 9-months before my 18th birthday would be best.  A gain of about 142,000 percent.

But almost no one in my family would have known anything about investing in anything.  If there were any opportunity it probably would have been in something 'safe' or 'established' or 'well known'.  Like AT&T or IBM.

From my 18th birthday IBM is up about 950%.  9.5x.  That's not a bad thing, exactly.  But .... and this is the really important part for long-term investing .... the S&P 500 is up about 3250% in the same period.

Best thing to do, at the time, buy the S&P 500 and let it ride.  For a LOT of people, that is still the best thing to do.  Invest in the market over the long run.  It's like hitting singles all day instead of swinging for the fences and striking out WAY too often."

2021-04-06 22:44:29,stocks,"I work for a man who mad a total butt load of money in stocks. His advice though was that you won’t beat the computers long term without spending a lot of time watching the action and researching. His advice to me was to put everything into and index fund like the vti or qqq. If you put them in the search bar for your trading platform you should seer them. Maybe less extreme gains then someone who is a talented trader, but they’re set it and forget it style and give pretty good consistent gains to your money. My other advice is don’t waste too much time staying in regular hourly or service jobs. Build your skills now  so that later your skills are worth more money. Be learning to start a small business, or trying to gain supervisory experience at work etc. you don’t want to wait tables at 35 years old with a kid. Source: guy who was waiting tables at 35 with a kid lol. Started working for myself last few years and way happier and I’m learning it better everyday, but still think what if I had started focusing more as a younger man. I’d be way ahead by now. Also if you like one area and don’t plan on moving around a lot buy a house ASAP instead of renting. I’ve paid my landlady 100k in rent this last 8 years yet when I move I will have zero equity coming back to me."
2021-04-06 22:50:03,stocks,"18 I lived for moments and made crap money working at coffee shops. Concerts, travel, etc was the sole
Purpose for working. in my 40s not a priority as it once was. I still travel, see shows, but it’s more like the special occasion now with purpose going places instead of exploring just because I haven’t seen it. 

Money is vastly better than when I was at 18. But I do put aside quite a bit for retirement now and have done so since I was about 25. Had to borrow from it a couple times to take care of sudden life situations. But if I could go back, I wouldn’t change a thing. I had kids, I made sure they had opportunities that I didn’t. 

I just don’t think there is a secret sauce to investing. It just depends on what you invest in. I invested in experiences at a younger age, invested financially for my family as I aged. When it’s time for me to stop contributing to my work and focus on contributing to the joys of being done with it. I feel I’m pretty prepared, I won’t live lavishly, but I never lived that way my whole life either.  So, to each their own."

2021-04-06 22:59:38,stocks,"First thing is to avoid high interest debt like credit cards, high interest loans, payday loans, rent a center, etc. Also begin a habit of a nest egg. Ideally 6 months of living expenses. 

If you have a job that offers 401k matching, invest there first and at least invest as much as you can get full match. It’s basically free money. Maybe 401k plans have limited investment choices, so it would be difficult to male a recommendation.

Next I would recommend a Roth IRA. Your tax rate now will most likely be lower than in the future. In a Roth, you pay income tax now, not when you withdraw in retirement. Caveat, this is money you shouldn’t touch until you retire as there are usually large penalties if you do beforehand. 

Now what to invest, my advice is to only invest in something you understand. An S&P 500 ETF is one of the easiest things to understand and is a fine investment to start with. When it comes to ETFs, beware of fees. Those can really hurt your earnings. Vanguard ETFs have some of the lowest fees generally. If you want to go individual stocks, companies like Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Google are solid choices. These are now referred to as FAANG stocks now. 

Another great safe choice is a group called dividend aristocrats. These are stocks have pay a dividend and have continuously raised their dividend at least 25 years. Make sure you set up your account to automatically reinvest dividends and this a phenomenal way to grow value over 30 years. 

Calls like Tesla are super hard to make. I am a huge fan of Tesla and wish them continued success, but I believe they are over valued and don’t personally invest in them.

Bonds are historically a safe investment and worth studying as well."

2021-04-06 23:06:32,stocks,"You didn’t ask this, but at 18 you probably aren’t making bank and your biggest asset over the next several years will be relationships.

The people you meet will be your best friends, your sounding board, and will also help you find opportunities.

Go to the beach with your family. Go explore. Have fun at spring break and go party with your friends. 

You're probably not going to earn much money between 18 - 22 years old (I said probably, but many still do make good money at that age). Just enjoy being young. You're only young once."
2021-04-07 00:25:11,stocks,"Figure out how to invest your money so you can retire at 40 or damn near that age. That means do the homework on how to invest so you aren't stuck with your money locked in a 401k waiting til you're 59 1/2 or older to get at your money without incurring huge penalties. Take the full ride scholarship to a university that isn't your first choice to avoid student loan debt. Live at home as long as you are able to save money. Join a trade union and work your way up while you're young. Dammit I wish someone had told me all this back when I was 18.

By the time you're 40 the youthful energy of your 20s and 30s that you were willing to spend grinding, full of ambition, will have mostly worn off and you'll be wanting to not spend the rest of your increasingly tired-ass life grinding away at a 40+ hour a week job as the wheels slowly continue to come off your physical health. You'll want to do the stuff you want to do while you still have the strength and energy to do it, and if you can do that by being mostly financially set, the less tethered to the grind you will be.

Try to figure out if if they have a viable solution to the problem. It will likely look like a much different that the status quo, most people will say it's not possible or something to that effect. Remember that ten years ago most people said electric cars could never work. Take a look at the leadership of the company. Sometimes like with Facebook, this will be a college dropout or never started. Other times this will be someone with more experience. This is a good start at least. Better yet, go out and start that company yourself."
2021-04-07 02:18:40,stocks,ETF’s or an automated mutual fund is probably your best bet unless you want to take the time to really learn the in and outs of specific companies and stocks.

The ark ETFs are kinda of high risk but perform well year over year and Cathy wood and the rest of team that manager them are geniuses. VOO and QQQ are good options for the s&p 500.

How is this advice the not the top post?"
2021-04-07 00:00:21,stocks,"For what it is worth this is my advise:

SAVING IS HARD. Unless you were born to wealth it is hard. Sometimes even saving $5 is hard, and as you climb up there are always new things you will see to spend your money on. 

Try to use your money earned to make you happy, but put some back. Even if it is only $5 this week because you wanted to go out and have a good steak. 

If you did not grow up with a family that knows how money works you need to educate yourself. They won't teach you in school. You either need family to teach you or you will have to learn on your own. Go to your library and read finance books, subscribe to some financial magazines, and watch YouTube, or go to broker sites and go through their online education stuff. TDA (not that I'm a fan of them or anything), Fidelity both have some good reading and watching. 

My grandfather was born in the great depression to a pretty poor family, joined the navy, became a cop and spent 1960 till the day he died, investing and trying to learn this shit and thought me what he found out, and I have spent the last 20 years doing it too. I've gotten pretty good at what I can find and I'm 41, still novice and could just say F it and retire today if I wanted to. Make no mistake, if you do not have generational support you have a lot to do, make sure you pass on what you learn. 

Go to seminars, or online live stuff. Learn the financial products and how to use them. Learn how to read company financials and how to interpret it. 

None of this takes a huge amount of time. Spend 5 or 10 hours a week doing this instead of watching tv, reading fantasy, playing games (or working, fuck the man).  

In 1 year you will be ahead of 90% of others. 

Dont believe what financial media is telling you, by the time you hear it from them it's already over and the big boys are looking for bag holders. You have to learn how to do your own due diligence. Never believe anything you cant verify.  Pretty sure CrMer was shouting to buy lemanbrothers in 2008... that worked out well?

Broad market ETFs are seeming more and more like those bundled loan securities pre 2008. Looks like we might see more losers than winner soon, but I could be wrong.... do your research. 

I like managed funds. Vanguard and Fidelity have their reputation for a GOOD reason, and they have their own clearing houses. 

Pick a solid broker, read above. 

Get a ROTH and max it before anything else, then standard IRA, then brokerage. Try hard as hell to get 6 months or 1 year of savings to cover basic expenses. Dont be afraid to gamble a little every now and then but dont make a WSB yolo 90% of your portfolio. Unless that's your risk tolerance... investing really is ALL ON YOU. 

Start with managed ETFs, mutual funds, then maybe some passive ETFs that track indexes. Then, Once you  have your feet wet, and have some cash in savings (dont forget that inflation will take cash out if your pocket, but a market correction could take more [it's a balance act])

After you have set yourself up try picking some stocks. Look long term, 10+ years. I like inovationers or solid old companies that just truck along and pay dividends. Healthcare, biotech, chips, multifamily REITs what I'm in. Go global too. 

After you have a little bank roll sell some options. Dont do naked calls, dont short sell. Avoid Infinite risk, but know what your risk is and go for it if you think you might have a win. If you bet $500 on a play that could get you 5k I call that an ok gamble, IF you can take a $500 risk. 

If you are not from a family already rich now, its about getting rich in 10 or 20 years. Save now. Learn how this works, have capital for down turns, and ride the waves. 

Look at any chart of any index over 20 or 30 or even 100 years, guess what ..... stocks go up.

Don't try to out think the market. Go with the flow. Follow the waxing and waning. Markets move through rotations just like tides in the sea. Move with it, not against it. 

DONT PANIC. 
Dont trade with emotion, do your due diligence and analysis and stick to your plan.


Learn some hedges. I take a 1% stake against my positions with 1yr puts or calls every year. If I'm down in a year I'll take a 1% value call option. If I'm up I'll take a 1% put a year out. Its like insurance. And believe me, it CAN and WILL save your ass. 

Time in the market vs timing the market ... time in always wins, but having bad timing can set you back a long time. 

Anyway, at the end of the day... just do something. 

And buy some $GME. Even 2 shares. That shit is crazy, who knows what will happen.

*I am not a financial advisor, I'm just a dude on the internet sharing what he has learned. Nothing should be taken as any type of financial advise, but everyone should save some money and invest with using their own risk tolerance and the help of a certified financial adviser (not me).*"

2021-04-06 20:22:43,stocks,"Hi, so happy that you've been considering investing so soon. I'm 25 and saved some money through my life but without putting more thought into how I could get my money to work for me, rather than the opposite. So congrats on taking the first step.  
Well, as you mentioned everyone wanted to have bough tesla, apple or amazon before they became the top in their areas and were basically startups. But how many ""apples"", which had a lot of reputation and people really though that would grow ended up going bankrupt? So I wouldnt recommend investing in companies which you aren't confident enough. Im not saying they are a profitable (the logic is what matters), but can you imagine the world without coca cola? without google? how about walmart? So I'd search for those blue chips which went through some market crashes and made it out just to me safer when a market correction happens. It's always good to choose companies which mean something to you, such as companies you use and trust.   
If I were to guess which sectors - not companies - are going to be profitable in the future I'd have three main areas to focus:  
\- EVs (not only tesla though, GM has been performing great)  
\- Clean/Solar energy - usually the companies which generate the energy have a better profit than those which build the solar panels, btw  
\- Semiconductors, simply because whatever it is that you think about the future envolves this tech. Solar panels? EVs? AI? all things semiconductors.   
I think I might've rent a little more than intended but having a hard day and this really helped me clear my head. Hope it somehow enlighted you.   


P.S - when I was 18 I invested in a savings account, by that time my country was growing fast so it'd easily guarantee me a 1% profit each month. I don't regret it, it was a good profit and above most ETFs. But if that was not an option, then deffo I'd try something which would've given me a better return - such as the stock market."

Since you’re young and have time to build more wealth you could be more aggressive and pick companies with more upside, I personally like tech companies, just make sure you research as much as possible before investing and never invest more money than you could afford to lose.

Oh and as other people have pointed out... Pay off any crazy credit card debt etc if you need to first. 

It may sound dumb but there's a reason that financial advisors are trained to establish this at the outset of an advisory relationship.

Once you have established

""I can afford to lose X""

""I'm willing to accept a risky investment where I may lose X""

""My goal is to receive a return of Y per year in order to achieve a goal of Z by the time I'm age Q""

Then start thinking about what you want to invest in.


For me:
I can afford to lose 100% of my investments - I live off my income from my work.
I'm willing to accept risky investments where on a fairly bad year I might lose 40% of my portfolio
My goal is to receive a return of at minimum 20% per year so in 5-10 years I will be able to afford everything that I want without needing to work (House, chipotle every day, a 5 foot snorlax plushie)

So how do I get there? Treasury bonds yield like 2%. Corporate bonds yield like 4-8%. Stocks average 10%

Right off the bat I know that I will need to take additional risk to achieve my target (through the use of leverage, or a very risky basket of stocks). If I'm not comfortable with this I go back to the drawing board and tweak the assumptions. 

Well am I willing to lose 70% in a bad year and therefore can explore the use of leverage? Am I willing to accept 10% a year, invest just in index funds and put off my goals for a couple of years?

Getting this right will inform you on what kind of stuff to invest into - You don't want to be buying t-bonds with a small amount of money while trying to live like a rapper.

I would say a growth fund is about as low risk as you should put your savings into.

My serious advice is to find ways to use your assets to increase your earning potential. It's a lot easier to quadruple your per hour salary in 4 years than quadruple your money. Don't forget that you pay a price for everything. Doing a physical job that pays good now may come back to haunt you in 20 years.

And the rest were random not as promising business. So instead of investing super safely into an index fund. Go slightly more aggressive and invest to well known great growth technology stocks and industries that are destined to takeover the future like Clean Solar Energy , Electrical Autonomous Vehicles and 5G. 3 big power house industries which I believe will make huge growth and a lot of money. I was able to make double the gains I made from those 2 years in just 8 months through blue chips stocks. So that’s my strategy for now.

2021-04-06 21:12:13,stocks,"Property. 

Knowing at 18 what I know now, I would have saved up enough for a down-payment on a duplex, lived in half of it (with an employed roommate if you're single) and rented out the other half through a property management company (they have the insurance, gardeners and a large share of the responsibility) and voila... collateral and an income property which is also your primary residence. (This is important for tax purposes.)

My husband and I finally did this five years after graduating: fixed it, sold it (after living in it for two years, no capital gains tax) and then we took the profits and traded up. We always bought the worst house in the best neighborhood we could afford; we each worked in order to not take out loans to fix the place up, a slow process, but no debt. We took one very modest vacation once a year, and budgeted on a spreadsheet to the dollar. We never renovated a house at a level beyond what the neighborhood could support. 

Repeated the process two more times and now we own a house outright in our early 40s. The money we would have paid mortgage or rent with goes right into various retirement funds instead of to a bank; we're both still employed and hopefully will work until our late 50s.

The other two things that proved so pivotal to success: frugality and partnership. Learn to live better with less, and be smart about your purchases. Do your DD and pass if it doesn't smell right. Eventually find someone--of like mind and good humor--who will journey with you and doesn't mind not having all the toys.

Seems corny, I know, talking about love and money, but they're two halves of the same coin. What good is money if you're alone? Live long and prosper. 🖖

Don't worry so much about how much money you save, or how many memories you make, or where you put your money, etc.

My parents were poor. My mother lacks even an almost basic understanding of finances so most of what I know I had to pick up along the way.

THE most important thing you can do with your money is train yourself to have good financial skills, rather than putting it in smart places, or having a lot of it.

Money will come and go, opportunities will come and go, but the skills and diligence you build towards financial health will stick with you.

If you want extreme examples look at lottery winners, or suddenly rich people for other reasons. They have incredibly vast amounts of wealth and almost all of them lose it within years. 

To me it's more important to have the skills and discipline to weather chaotic events in your life than it is to worry about money at such a young age.

Aside from that, always opt for the 401k and keep track of it and roll it into whatever a new employer has. Not getting a company match is giving away free money and you literally will not miss a small percentage out of your paycheck, even if your paycheck is small. You will learn to work around that."

While it is great to start thinking like this now I think you should be more worried about enjoying yourself when you're young (you have much less responsibilities now, more free time and likely a better social group then you will have as you get older), however if you want to be responsible with your finances, you want to be the friend who always seems to have cash and is never asking for help or loans then I think and obviously this is my opinion, but I think one of the best things you can do for yourself now is recognizing the value of your money and your time.

The sooner you can realize how much better cutting out a daily morning latte is when you can eventually take a vacation with that money or buy a car (used please for the love of god) the sooner you will find yourself having more money in general.

I pay my bills, I buy my groceries, when my shoes get holes in them I buy myself shoes, I always have nice things AND I have savings and investments. I don't go out and splurge on myself often but when I do I feel a great sense of satisfaction knowing how much I deserve that little hit of materialism. 

An even better way of thinking just in terms of sheer dollars though might be putting all your effort into finding the right career that guarantees you work in the area you live currently, that pays well, and you can also afford the training/education for.

Example: if you make minimum wage and after all your expenses you have 2$ to invest or whatever you will realistically never change your financial situation, no matter how much planning you do or advice you get you can't invest with 0$ whether it's stocks, tools, a house whatever. Now if you set yourself up to start working at the local mill as carpenter or whatever your situation may be because you know they need tons of workers and maybe they'll help you out with school tuition, now you can really start making something happen with all that extra cash your making, the trick is not to develop a lifestyle that reflects your income."

After amazon got big it was a sure thing but those people at the initial offering had no idea. For every one of those guys, there's 2,000 that invested in something and lost everything.

So, no more than 5% of your portfolio on penny stocks. After a couple years bump it up to 10% and never more. Realize it is a speculative effort and don't diamond hands everything you see. Half this stuff is for selling at peaks and doubling down on dips on a day to day, hour to hour, and thanks to CPUs, microsecond to microsecond.

If you're looking at that price range, go for a B class stock. I got BBD.B right after reorg at like 0.50 and it's at $1. But BBD is not a penny company. The class A stocks are worth more, but the Government will never let BBD fail so I felt confident going with higher margins.

I highly recommend going into the S&P and spend your first year trying to get positive returns. Aim for 10-15%, don't get greedy early.

If you want 3 that I like, well, I gave you BBD.B but I'm also into SU, CCL, and ARKX. I think if you bought into those you'd have a very safe, diverse portfolio to drop 5% on something like DMGI, CJ, HITI, or FLT. but remember, those are gambles. Learn limit sells and buys. Use them.

2021-04-06 22:08:43,stocks,"Honestly I’d go one of two routes in your shoes, both are playing it safe and assuming minimal risk.

1) Just starting buying ATT shares ($T). Two reasons, it’s a relatively safe hold of value and it returns 6% in dividends with modest growth potential. Starting at 18 if your manage to squirrel away what you can and get in the habit of pushing returns back into the stock you’ll have a sizable chunk of cash a few years down the line.

2) Start buying into SP500 through fractional SPY shares. Most retail traders spend a lot of time just trying to outperform the S&P. Some are successful, most aren’t. The successful ones generally don’t beat the index without either a lot of lessons learned and research or luck. Returns modest dividends and is an outlet for modest, semi-consistent growth.

If neither of those appeal to you, I still recommend sticking with ETFs. A large cap growth ETF starting young is a solid idea. If you want more risk buying into an emerging market ETF has a lot of upside potential too.

Regardless never be tempted by people saying *this will make you money*. Odds are it won’t and sticking by the boring investments early on is the best plan. I put liquid savings into only SPY for close to 6 years before I started trying to diversify and play the market more. I lost a full year of returns my first several months trying to beat the market. This is why I recommend avoiding trading until you have some available learning funds. But if you like financial math, researching company finance, compulsively read the news daily, and have resolute patience then you’re definitely setup to win."

2021-04-06 22:13:55,stocks,"I started a fund for my 9 month old (now 10 months) with vanguard in a target retirement fund (2065). I started with 300 (Christmas money from grandpa and great grandpa) but they would let me invest until I had 1,000.  So I put 700 of my own money into it to get it started and then when the Biden stimulus hit I threw in an extra 1,400. It now is at 2,435 over 1 month. I’ve told my parents and friends and family about the fund and that all his present money will go into this fund until he is 12 years old, then half of his present money will go in and the other half he can keep. I’m doing this because over the next 40 years that money will grow to be a very large amount of money, hopefully 250,000 or more. When he starts earning income I am going to roll it over to a Roth so he doesn’t have to pay taxes on it when he wants to use it. My goal is to give it to him when he starts a family to buy a house, pay for a baby, etc. 

A target retirement account or a mutual fund with high risk is where you need to start. When you have about 40,000 in your IRA or 401k then you can start investing in stocks. But the people that manage IRAs, 401ks and mutual funds do it for a living and will get you a better return than anyone on here can give you.

Investment
IRA and 401K are always a good options even if its $50 a month.  Real state/rental property is another great goal.  Also try investing in the stock market to get the hang of it.  Its good to also have money readily available in case an opportunity comes up - money in 401k is no good for this.

Education (if it applies)
As far as college, it seems that more than ever - its nothing but a business that sells you a fake promise that you will make 100k a year on day 1 and you’re stuck with a massive college loan for the next 20 years (Unless your field of study requires it such as doctor). There is soo much content online, you can lear a lot.  Consider a business education along with a trade.  Such as a plumber or electrician, most make well over 100k a year but if you have a business education you could open your own company.

Mindset
The major thing I learned is to pull the f-ing trigger and just do it.  Procrastination has been my biggest enemy.

2021-04-06 22:19:13,stocks,Start at 5% of income and put it into three different sectors of index funds. Take half of your annual raise and increase your contribution every year until you get to 20%. You’ll be able to retire comfortably someday. If you find yourself with additional disposable income you can try trading stocks.
2021-04-06 22:19:39,stocks,Put it into a Roth IRA.  Buy a tech stock that has solid fundamentals and you see growing for the next 20 years.  FAANG + MSFT + tsla may be a good place to start.
2021-04-06 22:19:42,stocks,"If you have a job, a Roth IRA with a total market index fund (I use Vanguard and have since I was 19) is a great bet. If you want to keep some fun money to play the markets, that’s not the worst idea, but a total market index will probably get you 10% returns year after year. And if you do like I did and go to college and then grad school, you might end up with a job that pays above the Roth cutoff, and it would be great to have money growing tax free your whole adult life."

At the time we had Lycos, Web Crawler, Ask Jeeves..then there it was! Looking at those blue, yellow, green, letters I knew it was something big but didn’t understand how big it was.."

Take a financial literacy or empowerment class if you can.  Sometimes you can find them from local service and non profit organizations.  This is NOT the same as taking an accounting or economics class in college.  This is practical and immediately relevant. You can discover your spending and savings style, what is important for you to support in your community (where you want to spend your money e.g. the arts, dining out, education, charitable giving) and articulate your financial goals. Even if you can't invest much in the things that are ethically and personality fulfilling initially, these self discoveries will encourage you to be thoughtful as you move forward. You'll also get the basics of interest and loan amortization and retirement account options. This is big deal stuff -- things boomers and the silent generation didn't teach their gen-x kids.

It may sound overwhelming, but a class can make it all understandable and help you learn how you can  define and achieve your goals.

Calculate your net worth periodically -- it's important to know whether you're in debt or not and it can make you feel on control of your future.  You'll probably do a basic net worth calculation in a literacy class 

Once you have a job, make a budget and set aside some funds in a 'savings expense' line item for emergencies -- even if the amount is quite small.  Also put on specific savings line items for big ticket recurring costs ( like taxes, or every five-ten years for a car, insurance, future education, and fun stuff too, like concerts, adventures, sports, new gaming system, whatever).  

The bonus of saving over a long time for the next big purchase (like a car) will mean no, or very low, loan balances later.  This can mean huge savings. Really.

No matter how much you earn you are likely to be able to put at least a few dollars aside for these longer term coats and investments.  It'll save you from a LOT of stress when you have an unexpected draw."

2021-04-06 22:21:59,stocks,"I went to college using vocational rehabilitation, as a disabled veteran. They paid for books, supplies, tuition and gave me a stipend to help defray the cost of me not being able to work. I still worked as many as three, part-time jobs while I was going to school and graduated with about $15,000.00 in debt.

The first thing I did after graduating and getting my first job was to aoy off that debt. It took me six months. Then I started saving. A year later, I had a downpayment for my first house. Then I took a car note for 5 years. I paid it off in 3.5. Then I took a note for a motorcycle. I paid it off in 3.5. Then, I started saving. I was over 30 before I could really do any real saving. Now, I pay cash if I want a new vehicle. I own my home and have over 250k in my 401k. I am working on buying my third property and planning to retire at age 60. 

The point is, many other redditors are right. Have some fun, but when you finally do get a good job, don't go wild living above your means and trying to keep up with your neighbors. You aren't the car you drive or the house you live in.  Start saving earnestly once you've paid your debts. Grind for the next 25 to 30 years and retire while you're young enough to enjoy all you've worked so hard for. 

Good luck!"

Bitcoin was a strange way to buy drugs, apple had the ipod which was more expensive and barely superior to a cheap mp3 player, and while tesla seemed awesome but I didn't think musk could actually pull it off (not at age 18, but when I was first acutely aware of those things).  Best use of your income right now is books and networking."
2021-04-06 22:26:39,stocks,"Read “The millionaire Next Door” and watch “The Money Guy” on YouTube. At your age, $1 saved and invested will be able to grow into $88 by the time you’re ready to retire. If you can invest $1,200 this year, by the time you retire, it will have grown into over $105,000. 

Believe it or not, saving and investing $5,000 a year between 20 and 30 ($50,000) will grow into more money than saving and investing $5,000 a year between 30 and 65 ($175,000). 

Compounding interest will make you wealthy, but you gotta start early, and start with whatever you can, even if it’s just $100/month.

Put it in an S&P tracking index fund or ETF and forget about it."
2021-04-06 22:27:04,stocks,"I've always been of the mindset to live as debt free as possible. I made financial mistakes in my late teens, early twenties, and had to file bankruptcy at 24 years old (about $250,000 debt). I lost a condo I'd purchased and couldn't keep up with my loan payments.

Since then I've tried to do my due diligence and paid cash for what I could. I also learned that debt isn't necessarily bad, as long as you keep a strong debt/income ratio. I've invested in S&P funds and dividend stocks to build a decent retirement fund. 

I'm very keen on loan interest and stock returns. If my mortgage is 2.75% (3% APR) and the S&P 500 or Nasdaq is returning 10+%, is rather put money there because it's a bigger gain in the long run. I'm 33 now and my best advice is to put about half of your money in some good funds that follow the market, 25% in dividend aristocrats and take some chances withe the remaining 25%. Research some up and coming tech companies or industrials and see what happens. 

Most importantly, have fun doing it and don't stress yourself out!"

Depending on how long that takes you, consider doing another three months. Now every year, reevaluate your expenses and adjust your emergency fund up. Heres why it's important-

Right now, your expenses are basically nothing, so it's super easy to save a few months worth. Then, all you have to do is adjust a little every year. If you try starting this when you're 30 and you have a family, kids, house, two cars, etc, itll be damned hard to do. In the meantime, you're a free man (or woman). Don't like your job or your boss? Fuck it. You've got 6 months of savings in cash. Walk out. Car break down? Fuck it. Go pay cash for a new one. Do not underestimate what that kind of freedom can do for your happiness."

Track your interest expense in your monthly budget, you will know when debt levels are getting out of hand when you look at it and say I paid as much in interest as I did for “x” this month."

I have 1 checking account for direct deposit and another high yield checking account for my emergency fund. Make sure neither of these checking accounts charge any type of ATM fees and are quick to access.

As for what I’d invest in, I’d start out with a base of strong ETFs from different sectors. My only criteria is a decently low expense ratio and that it’s made a minimum of 50% return over 5 years. Invest regularly and do your research on good companies that have a long term advantage. Don’t just stick to the tech sector because there’s more stable money to be made in other places too. 

Lastly, DO NOT neglect getting a credit history. I’d get a decent job and apply for an easy to get rewards credit card or secured card. This will save you a lot of money on interest rates in the future."
2021-04-07 00:49:16,stocks,"You may not have realized it, but ""where would you put your money"" can be split into multiple questions:

1. What kind of accounts would you put the money in?
2. What investments would you purchase in those accounts?

&#x200B;

**1) What kind of accounts would you put the money in?**

If you work and your employer offers a 401k match, invest the minimum needed to get the maximum employer match.  For your 401k, I am not going to address that in question 2, but most plans offer ""target date"" funds which will be very similar to what I will suggest for you.  The only reason not to use one is if the expense ratio is high (above 0.1%) or you want to balance the allocations with holdings in other accounts, but that is beyond the scope of this post.

After maxing out your match, you need to decide what else you want to do with your money.  That could mean saving more for retirement (Roth IRA for someone your age), saving for a house or college (taxable account or educational account), build an emergency fund (savings account).  To determine this, you need to look at your own financial stability, how much you can rely on your parents, and your own goals.  I highly recommend the [Personal Finance Flowchart](https://www.reddit.com/r/personalfinance/comments/4gdlu9/how_to_prioritize_spending_your_money_a_flowchart/) for determining where to put your money.  It isn't perfect and it can't account for every situation or the case where are not financially independent, but it's very valuable.

For question two, I'll assume you have opened up either a (Roth) IRA, an educational account (i.e. 529), or a taxable investment account.

**2) What investments would you purchase in those accounts?  (I.E. The Good Stuff)**

I've been pleasantly surprised to see ETFs mentioned a lot in this thread, which is really good.  So how do you know which ones to get?  We will be constructing our portfolio from 3 (or 4) assets: Bonds, the US Total Stock Market, the International Stock Market, and (potentiallly) REITS (Real Estate Investment Trusts).  REITs will only be chosen if you are investing in an IRA or a Roth IRA, as they are very tax inefficient.  If you are investing in a taxable account, we will skip REITs.

For someone your age, we are going to be super aggressive and say that you want to hold no bonds.  You may want to have up to 10% bonds.  Anywhere from 0 to 10% of the portfolio would not be a bad decision.

**Asset Allocation**

Here is one example of an asset allocation, you can find others at [the Bogleheads wiki](https://www.bogleheads.org/wiki/Asset_allocation).

Note: Percentages may appear peculiar because they were chosen to maintain the ratios between the funds, whether or not you have REITs and bonds.  The exact percentage isn't important.

For this example, when there are bonds, I have always done a 95 equity to 5 bond ratio, though I expect for an 18 year old, the zero bond route would be more appealing and a 10% bond ratio is more common.  No reason and no mathematics behind this decision, it's just what I used when I started typing this post.  Within equities, I have always used a 50% US, 40% International, 10% REIT, when REITs are included and a 5 US to 4 International ratio when REITs are not included.  You would not be wrong to do +/- 5% on any of these numbers, though I would not have REITs be more than 10% of your total portfolio, regardless of age.

||**Tax Advantaged Account, No Bonds**|**Tax Advantaged Account, With Bonds**|**Taxable Account, No Bonds**|**Taxable Account, With Bonds**|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|US Total Stock Market|50%|47.5%|55.556%|52.78%|
|International Stocks|40%|38%|44.444%|42.22%|
|REITs|10%|9.5%|||
|Bonds||5%||5%|

**Fund Selection**

Fund selection is going to depend on your broker.  You can't go wrong with any of Fidelity, Charles Schwab, or Vanguard.  All three are pretty competitive with fees (and low expense ratios are very important in index investing).  I'm sure there are other brokers that are great, I just have less knowledge of their fund offerings.

So you can buy either ETFs or Index Mutual Funds.  Technically, the ETFs might be slightly more tax efficient, but the benefit is usually minuscule at best.  With some brokerages it is easier to automatically invest with mutual funds, if that is the case, going with an index mutual fund is fine.

&#x200B;

||Fidelity (ETF / Mutual Fund)|Vanguard (ETF / Mutual Fund)|Schwab (ETF / Mutual Fund)|
|:-|:-|:-|:-|
|US Total Stock Market|ITOT / FSKAX|VTI / VTSAX|SCHB / SWTSX|
|International Total Market|IXUS / FTIHX|VXUS / VTIAX|SCHF / SWISX|
|REIT|USRT (among others) / FSRNX|VNQ / VGSLX|SCHH / (Unsure)|
|Total Bond Market|AGG / FXNAX|BND / VBTLX|SCHZ / SWAGX|

Note: There are many different REIT indices and the funds selected are NOT equivalent as they track different indices.

Hopefully this helps, let me know if you have any questions.  If anyone finds any errors, please let me know so I can correct them.  If anyone disagrees, I'd love to hear why.

&#x200B;

TLDR: 55% US Total Stock Market, 45% International Total Stock Market, choose fund based on your broker based on the above table.  Put money in consistently, the same amount every two weeks (or whatever works for you). Don't ever sell. When the market goes down, avoid the urge the sell. You can't time the bottom. In fact, once you have all your auto investments set up, don't even look at it (except to rebalance)."

For an actual investment tho precious metal is one of few investments that doesn’t have marginal price drops it doesn’t recover from, commercial real estate is another great play, find something like a high yield C&D account or IRA that allows early penalty-less closure, put into it until its a down payment on residual income “aka apartment building duplex store franchise etc”"

2021-04-07 02:05:52,stocks,"my direct answer is ""tesla and bitcoin"" but not just because they mooned

&#x200B;

growing up I was into computers and tech, went into IT as a career, always had an interest in that sort of thing. I learned of bitcoin early on and saw the trend as people started getting into mining it, when I saw it climb up to 50 dollars per bitcoin it peaked my interest and i told myself I should buy a bitcoin or two just in case it's the wave of hte future

&#x200B;

that trend continued in my mind as milestone after milestone came and went. I kept telling myself I should buy into it becuase it made sense to me as a future currency and for a few hundred dollars I would never feel the loss if it was wasted but the reward could have been (and looking back, obviously it would have been) crazy big. This thought occured at the 100 dollar price, 150, 200, 400, 500, and finally 1000 mark. By the time it reached 1000 I was sick to my stomach knowing I could have converted 200 dollars into 5000+ so I started gearing myself up to invest. By the time I pulled the trigger and started we were at 5000/btc. I'm now an active investor in various formats but god I wish I started back when it was sub 100.

The same thing happened with tesla, I believed electric cars were the future and the big name was tesla, they were the first EV to really develop any decent hype and stay relevant for more than a few months worth of buzz in the media. By the time I started getting into it we were at 500 pre split, which was still early enough to make good money but I could have made ohh so much more. I also had yet to really commit and kept selling for small profits and panic sales on red days (I was relatively new to stock market investing and didn't know better) so much of the potential gain was missed. I currently have a decent chunk invested in TSLA, had I committed and took action when I first starting having those thoughts I again could have seen a retardedly large amount of profits, life changing even.

TL:DR if you are decently knowledgeable in an area and/or have a solid belief in something you can invest in, trust yourself and invest while it's still in fledgling status. The money lost if you're wrong wont be something you remember or financially feel in 10 years, but you'll never forget if you're right, and that'll only feel good if you were on the ride."

2021-04-07 02:23:25,stocks,"The basic principal is to minimize the amount of taxes you pay and get any “free money”.

If you have an employer who does matching for 401k, you should contribute enough to get the matching cap.

If your employer will contribute to an HSA, then open that too. HSA’s go with you when you change employers. The money is yours to keep (unlike an FSA, don’t get them mixed up) and can be used on family members. My employers have usually contributed $1k/year without me needing to contribute anything. I did this when I started working and built up enough to cover the pregnancy bills when my son was born years later.

After the employer matching, go with a Roth IRA. If you like the Costco shopping mindset (less options but all decent so you don’t have to shop around as much) then go with Vanguard. If you want more choices then Fidelity. And if you want even more investing options then you already know enough to not be asking Reddit :)

If you still have extra you can save and have maxed out your Roth IRA, put more in the 401k. 401k you can take a loan out in a pinch anyway. I did this when I bought my first home and I don’t remember there being any fees. The “interest” charged goes into your account so you’re paying yourself. I think the ability to do this and frequency depends on your employer and 401k institution though.

If you still have more to save then go back and max out the HSA. You’ll use it eventually. Having kids is expensive.

If you still have more then open a 529a. You can open it for yourself then transfer it to your kids in the future.

If you still have more to save then you’re making a ton of money and could afford a financial advisor ;)"

As for investments, funnily enough you make more money betting on the system than on individual stocks in most cases (citation needed but this is what I’ve read over and over about things like day trading). Basically take the advice of something like the Roth IRA and/or investment firms. Obviously diversity is important. There was 2008 and then a pandemic. You never know what might be high or low value, but betting on averages helps keep you from getting in deep shit. Similarly considering *real* value not just market value. You can own a home and be house poor. 

Before you invest in your first home later on, I’d also suggest learning basic tips and tricks from home inspectors. Then you’ll have an eye for things that will become expensive eventually. One my family learned? Don’t buy a house without knowing how high the water table is. We had a spring burst up under our foundation. It had been there the whole time since it was built in the 1970s but no one bothered to check. Somehow we sold without a massive loss (buyer beware considering someone bought a spring with a house).

Investing in financial markets is a form of gambling.  If you're going to gamble, learn how to do it safely; know what you risk going in, never discard your plan for getting out with a profit.  If you have to have a stock market account, make it a cash account, avoid anything that has debt potential, like shorting equities; buying Puts in a cash account is equivalent to shorting and easier to walk away from if/when it goes bad.

Nobody knows what parts of our planet are going to be inhabitable in 20 years.  You need to stay the light and flexible.  The hardest thing you can learn at age 18 is how to leave your cash just sit there not doing anything except collect interest; the impulse to spend is strong and can be deadly.

2021-04-07 05:20:10,stocks,"Probably shares (or part ownership) in

* private fisheries
* private farms that have a reliable water supply

Climate change will alter weather patterns and cause desertification of existing agriculturally viable lands.   We probably won't be able to establish farms fast enough in areas that will become agriculturally viable and predictable from a weather perspective.  Large Scale farming takes a lot of infrastructure building and investment.

Sea level rise will probably make a lot of beach real estate worthless. (under-water)  That will probably cause real-estate to be re-valued.

Ocean water will be less salty because there will be a lot more of it.  Not sure what species of marine life that we fish and eat will survive.  Also not sure if overfishing will cause extinction of existing wild marine species.  Hence the private fisheries.

Some of the climate-caused price shocks (supply-side scarcity caused by climate change and climate-change-caused natural disasters) will collapse existing stock markets and national currencies.  So I'm not sure index funds, stock markets or paper money will have value or be viable during the coming climate crisis.

I would also invest in companies that own weather satellites since that predictive information (developing oceanic hurricanes about to hit land masses) will be very valuable.

Water will be a valuable commodity in the future.  Existing watersheds will probably change due to different precipitation patterns.  Not sure if there's a way to own future water supply other than just buy a lake that has viable, reliable and predictable source watersheds.

I'm a contrarian and I do think that climate change and climate change caused natural disasters will cause market shocks.  

I also think that shocks to the markets will cause a lot of enterprises to go private.  

The markets are a lot more fragile than we think so I'm not really sold on long term index investment.  

There's simply a lot of pain in store for humanity in the next 50 years and I'm not sold on conventional status-quo value investment thinking.  I think that value investment thinking was nice and dandy from 1930s onward but climate change will pose challenges to future generations that past generations did not have to live thru.  

What good are your market index fund shares if your beach real estate is under water, you've barely escaped with your life, you're homeless, in a shelter or living in a second home, food prices make produce and meat unaffordable, food is rationed (think ration cards) and inflation has made your savings worthless?"

Then I would do 2 things: start a mutual fund and an IRA. Mutual funds can be long-term [20+ years] or short term [5-10yrs]. You can use a mutual fund to save up for a house down payment or to just build wealth that is accessible to you prior to 59.5 yrs old. 

The mutual  fund is KEY!  Start your adult life with a safety blanket and then you will have the liberty to invest freely without worry.

[https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic#taxes](https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/taxes-topic#taxes)

Also understand the difference between IRA, Roth IRA and 401k.

If you are legally employed, you can contribute up to 6000 in IRA. If you contribute to Roth IRA, money is already taxed at the current rate. You will have to file taxes and include this when you file.  This will be a very advantageous in your future, when you have a full time job and are earning enough to be in higher tax brackets. Additionally, you can contribute to 401k. Limit is about 19.5k for 2021. A combination of Roth IRA and 401k would mean you can retire early. Like at 40-or 50 something.

2021-04-07 08:17:25,stocks,"If I could back to when I was 18, I’d put it in Apple. At 18, I had already been a nearly lifelong Apple user (iPod, iMacs and my parents even bought a Macintosh back in the early 90’s), The iPod had already taken over the world and Apple Phone rumors had already been swirling around Macworld and other outlets like that. 

At 18, I had already becoming ‘addicted’ to using ‘pre-smart’ phones such as the LG vx9900, my sister had a blackberry while my friends had the sidekick. Cell phones were all the rage. From like 2000-2005 is the period of time when cell phones began to transition from a novelty, useful device to what they are today. This is when cell phones became ‘cool’ before 2000 they were used mostly for emergencies, to tell people where you’re at or that you’re on your way. Shit, I still remember my parent’s bag phone that plugged into the car lighter and I don’t think we ever used it, probably because there wasn’t any cell service anywhere.

In retrospect, it’s so obvious the iPhone was truly a game changer and life would never be the same after it was unveiled. Unfortunately, I grew up in a low middle income family with little disposable income and my dad had a pension so he never really got into investments and since I played 3 sports all year round I didn’t haven’t part time jobs through high school so I never had any money to invest myself. 

From a long-term perspective, look for the company with a truly game changing, disrupting product that can appeal to the masses. To me, Square & PayPal are still in the early innings. I really like America’s Big 4 MSO’s
(Green Thumb Industries, Cresco Labs, Trulieve, Curaleaf). Why? Because the Total Addressable Market is absolutely massive. Even after several states have legalized weed, researchers estimate US Black Market weed sales to be around $400B while legal sales account for only $60B, so the growth runway is absolutely MASSIVE. With about 2/3’s of the country in support of legalization, it’s only a matter of time until weed is legal at the federal level. Sure, legal weed may not grab 100% of the black market but think of it this way, do people still buy black market booze? The answer is either no or it’s such a clearly trivial percentage of purchases that’s it’s almost not worth tracking. This is what will time will do to the black market for weed. Black market weed is cheaper now, because it’s surplus weed flowing from legal states to the streets. As the market becomes more regulated, the black market will begin to dry up and legal sales will take off. The main risk here is consolidation. Will a couple MSO’s team up to strangle the market? Will a cigarette company swoop in? Will the market become over saturated? I don’t know, but I know I’m not planning to wait and see on this industry."

**Stay clear** of 'passive index funds'. No disrespect to anybody who has suggested this, but there is heavy evidence that this will be the leading cause of the next great American recession. (I'm more than happy to provide evidence as to why I believe this to be the case)

&#x200B;

I assume the reason behind *'Financial security in the future'* means that money you want to invest will create returns. The most important aspect is ensuring that your investments can ride through the ups and downs of the financial market AND be best protected against inflation.

&#x200B;

My advice? First, Real commodities. Not *'let's jump onto an online broker and buy a piece of paper that says I have gold'.* I mean the real deal. Buy bullion (coins) in silver or gold and just sit on it until you can trade it back in for a house (again, physical asset) or whatever you plan to use it for.

Second, you don't have to have 'crazy DD' nor would you be in the market if you could do that. Pick up some books and do what you can to not just learn fundamentals behind companies, but how to read 8-K filings etc. This is your money and trust yourself where you want to invest it in the stock market (if you decide to also go this route).

And the most I've ever made has been the past two years around 30k, but just putting little slivers in over time have resulted in me having like 15k in the market after a few years because it compounds. You hardly notice $50 leaving your paycheck every other week, but after a year you've put in $1200, another year $2400, a third year $3600, and its been compounding and might be  flirting near 10k. Idk, I just figure its a better way towards building wealth than lottery tickets, and worst case scenario you're out $50 you would have honestly spent on beer.

2021-04-06 23:02:33,stocks,"Additional piece of advice to a newbie: find yourself an online brokerage (Schwab, Fidelity, etc) that charges $0 in fees for trades on these funds. 

That way even if you only have $20 to toss in at the end of the month, you can do it instead of having to save up and invest in large chunks. A $3 fee (example) on a $100 order means you need to make 7% just to return 1% by the time you buy it ($3) and sell it later ($3 again). 

Also make sure your brokerage doesn’t charge a fee to keep your account open, or have minimum balances to avoid fees. Anymore these things are going away, but don’t just join your local credit union because it’s convenient and they talk a big game. 

Sites like [Nerdwallet](www.nerdwallet.com) are useful for beginners to answer basic questions about different kinds of accounts, or to compare brokerages and credit cards** etc. 

**While I’m on that topic, I advise getting yourself a credit card (Discover has one for students with little-to-no income), and use it like a debit card. Pay it off in full each month, don’t spend money you don’t have. But starting a credit history at 18 will pay off when you’re 25 and beginning to do things like buy a car or even get a mortgage. You’ll even get some cash back with good cards too. Again, find one with no annual fees or other crap like that."

It’s also misleading and can put unwanted pressure on kids, making them believe that life will be shit after they turn 25. Every year of my life has been great in different ways because I enjoy life.

Lowering your interest rate from credit cards to whatever you can get on a loan makes a MASSIVE difference.  You can already survive without the extra cash so consider taking what you save and putting it into an index fund to compound into a down payment.

I had been a career waiter and although the money was pretty good, I fancied becoming the Manager of a successful restaurant. I went about educating myself and found myself qualified for the role within a year. I now have a nice home, lovely wife, a modest mortgage and car payment, 3 motorcycles bought for cash and a decent sized sailboat.  Ironically, after 10 years Management, I made the decision to become a waiter again in a high end place simply because the money remained high but the hours are far more flexible."

But I disagree that you shouldn't buy individual stocks without ""crazy"" DD. It doesn't take that much information to pick 30 stocks and have 20 be winners over a 10 year timeframe. Not saying it's likely that you'll outperform VOO or VTI, but at least you're giving yourself a chance"

Stocks is not nearly as big and spooky as anyone in this thread is making it out to be. If you have the time, the interest, the knowhow, and the stomach then go for it. You can probably beat the market. 

If you don’t and just want to put your money somewhere thats safe, doesn’t need to be managed at all and will consistently grow over time then index funds are your best friend. 

I think the stomach will kill most aspirational stock pickers than anyone else and is the biggest portfolio killer over the actual picking(within reason ofc)."
2021-04-06 20:59:58,stocks,You'll make 0.07% more a year going with VOO.
2021-04-06 21:12:07,stocks,"If you make more than 66k a year you stop getting deductions when you put into a Roth, basically getting double taxed.

If you make less than 30k a year you're probably going to be taxed the same or more in retirement.

So a rough estimate is only put into an IRA if you make between 30-66k a year.  If you make below 30k put into a Roth IRA.  If you make above 66k put into a 401k, and if you max out your 401k put into a Roth IRA.  However, if you do make 30-66k you probably want to max out a 401k, then put into an IRA.  This is because of 401k matches and most 401ks have lower fees on equivalent index funds like VOO, so they end up being a slightly better deal.

>Why the emphasize on ROTH?

Because most people who are saving for retirement are outside of the 30-66k income range, and of the people in the proper income range, they have to save everything they're making after tax, so they pretty much have to be living for free at their parents house or similar to take advantage."
2021-04-06 21:29:14,stocks,"Yep.  A 401k reduces your tax burden.  Eg if your top tax bracket is 24% and you put into a 401k you get a 24% savings.  Generally for most people out there maxing out a 401k is ideal before considering a Roth IRA.

If you're a college student working at McDonald's so you're making little and so your tax rate might be 10%, it's better to max out your Roth IRA.  That and you typically will not be offered a 401k at a low paying job so it becomes your only option.

If you max out a 401k and Roth IRA every year of your work life, assuming a stable income, you can retire early.  Subs like /r/personalfinance and /r/financialindependence go into this."
2021-04-06 21:31:59,stocks,"If the market crashes all stocks take a hit.  What you consider a huge hit vs just a hit is opinionated.  They'll take less of a hit than most reasonable investment options, which is why they are preferred.  Anything that makes more than VOO will take a huge hit.  Anything that makes less than VOO will either make quite a bit less or take roughly the same sized hit.

Also, if you dollar cost average (put money into the market bit by bit every paycheck) you'll most likely have more in your account at the stock market bottom than you did at the top, unless you have hundreds of thousands saved already, so will you lose money?  No, only if you sell.  Best to buy low, which is why DCA (dollar cost averaging) is so awesome."

2021-04-06 22:20:50,stocks,"Maybe.  Depends on economic conditions.  I mean, I wouldn't want to own XLV if we go to a Medicare-for-All program, and I wouldn't want to be in bank stocks if interest rates take off.

The original post was really low-risk, low-effort strategy that is tough to beat without investing a lot more time and effort.  Invest in index funds forever and you'll retire wealthy, sure as the sun rises in the East.  

But lets take a look at your picks and the 10-year returns.
VOO: 13.38%
DIA: 12.28%

XLK: 19.19% - nice
XLV: 15.16%
XLF: 11.05%
XRT: 13.86%
VNQ: 8.19%
XLT: -1.16%
Average of all 6: 11.05%

Yeah, some of those returns are great!  And over the last few months XLT has been cookin, and XLK looks pretty worthwhile as whole. But that's an approach that is going to take a lot more awareness, research, and upkeep to really keep profitable compared to the overall market as a whole.  The average investor picking stocks does not get returns as good as the whole market.  Clearly it's possible to beat the market, but if I'm an 18 year old and want to do 18-year-old stuff, not pour over financials... index funds are hard to beat."

If you had put in $1000 in Feb 2020 and it was worth $600 a month later, how would you feel?  Would that be devastating to your finances?  If so, don't invest.

The only thing that is certain is that money in a savings account loses value to inflation.  My bank just dropped rates to 0.1% on savings.  Unacceptable!"

From what I understand, they have a slightly lower expense ratio at the cost of a higher minimum investment, and allow for additional purchases at no brokerage fee (which these days is true for stocks and ETFs, too). “Dumping all your money” is generally a bad idea, especially if you may need it within the next couple of years, like for college or to move out or if you’re dumb and get someone pregnant.

Thing is you can’t touch the money until you’re 59 without paying penalties, so if you need it liquid then it’s not a good instrument. Rule of thumb is to not invest spare cash until you have a few months of living expenses and emergency funds already saved up. You should definitely research this on your own though and don’t take financial advice off one comment on Reddit. These investment banks like fidelity, vanguard, Charles schwab all have experts who can advise you"
2021-04-07 03:15:03,stocks,"I'm no expert, but Roth IRA is an investment fund that you pay with after tax funds (as opposed to before tax like a 401k). The benefit to that is you don't pay taxes on it when you retire after the account has grown. Additionally, you can pull out your contributions to the account with no penalty (but not the profits), which can be good if you retire early or run into financial trouble. 

I used it to build up my emergency fund as well. I put all my emergency funds into a Roth but didn't actually invest it so there is no risk. Once I had enough built up, I could start investing it in small increments as I deposited more. This allowed me to not ""waste"" the 6k Roth cap every year while I was saving.

Getting into healthy saving and spending habits early on (when you are in college or even high-school) is key. Maybe the amount you can set aside is much less at 20 compared to maybe 30 or whatever but getting into the habit of setting a % of your earnings aside is key imo. Not to mention why delay saving for your future? The best time to start is 6 months ago. The second best time is today. Between ages 20-24, if one would save only 25 bucks a week, this person would have about 5 grand saved. This isn't a bad little place to start with an investment account and maybe you can start saving for a home once you have your ideal job but what if that job doesn't come in due time ? At least you will have something started. And this is only saving 25 a week.

There’s something to be said for delaying consumption til the future. And realizing how much money can compound if given enough time. Don’t ask me, run the numbers through portfolio visualizer. Even something modest - $1000 per year. Look at the different if you delay consumption and follow your investing program for 45 years vs spending it now and getting started 10, 15 years later, and only having 30-35 years for your money to do it’s thing. In short: anyone asking about getting started early is doing their future self a heck of a favor. 

And so to circle back to OP - kudos for getting started early. Your future self will thank you. As for what to invest in? I would suggest reading up on two things: dollar cost averaging and index investing. You’ll probably get great results in a broad index fund, which you invest fixed amounts in regularly, regardless whether the market is high or low. Maybe by the time you’re my age, you’ll be more concerned about managing risk than taking on all sorts of risk in order to maximize returns like so many others have to do, since by that point you’ll probably have already met the goals you needed to reach."

2021-04-07 02:02:02,stocks,"Gatekeeping DD because it's 'too hard' just seems like the dumbest possible take on an investing sub. Why the hell are we all here otherwise?

On a personal note, last year I saw a drone stock (whose ticker I can't post here without being  removed) mentioned on a sub and thought it sounded promising so decided to do some DD of my own. 

I spent a day or 2 looking into a) the financials b) the technology c) the leadership team involved and discovered several qualities that showed asymmetric upside and a few future catalysts. Not any quant math wizardry, but things like:

a) their tech has a battery life advantage over their competitors by 40%

b) drone usage by police and military is growing rapidly, with the current limiting factor being battery life

c) the ex-head of Tesla's battery R&D team founded the company and is on the leadership team

d) their market cap at the time was a fraction of their next closest technological competitor

I decided to buy a fair amount because of this when the price was $0.40 - over the past few months it's climbed to a floor of $4 with an ATH of $8 because of the reasons I researched becoming more widespread knowledge. I sold to cover my initial investment and will be holding most for the longterm because of the DD i did back then and currently.

It's just a matter of what kind of candidates you're looking at: when you pick your own (in this case focusing on relatively-nascent or beaten-down companies you really think will shape tomorrow), you get a little more focus/concentration (and subsequently increased risk). 

It's certainly far from any kind of be-all-end-all approach that everyone NEEDS to follow, but I think it's at least interesting to conceptualize."

2021-04-06 22:27:04,stocks,"Fund manager's are a terrible metric to base your argument on and don't really fall neatly into the category of stock pickers.

They don't just simply buy and hold like is recommended by people like Buffet and use much higher risk strategies and methods(Like shorting stocks and options, and swing trading) that stray faaaar beyond stock picking and are far from what the average investor here is likely to ever do or know how to do. You are FAR more likely to beat the market stock picking and holding long term than you ever will with options or shorting or swing trading.

For reference, I highly advocate *against* options or shorting or even swing trading unless you're really well versed in it. That's where much more complexities in that that takes way more study to grasp than stock picking and yes, you will more than likely blow up your account than you ever will beat the market.

Stock picking is a whole different and much less risky beast and yes, **if you know your shit** your odds of beating the market aren't nearly as bad as most make it out to be. It's more simply that most retail traders *don't* know their shit and quite a lot of active managers do way riskier shit than your avg educated stock picker is undertaking, therefore the data looks terrible. If you follow the Warren Buffet method of valuing companies and take time to do DD your odds of beating the market are waaay higher than any HF manager. If you don't have the time, knowhow, or stomach for it then by all means indexes are great investment vehicles. Not shitting on them in the slightest."

2021-04-07 12:40:01,stocks,"https://www.thebalance.com/how-to-calculate-your-effective-tax-rate-4685263

Look at the chart on that page. If you make 91k AGI and choose to put 6k in a Roth instead of traditional, you pay 24% tax on that decision. You don’t reach 24% effective tax rate until you reach $230k of income (today’s dollars). So you have to reach that level of distributions for this to be a break even decision and that implies a $5m account balance. This is important because your financial situation is uncertain and you are guaranteeing a high income tax as opposed to letting your income tax be calculated when you know what your financial situation is. If your income in retirement is lower than 230k for any reason then you prepaid taxes you didn’t owe. So you’re making a decision that only benefits the rich future you at the expense of poor to mid income future you. That savings will mean less to rich you and that guy might have other ways to earn income other than Roth distributions (passive business income, qualified dividends, LTCG).

Sure the tax law will change meaning the percentages and brackets. But the concept that the weighted average tax rate will be lower than the top tax bracket will not go away in a progressive system. And in this case you are making a bet on marginal tax rates rising substantially at the lower brackets.

Roth’s place is where your effective tax rate including the investment is at or below the 12% bracket. So that’s for young people making not a lot of money and families who get large deductions and budget well."

1. Beating the index fund return: You can make money easily by picking stocks. But many investors don't realize that ""beating the market"" means beating the index funds (mostly the S&P500). Has everyone that thinks they can beat the market actually plugged in the numbers to check what they'd be if they invested in VTI/VOO? If you can beat the S&P500 consistently by a large margin, do it!
2. Time: if you're spending 40 hours a week trading and are beating the market by 0.1% then is it really worth the time? Index fund investors don't pick stocks or daytrade, tbh it's boring AF. I use about 10% of my capital for fun trades.
3. Long-term: [Over 15 years, less than 9% of active, professional fund managers have beat the S&P](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/15/active-fund-managers-trail-the-sp-500-for-the-ninth-year-in-a-row-in-triumph-for-indexing.html).

2021-04-06 22:36:04,stocks,"Your feeling is likely correct. Think about why so many people on Reddit have beat the market over the past 1 to 10 years. People on Reddit are likely to favor tech stocks, which conveniently have outperformed the market during the past decade. In fact, if you simply bought a NASDAQ index fund, say QQQ, you'd have beaten the market. 


In asking people's age, you're onto something. It's much easier to beat the market (and emotionally easier to invest extremely aggressively) in the longest bull market in history. Would these same people say it's so easy to beat the market after 2008? What about the Dot Com bubble? Did they perfectly time the Nifty Fifty and continue to beat the market in the subsequent market crash?

So even if people say they are in their 40s, that means they have invested through a single recession and might have experienced the dot Com boom and bust. Does that qualify them to explain how easy it is to beat the market in various market conditions? Probably not, but it sure makes them more qualified them the 20 and 30 year olds who have beat the market by buying tech stocks. 

Here is a fun example:
If 20% of your portfolio was Tesla and the other 80% was companies that have since gone bankrupt, you'd have beaten the market over the past five years (by over 50%). Would that make that person an investing genius? Hardly, 4 of their 5 picks went bankrupt. And let's not even get into the fact that Tesla's P/E has no basis in reality, much like other companies related to electric cars.


Between 1992 and 2017, the average return of a mutual fund was 8.55%, where the S&P 500 averaged 9.69%. (Source: A Random Walk Down Wall Street). If professionals who have teams researching spending 8 hours a day can't consistently beat the market, how can you reasonably expect someone who is equally knowledgeable (and let's be clear, you and I are not as up to date as fund managers) to do it in only few hours a week. There are plenty more statistics that show that the fund managers who happen to beat the market to it by chance, not by skill, if you're curious to see them, I suggest reading Jack Bogle's ""The Little Book of Common Sense Investing."" (I would actually recommend reading the book if you have any interest in investing, it's usually the first book I recommend to people.

If you want to buy individual stocks, my suggestion is to do it with a small portion of your portfolio (<5%) and consider it just as much a hobby as an investment. Additionally, you may want to focus on a specific niche where you think you have an advantage or you can study, whether it is because you believe the market is inefficient in that sector, market cap, or you just have an intimate knowledge of what is needed in that sector or industry."

> That's where much more complexities in that that takes way more study to grasp than stock picking

I guess I don't agree with this. To do good value stock picking you need to have a good understanding the company, its financials, the sector, etc. Look at the pages and pages of DD DFV did-- that is expertise. I can't touch that shit.

CC's/options are easy to grasp in comparison lol. And I don't think options are inherently more risky, you literally can cap your risk/losses or use them as hedge plays.

Except Warren Buffet's own method explains his decline perfectly. It's all about his sphere's of competence and them not including tech! Part of Buffet's strategy is to avoid stuff he does not understand and the dude is very very open about not understanding tech and how that's impacted his returns. Dude didn't touch apple until **2016** for instance. Buffet's age is really his biggest downfall in the modern era moreso than his methodology or valuing companies.

This doesn't really apply to a younger investor who understands how to value companies and who inherently will have a much stronger grasp on tech just due to more exposure at a younger age.

>""A low-cost index fund is the most sensible equity investment for the great majority of investors... by periodically investing in an index fund, the know-nothing investor can actually out-perform most investment professionals,""

And this is true because as I stated later on in my argument--most investors do not know their shit.

This advice is for the average joe without interest in the market or learning how to value companies and absolutely will apply to most investors as lets face it, not everyone has the interest or patience for stocks.

Buffet has published and contributed to entire books on how to value companies so I'd struggle to say he means this for everyone.

>To do good value stock picking you need to have a good understanding the company, its financials, the sector, etc. Look at the pages and pages of DD DFV did-- that is expertise. I can't touch that shit.

Sure and if you're not willing to do that or don't know how then absolutely stick to index funds. But I think people who do know how to go about doing this or have interest should absolutely try to learn and give it a shot.

Temperament is important too. You can do all the DD in the world but that doesn't matter if you're going to panic at the first sight of red.

>CC's/options are easy to grasp in comparison lol. And I don't think options are inherently more risky, you literally can cap your risk/losses or use them as hedge plays. IMO to be a good value stock picker you have to be good enough at financial analysis to do DD. Like, my brother has his MBA and does real estate DD for a living, he doesn't even touch stock picking, there's so much you have to learn

I mean if you're talking selling CC's sure that's easy as you don't have to worry about IV crush or the Greeks nearly as much and your downside is pretty minimal when compared to buying puts or calls as purchasing puts/calls 

However if you're buying puts or calls, no that's WAAAAY more intensive than pulling up balance sheet information(Which is really not nearly as hard to access as you think), understanding the product the business sells and it's positioning in the market, and measuring profits over times to their relative debt, evaluating management etc. etc.

I know my paragraph here doesn't really make it seem more simple than buying calls or puts but trust me it really is and not understanding those will blow your accounts up faster than anything else(Just go look at WSB). I picked up on stock picking pretty easy. Talking about option fundementals or strategies to me may as well be as useful as speaking to me in Chinese.

> Like, my brother has his MBA and does real estate DD for a living, he doesn't even touch stock picking, there's so much you have to learn

I mean sure this makes sense because real estate and stocks is like apples to oranges, this is like saying a biologist doesn't touch theoretical physics, both are science at the end of the day but two completely different fields. They're two entirely different beasts with two entirely different types of fundementals. You don't need to worry about whether or not the Apple campus is close to a good school or neighborhood to value Apple for instance and there's no balance sheets to evaluate when looking at real estate.

This is just me but I'm the exact opposite of your brother I understand stocks better than real estate and don't even know where to begin on real estate DD(Although I am interested and may look into learning it in the future). To put it on more equal footing if we were to compare DFV to your brother I'd probably put my money on your brother knowing how to value property better than DFV(Who knows though I'm not 100% on DFV's spheres of competence)."

2021-04-06 22:37:15,stocks,"Generally no, you can't move money out of a 401k unless there's a change of status (like, retirement, or changing employers).  And if you do move from a standard 401k to a Roth IRA you have to pay taxes on the contributions which were not originally taxed, including any employer match.  So, that can have serious tax consequences depending on your specific situation.  I'd recommend consulting an accountant or financial advisor before going down that road. 

However, it costs you nothing to set up an IRA or Roth IRA, and you can just have it there empty, waiting for funding, or you can start contributing from each paycheck with an auto-debit or something.  That's the easy stuff that gets your foot in the door.  And with the 5-year withdrawal policy on the Roth IRA, it helps you out to have the account open as soon as possible, even if you take months or years to eventually fund it."

2021-04-07 14:36:06,stocks,"Invesco wanted to reach more investors with a cheaper ETF. People who can't afford paying $300+ for one QQQ share (and who don't have access to fractional shares), although I do wonder why then they didn't make QQQM cost less than $100 per share. Also, expense ratio (management fees) is slightly cheaper for QQQM: 0.15% compared to 0.20% in QQQ. Both fees are low, but this slight difference can add up over time. They could have just lowered the fees in QQQ, but I think it's pretty clear why they didn't do that (more money for them).

For buy-and-hold investors QQQM might actually be a better investment. That being said, QQQ isn't redundant yet. The fact is trading volume for QQQ is significantly higher than QQQM, so good for day traders and options. Also if you invest millions of dollars, the extra liquidity ~~skills~~ should benefit you. Lastly, for someone already holding QQQ, it might not make sense to sell it all and replace it with QQQM -  especially in a tax account."

2021-04-07 00:01:54,stocks,"I think the argument is that every dollar you spend towards erasing your debt is effectively a 10% return on your investment if you're paying 10% on interest. That's about the same return you can expect to make through smart investments, so you might as well put your money towards eradicating your debt as it's a safe, consistent 10% ""return"" and if your interest is higher than 10%, you're actually gonna get -more- of a return than you could expect from investing."
2021-04-07 02:51:28,stocks,"""I’m not sure how it’s actually calculated if it’s not just straight up percentage of total debt""

Seriously bro or ladybro, think about this statement really hard. You are paying a bank to loan you money and you don't even know how to calculate it. Don't agree to something you don't understand, especially if your money is involved.

It is highly unlikely at your credit card interest rate is 7.44%. That's crazy low. Like, almost impossibly low. You're only going to get that if you have good credit, which you definitely don't.

7.44% was probably an *introductory* rate that expires after you have the card for a while. It's likely much higher now, and you should figure out what that is.

If you divide the APR by 12, and multiply that by what you owe, that will give you the total interest for the month. (APR -- annual percentage rate, divide by 12 to give you the monthly interest rate). 

By putting that $500 in something else, you're keeping $500 worth of loan(credit line) open. Every month, you're paying an additional percentage on that to keep the loan open, which in turn cuts into your profits for the month. You aren't going to come out ahead in that regard, because the bank is better with money than you, and they're only loaning you that money because they know you pay them more money than they can make investing elsewhere. Compare your interest rate to your first month of investment and see how you do. If you beat the interest, keep doing it. If not, pull your money out, pay down your debt, and go read through ever contract you've ever signed."
2021-04-07 07:37:17,stocks,"I don’t know why nobody is answering your question. Your debt is repaid in monthly installments, so your interest accumulates monthly. At 7.44% APR (Annual Percentage Rate) on $26,000, your monthly interest payment would be:

$26,000 * (0.0744/12) = $161.20 per month 

That’s if the interest is applied only once a month. You can also have interest that applies daily, like: 

$26,000 * [(1+0.0744/365)^30) -1] = $161.68

This is slightly more, because on day 2, you pay interest on the interest from day 1, and on day 3 you pay interest on the interest from days 1 and 2, and so on. 

Then there are ways to make your interest compound literally continuously, but you can Google that yourself."

More states lifting lockdown restrictions and spring/summer on the way likely bringing more travel to our everyday lives is my only hunch on the subject. I know there is a lot more to the subject than that so maybe you guys can provide some thoughts/analysis on the topic.

I want to double down on the sector but not without doing the proper research first."
2021-04-06 20:49:58,stocks,"I’m an oil bull that completely acknowledges a dwindling market. So why stay optimistic? Because I’m bullish on overall emerging markets and international development. I think the transportation sector is undoubtedly shifting in developed nations, but less so in developing nations. Enough to largely offset the losses in that sector here.

I also think oil and gas will start increasing their presence in renewable energy. I imagine if you’re already building offshore oil rigs, you’d have an easier time building offshore wind turbines."
2021-04-06 23:35:30,stocks,"Oil is more than cars. How much plastic is made? How about tires for every car, or rubber in general? Still need to lubricate moving parts. How any electric airplanes have you rode in? Electric ships probably don't have a charging ports in the middle of the sea. Oil is never going away until we run out of it. All of your smaller refineries that closed due to covid won't come back. Most oils companies are in or getting into the liquefied natural gas game.I own all major oil companies and right now. My favorite and IMO undervalued is Shell."

2021-04-07 14:45:16,stocks,"People always say this, yet retail stores didn't do it to Amazon, Nokia didn't do it with smartphones, legacy automakers didn't do it with Tesla, Blockbuster didn't do it with Netflix, I don't see oil companies doing it with renewables.

Old companies are too short term-focused to see that long term they're putting themselves out of business, and oil companies are the pinnacle of short term-minded businesses. They very well could be the exception to the rule, but I wouldn't put any money on it."
2021-04-07 06:10:51,stocks,"I bought several oil / energy titles months ago. I am green with all of those.

2021-04-06 20:26:14,stocks,"This is one of the reasons to invest in oil.  Biden and his lackeys--or is it the other way around--will do everything he can to restrict U.S. supply and this will drive up prices while at the same time the world is opening up and demand is going up.  Companies like Suncor, which is profitable at an oil price of $35/barrel, will be minting money."
2021-04-07 14:49:36,stocks,"The incentive for armies to phase out their oil-reliant equipment is gigantic. Electric vehicles are much less maintenance-heavy, require much less logistics, have better performance and can be made more safely. I do agree it will take a while for them to make this a priority, but unless you'll die within 20 years you will see it in your lifetime."
2021-04-06 22:20:25,stocks,"I second this as having some work related to the sectors downstream of crude oil. Just google image 'products of crude oil' and you can see the biggest product fractions are gasoline and then diesel. Both product fractions are the biggest for road transport (gasoline for cars, diesel for trucks).

I'm most surprised this OECD article states 19.3% is for electricity generation, since traditionally we use coal or natural gas for this purpose, not oil. Maybe they lumped gas together with oil for this statistic (shrugs)."
2021-04-06 22:28:49,stocks,"Some countries rich in crude do use oil for electricity, Venezuela comes to mind. Gasoline/Diesel is also used for electricity in remote or emergency cases too. Still 20% does seem high to me too."

Use all your tax allowances and buy stocks that will be hear in 40 years with dividends to match your age now  ie at 20 yrs of age buy Apple with a dividend of 1% then you get growth and a dividend that will hopefully go up to 5% for your retirement if your 45 now then Apple is no good as a dividend stock for you as the dividend will be only 2% in 10 years and that's not enough

2021-04-07 03:20:35,stocks,"Hello, Altria had quite a run the last quarter. So while it is still far from expensive BTI is the cheaper of the two. Both have growing revenues and are improving their margins, but they are discounted as tho their revenues are declining. This is mainly due to their core business (cigarettes) declining around 5% a year, but that is not a new development. Both with non-combustibles, oral tabacco (snus) and now cannabis have positioned themselves to still remain relevant, yet it seems the market doesnt take that into account (it did a bit with Altria). Add the huge dividend and even if their share price stays flat or even declines one can expect quite a nice return in the next 5 years."

Inflation is rising and the dollar is falling - industrial uses for EV and solar panels, etc also make it fundamentally undervalued, the inflation adjusted price should be 3 time or more what it currently is.

If you don’t believe it, this silver squeeze movement is causing a legitimate supply shortage and already mints and banks are having major issues.  

It’s a fundamental play on inflation and industrial use that also is going to be squeezed, and also retain the new value as silver finds true price discovery when all the banks that are short via PAPER contracts with SLV are forced to cover with silver they do not actually have.

Read up about the Comex..  it literally runs the silver market and is getting completely Fucked

It is fun to be investing along with other people and buying into a reasonable amount of the excitement.

When i think about what happened the last 2 months and how hard, easily and quickly those Stocks fell while these funds help up more it makes me feel better.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose and don't invest money that you need/want to use in the next year or two (or maybe more)."
2021-04-07 05:29:36,stocks,"You've got some good replies already - but my input is to go through your income and budget out your needs and wants over the next 10 years and figure out what you need in savings to achieve those goals.  You say you have 800 'free' each month - figure out:

1. a minimum amount for an emergency fund
2. how much do you need to save for a house deposit, and figure out the amount per month that you need to set aside.
3. how much do you need to save for car deposit (or buying the car outright), and figure out the amount per month to set aside
4. Do you have anything else that you want to save money for?  I have an amount that I like to have in savings for travel, for example.

Once you really go through and think about these things, you'll come up with an amount that you have to invest in the market.  Resist the urge to pick stocks - it's difficult and you will need a lot of luck to beat the average returns from a simple SP500 tracking ETF."

2021-04-06 21:13:22,stocks,"I guess it’s a matter of opinion. Since you’re young, risky investing into higher-growth opportunities may be especially beneficial.

On the other hand, VOO/VTI are a little more set-it-and-forget-it. I think you have to ask yourself if you see these sectors (genomics and fintech) expanding or shrinking in the short-term and intermediate-term versus the market as a whole. This is purely my opinion, but I have about 5% of my stock portfolio in ARKF because I think Fintech booms over the next couple years. Again though, that’s just my educated guess. Sometimes I think about selling and putting it into something more reliable like you do.

I recommend looking at the top holdings in the funds and looking at these companies. I don’t know much about genomics and I’m a little more hesitant on their growth in the short-term, but that’s just me."
2021-04-07 02:09:42,stocks,"I'd recommend setting some in your savings -- enough for the emergency fund I mentioned at the very least and also maybe a bit more just in case and any money you think you'll need/want to spend in the next few years (e.g., down payment for a house, money for a wedding, etc.).  The US stock market has been historically great over the long term, but there can be a crash where you lose 30% - 50% of your money and it can take several years to come back.  If you can ride that out / don't need that money during that time, you'll be fine (and you'll be even better if you have extra cash to invest), but if you had your rent/mortgage in the market when it crashed, you'll have a rough time."
2021-04-07 02:13:19,stocks,"It's a lot easier to control the price when the volume is low, when the volume is high you're fighting market!

Commonly, if somebody is setting limit orders just above the last price, then those often end up getting filled. If the stock is being actively traded, these won't get hit. But if volume is really low, then they will.

Plus people can spoof the limit order book, but that is illegal. Or sell it to themselves using different brokerages and the price moves up.

It can happen naturally, or artificially, but it isn't normal. If there is little interest in trading a stock, there will still be a few extra people selling because they need liquidity. It is unusual, but possible, to have a slightly higher number of people wandering in the door to buy the stock, even though there isn't much interest. If you have direct market access, you can easily set this up with an algorithm, too. It would be too expensive if the volume was high."

The brief version is: Ethereum is transitioning away from proof-of-work (mining with processing power, like Bitcoin) to proof-of-stake.  Essentially, you lock up your Ethereum, and then serve as a validator for the network, earning a modest APR, but facing severe penalties for taking part in any malicious action against the network.  This will drastically reduce the carbon footprint from mining, but is largely unproven ground, compared to the battle-tested proof-of-work system currently in use, so it remains to be seen what effect this transition will have on the value of Ethereum, but most of the community is very optimistic."

2021-04-06 23:58:15,stocks,What do you use now?
2021-04-06 23:08:46,stocks,"That’s not how disproportionate works.  Whether they have 56 users or 56 million isn’t the point.  Obviously I don’t have hard data but just going by the general “vibe” of the different exchange subs, Coinbase seems to MOSTLY be filled with complaints some of which are very scary like being locked out of your funds with no recourse or response from customer service.

None of the other exchange subs are even CLOSE to the number of complaints (especially serious ones) as CB is.

Sounds like you’re happy with them and that’s awesome.  I hope you never have any issues because if you do all I can say is “good luck”."
2021-04-07 07:48:43,stocks,Yeah over 3 years later lol.. It’s a worthwhile investment long term but to assume it won’t go down short term is crazy. It can be 10k or 100k in a week
2021-04-07 12:47:24,stocks,"Yeah I see coinbase as a medium term play. this line of thinking (dexes will replace centralized exchanges! says crypto fanboys) made me second guess yoloing a substantial portion of my portfolio into Binance coin when it was $50/coin. I still grabbed some but damn, I'd be sitting prettier if I hadn't been looking that far into the future to determine if it was a good buy or not."
2021-04-07 13:42:16,stocks,"true true buttttt i think you’re playing a different game with stocks, i mean cryptos will do their thing every 3-4 years and you can ride that up with BNB or whatever you want but with stocks you’re usually looking a bit longer term"

2021-04-06 20:17:40,stocks,This post makes my brain hurt
2021-04-06 20:15:54,stocks,"Isn't she basically saying that technology innovations that have great potential to be profitable aren't reflected in a company's current profit and losses or GDP?

Which makes sense with TSLA. The stock isn't sky rocketing because the company is making a lot of money. It's skyrocketing because people are valuing it for the technology or the potential of technology to pan out and make profit"

2021-04-06 23:17:56,stocks,"For her sake I hope this is not what she is saying. There are absolutely no reasons to value 'potential' in GDP. If we want to value potential, we might as well also include expected winnings from lottery tickets."
2021-04-07 07:50:37,stocks,Valuation of things by humans is in many ways arbitrary. GDP is great for realized income but all stock valuations are also based on unrealized income. That's why she is saying comparing the S&P to the GDP is a bad metric. It's especially true when you're talking about profitable technology that is still being developed or is potentially being developed.
2021-04-07 13:11:35,stocks,The only one I trust is Buffett and BRK. He's had specific levels of valuation that would justify buybacks in place for decades.
2021-04-07 13:09:05,stocks,People who enjoyed the buyback driven stock growth hates you
2021-04-06 23:43:54,stocks,"Expected winnings from lottery tickets is a good gauge of lottery ticket value. It's simply estimated value which is very low.

She's responding to musk's question about GDP in relation to S&P's market cap. Essentially she's saying it's a poor way to gauge values of stocks which is true.

You can't gauge the value of companies simply on GDP. GDP only accounts for realized gains. A company's value or stock is also based on expected gains."
2021-04-07 09:00:35,stocks,"Totally fair and true in case of stock and price of goods (especially collector's items) valuations when it comes to physical goods.

However, saying ""inflation is probably lower"" is a bit too euphoric for me - especially to tie into that as it's dangerous to suggest we should not think about inflation when looking at tech valuations. Since they are so fast-growing that you need ""different measures"" for them - I don't know... but sounds suspiciously close to the .com bubble shortly before it burst in terms of justifying some probably very inflated valuations (no matter the arbitrage, if it's unhinged from fundamentals like revenue stream and DCF - how many years of ""explosive growth"" do we assume to justify the super high TSLA valuation right now in 2021, despite of [this chart](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/09/teslas-crazy-valuation-in-1-chart/) making it pretty clear in relative terms? 

I'm not a big Motley Fool fan (actually the opposite), but that chart is great in its simplicity.

I hope no-one is comparing S&P directly to GDP, at least I don't. I guess you meant the Total Stock Market ([using Wilshire 5000](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EW5000?p=^W5000&.tsrc=fin-srch)) to GDP ratio? 

Ie the old ""Buffet Indicator"", as represented by [this](https://www.statista.com/chart/21972/market-capitalization-to-gdp-ratio/) (recently updated) chart. It's just an indicator, obviously, not the universal truth - but unless someone comes up with something ""better"" it has still got its merits. And when we look at this, we clearly see the indication of all recent bubbles and its downswing on their market corrections following.

Make whatever you will out of it, I draw my conclusions for myself and won't let Cathie tell me otherwise, however much she'd like to defend having bought TSLA and other potentially headed-for-a-correction stocks."

How safe is it really? Genuinely asking. Is there something legally stopping them from one day just suddenly cutting that dividend? I understand why they might not want to do that, but could they?"
2021-04-07 07:00:05,stocks,"That’s kind of what this whole thread is about. ATT has prided themselves on not cutting their dividend. They also prided themselves on raising it every year which they didn’t do this year. 

Ultimately I think it’s safe from a cut. It’s a stock for income investors primarily. Meaning that most of the people who hold it are it in primarily to draw income from the dividend. Those people don’t care much about the share price, just the yield. 

Just like any stock there is always risk but I think it’s very unlikely ATT would cut their dividend"
2021-04-06 20:25:17,stocks,In today's market you can overperform or underperform pretty easy if you are trying to chase sectors or individual stocks.  I've moved around between industries and stocks and luckily have been mostly in the right ones more than wrong following catalysts.  Longer term is is better to buy a broader index fund if you find it upsetting being in the wrong thing at the wrong time when  the broader market is going up.  When the market is going down you do have to pick or stay out but we have not see a read red market even midterm in the past +10 years except for a short period when it caught COVID.

Somehow just watching prices daily for a long time helps teach you certain market trends. Trading is more emotion than anything IMO. Over time killing your FOMO and spending time on a few companies rather than 20 are just strategies that have taught.

Also as many times as its been artificially pushed down and bounces right back without issue. I believe between 150 and 180 Gamestop to be actually worth with the extremely low amount of shares available. Then over the next year will be nothing but better and better news. The entire boards been replaced and still is being replaced and they are going to move to e commerce. Ryan Cohen (Chewy Founder) put his own money where his mouth is. Video gaming is a growing industry. Gamestop warned there is a potential for a squeeze to happen pretty much warning their investors they might not want to buy if it starts mooning. They Also just repositioned theirs self to be able to profit off the squeeze, estimating themselves their shares to be worth a minimum of 285. This company has alot of support. I dont really see to compare ARK and Gamestop since ARK is an etf. I just think its riskier for an etf and Gamestop has much more potential. The bottom line is idk how long term you mean but as long as you regularly read about it I plan to make alot more money on GME than ARK."

2021-04-06 23:04:24,stocks,"Why would it be a bad idea to buy the dip on say blue chip stocks or others if the described scenario in that DD actually plays out?  Also, this is probably a dumb question but how would someone buy precious metals?"
2021-04-07 05:23:28,stocks,"That’s not how you manage a crash... you take profits and invest more short term minded. And have cash around to buy that dip while you have long term investments that secure you if you are wrong. 

You can’t possibly think that the current state of the market is sustainable?"
2021-04-07 11:14:45,stocks,"well it wouldnt be a bad idea to buy the dip on blue chips at all. the only problem is $GME is NOT a blue chip. personally i would keep 15-30% cash and dca it into real blue chips as the prices go down. 

not a dumb question at all, your best way of purchasing precious metals depends on whether or not you want physical. you can buy $GDX shares or you can go to jmbullion and purchase an actual ounce of gold and store it under your mattress or something. if you want physical gold you will be paying a serious premium cause there seems to be a shortage."
2021-04-07 11:36:30,stocks,"Thanks!  And I guess I meant, selling GME and using that to fund a dip. However, that obviously means timing the market perfectly and relies on GME actually mooning. Also, is there any real benefit to holding shares of precious metals v. physical gold?"
2021-04-07 13:12:23,stocks,"im not sure if i would take that risk, i would much rather have some cash standing by already.

the only benefit to holding $gdx shares is liquidity and ease. $gdx shares are much easier and quicker to sell compared to a 1 oz gold coin or bar.

the main benefit to having physical gold is that in the event of an absolute economic crash it will be EXTREMELY hard to find physical gold. you dont trade $gdx like you do physical. when you buy physical gold you should sit on it for the rest of your life and hopefully pass it down to your children. it is quite literally the best inflation hedge and the best “savings account”."

2021-04-07 04:16:15,stocks,"Oh, yes... the ""minor"" caveat... should probably have mentioned that one!

Makes absolutely no sense whatsoever, especially on expensive units of stock like Nintendo is.

Not sure why they did install that 100 min order. It definitely is a great tool to keep us out of their stock exchange.

There is some (limited) liquidity untied in Frankfurt Exchange... so you can maybe check if you can purchse the same ISIN from those places where they don't have that ridiculous limit. But be aware that Tokyo Exchange allows for only the ""100 Lot"" trades (ie. you can only sell there then if you have 100, by that rule).

Following the separation of the company in December  2020 and as indicated in the separation announcement, the legacy Aimco  dividend is being continued in the shares of AIR Communities (AIRC).  AIRC announced a $0.43 per share quarterly dividend,  or a 5% increase over the regular dividend paid by Aimco as a combined  company in 2020.  

AIV does not presently intend to pay regular cash  dividends.  AIV is a REIT and will comply with REIT regulations  regarding the distribution of taxable income to shareholders, but it  does not intend to do this through a regular (quarterly)  cash dividend.

2021-04-07 03:07:29,stocks,"I appreciate the feedback 

I honestly don’t understand that at all. It was on every stock website that they had a dividend. It was something like 83% when I invested

The stock stock is worth 1.4 times more than when I invested, so I’m not at a loss... I was just expecting that big dividend here soon

I really appreciate you sharing the information!!!

Is there any other stock with a crazy dividend like that?!"
2021-04-07 03:19:52,stocks,"I had the same presumption, and you are correct in that all of the sites I've done DD on this stock have explicitly shown that they would be paying a dividend. I don't know. I checked out the other Co they mentioned AIRC, and it doesn't have nearly the amount of growth as AIV. My guess is that with all the insider buying by the higher ups that they just don't want to share the gains with the stockholders and line their own pockets. Par for course for essentially a group of  landlords ; ) But, whatever, I'll take my %14 gain and probably sell it soon for something else. Best of luck!"

Above referenced catalysts could come any day now. This will be new information. 

GLSI's II-b trial results are already known:
""We appreciate the overwhelming response to our first poster, where we reported the final efficacy results of our Phase IIb clinical trial showing no breast cancer recurrences in HER2/neu 3+ patients if they were fully immunized with GP2.""

https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/22/design-for-recurring-breast-cancer

The upcoming conference is presenting similar information. Maybe it will be presented differently? https://investor.greenwichlifesciences.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/36/for-cancer-research-annual-meeting 

Either way, the efficacy was known back in December and it's what launched their stock higher. Not sure how them presenting this information again is a catalyst. Regardless, the stock has been moving higher on the assumption something new will occur. It seems a very much sell the news scenario. 

The next catalyst for GLSI is them formally announcing patient enrollment for phase III trials has begun, which they are expecting to happen in Q3/Q4 of 2021."

2021-04-06 21:03:30,stocks,Unless you already have the shares (covered) you would have to acquire them if the person you sold a contract to exercises it.

and also, isn't that why they're buying it off me, to exercise the option?"
2021-04-06 22:12:38,stocks,"No, shares only change hands if a party exercises. You don't have to buy the shares if you sell your call, or if you exercise your call that is then auto-sold at market value. The option just gives you the right to buy(call) or sell(put), depending on the type, of the equity listed in the contract. If the call buyer is in the money and wants to exercise, they then would either buy the shares at the contract price, or take the difference of what it would sell at minus the contract price."

it says that it cost 2090 or so dollars with the .65 fee. 

What is the maximum I could lose? What is the maximum I could make? Is it possible I somehow could owe someone 60k to 70k???? 


Look at this: https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/7w62s9/i_somehow_made_110k_this_morning_and_im_still_not/

can this happen to my account too? Like come on, I don't wanna end up owing money by something like this happening. So how would this work?"
2021-04-06 22:43:09,stocks,"Owing $70k from buying a call? No no. It would just expire out of the money. The most you lose from buying a call is the cost and fee. It's when you start being the seller that you get the chance to lose infinity. The guy from that link was selling puts, which potentially could have lost him a LOT of money. That's not what you want to do if you are worried about owing money at the end. He just got incredibly lucky. Could have owed a lot more than $100k if it had gone the other way."
2021-04-06 23:04:02,stocks,"well when you buy a call, don't you SELL it? The same applies to puts too no? So lets say I buy the call and next week tesla is at 710 and expiration is like 2 days away. THEN I would sell it right?? And whoever buys it from me would exercise and then I would owe a 100 shares of tesla?"
2021-04-06 23:11:04,stocks,"As long as you are holding the call before the expiration date, you have the option to sell it or exercise. You are not the one who wrote the call, so no you aren't on the hook for the shares. I would avoid options entirely until you do some more research. There are tons of videos and website out there about pricing and timing and lots of ways to lose big."
2021-04-07 00:09:24,stocks,"ok, so now there's writing calls?? So the only way you could owe something is if you go out of you're way to write a call or put? Could you explain this a little more? I mean my broker may not even give me the ability to do so, may need to level up or something. What about naked calls and puts, is that the traditional way you would buy a call or put to make profit (like the tesla example from before?) also who is on the hook for the shares then, how do you even write a call or put up?"
