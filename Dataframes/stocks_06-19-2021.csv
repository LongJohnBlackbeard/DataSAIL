2021-06-19 19:22:50,stocks,"Directly due to a blackout?  Probably not much.  Blackouts tend to reduce economic activity.  There will be some short-term demand for portable generators and ice but it will quickly exceed supply.  Might be a short spike in crime and probably some perishable inventory losses but nothing likely to affect stock values long term.

Long term there I would expect some grid investments unless Texans decide they prefer the 1800s lifestyle.

Maybe check out the stock market around the time of the [2003 blackout](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northeast_blackout_of_2003) for some ideas.

I like Canopy too, then Green Thumb and Tilray. However, again HITI shits on every one of these companies and it will be trading in the $400 range in 6 years. Weedmaps is...interesting. Need to do more research on them. It is truly amazing that people do not know about the company with the largest overall footprint in the world right now, which is HITI. Blows my mind.

2021-06-19 18:34:53,stocks,Why did you buy the stock in the first place? If you’re holding long term this split shouldn’t even matter to you.

It's a long, long hold for me, ill only add to."
2021-06-19 19:19:02,stocks,"I'm no expert but a stock split shouldn't affect your current position by much if at all. So you have 15 shares at 745, an 11,175 value. After a 1:2 stock split you will have 30 shares at 372.5, still a 11,175 value. You're still working with the same value, just more units of a smaller value. Stock splits only really affect your decisions if your planning to buy more or actively trading it.   


were you going to sell it soon anyways? then sell it. were you going to keep holding it? then hold it."
2021-06-19 18:39:04,stocks,"Depends on if you need the money now or later. NVDA splits stock often so its just going to make you more money for years to come. If you can wait, hold. If you cant, take the money now."

2021-06-19 18:39:18,stocks,"So, I was recently juxtaposing and comparing Fidelity, Wilshire, ProShares, SPDR, Vanguard, and Schwab ETFs, looking for the ones with the best expense ratio to yield relationship and YTD returns, and came up with the following selections:

SWTSX - to invest in the total stock market (which is pretty much the same as ones that track the Russell 3000 (since their top 10 holdings are, or mostly are, the same), but with a lower expense ratio)

SWPPX - to track the S&P500

DIA - to track the Dow Jones Industrial Average

VTWO - to track the Russell 2000

VTIAX - to invest in the international stock market

TMFC - to invest in The Motley Fool’s picks (this is probably the riskiest ETF of the ones that I’ve listed, so beware). This one wasn’t compared with the others, it’s a mutual fund, not an index fund.

Of course, do your own research, don’t just copy my watchlist, unless you agree with my picks.


By the way, I attained the information I used to compare the ETFs with what I found on Yahoo Finance."

2021-06-19 18:13:47,stocks,"https://ofdollarsanddata.com/no-millennials-arent-poorer-than-previous-generations/

This is a pretty solid post and one of the reasons I'm so bullish on fintech companies.

Millennials do have money, and wealth, and one could argue Gen z, who is behind them, has been the first generation to get introduced this heavily into investing, this young. Regardless of how this happened or what they're doing now, investing early means learning early. And that'll pay off in the long run.

So despite the pessimism that engulfs social media, when it comes to Millennials/Gen z and money. Look where they put it.

Because even if they don't have a lot now, banks are sticky as fuck, and what they do with it now is likely what they will do with it when they are 60 and actually have wealth.

So I'm not looking at BAC and JPM, their boomer banks. All the boomers have their money there, because they've had their money there since they were kids, and two things scare boomers. Change and buttons.

But Millennials/Gen Z are putting their money into companies like Sofi, not BAC and not Wells Fargo. That is the choice they are making now, and that is super bullish for companies like these over the next 40 years. 

It starts with a checking account, maybe a savings, maybe a peer to peer transfer. 

Then they are getting car loans, home loans, and have IRA's and millions of dollars of networth tied to them. 

Once you're in a bank, it has to really REALLY fuck up to lose you. Looking at you Wells Fargo..."

2021-06-19 18:27:01,stocks,"you're getting conflicting and wrong information in the replies. hopefully this answers your question

> The stock split will be payable in the form of a stock dividend. Each shareholder of record as of June 21 will receive an additional three shares of stock for every share held. The shares will be distributed after the market close on July 19, and the newly split shares will begin trading when the market opens on Tuesday, July 20.

> Existing shareholders won't have to do anything to receive the additional shares, which will be deposited directly into their brokerage accounts once the stock split takes effect. It's important to note that investors shouldn't necessarily expect the new shares to appear in their account immediately after the market close on July 19. As internal processes differ from brokerage to brokerage, it may take as many as several days for the new shares to show up in investor accounts.

> Finally, investors should remember that a stock split does nothing to change the value of the underlying business, but merely divides it into a great number of ownership portions. As an example, NVIDIA shares have lately been trading for roughly $700. This means instead of having one share worth $700, shareholders would own four shares, each worth $175.

2021-06-19 19:56:22,stocks,"It’s basically an accounting thing. The record date is for Nvidia to know who gets the split shares. If somebody sells their shares to someone else after the record date, Nvidia gives the shares to the broker who makes sure they are transferred to the new owner."
2021-06-19 19:26:40,stocks,"Just to be clear, theirs no way to lose shares or money through the split process!

For retail investors it's very easy actually, it doesn't matter when you buy the stock, the record date is practically irrelevant, even if you don't own the stock on the record date, the shares will be correctly booked into your account  on the split date, essentially coming from the former owner of the share.

If you own 1 share before the date the stock officially starts trading on split basis you will have 4 the next day regardless of when you bought the share."
2021-06-19 17:47:16,stocks,"Regardless, the stock your holding still splits"
2021-06-19 18:06:32,stocks,You can buy after hours the day before the split and you will still be part of the split.
2021-06-19 17:41:13,stocks,I was wondering the same thing mate….I was thinking of dipping in as well. NVIDIA is definitely a great equity….it’ll do great numbers in the future…lots of upside 📈
2021-06-19 17:36:37,stocks,"To be a shareholder of record you have to wait 2 days for the shares to settle, so if you buy on June 21, you will be a shareholder of record on June 23.

In this case unfortunately, you would be too late to be a shareholder of record."

2021-06-19 19:44:56,stocks,"Incorrect, record date is very important. Unless you are a shareholder of record you won't received any split shares."
2021-06-19 18:12:53,stocks,"Whats the point of bing a shareholder ""on record"" by june 21 then?"
2021-06-19 18:11:56,stocks,"then what the point of being ""on record"" before june 21?"
2021-06-19 18:50:52,stocks,"So what does that mean then? You only get 1 share while everyone else gets 4? So that $700 share will be worth about $175 in a couple weeks time, and you'll have to deal with it?"
2021-06-19 19:53:09,stocks,"That's wrong information, for retail investors it absolutely doesn't matter. 

If you buy a share after the record date you obviously buy it from someone else who is now on record, since that person doesn't own the share anymore the split shares of that person will be allocated to the new owner, if that wasn't the case it would be an infinite money glitch for the seller and everybody would try to dump their shares after the record date."

2021-06-19 18:27:09,stocks,Dividends.
2021-06-19 18:48:10,stocks,"I honestly don't know. But in reality if you buy the stock before the split and hold it through the split your shares split regardless of the dates. I don't understand why they give ""on record"" dates. I guess it's because a split is considered a dividend."
2021-06-19 19:18:45,stocks,[removed]
2021-06-19 19:46:23,stocks,"Wrong, you need to be a shareholder of record by June 21, if not you won't get split shares."

2021-06-19 17:22:30,stocks,"Not at all. A lot of large companies offer things like this. But they typically work with a broker, E-Trade, Fidelity, Schwab, to manage the buys. And often times shares are allocated for insider situations like this."

2021-06-19 17:16:43,stocks,Keep in mind that ET is an Master Limited Partnership and any gains from shares will cause you to have to file a K-12 at tax time. That's why the dividends are insane.   It's a pain to deal with.  They don't send out the forms til last minute so you can't file your taxes until last minute.  Sometimes you even have to get extension.  Also you will have to file in multiple states.  Other than that it's a great company!   I have some ET Leaps.

In the first case, the price could rise indefinitely. The company could issue more shares to meet the demand, but no buyer, no seller, no trade. In reality, of course, 70% of most companies are owned by institutions - even if that’s a bank or financier. They have pretty clear definitions of “taking profits”

In the second case, the company would have taken itself private. Like Michael dell and some capital company did with dell computers. No more stock, no more stock price, no more trading"

This is effectively what happened. Porcshe were attempting a hostile takeover of VW, buying up as many shares as they could, while it was being shorted heavily, simultaneously. Someone eventually realised very few shares were still tradeable, since porsch had gobbled up a load. This caused a rush and an exponential rocket upwards. Very short lived, 1 day I think, though before crashing back down.

2021-06-19 17:58:17,stocks,If you mean nobody is selling?  Everything is for sale FYI. The price would increase until a seller is found.  Alot of the price action you are seeing recently is alot of short ladders and short shares being sold.  Control the float you can control the price.
2021-06-19 16:56:04,stocks,Probably the company would procede with a follow-on before.
2021-06-19 18:23:32,stocks,"Sorry if I seem uneducated, but just out of curiosity, what happens when a company tries to go private through buybacks but x amount of people refuse to sell back? Say for a hypothetical example TSLA started a buyback and tried to go private, There's so many Musk fanboys out there that there's bound to be many that would refuse to sell back and hold onto to stock at any buyback price just for the fact of it being a commodity. In that case would Tesla just not be legally allowed to go private? Or would they have to bring on the remaining stock holders as some kind of board member?"

2021-06-19 19:46:00,stocks,Can't find it. There was a news article on maybe superstonk or DDIntoGME a few weeks ago where they spoke to the guy who bought it all up.
2021-06-19 16:57:37,stocks,"A single index fund is great and fairly diverse by itself, but you'll see a lot of swings in your account value if you check it regularly. To smooth things out, people diversify their portfolio a bit more by mixing the large cap S&P500 index funds with mid/small cap funds or international funds. No one really knows for sure which sectors of the markets will have the greatest gains (or losses), so investing in a single fund may offer greater gains (or more missed opportunities) than multiple ETFs.

Kinda like flipping a quarter where the bet is $1 and the payout for winning is $3. I can bet $1 on heads, $1 on tails, or $2 for both. Either way I bet, I'll win $1 on average over time per game. Betting on both each game is the safest option, but if heads comes up heavy (or tails), then I could have made more if I just bet on it. Unfortunately though, we can't predict which one will come up more."
2021-06-19 16:37:40,stocks,"VOO is great.
I would suggest VTI, VEA and VWO.  These 3 combine for the lowest total fees and also provide you the option to rebalance between those 3 areas as you see fit in future. Adding SCHD and SCHY is an option also."
2021-06-19 17:37:52,stocks,"VTI and you have every sector, growth, value, dow 30 s and p 500, everything but international or bond exposure.
You didn't mention your investing time horizon or whether this was a regular or tax advantaged account, nor your risk tolerance.

So anything in this thread is information and not advice."

2021-06-19 19:02:55,stocks,"Yes. You’ll want to check out r/bogleheads where you’ll find more about this approach to investing.

Edit to add: VOO is a great call."
2021-06-19 17:04:01,stocks,"Yes. A single ETF such as VOO is 500 stocks. Imagine if you had bought 500 stocks in your portfolio manually, would you be asking if you are diversified enough?"
2021-06-19 17:40:17,stocks,"One is fine if it’s a broad market index ETF (like VOO). Prob not the best if it was a thematic or sector-specific ETF. 

You could do worse than just holding VOO as a “set it and forget it” holding and then just adding to it when/if you can moving forward. And stacking VOO would be preferable to having one share each (or whatever) of a bunch of different ETFs that either give you marginal gains bc you’re spread too thin, or have a lot of overlapping holdings that make them somewhat redundant to each other."
2021-06-19 19:12:43,stocks,"yes, VOO alone would be good enough for 95% of everyday ppl to get the average market return.

Only if you want to get more involved you can also look into sector-specific ETF that vanguard offers like VUG (big tech), VGT (IT), VNQ (real estate), VTI (world market), VYM (dividends), etc."
2021-06-19 17:53:08,stocks,Any diversified etf should be safe to pile all your money into. As long as your goal is long term financial stability

2021-06-19 19:23:15,stocks,"Since your ETF focuses on every sector of the market, yes that is fine to just focus on $VTI.

If you said an ETF focused on just one certain sector(i.e; finance, Real Estate, Electric Vehicles)-- then I would probably tell you to diversify"

2021-06-19 19:33:13,stocks,"If there's only one ETF/index fund you want to invest in, then go with VTI/VTSAX - total stock market fund that covers mega, large, mid and small stocks all in one. Can't get more diversification than that, unless you want to balance out with bonds (which if you're young is fairly pointless in this market)"
2021-06-19 19:36:42,stocks,"I like to mix up my ETFs even in the same class with different funds. You get a better blend of companies.

VOO 16.5%

VTI 16.5%

Just make sure that any fund you look into has low spread and low fees to get into."
2021-06-19 18:54:14,stocks,I prefer an ETF with more companies in it. I invest mostly in the MSCI World. It has more than 1600 companies in over 23 countries so it is more diversified and less risky. In addition to that I also use an emerging market ETF
2021-06-19 18:25:28,stocks,"A little bit of every diversification: 
SP500 ETF
DIVIDEND ETF

2021-06-19 19:03:12,stocks,"Consider equal weight index fund like RSP. Voo is market cap based  a handful of 10 companies makes up 12% of portfolio . If you have to be protected from large tech sector related shocks you have to consider gems like RSP . Plus lot of funds flows into market weighted S & P meaning , people are betting too much in first 10-12 large market cap companies"
2021-06-19 19:25:32,stocks,SWDA or IWDA depends on the exchange is a really nice one too. It’s an accumulation ETF covering worldwide markets except emerging markets
2021-06-19 19:47:21,stocks,imo probably not - you will probably want to diversify at least somewhat into bonds and/or other asset classes. Yes the S&P has done well in the past. But I would check out the theoretical benefit of a 60 percent stock/40 percent bond portfolio. That should get the max gain with the min risk. But it's more important to just get the idea of asset correlation.

2021-06-19 17:12:52,stocks,"\+1

These will give you some exposure to US mid/small cap stocks, as well an international. If you dont care about rebalancing, you could also try VT. Minor (possible) draw back of VT compared to the 3 funds parent comment references is that it only hold the larger companies i believe.

One last detail about VEA and VWO, since they are international, you will receive international dividends, which will complicate your taxes just a bit."
2021-06-19 17:39:09,stocks,"What's better, VT or VTI?"
2021-06-19 17:44:08,stocks,"Probably because I’m fairly new and didn’t know much of what people would need to see. I have a separate Roth IRA through my parents financial advisor that I’m putting $100 a month into with the focus on long-term, aggressive strategy.

2021-06-19 18:42:05,stocks,I’m in VOO for the minimal fees but I will be looking into international exposure now that many people are mentioning it!

2021-06-19 18:19:38,stocks,Laughing my ass y____ off?
2021-06-19 17:08:05,stocks,"Yes. Over the long run (a few years) it probably won't make much difference whether you invest in one ETF or several, but over the short term a less diverse portfolio may see bigger variances. Over time, they'll approach the same average. It's just that less diversity means larger variances."
2021-06-19 19:30:08,stocks,And don’t forget international exposure!
2021-06-19 17:21:03,stocks,Thanks for the extra info!
2021-06-19 17:59:19,stocks,Depends entirely if you want exposure to global markets or not. VTI only covers US markets. Personally I like VT more but that’s just a personal preference.
2021-06-19 18:02:58,stocks,"I stay away from international companies.  If we think wall street is rigfed; what manipulation could be happening in foreign stock markets.

Plus with vti, you already have international exposure by proxy.   Apple, Starbucks, Facebook, Netflix etc have international operations."

2021-06-19 17:21:25,stocks,Where would I be able to find that info?
2021-06-19 18:51:36,stocks,"For sure. It’s all just personal preferences on allocations, but I’d say if you keep 33-50% of your total portfolio value in VOO (or VT or VTI or whatever) and use that as a nice solid foundation to construct your portfolio around and use as a jumpoff point for your other positions/plays then that’s a perfectly feasible and reasonable strategy. 

Smart money is more money and it sounds like you’re on the right track, so nicely done."
2021-06-19 18:44:19,stocks,"I've currently only got the super dividend and saving up for the 2 others, small time investor here. But I'm hoping to have equal shares of each by the end of the year."
2021-06-19 18:47:01,stocks,"Kinda follows the same logic of buying broad market ETFs, just taking it a step further beyond the US. I.e, why buy one sector or stock when you can have it all? Why buy one market when you can buy all of them?

I might be wrong but VT and VTI historically don’t have that much of a difference in price or returns. You really can’t go wrong with either.

Personally, I think Africa is going to be gigantic money makers in the next few decades and I’m hoping the VT train will capture some of that. I’m also not entirely convinced that we aren’t due for a big drawback in US markets so I’m sort of hedging against it. It’s also slightly more affordable on a per share basis than other Vanguard vehicles which makes it easier to add to my pile in small increments without buying fractional shares.

I might be totally dumb on this subject which is exactly why I’m buying the whole market. It’s a nice way to set it and forget it and I trust Vanguard thoroughly. They invented ETFs and have been consistent for decades."
2021-06-19 18:46:44,stocks,vss is small cap international. vxus is international total market. vymi is international dividend focus. all are excluding the US
2021-06-19 17:21:53,stocks,Makes sense! Thank you!
2021-06-19 19:28:44,stocks,"Strictly speaking if you reinvest all your money then more diversification is better if you KNOW the average will be the same. 

If for example you had one fund that goes up 10% each year for 2 years you get 1.1x1.1 = 1.21x your initial investment (or 21% gains).

If on the other hand you a fund that goes up 20% one year and 0% the next you get 1.2x1.0 = 1.20x your initial investment (or 20% gains). 

Assuming this is actually the case (which if nobody knows is probably a fair assumption) then you get 1% more gain for a more diverse investment with the same average return. 

Over longer periods of time this effect gets larger too. The same example over 10 years would give 2.59x return for the steady 10% vs 2.49x return for the 0%/20% return, or a 7% larger profit for a lower risk strategy."
2021-06-19 18:20:36,stocks,That's what I've heard because VT is international so you get a broader range of companies
2021-06-19 19:30:22,stocks,"1. Many countries' securities markets are at least as well regulated as US markets, so your assumption may not hold water;  
2. Short term manipulation does not mean anything. Over the long term (5-10Y+), company valuations generally tend to converge to their fundamentals;  
3. Exposure to revenue from countries does not mean exposure to their companies. By that logic, I could buy just one stock (say, Microsoft or Toyota) and be exposed to every country, state, and territory, but that's obviously not the way it works."
2021-06-19 18:24:19,stocks,"I have about a quarter of my IRA in VXUS, i think it’s a good idea to have some exposure to international investments, just don’t over leverage it. Me personally I think the US is in for a huge correction at the least so I wanted some international exposure."

2021-06-19 19:24:24,stocks,"In my long term account I have VUG(vanguard growth), SCHA(schwab small cap), and BRK.B(Warren buffet the GOAT).. I try to deposit something weekly even if it's not much, the benefit of small cap and growth is many times one is down while the other is up. Whenever I deposit funds I typically buy whichever is down(never buying at the top). BRK.B can sometimes be a bit of an anomaly, which also works in favor of buying whichever I'm getting the best deal on, to be honest I don't know much about Buffetts holdings, I just know its very diversified and also includes things that are not listed on the market, and trust him. I've been considering adding something with my international exposure(most likely another vanguard ETF) but at the moment the 3 of these perform well with my strategy and until I build them up more I don't want to stretch too thin."
2021-06-19 18:23:30,stocks,"That was my thinking. Not sure why someone downvoted me above, it’s literally just a fact but whatever. I like the exposure to European markets and feel VT is a little bit of a hedge against volatility in US markets. I really don’t feel you can go wrong with any of the broad market ETFs that Vanguard offers. They invented the damn thing in the first place and have been consistent for nearly forty years. The returns aren’t flashy but they are consistent."

2021-06-19 19:59:07,stocks,"One possible reason is that I may want to be able to hold on to BRK.B for the next 20 years without needing to sell it, and in that time the make-up of  BRK.B may change significantly.  Where if I bought AAPL today, I may not like it in 5 or 10 years and sell it.  At that time of sale, I now owe tax on it and it may come at a time in which capital gains taxes are higher than normal.  BRK.B essentially allows you to choose when you are going to pay the tax on the gains.

The difference in tax may offset the expense cost just by itself."

2021-06-19 18:29:54,stocks,The biggest bullshit ever said.
2021-06-19 17:41:17,stocks,"Wouldn't DCA be risk mitigation though? 

If you invest it all now, and the stock depreciates, you lose out big time. 

If you DCA and the stock depreciates, you still lose out, but to a lesser degree because you're buying in at lower prices as it goes down. 

Of course, theres the opposite argument to losing money, like you experienced. But theres a downfall to everything. And the downfall of DCA still nets you a profit, while the downfall of one time investment (in comparison to DCA) means losing a lot more than the alternative. 

Just food for thought, I'm quite the noob, not claiming to know everything."
2021-06-19 19:01:22,stocks,DCA is not timing the market.
2021-06-19 18:02:40,stocks,It’s $2.3M with annual DCA vs $1.1M for Worst Timing Bob. What do you mean it doesn’t matter much? It’s more than double
2021-06-19 16:29:08,stocks,what crash?
2021-06-19 18:11:04,stocks,Ignore this comment
2021-06-19 19:47:05,stocks,"The short answer is, yes- it is less risky, but potentially far less rewarding.  The market goes up more often than it goes down, so you are more likely to miss out on gains than you are to dodge losses.  When you DCA, you are placing small bets that the equity will go down in the short term against your bigger bet that the equity will eventually go up.  These bets are attempting to time the market. 

I’m looking at this question from a long hold, total stock index fund perspective.  If you invest it all now, and the stock(s) depreciate, then you will still have a lot of money in 20 years, not lose out big time.  If you DCA and the stocks continue to appreciate you miss out on possibly a small percentage of gains…but if you play with a compound interest calculator you will see how much these missed gains change your end amount at 10, 20, 30, 40 years."
2021-06-19 16:42:39,stocks,The one that's about to happen
2021-06-19 16:59:19,stocks,how can you be so certain about that?
2021-06-19 17:45:01,stocks,"Nobody can be sure about anything. 

But the new of sooner than expected rate hikes might rattle a lot of people, plus inflation fears, plus the rapid expansion of the market as a whole. 

Lots of people think there's a market wide bubble, and there will be a recession coming soon. 

Others think it's perfectly fine.

All I know is that I've budgeted x amount to invest monthly, and I will continue to do it as I'm investing long term, and don't care if there is an extended recession. Over an extended period, any buys right now should still net a profit, and a recession just means buying at a discount. 

(It also means a lot of other bad things, but you know what I mean)"

2021-06-19 15:45:59,stocks,"With rampant inflation, I doubt it will reach 400. Inflation saps the demand. Just Powell declaring that it is transitory means nothing. I think you should first make your own judgment call on inflation. If you think it is transitory, LULU  will likely achieve 400. I am on the opposite camp. I think inflation is actually very high and will kill the demand. Anyway, best of luck to you"

2021-06-19 16:20:19,stocks,Do keep in mind if you are going to hold TQQQ for a long period of time you are going to have decay over that time. If you don't know what that is I'd highly recommend looking into it but essentially you are effectively losing money if TQQQ trades sideways.

2021-06-19 14:33:34,stocks,"It depends how much ""recession proof"" you want and why the recession started. Cyclicals like oil and some value stocks like banks are highly sensitive to economic factors in a recession like unemployment and lower economic activity, they will get hit the hardest. Technology has actually shown to be quite resilient because they are less affected by unemployment, but not if a recession is caused by inflationary pressures. Health care and especially utilities are essential services, so they go down less in a recession, but they can still go down because of liquidity issues and general de-risking. A ""food fund"", if you mean consumer stables like grocery stores are similar to utilities. The best overall recession proof funds would be bond funds because the government will lower rates during recessions which will increase the value of bonds. Of course, the more recession-proof something is, the lower your potential returns."
2021-06-19 12:29:48,stocks,"I’d suggest also looking into some inverse ETF’s such as SQQQ, SDS, SH and PSQ."
2021-06-19 14:25:16,stocks,"Depends on the nature of the recession. Inflationary recession probably commodities, gold, companies that borrowed heavily now/in the past to fund future growth (Verizon and ATT come to mind) In a deflationary recession I would shoot for companies with strong dividends that they can cover comfortably. Low debt, valuations, and products that people need are important. 

I have tried to balance my portfolio against both. Lots of foreign utilities at low multiples, Russian commodities producers, telecom's, grocery stores, and a big position in google. 

Hope this helps"

Regardless of economy, Amazon will still shit out an owl beak, a blender, and an industrial sized box of gummi bears onto your doorstep in 48 hours. Tesla and whatever other Musk companies will still keep Musk'ing. Blackberry will still have government contracts and own the EV chip market. Intel and HP will still sell just as many PC's because you honestly just cant not have a PC in the US these days. Apple will still sell overpriced phones and mac's and fanboys will still pay a months wages or more to get them. CDK is almost purely industrial so they're not going anywhere.   


I could go on about our tech reliance but you get the point. Society as a whole is just so reliant on tech now that I just have a hard time thinking of how many of them would see a major hit from a recession.

I also recommend a few books like The Little Book of Common Sense Investing from John C. Bogle. Also you should sign up to Fidelity its the best of the bunch. Don't buy in all at once wait for a nice correction of 8%-10% and buy in 4 or 5 blocks over the course  of a few days or weeks until you build your postions. Good Luck and Happy Investing 🙂

Use these forms as your primary source of information about how the company makes its money, who its customers are, and its discussion about the direction of the business. 

When reading its discussion about the direction of the business, this is where you have to do your own research and compare with outside sources. 

One company I'm researching is Methanex (MEOH). I'm reading the published forms to learn about the company, I'm using macrotrends dot net as a consolidated resource for a history of its financials, and I'm using the greater internet at large to understand the methanol market and where it's headed.

The hard numbers are available for the public. I'd be more interested in asking questions about leadership and how the company is solving hard problems. So if you have insight into the industry and you know the business well (you should be investing in what you know) then you should be able to ask really good questions. For example, perhaps the industry as a whole is shrinking. Ask the leadership what they're doing to pivot into other revenue. Or maybe there's a new technology that you think should be adopted etc."

Before open on thursday.

Is there any reason I shouldn't absolutely unload my entire lifes worth on a short position this week? I can only open on the LSE under CCL.L

I literally cannot see a single thing coming out of earnings that will make the stock go up. Even if CCL declare ships will be running by the end of the year (they won't), I refuse to believe that this will offset the incoming financial numbers.

Their ships aint moved for 18 months. They've made zero cash. At least airlines (to some extent) have been able to move a little bit for business or freight, but ships are literaly a holiday play. It's also easier to get a plane up and running with 10 crew for a 6 hour flight, compared to a ship that needs 1000 crew and a 6 month journey to multiple countries that still don't want people coming.

I mean, they currently have debt of...

# 31 Billion Dollars

And they only have cash on hand of 11 billion. Granted they have assets, but it's not like they're going to start selling ships to clear the debt.

It will take them YEARS to get back to being a company that can make any money at all.

The stock is down 50% since covid hit, although over the last 6 months, has climbed steadily from 13 to 28$. I think people are ""buying the dip"" but i'd argue the dip will last years.

Am I missing something here?"

If you are going to gamble don’t pick one where the odds are against you. If I had to place a long or short bet on CCL (and I’m happy I don’t) I would go long on the chance they report something positive. Better odds (simply because most stocks go up after earnings) and bigger upside."

You aren't special in having these thoughts, and absolutely awful earnings are already priced-in for Carnival. If anything - if they do ever so slightly better than the wreck that is expected they could actually go UP.

My advice to you; don't play earnings. It's incredibly difficult to consistently make money in the long run. Expectation is priced in."
2021-06-19 10:01:36,stocks,"The stock market is always forward looking.  Anything you know everyone else knows and is already priced in.  When stocks move on earnings it is not because of how much money they make or they lost, it is on how different that number is from expectations.  No one is expecting Carnival to have good earnings.  If they have more good news about future bookings which have been strong for all cruise lines (I don't know specifically about Carnival) as well as good news about more ships than expected starting up the stock could actually rise.  On the other hand the only way it is going to go down is if future bookings are lower than expected and they announce further delays (which are possible as RCL just had to delay a ship due to crew covid cases).  I just don't see any large movement down but it may dip a little.  I would stay away but definitely would not be short and not heavily short into earnings.

Having said all that, full disclosure I am still long on RCL and am expecting a potential 15-25% increase in the short term.  I do like to cruise and am a member of a couple of cruising and travel related message boards and let me tell you those people are insane and have been chomping at the bit to get back to cruising.  Cruise prices have been going up and travel agents are warning people that they are going to keep going up at least through 2022 as demand is heavily outstripping supply.  That said I do not expect prices to remain so high once all the ships are back and full (as right now they are still selling assuming limited capacity).

All of your arguments are for a long term short positions not for a short position into earnings (which is more likely to be a short term positive rather than negative).  If you still believe that it is doomed then I think you should wait until after earnings and see if it jumps then go short."
2021-06-19 15:56:16,stocks,"Why in the world would you short this stock NOW? At precisely the moment cruises are poised to resume from U.S. ports and they're about to start seeing massive cash inflows? They've trimmed down their fleet by 20 ships (the oldest, least efficient tonnage) and if you had paid attention to their earnings reports you would know that their bookings are outpacing historicals with ZERO marketing. They have a loyalty database of 40 million repeat cruisers. And don't forget that they are well diversified geographically, with regional banners across Europe and Asia.

People want to cruise. People will cruise. They're itching to get back out there, the same way we've seen the rest of the consumer discretionary economy boom since the country has reopened. Carnival will make money and pay down its debt. They're not going anywhere."
2021-06-19 13:44:25,stocks,">Am I missing something here?

Yeah, the $31bn in debt that CCL recently refi'd isn't due until 2027, which is plenty of time for the cruise industry's fundamentals to improve.

2021-06-19 11:15:09,stocks,Here’s a good piece of advice for the next couple years: avoid all airlines and cruises because they are (mostly) debt filled garbage. If you really want a reopening play with cruises as a side bonus then buy Disney.
2021-06-19 14:03:47,stocks,"I pretty much agree with the sentiments of the OP and I'm staying away.

It isn't that I don't think investing in a dip on a cruise line is a bad idea and they can't survive this, it is that the price currently is way too high to take the risk that involves. I'd take on the risk at a lower price, but enough people are willing to take the risk at a higher price.

The upside potential for the level of risk involved isn't that great. I'll invest in stocks that have less upside potential but comparatively tiny bits of risk. 

&#x200B;

However, in defense of the cruise lines, I would spot out that in normal times they are -highly- cyclical.  These are firms designed to weather storms, pun intended, but they are firms designed to make well above typical profits in good years.. They have the infrastructure in place to make a good deal of money quickly and there is a great amount of built-up demand not being met and the macro economy is well-primed for a surge in spending on excess items, like a cruise vacation.

I would expect 2 things: 1) When they are at full operations, they will be able to remake lost ground and pay off some of their debts relatively quickly and 2) getting partial operations running without having to sell as many tickets at a discount will allow them to stop the cash bleed lowering their short-term risk. It is this second part that is appealing. They could probably keep ticket prices elevated operating at 50% capacity and stop their financial bleed and maintain their high-value in assets.

&#x200B;

The political situation isn't good for them either. Even when they get back up and running, they depend on on older clients with expendable income in retirement savings, especially in off seasons (3/4 of the year). DeSantis is playing games to protect the anti-vaxers from decisions of private companies... well just for the sake of doing it.  The problem for the cruise lines is that would be a huge selling point for over 3/4 of their customer base. People knowing that everyone onboard is vaccinated would probably be a profitable selling point and they can't achieve that. Cruise lines also tend to be a bad-press magnet, because of how self-contained they are. A few covid cases on a cruise get noticed, but the tens of of thousands (or more) occurring at Wal-Mart go relatively unreported.

The reason this is important is Florida has 28 docks for cruise ships and most of them are cruise dedicated year-round and have billions in specialty infrastructure built to accommodate cruise ships. The rest of the East and Gulf Coasts only has 15 docks for cruise ships. Some of these are only seasonal and some only have minimal terminal investments. Cruises also endure larger sailing costs from non-Florida locations. The ship has to go to a foreign port due to the Jones Act. Only Florida allows a ship to burn less fuel and sail a short distance to the Bahamas, so the rest of the East/Gulf coast is more expensive to sail out of.

It has been really odd how a Republican is defiantly not helping out such a large in-state industry. He's allowed a minimal short-term political gain among a support base to outweigh being business friendly to a large in-state industry clearly in economic duress.

On the west coast, Canada not allowing sailings is a problem. The cruise lines have been granted a reprieve from the Jones Act for Alaskan cruises, but they are losing a great deal of existing terminals to access in Victoria and Vancouver.

&#x200B;

One last issue is RCCL is a better buy over CCL, but it is even more over-bought, given my perception of the risk. I think the market reflected this in their stronger price recovery. CCL was long known to buy their ships out-right and have no to low borrowing costs, but they also cut many corners and have the cheapest ships. Over the last 10 years they had too many problems pop-up that were related to the under-investment and it really hurt them. RCCL would borrow more, making them more leveraged, but their ships are in good condition and they did more to retrofit and new build in a better sales environment for on-ship purchases. They have better pay restaurants, better shops, and their cruise clients typically have more expendable income."

Clearly, it doesn’t make sense. A 47% growth is monumental in my opinion but somehow the market disagreed. These things more often than not doesn’t make any sense and one should stay away from these tactics. 

I generate a decent amount of income by selling weekly covered calls on blue chip stocks but I will always avoid these things during their earnings week."

Everybody already knows they aren't making money right now, so it would be really hard for their earnings to be so much worse than expected that the market reacts in a big way.  Your opinion on Carnival isn't very unique, so chances are all that doom and gloom is already priced in.  In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if the stock goes up after earnings. Nobody is expecting anything good, so a bad but slightly better than expected report will be a much bigger surprise to the market than a slightly worse than expected report.  Honestly I think pretty much everybody would do well to just stay away from most cruise and airline stocks right now, but if you must mess around with them remember that public knowledge is always priced in, and that the value of companies that are actively burning cash can often end up totally detached from reality."

If stock market behaves logically and everyone has perfect knowledge what is coming, the price would not move."
2021-06-19 10:07:01,stocks,Just a second note about the danger of comparing cruise lines to airlines and even hotels.  Cruises are completely made up of tourists and people on vacation which seem to want to come back and are willing to book vacations way into the future.  Hotels and especially airlines are much more dependent on business travelers that mainly travel last minute and pay huge premiums.  The business travel market is not likely to ever fully recover as companies realized what they can do remotely and how much money they were saving by doing so while I think the vacation market will eventually fully recover.  I just point this out because you made the comparison and it is not fair to expect both to recover at the same rate.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Would Chinese VIE companies ever pay out dividends? I was looking for Chinese stocks that would pay decent dividends (at least 2-3%), however, I cannot find any?
I am wondering if the VIE structure has anything to do with that. If we buy BABA, NIO, TCEHY or whatever else, we don’t get any actual ownership. 

AFAIK VIE works like the following. Chinese laws forbid foreigners from owning Chinese stocks. So the Chinese stock you buy actually only grants you a stake in some Cayman Islands-registered entity. These entities are under contracts to receive some profits from the Chinese assets but not to actually own them. This is how BABA, NIO, XPEV or whatever else Chinese works like. Besides, VIE technically is illegal but China has been silent on that.(more on the VIE structure https://globescancapital.com/chinese-vie-structure-wall-street-continues-to-ignore-the-risks/)

Aside from all the political risks, I am wondering - if a Chinese company no longer needs to raise capital in the West, why would it keep the obligation to share profits with the shareholders? If the VIE structure is not enforceable, the shareholders of the Cayman Island companies (again: BABA, XPEV, NIO) could end up with empty bags while the profits would go to CEO/board/Chinese shareholders.

Also given that shareholders are not entitled to any ACTUAL entity in the Chinese company, the board/CEO can decide to simply transfer ownership of the company’s assets to somewhere else thus leaving shareholders emptyhanded and thus NIO, BABA and whatever else could easily go to 0 while the actual companies may thrive.

And this can harm not only retail. There was this dispute between Yahoo and Alibaba when Jack Ma transfered ownership of Alipay from the group to an entity controlled by himself and didn’t even inform other shareholders.(https://www.ft.com/content/40a66dd2-b9ec-11e0-8171-00144feabdc0)

So if the Chinese companies trading under VIE structure don’t pay out their profits (technically the sole reason for the VIE structure), it looks like they should be bought only for speculation purposes.

Are there any Chinese well established companies that share their profits and pay decent dividends to their VIE shareholders?"

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Help understand what Macro speculation drove financials parabolic It has been a while since I brushed up on macro policy, and it is a headache to keep up. 

Can anyone help me better understand what speculation pumped financials from January to now, and why yield curves are flattening with the earlier expectation of increased interest rates? From my understanding the Fed raised inflation expectations for the year which should theoretically increase nominal yields. I suppose the Fed still is targeting 2% in the following years so maybe that is irrelevant for long dated bonds. But the big shocker is that interest rates are expected to climb earlier than anticipated and then the 10Y climbs and then sells off hard.

From Investopedia,  

>""One reason the yield curve may flatten is market participants may be expecting ... the Federal Reserve to raise the federal funds rate in the near term.""

Was the inflation already priced in and now with  the Fed indicating that we're heading towards a new rate hike which is a direct measure to counteract the raise of the inflation it causes gold to drop?"
2021-06-19 01:16:11,stocks,Because the price of gold has been artificially  Controlled for decades now..

2021-06-19 07:26:30,stocks,"Because as inflation rises, so do nominal (interest rate) yields on bonds as bond investors demand to be paid more since they're getting repaid in dollars that are going to be worth less. 

The increased interest rate pulls money away from gold/inflation assets since people believe it's better to get something (on a bond) rather than nothing (gold).

What really matters is the real yield: nominal minus inflation (how much your bond repayment is worth after factoring inflation). Gold performs well when real rates are low/negative because people don't want to hold a bond that literally loses them money.

The question is, what are real rates? This is quite subjective and up for discussion. The mainstream tends to believe inflation isn't a problem, thus they believe real rates are high enough that gold isn't worth holding.

And yes, as other have pointed out, the government and big money are trying to fuq gold investors 🙃."

Don't look just at gold, look at other commodities like copper, soy, platinum, corn they have all dropped significantly. The dollar has strengthened most likely due to the fed signaling that they might be tapering earlier than anticipated. Lots of ppl were long commodities due to fears of inflation. Now it seems that inflation may not be such a big worry and there are some indications there maybe an economic slow down and everyone is having to cut their inflation trade. All commodities are priced in dollars so when it moves all commodities move."
2021-06-19 03:36:38,stocks,"Gold goes up and down based on investor interest. So it’s linked to inflation as long as investors think that they should buy gold for the upcoming inflation but that’s not always the case.

The fed sent signals that they may be tapering down on the money printing and raising interest rates early. Both are bad for the hyper inflation case and a bunch of people bailed on gold as a result."
2021-06-19 03:37:21,stocks,Because it’s not about inflation it is about the expectations of inflation and since it is on the rise people think central banks will be hawkish in the near future.

Gold is affected by inflation expectations and changes to these."
2021-06-19 01:31:38,stocks,"The case for gold as an inflation hedge isn't very strong. It's possible the hedge still exists against long periods of persistent inflation, but on a YOY and short term basis the hedge just isn't there. 

That being said, most investors and the market are positioning for inflation to be transitory. The May numbers showed only 2.5% annualized inflation since 2019 and commodities are all down, some even double digits, during the month of May. 

So the expectation in the market is that the rate of inflation trends down over the next year as the supply chain normalizes.

That is what is being priced in with Tech stocks beginning a new rally, interest rates staying low, the USD index trading within a fixed rang, commodities trending down, and industrial and bank stocks beginning to underperformed again."

2021-06-19 06:13:04,stocks,"There is never one reason for a price move, but one to consider is positioning ahead of the fed. Once it turned out slightly more hawkish than expected, some of those inflation hedges put on (eg gold - let's not talk about whether it really is an inflation hedge) were unwound - gold it sold off."
2021-06-19 07:49:34,stocks,"Because as much as people want to pretend differently, gold is not a store of value or a hedge against inflation. Nor is it a meaningful alternative to the fiat system. 

So like any investment, it goes up and down at the whims of the market. 

Worse, there’s no centralized count for how much gold is out there and it was heavily, heavily manipulated following 2008, a situation that has never changed even during the crazy decade long bull run. 

There’s nothing wrong with buying and holding gold, it certainly has some unique properties from an investment/financial strategy perspective. But don’t buy it thinking it’ll go up when the market goes down or that the gold bar in your backyard will be useful in a US societal collapse.

2021-06-19 08:59:54,stocks,"Inflation is a result of either increase in demand and/or decrease in supply. Despite what a lot of people say I don't think there is an increase in overall demand, I think the suppliers and supply chains got consolidated and/or disrupted and that's the driving factor of current inflation and the rate hike is to slow it down on the cash side. The supply and demand of gold really  hasn't changed that much. Lumber on the other hand is out of control. Unless the supply chain gets fixed or becomes more localized expect inflation to continue and real estate to skyrocket."

2021-06-19 12:42:15,stocks,I think it has more to do with the continued relative strength of the economy. Gold starts to do much better when the other investment avenues fall (or as people start to fear the same); as people retreat to tangible assets.

The US. Being smarter than you. Believes in Gold.

2021-06-19 13:05:41,stocks,Inflation is not on the rise. It’s transitory. Fed can threaten early price hikes and it psychologically makes people sell commodities so big money isn’t left holding the bag. Thus completes the circle.

No? Okay let’s go with market manipulation then, when it’s clear we are going into a deflationary environment. 

look at tlt/dxy. you think the dollar should be gaining strength from inflation worries? you think banks would be piling into bonds if they were worried about inflation? 

look at commodities, hog/corn/etc futures, gold, credit contraction, etc. try looking at the other side(deflation) instead of just assuming this is market manipulation.

i think the banks and jerome are right on the money for this one, inflation narrative will be gone soon."

2021-06-19 13:22:40,stocks,"The stock for gold and silver is extremely manipulated BUT precious metals (or really any metal or metal alloy) in its physical form will always retain some form of value.

For example there’s some potential scenarios that make holding physical gold silver ect worth it:
The unlikely: the worlds power grid fails, can’t be fixed and all access to online money such as stocks credit cards debit cards ect is now useless, and the only form of currency is physical money, such as paper money, coins, precious metals ect.

The somewhat likely to happen: same as above scenario but the internet and power grid can eventually be fixed, but for a period of a few years all access to to anything online is useless, this means people must rely on physical commodities to survive until everything is fixed.

What might actually happen: online currency and the internet of things connects everything and we ditch physical currency entirely, this will inflate the rarity of physical currency (including paper money) on the collector end of things, however there will be societal panic anytime the internet goes down for any extended period of time and they can’t figure out how to pay for goods and services.

What Also might happen: in regards to the value of USD: USD will continually be inflated to unrealistic levels that the value of USD will ultimately crash, which would make USD worthless, paper money holds little to no value anymore BUT any spare change you have or gold or silver or other precious commodity still will retain a value based on the value of what they are. For example coins: USD might be worthless but if you have a bunch of pennies the value of the metal in those pennies will still be worth something"

2021-06-19 14:36:41,stocks,The gold just hasn't been as shiny as of late
2021-06-19 14:39:19,stocks,I believe it was due to them saying they will raise the rates. Gold is good for when there is inflation or currency being devalued so they may think this signals the FED will do more to keep inflation in check. But if you look at the chart for gold going back decades it has been consistently rising in price. Plus i believe there is another crash coming and gold will go up in value again. Gold will be worth a lot more in 5-10 years if you like to invest long term. The FED can't fix the problem we have had since 2008 they just keep prolonging it because to fix it would make the politicians lose votes. There was another post and the user pointed out that yesterday a lot of stocks and indexes like BRK.A and Russell 2000 had death crosses appear which is a good signal of an upcoming bear market and/or crash when it's across multiple stocks. Death crosses popped up before all the crashes going back to the great depression. I believe China is waiting for that big crash to dump all our debt and devalue the USD to the point the world won't accept it as the standard and China will take over and their currency will be the standard. Gold will skyrocket if that happens.

It's because gold is at it's best when it acts as an alternative to bonds, specifically US treasuries.

With interest rate hikes on the horizon, inflation looking to be genuinely transitory (see the fall of commodity futures) money is moving back into treasuries, and therefore out of my yellow metal.

2021-06-19 15:34:58,stocks,"""Why is gold down with inflation on the rise"" That view in itself is why you are confused. There is another large sentiment that believes inflation is not a issue and it will sort itself out and the FED will raise rates and everything will transition smoothly (this is what the answer to your question roots from, lack of inflation fear impacts gold prices negatively) Long story short, its just the opinion that inflation won't really turn out to what we think at least what they buyers/sellers think at the moment."

2021-06-19 15:37:54,stocks,because all capital markets are affected by each other... liquidation of stocks or bonds usually results in liquidation of all assets. once national product inflation (which is the 'inflation' term most of us are accustomed to) hits you'll start to see rising prices in noble metals. side note: national product inflation is usually preceded by a market downturn which rebalances wealth.

2021-06-19 15:44:18,stocks,"Manipulation.  This is standard in the precious metals sector.  Any investor who wishes to invest in this sector needs to understand how the suppression works, and why they do it, or they have no business in this sector.  The reason for that is because the U.S. government is engaged in a scam (or conspiracy, if you will), along with the Fed and their cronies, to suppress precious metal prices in order to hide the excess money printing of the last 50+ years.  One must understand the Bretton Woods system, generally, why it came about, and what the money masters fear could come next (loss of control).  So, they manage the public's perceptions by suppressing physical precious metals, via the paper market.

If everyone who had paper tried to trade it for physical, the prices would go hyperbolic.  Just look to [Nixon's actions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nixon_shock) in 1971 when he closed the gold window (because France  and others knew we were overprinting and lying, so they took advantage and forced Nixon's hand).  Via the paper market, they can distort the public's perception.  Most people don't understand economics, even many of the few who actually study it.

The only way precious metals will ever break the suppression racket is if the racket loses control in some way.  Every investor really needs to understand this, as suppression and manipulation are simply part of the game, the way it is played under our current (fascist) system.  One can see similar suppression and manipulation with the meme stocks, as TPTB try to crush the uprising, before some of their attack dogs finally started using similar tactics themselves.  It is fascinating to learn about the depravity to which men will always sink.  It is also unsettling."

2021-06-19 16:42:43,stocks,"There’s a reason why Gold has gained more than 1,000% value since the year 2000. Gold is a non renewable material that cannot be created (like the united states dollar) It doesn’t corrode (search it up if you don’t even know what that means..) and it’s rare, it can’t be just found anywhere without some sort of time and labor being put up to find the material. Paper money can be created, Gold cannot.  There are many factors that you have to look at not just the simple ones, like demand and supply currently now demand is pretty low as now people think BTÇ is the new gold and it rivals gold as a hedge against inflation. Short term gold isn’t the perfect hedge against inflation but long term it’s the perfect one as it gains more value as the dollar value diminishes. Another factor is that there have been some problems with Gold mining companies/facilities including but limited to less workers, shortness of workers for the new years coming, mining explosions. 

before anyone gets smart Gold can be created by combining other elements but it’s costlier to do that then to find the metal.

If I were you I’d buy gold now while the demand is low and the price hasn’t gone up yet. Robert Kiyosaki has said, “Gold is God’s money”."

2021-06-19 08:26:45,stocks,"Things are worth what people are willing to pay for them. The dollar is a medium of exchange people accept the dollar because they believe it has value to buy other goods. In that respect gold is no different than dollars, but there is one big difference the government simply cannot print more gold, therefore it has a relatively stable value because it just cannot be created out of thin air like fiat money. You probably won’t create additional wealth by holding gold, however it will hold buying power relative to the dollar. The only way to really make money with gold is to put it to work by funding commercial activities. In 1920 a $20 gold piece could probably buy a very nice man suit which is exactly what it can buy today at the price of gold at $1800 an ounce. People should also think about silver, in 1964 the minimum wage was probably $1.25 if you took $1.25 silver coinage today it would be worth about $24. So we don’t really need a minimum wage of $15 what we need is a sound money system. The value of the dollar has been steadily decreasing ever since the creation of the federal reserve which has been given the authority to create fiat money out of thin air all money nowadays is actually issued as debt this system of debts created money is enslaving the American people. There are large markets now for gold and silver and I do believe they can be manipulated but if you go to your local pawnshop or coin dealer you will find that the price is considerably higher than what is offered on the exchanges. Banks and other entities can hold the value of gold down for a while but if inflation really continues on a long-term basis gold and silver will go up in value relative to the dollar, which to me means that they will simply protect your money from inflation.

2021-06-19 15:28:30,stocks,"Thank you for your response! 

My question for you (which is only tangentially related to the original topic): when we talk about how the 10yr treasury yield rose or fell on a given day, are we referring to changes to the nominal yield of the bond, or, are we talking about the current market price for those bonds in relation to their par value and coupon rate?

I am also confused about how that bond market works. Like how often are they issuing new bonds with updated coupon rates? And is there a marketplace to trade these bonds that is always open?

Sorry if these are dumb questions"

2021-06-19 14:07:03,stocks,"I bought GOLD (Barrick), Kinross (KGC) and Silver Wheaton which is now WPM (Wheaton Precious Metals) back in 2009. And I invested in First Eagle Gold Fund.  I decided to keep these stocks for the long run but I have lost in all with the exception being the First Gold Eagle Fund as I have $50 automatically taken out of my bank acct to buy more shares each month.  At this point, I'm really sick of the gold stocks.  WPM performs ok because they are diversified into silver, palladium, copper, cobalt and gold. I was finally ahead with WPM and I was going to sell just before the PM stocks took a nose dive.  I reasoned that I could take the proceeds to invest into a better performing investment.  I've resigned to having to keep GOLD for awhile but I really want to dump Kinross.  Looking at other stocks in place of Kinross.  Heck, if I sold KGC and bought more of a certain meme stock, I would have made up most of my losses in PM's.  At one time, my First Eagle fund went from an initial investment of $7K to $32K.  My mistake was not to skim off some of the profits.  I still am up in the air as to whether or not to keep the FE.  Any suggestions?  It's now around $16K.

2021-06-19 07:31:16,stocks,"Yes, I had to scroll far for a good answer.  I would just like to add that 10 year real rates are expected to go up because the Fed made some ""hawkish"" statements this week about sooner-than-expected rate hikes.  The Fed will be selling bonds in order to hit their target rates, a process which will lower bond prices and increase rates (that's the point).

Plus, the market sees this as a sign that the Fed will be acting to keep inflation under control.  So those coupon payments are more valuable now, because inflation won't be eating away at them so much, thus making bonds more attractive.  That's where the ""real"" part comes in, because real yields are higher when inflation is lower.

Gold is also used as an inflation hedge, and apart from the market preferring a safe-haven asset with a coupon, as you said, they're also less worried about inflation getting out of control."

First, Basel III is a banking regulation imposing capital, leverage, and liquidity requirements. Second, it was fully enforced at the beginning of 2019. 

The Basel I-III regulations were incremental increase in the robustness of world banks, motivated by the fragility that was exposed or actualized in the 2008 meltdown.

They consider physically-held gold to be a Tier 1 asset meaning it carries no discount to inclusion in regulatory holdings for risk of failure, which is not to say it carries no risk of losing value. Tier 1 also includes shares of common stock.

Banks have fiddled with gold since Bretton-Woods was eliminated in the 70s, but it's not really a big deal to them. Just another asset to convert cash into.

Not just that, but ""rising yields are the enemy of gold,"" to quote macro voices. People use gold as a conservative saving vehicle, just like bonds. If bonds are yielding more (due to projected future bond buying tapering and/or raised rates) then people will choose to invest there vs. non-yielding commodities like gold."

2021-06-19 11:08:58,stocks,"I used to think that hyperinflation was inevitable, but after doing more research about QE, etc. I'm leaning more towards there won't be inflation. QE traps dollars in the banking system and without lending growth and money velocity still super low, there will be less dollars on main Street which means harder to get inflation.

We're definitely seeing inflation right now, but will the economy and consumers be able to support these higher prices when the unemployment benefits roll off? In order to see persistent inflation, we need prolonged wage growth, lending growth and increase in money velocity. 

We saw some wage growth in the form of unemployment where people were making more money to sit at home. This is going to end soon. People are already neck deep in debt so we're not seeing much lending growth. Unstable job market and return of certain bills that need to be paid means people are saving more and paying off their debt more. This is what I'm understanding any way lol"

2021-06-19 13:59:06,stocks,">[Gold] involves assets that will never produce anything, but that are purchased in the buyer’s hope that someone else – who also knows that the assets will be forever unproductive – will pay more for them in the future. Tulips, of all things, briefly became a favorite of such buyers in the 17th century.

>This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future.
The major asset in this category is gold, currently a huge favorite of investors who fear almost all other assets, especially paper money (of whose value, as noted, they are right to be fearful). Gold, however, has two significant shortcomings, being neither of much use nor procreative. True, gold has some industrial and decorative utility, but the demand for these purposes is both limited and incapable of soaking up new production. Meanwhile, if you own one ounce of gold for an eternity, you will still own one ounce at its end.

>What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while.
Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”

>Today the world’s gold stock is about 170,000 metric tons. If all of this gold were melded together, it would form a cube of about 68 feet per side. (Picture it fitting comfortably within a baseball infield.) At$1,750 per ounce – gold’s price as I write this – its value would be $9.6 trillion. Call this cube pile A.

>Let’s now create a pile B costing an equal amount. For that, we could buy all U.S. cropland (400 million acres with output of about $200 billion annually), plus 16 Exxon Mobils (the world’s most profitable company, one earning more than $40 billion annually). After these purchases, we would have about $1 trillion left over for walking-around money (no sense feeling strapped after this buying binge). Can you imagine an investor with $9.6 trillion selecting pile A over pile B?

>Beyond the staggering valuation given the existing stock of gold, current prices make today’s annual production of gold command about $160 billion. Buyers – whether jewelry and industrial users, frightened individuals, or speculators – must continually absorb this additional supply to merely maintain an equilibrium at present prices.

>A century from now the 400 million acres of farmland will have produced staggering amounts of corn, wheat, cotton, and other crops – and will continue to produce that valuable bounty, whatever the currency may be. Exxon Mobil will probably have delivered trillions of dollars in dividends to its owners and will also hold assets worth many more trillions (and, remember, you get 16 Exxons). The 170,000 tons of gold will be unchanged in size and still incapable of producing anything. You can fondle the cube, but it will not respond.

>Admittedly, when people a century from now are fearful, it’s likely many will still rush to gold. I’m confident, however, that the $9.6 trillion current valuation of pile A will compound over the century at a rate far inferior to that achieved by pile B.

Gold in a way is similar to online currencies and diamonds.  It has value, but its value is reliant on how much the next person who is willing to buy it from you values it and so on.

2021-06-19 07:20:06,stocks,"The utility of gold is Money. Money is a technology not dissimilar from the technology of food canning or writing.

The technology allows you to store the energy produced by your labor today and preserve it over time and space in such a way that your energy value can be exchanged (or passed down) in the future without deteriorating.

Gold has served that utility perfectly for thousands of years.

Gold does not rust even if it has been under the ocean for hundreds of years. It can be heated and burned and maintain its chemical compounds. 

The same Gold the Pharos used in ancient Egypt is as good today as it was then.

Therefore any labor energy stored in gold has preserved its energy value over time and space -- even across the span of thousands of years.

Just like how the technology of food canning allowed you to preserve today's fruit for up to 5 years or more. Or how writing allows you to record today's knowledge, thoughts, or experiences and transfer it over time and space.

So to say it has no utility is insane.

Furthermore, it does not need to derive its value from anything. Unlike stocks that must derive their value from businesses or Bonds / fiat which much derive their value from Governments and economies.

Gold derives its value simply from being a Good Money that preserves Labor Energy.

And all those businesses and those Governments and those economies have risen and fallen and passed away into the sands of time.

But the gold has lasted through it all without fail.

It seems people have forgotten what the point of money is because we have been forced to use a defective money technology for so long (fiat) that has a built-in self-destruct mechanism to incentive spending rather than thinking long term (the benefits of which only serve Governments who want to ignore the laws of nature and manufacture their own personal Philospher's Stone....although this has a 100% rate of failure historically)."

Look at section 2 of the Maastricht Treaty, which at the time (1992) were apparently gospel “EU nations must not exceed a debt/GDP ratio of 60% at the end of fiscal years”

Meanwhile you have high level EU officials like Mario Draghi calling for outrageously elevated public debt levels to be a “normal feature” of EU member states.

Look at the numbers:

Germany: 71.2%
France: 96%
Italy: 132.7% 
Greece: 177%

2021-06-19 14:15:54,stocks,"Probably should clear this up, because I think this is where the confusion comes from when discussing transitory inflation.

Nobody is suggesting prices return to previous levels. That'd actually be a deflationary effect and something completely different. 

The price of all things will generally trend upward over long periods of time, as inflation is relatively persistent, even in low amounts like 2%.

So there is no such thing as a normal price level, because that level is always rising.

When people say transitory inflation, they mean the ""rate"" of inflation is transitory. 

And that is largely what matters, is not inflation, but the rate of inflation. 

So when ever you hear discussion about inflation know that they are discussing the rate, because the rate is all the really matters. 

This is because the economy can always adjust to higher prices. That isn't a problem. The problem is the rate at which those prices rise effect the economies ability to adjust appropriately and within a reasonable amount of time. 

So the default conversation is always about the rate of inflation.

So there aren't any claims that prices go back to 2019 levels (just erase 2020 pricing data as it skews a lot of this). They suggest that from here, the rate at which prices in general rise will continue to go down and eventually platue around a lower number."

Ask yourself if you think any time in your life, do you believe we will have that need again. Or will we always have a better medium for trade.

2021-06-19 14:01:20,stocks,"> This type of investment requires an expanding pool of buyers, who, in turn, are enticed because they believe the buying pool will expand still further. Owners are not inspired by what the asset itself can produce – it will remain lifeless forever – but rather by the belief that others will desire it even more avidly in the future. 

>What motivates most gold purchasers is their belief that the ranks of the fearful will grow. During the past decade that belief has proved correct. Beyond that, the rising price has on its own generated additional buying enthusiasm, attracting purchasers who see the rise as validating an investment thesis. As “bandwagon” investors join any party, they create their own truth – for a while. Over the past 15 years, both Internet stocks and houses have demonstrated the extraordinary excesses that can be created by combining an initially sensible thesis with well-publicized rising prices. In these bubbles, an army of originally skeptical investors succumbed to the “proof” delivered by the market, and the pool of buyers – for a time – expanded sufficiently to keep the bandwagon rolling. But bubbles blown large enough inevitably pop. And then the old proverb is confirmed once again: “What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.”"

The entire supply of mined gold on earth would fit inside a cube 22m on a side, around 200k tons. Someone tugging back a few hundred tons for the cost of propellant could certainly throw off the market value. Right now they are preparing to send out a probe in 2022 to visit a metallic asteroid that they think might be the core of a dead planet (though some think it may be just a gravel pile), 16 Psyche. Gold, being so dense, would tend to accumulate and concentrate in the molten core of a planet. There is a theory in fact that most of the gold we have mined arrived here by asteroids, as most that was present at the formation of the earth would have already sunk into the molten center. So anyway, it's a bit further out there but in my mind there is a very real chance that the supply side of this equation could get flooded.

I would mention the digital version of gold, but this sub will automatically delete my comment.

However, just as dollars were an easier way to travel with and transact with gold -- today there is Tokenized gold such as PaxG -- fully allocated gold held in vaults that you 100% own and can send the value of anywhere.

You can also earn interest on it using tools like Block fi, or exchange it for physical bullion through sites like Alpha Bullion.

>Gold has the same value as shells did to indigenous peoples. 

No it doesn't. Shells are easy to find and procure -- gold is not. Shells break and crumble easily -- gold does not.

Various isolated cultures had different money technology that -- in their region -- was rare until they began trading with the rest of the world and their currencies were inflated out of existence.

For example -- glass beads in African regions. They were hard to make for Africans, but the British could easily manufacture them and so flooded Africa with beads, transferring wealth to themselves via inflation.

Or with Yap Stones in Micronesia -- hard to procure for the indigenous people, until explorers came with dynamite came and excavated the limestone easily, thus destroying the currency and inflating away wealth.

Or salt (from which the word ""salary"" comes from) which was vital for preserving food over long periods of time, thus making the salt itself a value wealth preserver.

Until....people could easily get more salt as technology changed.

All that ended up being left on the global stage was Gold.

So it was never ""as valuable as shells.""

>All it takes is enough people not caring about it for a period of time and its value as a store of weslth goes away.

Perhaps, but Good Money has basic laws and characteristics. For example, it cannot be easy to produce (it must be Hard Money).

A money that can be created at-will and in as much quantity as desired has no value (unless someone with power is forcing you to use it).

When currencies backd by nothing fail as they always inevitably do, then there are only so many options in the world you have left.

One is gold, one is silver, and the other is that which shall not be named (in this sub).

>When the gold standard ended so did the inherent demand for gold.

The opposite is true. When the Gold standard was ended by declaration (as it has been done several times before in history -- such as over the course of 600 years and 5 dynasties in China who printed each currency to zero, which each currency lasting about 120 years or so) gold was a felony to own in the United States.

You could go to jail for having it.

After gold stopped being a felony to own -- there were lines outside gold shops all over the US.

However, the Government has done a fine job of educating away people's understanding of gold and what Good Money is over the last few decades.

Barely anybody has an elementary understanding of basic finance, nonetheless monetary history."

You cannot argue that the transaction value of PaxG is remotely close to that of the dollar, because you cannot directly trade it for goods or services. Additionally, grantor ETFs for gold have existed since the '90s, and gold notes existed long before that. Very few people use them as a means of storing wealth because they are bad at it. Volatile, poorly denominated, and resulting in counterparty concerns. 

If you want exposure to a diversifying asset I am not opposed to the concept of holding gold, contracts on gold, gold ETNs, gold ETFs, etc. but you just have to look at how people use these assets to seen that their transaction value is minimal.

In addition to the missing words that would have made your gibber a sentence, it didn't even mention electricity. If it had it would have made it even more obvious that you don't know what you're talking about.

Gold does not have zero electrical resistance. Electricity passing through gold generates heat. Gold can not turn heat into electrical current, so it is not a lossless conductor.

Further, gold has *higher* electrical resistivity than copper, which has higher electrical resistivity than silver.

The reason gold is used in electrical contacts is that it is malleable. Since it is soft it tends to deform and make a larger contact patch between the mating surfaces. That lowers the resistance of the contact by more than the use of gold increases it. The gold is almost always thinly plated onto a bulk material like aluminum, copper, zinc, tin, nickel, steel, or another alloy.

It also has a lower thermal conductivity than copper, which again is less than silver's. 

All materials that are heated will give up their heat unless their entropy changes, and many of those entropy changes are reversible to release the same amount of heat. You can google that.

>Additionally, grantor ETFs for gold have existed since the '90s, and gold notes existed long before that. Very few people use them as a means of storing wealth because they are bad at it. Volatile, poorly denominated, and resulting in counterparty concerns. 

I'm not sure what you're referring to. ""Gold Notes"" is simply what paper currency has always been. A simple, easier ""foldable"" way to transfer and exchange the value of Gold.

So anybody who had dollars for example and put it I  a tin can was preserving their wealth in Gold until 1972.

And if you had kept your wealth in gold (rather than dollars) since 1972 you'd be well off.

>If you want exposure to a diversifying asset I am not opposed to the concept of holding gold, contracts on gold, gold ETNs, gold ETFs, etc. but you just have to look at how people use these assets to seen that their transaction value is minimal.

People do not want to transact with gold right now because it actually has value, unlike dollars.

It's a classic example of bad money chasing out good.

People would rather transact on the short term with their bad money and store their wealth in the long term by hoarding good money.

Why exchange my gold for anything right now when my gold will only increase in purchasing power over time relative to anything else?

>In other words no ideas from the last 150 years

Are you referring to Keneysian economics? That's nothing new. Every Government throughout history has had a Keynes-like figure whisper into their ear that they could create wealth out of thin air and nothing would go wrong so long as they maintained a delicate balancing act.

And all those Governments failed at printing themselves to prosperity and their currencies collapsed.

>I look forward to the day we get to space mining, and dropping palettes of gold from orbit, creating infinite value, because gold has intrinsic value

If gold had no ""intrinsic value"" people wouldn't spend the insane amounts of money to mine it from asteroids.

Although I don't believe there is any such thing as intrinsic value.

There's also the simple argument that if gold became that plentiful, another store of value with Good Money characteristics would take its place (probably a digital alternative) jusr as gold replaced all other forms of wealth preservation as technology made ir easier to extract (like salt for example)."

Yes, they'll likely hit support, and as we discussed early there is no normal price level since prices always trend upward. But from that support level prices will go up at a more normal, lower, rate than we have been seeing. 

That would make inflation transitory and make for a normalization of economic activity and no need for Fed intervention.

If you think of everything that had to occur in order for prices to go up at the rate they did, not least of all a global pandemic, it'd be an awfully bold prediction to assume that happens again anytime soon.

While I have a decent enough understanding of what I'm doing to ensure that I am generally in the green on my portfolio so I'm content with that, but I always am trying to learn more and really make my investments for the long term gains rather than short term quick profits.  I have a rather demanding job at times and so I'm a lot more interested in set it and forget it type investments than constant monitoring.  

So this gets me to the meat of my question:  I have read multiple posts and comments across Reddit recommending VOO, VTI, and the like.  I understand that both of those are ETF's that track the S&P500 and total market respectfully.  They each have a cost basis to them of 0.03% which makes sense.  VTSAX is also recommended for folks who have a little more money in the game because it has a buy-in minimum of $2500 right now with a cost basis 0f 0.03%.  I use Fidelity as my brokerage and I was researching these funds and noticed one offered Fidelity called FXIAX that acts pretty much identical to VTSAX and VOO but has a $0 buy-in with a cost basis of 0.015% which seems a lot more desirable to me as it meets all the things I'm looking for and is about 50% cheaper than the vanguard options.

Thanks for the input!"
2021-06-19 00:10:33,stocks,Gotcha.  That makes sense about Vanguard and their tax method.  That's definitely something I'm thinking about heavily because I want to maximize my overall gain for the amount of taxes I end up paying.  I'll definitely do some deeper research into the tax methods that each company is using to build a better plan for my portfolio.
2021-06-19 00:15:25,stocks,"Ah, that makes sense.  I was doing my research and saw the 0 fee and cheaper cost basis and was really intrigued with the fund. 

Can you explain how a mutual fund is a little less valuable in a taxable account? Is that due to the tax methods being used on the dividends and gains or is there another aspect that I am overlooking?  

My general plan right now is to build up my investments in FXIAX over time while still maintaining some deposits into my VOO asset which is currently sitting at about 25% of my overall portfolio.  I do have a decent amount invested in individual companies right now that I have confidence in for the long term to turn a decent profit, but VOO and FXIAX and similar funds/ETF's are where I'm leaning more and more heavily for future investments."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Question about selling that I could not find through google (possibly specific to a Chase basic investing account)  

I'm sorry if this is something more obvious or dumb to ask but I tried to look into it and couldn't find an answer (though I didn't call my bank yet)

I am not just here for meme stocks and I have been really enjoying my time learning and studying how this all works.

I opened an investing account through JP Morgan/Chase because they are my bank and it seemed the easiest for me to do. I bought a small amount of shares of AMC partially because I wanted to be a part of the meme stock experience and partially because I believed in their ability to bounce back later naturally.  
This week, I sold half of those stocks and more than doubled my total investment. feels good.

I am aware that I will have to pay taxes and such on the profit. I have a wedding to pay for this year and I do not believe that the stock could ever be this high a year from now. I am holding half still anyways with plans to buy more next time its reasonable to do.

Anyways, my problem is that the sell calls are both labeled ""fully executed"" and the money is present in my cash funds on the account which I could use to buy more stock BUT the money cannot be transferred or withdrawn to my checking account. it specifically shows the amount of cash I had prior to selling.

I googled around and only found that the money wouldn't show up like this if the calls weren't completed, but they appear to be. It has been several days and I have no idea when it will become available for me to withdraw so I can put it towards wedding expenses.

Sorry again if there is something obvious I am missing here. I am playing this game largely solo. I don't mind looking like a fool in the name of learning though."

2021-06-19 07:28:53,stocks,"It has been answered but just to go into more detail, this is the settlement period.

Trading has a huge benefit of being executed the moment you do it, that's at least what it looks like. In reality the settlement takes around 2 days. Usually it goes through the clearing house/intermediate, then towards a market maker. Same for the person selling. There the transaction is confirmed and the money is send to you, which in reality the clearing house receives. The broker has to pay the clearing house a usually 1-3% collateral upfront and this is now paid back. Once that happened its considered settled and you can freely use your money."

I’m a tech founder and software engineer so a lot of the stuff I pay for myself and for my company end up being areas I have knowledge of. It’d be cool if there was a tool that scanned my email or my credit card transactions and reminded me to look into Asana, Atlassian, Twilio, Cloudflare, SEMRush, SolarWinds, UpWork, Momentize, Sprout Social, etc because I use their products. Some of them like SolarWinds and Momentize wouldn’t occur to me to look into further because they’re named differently from the products I use under them."

Or maybe my wife uses Depop and it just got acquired by Etsy, so I could decide to invest in it that way.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"How long is a sector rotation supposed to last? Back in early May my growth portfolio took a huge dump (bigger dip for me than COVID) and all the news headlines and all the Reddit experts were claiming that there was a rotation from growth stocks into value stocks and commodities. I got the impression that this was supposed to be a long term thing. Luckily I didn’t move any of my positions and I’ve fully recovered. Seems like the value and commodity stocks have dumped again.

Are sector rotations supposed to happen that quickly?"
2021-06-18 22:06:24,stocks,"Honestly, you only really know in hindsight. 

Try to buy undervalued companies. Period. 

Predicting entire segment movements seems more difficult than judging a singular company's financials. 

Just a prediction: I think people on Reddit are over emphasising the discount on growth stocks due decreased inflation earnings and underestimating the asset comparison to bonds vs stocks due to higher rates. In my opinion, 95% of the reason inflation is bad for equities is because of rates, not inflation itself."
2021-06-18 22:47:14,stocks,"Depends. Feds money printer has been going full steam since 2009. During that period you could invest in practically anything and think you was Gods gift to investing.

Markets are frantic now. They ride the tip of the tongue of Jerome Powell. Initially, no one believed a word he said about a crash not likely to happen. Now it appears market sentiment is to play it cool and follow everything that Powell says.

Market hasn't made much sense this year. For now, I believe commodities, etc will sale off and rotate back to Tech for the next couple of months.

In other words, the Federal Reserve has to play this out to perfection in order to avoid hyper inflation. Until we know for sure we are all shooting arrows into the air."
2021-06-18 23:50:34,stocks,"Nobody knows, i suspect the rotation to value was a narrative pushed by certain big players who bought it dirt cheap during the pandemic, and they dumped it when retail piled in.

I'm glad i ignored it and bought growth tech as it was dropping."
2021-06-19 12:19:17,stocks,"Honestly I think there are no real factors to trading on the market. When the 10-year bond yield was fluctuation up and down, market only cared when it went up and tech got hurt, but not when down. Now the yield went down, and it affects tech to go up? Sounds like market manipulation where they pick and choose to release articles on their narratives. It’s all still a coin flip, tech can still take a shit tomorrow or 5 months from now and you’ll see articles supporting why it makes sense. 

Personally, I think the fed news was the same news we’ve been hearing and thought tech would stay stagnant or sell off. The fact that tech has risen based on interest rates makes sense, but also doesn’t. I think tech will go down a little next week as the market gets dragged by fed meetings and scare."

Even if we get a crash, everyone will be buying growth again because they just dominate earnings."
2021-06-19 14:12:38,stocks,"People on Reddit seem to believe that the reason inflation is bad is because it means that future earnings are less valuable. (money is worth less, therefore $1 of profit in a year isn't as valuable as originally projected). 

This is partly true. However, inflation is a measure of price levels. If inflation increases it means companies can increase prices faster than projected too. So the companies COGS and sell prices increase balancing each other out somewhat (still a net negative but not as bad as people on Reddit seem to think). If we have inflation, and sales prices on the individual company don't increase, it means their products relative to other countries will also seem cheaper, increasing demand. This is why a weak dollar is good for exports and bad for imports.

I believe that Reddit puts far too much emphasis on this theory of discounted future earnings due  to inflation.
 
My belief: the real reason inflation is bad for the stock market is because inflation signals to the Fed that they need to increase rates. When the fed makes bonds more attractive, it makes all other investments look less attractive in comparison. This is a rule of finance: “all investment assets compete against each other.” This is the reason already issued bonds decrease in value when newly issued bonds have higher rates. It's not that the 30 year bonds yield less (that's fixed), it's that they trade against each other at different premiums. The same is true for stocks. If the near zero-risk bond now yields more, than an equity looks less attractive in comparison. If bonds are at zero, people are will to invest in stocks even if the yield is only 4% annually (risk-adjusted, 4% is better than nothing). 

My theory is that 95% percent of the reason inflation is bad for the market is because of the latter reason. Not that there isn't any truth to the first theory, just that Reddit is putting far too much weight on it as the sole reason."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Non-speculative stocks I've been a passive investor since I graduated from college (ETFs, etc) and have gotten into stock options recently.  Meme stocks aside, can we share some recommendations for the best companies within your field of interest?  I don't want potential good buys, I want to know which companies in your field are the best of the best.  I think there is a huge crash coming and I want to know which companies/products are going to survive and rebound the fastest.

On my end, I'm a veterinarian and I would vouch for Zoetis.  Zoetis is an offshoot from Pfizer, basically doing the animal side of medicine from the best pharmaceutical company.  They're going to come out with injectable pain medication for both canine and feline arthritis, with FDA approval pending in late 2021 or early 2022.  I'm also a fan of figs scrubs, which just went public.  They're high-quality scrubs (which need frequent replacement) and they are also expanding into workout options.

Can you guys contribute your own recommendations outside of the big tech companies?  Thanks so much!"

I've talked to employees of both companies and they share my views.

2021-06-19 09:56:53,stocks,"CTXR is my favorite by far. They're about to have the only product to treat infected catheters. As hospitals are penalized for 'preventable' infections, this is huge. Hospitals will be lining up to buy their product. They also have the capital to get them through production. The FDA is likely going to end their P3 trial early, as the efficacy is already proven. Oh, and to top it all off they ended their P2 trial early by superiority."

If you take their most recent quarter of revenue (87m), project it forward for the upcoming year (348m) then double that (696m) then they're trading at about 8x sales. Or, 16x if you are less optimistic, and don't think they can double again this year and just run most recent revenue forward.

SGC, a competitor in making medical uniforms, trades at 0.5x sales. Nike trades at 5x sales. 

On the other hand, their clothes look super comfortable and I just ordered some jogging pants from them. I'm not sure they're a $6B valued company though."

2021-06-19 18:43:55,stocks,"Your comment doesn't really make sense. For one, there are numerous treatments for CLABSIs (central line associated blood stream infections). Also, it sounds like Mino-Lok is utilized to treat already established CLABSIs. They have no utility in preventing them, as it is utilized only after the diagnosis is made, which means hospitals would still get penalized. Their main utility is that it theoretically allows us to continue to use a central line that has developed bacterial colonization. The problem with this is in hospital settings, when a patient develops a suspected CLABSI, we typically make the diagnosis by removing the catheter and test it for evidence of bacterial colonization. Also, we typically remove it regardless, as a potential source. It's really not a big deal to replace these catheters. 

So honestly, I really don't see the Mino-Lok changing the way we deal with CLABSIs, and it certainly won't help hospitals reduce CLABSI rates."

Antech is the big competitor for idexx and we use them more, tbh."
2021-06-19 18:48:29,stocks,"Right, it doesn't prevent infections but it does salvage the catheter. And with catheter replacements having a complication rate of 15-20%, I would argue that Mino-Lok is certainly a worthy product.

And since I imagine you're in the field, are hospitals penalized for the infection as soon as it forms, or according to the time the infection is present?"
2021-06-18 20:36:12,stocks,I sent a dm
2021-06-18 20:38:27,stocks,Are they publicly traded?
2021-06-18 20:35:41,stocks,Realllyyyyy?
2021-06-19 18:59:56,stocks,"Catheter replacement has nowhere near 15-20% complication rates and is likely data from central line placement prior to the utilization of ultrasound guided catheter placement techniques. More recent literature places the complication rate at around 5%, and even that is a bit high, although in most studies the large majority (somewhere around 80%) of those complications are ""failure to place"" (which is misleading, as most of these cases just lead to the CVC being placed elsewhere). So really, concerning complication rate is somewhere around 1% which is much more in line with my experience. True CVC placement complications are rare. I've performed hundreds, and have seen thousands performed. 

If Mino-Lok was able to prevent CLABSIs, I'd be all ears, but having to replace a CVC is not a big deal, and likely most physicians would opt with removing the source of infection rather than potentially leaving the source in and risking significant liability if the patient has a bad outcome."
2021-06-19 19:14:16,stocks,"Ah, that all makes a lot of sense. Where were you when I went all in a couple weeks ago? Haha.

Thanks for the knowledge. Cheers!"
2021-06-19 19:23:06,stocks,"All this doesn’t mean you can’t make money on it. Most investors don’t have this much knowledge on how CLABSIs are treated, so there is probably money still to be made, but I would caution holding this longterm."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"OXY exit target of $48 a share based on potential free cash flow Been following OXY for awhile and am starting to think about exit targets for OXY. 

If OXY went back to it's 2019 pre-covid market cap low of $31.5 billion, it would be about $33.76 per share. That, for me is the low side of targeting an exit for an OXY position.

Of a free cash flow basis, with WTI oil at, say, $62.50 a barrel, based on their last earnings filings, I expect OXY would have about $2 billion in free cash flow after cap-ex expenses.  That gives $8 billion in free cash flow for the year if WTI oil stayed at $62.50 a barrel for 4 quarters. OXY's pre-covid and pre-Anadarko 2018-2019 price to free cash flow ratio was in the 4 to 8 range. Using a ration of 6 that would give price per share based on expected cash flow of $48. 

With WTI oil above $62.50, OXY's annual free cash flow increases (per their earning report slides) $250 million annually. So, with oil currently at $72, this is somewhat of a conservative free cash flow analysis as, if WTI oil stayed at $72, that would be a roughly $2.5 billion increase giving total free cash flow, if it stayed at that level for a year, of $10.5 billion. Which would then be a share price of $63. Note that this is somewhat of a best case scenario and, if this were to occur, OXY could essentially use that $10.5 billion to pay back debt and get back to investment grade level ratings which would likely further drive up the price. 

So, overall, taking the middle ground approach of $62.5 a barrel which, at this point, it seems is pretty achievable, the exit target would be about $48. Either way, it seems like $33.5 is sort of the absolute low side exit point, assuming oil doesn't crash again in the next 12 months. 

&#x200B;

Summary: If oil stays above $60 a barrel for a year, good chance OXY trends up to at least the $45 range. Low side range for OXY, assuming oil doesn't crash, is probably in the $35 range."
2021-06-18 23:18:20,stocks,My #1 question is: what % of production is hedged and at what price?
2021-06-19 14:26:26,stocks,"I don't think your analysis is taking into account all the M&A activity Oxy's engaged in since 2019 if you're trying to use FCF as a metric, since that would obviously change both OCF and capex forecasts in 2021.

* $60bn acquisition of APA in 04/2019 (this was probably factored in, but just in case it wasn't....)

* $1.3bn sale of their Trona inventory and acreage in Wyoming to Orion in 08/2020

* $825mm sale of their onshore Colombia assets in 10/2020

* $280mm sale of their DJ assets in 04/2021

* $500mm sale of Permian acreage to Colgate in 06/2021"
2021-06-19 18:26:49,stocks,This is dumb. OXY will never recover from the Anadarko massacre because they are getting their hydrocarbons from the most expensive places. Hess/Exxon/name it are all in South America printing billions...
2021-06-19 03:31:10,stocks,That andarko deal is a chain oxy cannot break. Check Apache. They are not so heavily indebt.
2021-06-18 22:17:55,stocks,The naysayers will only call out the debt but that can be quickly paid down with WTI prices this high. Especially if output returns in 2022. They are also not paying out a dividend currently so even more of that FCF can be used to strategically pay down debt.
2021-06-19 14:32:39,stocks,"His high WTI pricing thesis rests on the fact that Oxy's going to use all this excess FCF to (1) delever and (2) reward investors with a return of capital in the form of dividends/buybacks, which seems to be what the industry has *promised* recently......we'll see if they actually fulfill their end of the bargain (vs using that excess FCF to expand and grow production rather than delevering...)"
2021-06-18 23:23:43,stocks,"Good point. Is this a rhetorical question or do you actually know, lol"
2021-06-19 14:30:31,stocks,"My cash flow numbers were based on their last earnings and 10k which would have been after almost all of these divestitures except the 2 most recent ones, which are nominal and non-core assets, according to Oxy, anyway. Basically the cash flow is based on their current actually producing numbers and their own currrent projections for production moving forward."
2021-06-19 18:56:47,stocks,"Uh, U. S. shale's production costs are lower than all South American countries. https://knoema.com/nolsgce/cost-of-crude-oil-production-by-country-and-crude-oil-prices

And then within U. S. Shale Oxy's got the lowest production costs.

Plus the money oxy makes isn't based on what other countries produce at, it's the difference between what oxy can produce it at and sell it at. In other words, it's based on the price of WTI oil, not whether other countries have higher profit margins."
2021-06-19 14:13:20,stocks,"Well, the bet here is that if Oxy can overcome their debt, their valuation will increase at a rate that outperforms others. Basically that moving from what the market views as a potentially distressed company to an investment grade company will better returns than just a company that is already investment grade."
2021-06-18 22:44:09,stocks,"Yeah, the non-paent of dividends is what I had factored in. Without dividend payment, all of that FCF, aside from capital expenditures, can be plowed back into repaying debt. A solid year of aggressive debt pay down and solid oil prices and Oxy should be in a very solid position.

Plus I've been doing research on reasons why OPEC's unlikely to significantly increase production and flood the market with oil. Which I agree with so hopefully these oil prices can be sustainable for several years."
2021-06-18 20:10:27,stocks,No creo Pablo
2021-06-19 00:00:54,stocks,I’m genuinely curious. It should be visible in their 10-k.
2021-06-18 22:53:14,stocks,"One data point that keeps me patient with oxy is price-to-revenue ratio. The closest company to oxy (by market cap) is Hess and their last qtr revenue was 1.92b vs oxy 5.29b. Once the debt is paid down, oxy is trading 2.5 times cheaper than its peers. That screams value to me."
2021-06-18 21:06:24,stocks,David Tepper anyone? Bueller. Bueller. Bueller.
2021-06-18 21:05:50,stocks,Everybody hates OXY. The bastard child of the oil & Gas industry.
2021-06-19 14:26:42,stocks,"Looked it up. Slightly confusing to me but their their last earnings conference slides indicates they're natural gas hedged but does not indicate any oil and gas hedges. 

But, the 10k indicates 96.3 mmbl call options oxy sold at a Brent price of $74.19 for 2021, but explicitly says it's not a hedge. Although, if they sold calls then I guess that would be a cap.
Assuming that is a hedge/cap, they're currently producing 1140 mboe/d which is 1000 barrels of oil per day, that would be 416 million barrels per year. So basically it looks like the potential cap is 23% of their current production capped at $74.19 Brent. So still fairly high of a hedge."
2021-06-18 23:15:32,stocks,"Yeah, I'm a bit surprised oxy hasn't popped more since oil prices have recovered. Kinda weird when you see WTI go up by $1 and Oxy trends down by $2."
2021-06-19 13:52:19,stocks,"The issue isn't just their debt tho. It's that during the pandemic, in order to stay afloat, they had to sell off ridiculous amounts off assets, which offsets the growth they otherwise would have seen from the Anadarko acquistion. Healthy price and demand of oil is a good thing for them and will help them out, but they're still holding a huge bag there."
2021-06-19 13:59:02,stocks,Did they sell off a massive amount of assets? They were actually pretty explicit they were making sure not to do a fire sale and make divestitures significantly below market. None of their asset sales during covid were their primary acreage.
2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"companies IPO and its 10K when a company IPO before its fiscal year, do they still have to include the full fiscal year information even though they wearnt public at those times?

an example is corsair.

it IPO on september. but its fiscal year is the standard calender year, ending in dec 31."
2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"XLF long term I am looking to reposition my IRA out of predominantly growth to predominantly value in preparation for a rate hike. I figure XLF gives me good exposure to banks, which stand to benefit the most in this environment.  

Can anyone provide insight, am I on the right track here?  Is XLF the right instrument to meet my goal?  Is my goal of moving to value even a reasonable one in these conditions?"
2021-06-19 10:56:40,stocks,I’m very bullish on WFC and C
2021-06-19 10:58:27,stocks,"Me too. Both in the short term and longer term. Particularly WFC, assuming they can meet their cost savings goals and move past the current asset cap and all of that."
2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Wall Street Week Ahead for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021 Good Friday evening to all of you here on r/stocks. I hope everyone on this sub made out pretty nicely in the market this past week, and is ready for the new trading week ahead.

Here is everything you need to know to get you ready for the trading week beginning June 21st, 2021.

# **The Fed will continue to dominate the market in the week ahead after sell-off - [(Source)](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/06/18/the-fed-will-continue-to-dominate-the-market-in-the-week-ahead-after-sell-off.html)**
*****
> The Federal Reserve’s signal that it is looking to step away from some of its easy policy is expected to be a dominant trading theme in the week ahead and likely for the rest of the summer.
*****
> In the past week, investors repositioned across the financial markets after Fed Chairman Jerome Powell said Wednesday that the central bank was considering tapering its purchases of Treasurys and mortgage securities. That is important since when the Fed eventually acts, it would be the first serious reversal of the easy policies it put in place to add liquidity to markets when the economy shut down last year because of the Covid crisis.
*****
> The purchases, which amount to $120 billion a month, would be gradually whittled away once the Fed decides to slow down and end the bond buying, or quantitative easing. That could then open the door to interest rate hikes, which the Fed now projects would come in 2023.
*****
> The Federal Reserve sent ripples across financial markets after its meeting Wednesday. The dollar jumped, stocks fell and bond yields moved to imply higher short-term interest rates in the future. The Dow fell 3.5%, its worst week since October. The S&P 500 was down 1.9% for the week, its worst weekly loss since February, and the Nasdaq lost just 0.3%, helped by a small weekly gain in tech.
*****
> “I think the market is still digesting the Fed meeting,” said Ed Keon, chief investment strategist at QMA. Stocks were trading sharply lower Friday, after weakness Wednesday and Thursday. Yields fell on longer duration bonds, like the benchmark 10-year, but rose on the shorter duration 2- and 5-year notes.
*****
> The spreads between those shorter-duration notes and the 10- and 30-year bond yields narrowed dramatically in a so-called flattening trade. That’s common when interest rates are rising. The higher short rates reflect the expected increases in the fed funds rate, while the longer duration yields fall, because the thinking historically has been that a tightening Fed slows the economy.
*****
> The Fed also provided new economic forecasts, including a chart on interest rates that shows it expects to hike its fed funds rate twice in 2023, after its prior forecast included no increases.
*****
> Fed speakers will get a lot of attention in the week ahead. Powell speaks Tuesday before the House Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis on the Fed’s policy response and the economy. His remarks could be a highlight of what looks to be a slow, but volatile first week of summer for markets.
*****
> There are a number of other Fed officials speaking, including New York Fed President John Williams on Monday and San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Cleveland Fed President Loretta Mester, both Tuesday. Other Fed speakers include Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic and St. Louis Fed President James Bullard.
*****
> “Getting more color from others will certainly be key,” said Peter Boockvar, chief investment strategist at Bleakley Global Advisors. “I’m most interested certainly in what Powell has to say. They’re all going to give us now the fine print of what was in the statement and what Powell said” at the end of the Fed’s June meeting.
*****
> There should be a lot of interest in personal consumption expenditures data next Friday, since it includes the PCE inflation index, closely watched by the Fed. The Fed has been pressing its view that elevated inflation readings are just temporary and that they should calm down next year.
*****
> Boockvar said the inflation data should reflect the same spike in prices that showed up in the consumer price index for May, up 5% year over year.
*****
> “It’s going to show some pretty robust month-over-month increases,” said Boockvar. He said inflation data will be the most important for markets.
*****
> “That’s what the rest of the year is all about — inflation, inflation, inflation and how does the Federal Reserve adjust to that,” he said. “In this inflation debate, it’s not just a U.S. thing, it’s a global thing.”
*****
> While the Fed has now penciled in two interest rate hikes for 2023, the market is more skeptical about inflation. According to futures markets, investors believe there could be one or more rate hikes next year and at least four in total before the end of 2023.
*****
> The Fed forecast 3.4% PCE inflation for this year, up a full point from its March forecast, but it still expects a tame 2.1% pace next year.
*****
> Housing data will also be of big interest to markets, after the Fed’s tiny step forward toward tightening unleased a surge in mortgage rates.
*****
> The rate for the 30-year fixed loan jumped to 3.25% by Thursday, the highest in months, according to Mortgage News Daily. The Fed is currently purchasing about $40 billion a month in mortgage securities, and that would slow down along with Treasury buying.
*****
> Existing home sales are released Tuesday, and new home sales are reported Wednesday.
*****
> # Value versus growth
> Keon said the market is choppy but taking in stride the change in the Fed. He said he has overweight stocks in his portfolios. “We like that position with earnings likely to grow 40% this year, rates staying pretty low. That’s a good environment for stocks,” he said.
*****
> As the market traded lower this past week, tech and some growth names held their ground. Tech was barely positive, registering a nearly 0.1% gain for the week. The worst performing sectors were in the value space — commodities-related or part of the reopening cyclical trade.
*****
> Materials were down 6.3% for the week, and financials were down more than 6% as a flattening yield curve has the potential to hurt bank profits.
*****
> “We had a very good move for value stocks and for the reopening plays. They really did well for six months or so,” said Keon. “There’s nothing in the market that keeps going forever. This is probably a bit of a counter rotation. Whether it’s the beginning of a major shift or a slight bounce back [for tech], is hard to say and rates are going to be a determinant.”
*****
> Keon said if the closely watched 10-year yield goes to 2% from its current 1.5%, that would be a positive for value stocks. But if it stays anchored around 1.5%, tech could continue to do well.
*****
> The 10-year yield, which is the benchmark Treasury, fluctuated widely in the past week. After starting the week at about 1.45%, it moved higher right after the Fed meeting to as high as 1.59% but then fell back down to about 1.44% Friday afternoon.
*****
> The 2-year note yielded 0.256% on Friday, up sharply from the prior week’s Friday close of 0.149%.
*****
> “My guess is that the thinking is that at the press conference, Powell made it pretty clear he has no intention of raising rates until 2023,” said Keon. “Until you get to 2023, you’re going to get the boom we are in now, and you’re going to get pretty strong growth in 2022. By the time, you get to 2023, the economy is going to be slowing and is the Fed going to raise rates in a slowing economy? Probably not.”
*****
> Keon said that would keep a cap on the size of the Fed rate hikes. He said there’s little chance the Fed will hike before 2023 unless there’s an upside surprise in inflation.
*****
> “The market thinks the Fed is not going to raise rates until 2023, absent an unexpected surprise to inflation, and that they’re not going to raise rates that much in 2023 because they’ll be risking a recession,” he said.
*****
> Julian Emanuel, head of equities and derivatives strategy at BTIG, said the Fed has now injected a new level of volatility into the markets. He expects investors will be on edge now as the Fed’s late July meeting approaches and again as the Fed heads to Jackson Hole, Wyoming, in late August for its annual symposium.
*****
> Many economists expect Jackson Hole to be the forum where the Fed releases details of the tapering program. Once the Fed announces it will cut back, it is then expected to wait a few months before slowly paring back the purchases over many months. The end of the easing program is important since it would then open the door to a potential rate hike, based on the strength of the economy.
*****
> “The narrative here is the markets are likely to continue going back and forth with regard to their view on the Fed assessment of whether transitory is correct or not,” Emanuel said. “Transitory” is how the Fed describes its view that the surge in inflation will be short-lived.
*****
> In the past week, some of the inflationary pressure in the market dissipated with a major sell-off across the commodities complex. The Fed’s policy talk helped spur a surge in the dollar, which was part of the reason for the selling. But the first catalyst was a move by China to cool the hot commodities markets. Reuters reported that a Chinese government agency planned to release reserves of aluminum, copper and zinc.
*****
> Copper was down more than 8.4% on the week, its worst week since March 2020.

> # Down Triple Witching Weeks Trigger More Weakness Week After

> As stocks continue to sell off on this Q2 Triple Witching Friday it is a good time to review the history and the pattern of down Triple Witching Weeks triggering more weakness the week after. This phenomenon is detailed on page 106 of the Stock Trader’s Almanac page 2022. The updated table of the four annual DJIA TWWs is pictured here.

> The most important fact to note is that the week after TWW is the worst in Q2 – down 26 of the past 30 years since 1991. Down TWWs not only trigger weakness the week after, but that trend is most pronounce in Q2 and Q3 – the quarters within the Worst Six Months. Since 1991, of 39 down TWWs, 27 following weeks were also down. But in Q2 10 of the 12 down TWWs were followed by a down week after and it’s 11 of 12 in Q3.

> Proceed with caution next week. And Happy Father’s Day to all the dads!

> # Big Drops In The Percent of Stocks Above Their 50-DMAs

> In yesterday's Sector Snapshot, we highlighted how the internals of several sectors have weakened dramatically in recent days. One such measure in which there are drastic differences versus a couple of weeks ago is the reading on the percentage of stocks above their 50-DMAs. In the charts below, we show the changes in this reading across sectors and for the broader S&P 500.

> As shown, the two sectors which have seen the largest share of their stocks fall below the support of their 50-DMAs are Financials and Materials. Two weeks ago, both of these sectors boasted some of the strongest readings of all sectors, but through yesterday, those readings have fallen over 60 percentage points. Meanwhile, Energy and Real Estate have seen almost all of their stocks trade above their 50-DMAs over the past two weeks without much change. While the declines were not as dramatic as Materials and Financials, Industrials and Consumer Staples have also seen a significant share of their members fall below their 50-DMAs. While most sectors have seen a decline in this reading, Tech and Health Care have been notable standouts with both sectors having more stocks above their 50-DMAs now than two weeks ago. This is indicative of the rotation that has been going on underneath the surface throughout the entire bull market that began when the S&P made its 2020 low after the COVID Crash last March.

> # Leading Indicators Continue to Forecast Growth

> As the economic focus has frantically shifted from inflation concerns to peak growth fears to the Federal Reserve’s (Fed) tightening timeline in recent weeks, it can be helpful to take a step back and assess the broad economic trend with a diversified set of indicators.

> Through this lens, we are encouraged by the latest reading of the Leading Economic Index (LEI), which strongly suggested that economic growth would continue at a strong clip in the near-to-intermediate term.

> On Thursday, June 17, the Conference Board released its May 2021 report detailing the latest datapoint for the LEI, a composite of ten data series that tend to lead changes in economic activity. Many economic data points are backward looking, but we pay special attention to the LEI, as it has a forward-looking tilt to it and spans many segments of the economy. The index grew 1.3% month over month, building on the strength seen in recent months since flirting with negative territory in February.

> “Three consecutive monthly gains in excess of 1% tend to be rare, and in fact, we never experienced that coming out of the 2008 recession,” said LPL Financial Chief Investment Strategist Ryan Detrick. “That we have seen this dynamic twice now exiting the trough of the most recent recession speaks to the speed and strength of the recovery. We certainly understand near-term jitters, but we expect broader economic trends to remain positive over the intermediate term, consistent with the LEI’s message.”

> As seen in the LPL Chart of the Day, the LEI has shown strong growth the last three months after limping through the second half of winter.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://i0.wp.com/lplresearch.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/6.18.21-Blog-Chart-1.png?ssl=1)**

> Seven of the ten components grew in May, while two fell and one remained unchanged. Average weekly initial claims for unemployment insurance, the ISM New Orders Index, and the interest rate spread represented the three largest contributors. Building permits and manufacturers’ new orders for nondefense capital goods excluding aircraft detracted from the overall index’s performance, while average weekly manufacturing hours held steady.

> Strong breadth among the underlying components reinforces our view of continued economic strength. While supply chain bottlenecks and a slower-than-desired labor market recovery have acted as near term speedbumps, we expect those dynamics to largely self-correct and propel the economy further in the second half of the year. Reopening effects are snowballing, and we believe ever-increasing vaccination numbers, warmer weather, and the potential for strong employment growth later in 2021 warrant continued optimism for this economy.

> # Citi Surprise Indices Surging But Not Everywhere

> It is a boring start to the week with nothing on the docket for earnings, Fed speakers, or economic data. With regards to the latter, the slate will pick up tomorrow with several US releases including retail sales, PPI, industrial production, and more. Expectations for tomorrow's releases are a bit mixed relative to the prior readings in each indicator, but overall, recent US data has been beating expectations at a healthy rate. The charts below show the Citi Economic Surprise indices for a variety of global regions and the US. Positive readings in these indices indicate economic data is coming in above forecasts, and vice versa for negative readings. Additionally, higher positive or negative readings would mean that economic data is exceeding or coming up short of those forecasts by a wider margin.

> Currently, the US index is well off record levels from the past year, but it has bounced since the start of June. The index has risen 42.7 points in the ten days from the end of May to last Friday. That move stands in the top 2% of all 10-day changes since the index began in 2003. That also comes not even a full month after the index saw its first negative reading in a year. While the negative reading was far from anything extreme, the sharp rebound has been impressive, leaving the index at a historically healthy level in the 83rd percentile.

> The US is not alone in having seen a rebound. Although it is similarly off the peak from last summer and generally trending lower since then, the global index has consistently sat at the high end of its historical range over the past year. The current reading is still in the top 1% of all periods, and the move higher over the past ten days is again dramatic ranking in the top 5% of ten-day changes in the index's history. While the jump in the US index has likely played at least some part in this, other regions around the world are also pulling weight having seen just as, if not more, significant moves. Sticking with a look at the move over the past ten days, the gains for the indices covering APAC and Central/Eastern Europe, the Middle East, and Africa all rank in the 98th percentile while the move in the index tracking Latin American countries ranks in the top decile. Each of these indices now sits in the top 1% or 2% of their historical ranges. One outlier region not contributing to the pickup in the global index has been Europe. While the Eurozone index is far from weak, it has not seen much of a move higher recently as other regions have.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061421-CESI-Regions.png))**

> Likely thanks to the weakness in Eurozone countries, a similar dichotomy can be seen comparing the indices for major developed economies (the G10 members) and emerging market countries. While the index tracking major economies has simply held up at healthy levels, the emerging markets index has leaped to new record highs, breaking well above the previous records set earlier in the pandemic. BRIC countries in particular are some to thank for that sharp move higher as the index has seen one of its largest short-term moves on record.

> # June Quarterly Options Expiration Week and After Historically Volatile

> The second Triple Witching Week (Quadruple Witching if you prefer) of the year brings on some volatile trading with losses frequently exceeding gains. NASDAQ has the weakest record on the first trading day of the week. Triple-Witching Friday is usually better, DJIA has been up ten of the last eighteen years, but down five of the last six.

> Full-week performance is choppy as well, littered with greater than 1% moves in both directions. The week after Triple-Witching Day is horrendous. This week has experienced DJIA losses in 27 of the last 31 years with an average performance of –1.14%. S&P 500 and NASDAQ have fared slightly better during the week after over the same 31-year span, declining 0.79% and 0.29% respectively on average.

> # Sentiment Shaky

> Although there has not been any sort of dramatic breakout to the upside as the index has fallen over the past few days, the S&P 500 did manage to tag new record highs in the past week for the first time since May 10th. The record-high milestone has done little to shift sentiment though. The AAII survey of individual investor sentiment saw its reading on bullish sentiment rise 0.9 percentage points to 41.1%. While higher, that is still three points below the reading from just a couple of weeks ago.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Bull.png))**

> The biggest move was in neutral sentiment as that reading fell 6.4 percentage points to 32.7%. That is the lowest reading in over a month and marked the biggest drop in neutral sentiment since the week of April 8th. Even though that was a big drop, neutral sentiment remains slightly elevated versus the historical average (31.42%) and especially relative to what has been the norm over the past year.

> ###### **([CLICK HERE FOR THE CHART!](https://media.bespokepremium.com/uploads/2021/06/061721-AAII-Neut.png))**

> The past couple of weeks have seen historically muted readings on bearish sentiment. While that is still the case with this week's readings remaining at the low end of its historical range, bearish sentiment saw a big 5.5 percentage point gain rising to 26.2%. That one-week uptick in bearish sentiment was the largest since last September. It also marked the first time since the end of last month that over a quarter of respondents reported as bearish. While the move was not nearly as large, the Investors Intelligence survey echoed that increase in bearish sentiment with the bull-bear spread in that survey falling from 38.3 to 37.8 after inverse moves in bullish and bearish sentiment. In other words, broadly speaking, optimism has appeared to have peaked for the time being.

I hope you all have a wonderful weekend and a great trading week ahead r/stocks."
2021-06-18 20:27:45,stocks,"So, summarizing all the above, the next week is likely to get even worse?"
2021-06-18 21:32:25,stocks,I predict that next week people will brag about being right for a change
2021-06-18 21:59:16,stocks,Do you happen to know if they released when the Fed people are speaking next week? Great stuff as always.
2021-06-19 08:45:06,stocks,How are the Meme Stonks likely to fair this coming week??
2021-06-19 05:04:53,stocks,"Gracias,.Oso Grande!"
2021-06-18 22:55:49,stocks,Should mention that bank stress test results are likely to be announced next week.
2021-06-19 04:08:10,stocks,Why is inflation running hot at 5% (based on CPI numbers) but the FED claims it's more like 2%? Why are interest rates not rising?
2021-06-19 11:10:20,stocks,"Guys, what software or website can display this info? Thanks in advance.."
2021-06-19 07:17:39,stocks,I've a balanced portfolio between tech and value stocks. I should gain regardless
2021-06-18 22:15:34,stocks,Sooooooo.... you're saying I should buy more!
2021-06-18 22:50:15,stocks,"Yup, if one Fed president speaking can cause stocks to tumble, imagine what 14 can do"
2021-06-18 23:10:20,stocks,No.
2021-06-19 15:01:45,stocks,Way to prime yourself to start bragging next week.
2021-06-19 06:29:39,stocks,They've explained many times they think current inflation is transitory and they are waiting for employment to hit their target. They will let things run hot to achieve this.
2021-06-19 16:28:11,stocks,"It's high year over year but if you look back at the growth over a two year period from 2019-2021 it's actually around 2.5%, which is on par for the compounded growth for the last 5 years. Basically, COVID depressed prices and now we're ""catching up"" to where we would have been without COVID."
2021-06-19 13:21:41,stocks,What value stocks are you in?
2021-06-19 13:26:45,stocks,Energy. Got hit a bit hard Friday but hope they'd get back on track
2021-06-19 15:03:24,stocks,"Lol follow the trend.. you think they're going to go up for some reason, and tech won't tank miserably?"
2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Why I'm bullish on CRSR I would like to preface this by saying that no I'm not a bag holder, although I am invested in the company I don't have an insane cost basis at like 35 or something. Also, I'm not saying we pump this stock this is just my DD so mods please don't remove my post again I put in a decent bit of effort lol and this isn't another shit post. 

First, CRSR is trading at a P/E of just 20 which is extremely low compared to the previous growth it's had. Of course, CRSR can't sustain their growth from last year but they will continue to grow nonetheless. Their competitors such as Logitech are trading at slightly higher P/E's yet are 7x the size of them indicating once again how low their P/E is for their sector.

Then, their free cash flow is very strong. With most companies I would like to see them trading at around a 20x free cash flow or 25x if their growth is strong. For a company like Corsair 20x seems low and 25x would seem reasonable yet they are trading at just 16x FREE CASH FLOW. N

Not to mention they are trading at a P/S of less than 2 and I understand that they have low margins but this is still very good for a relatively small company. Additionally, with Corsairs strong cash on hand this provides them with the opportunity to possibly improve their management or put more money into paid promotions with youtube/twitch streamers which I believe is much needed.

Lastly, when I used my DCF model assuming 11% growth for the next 3 years, then 9 percent growth for the next 3 after that, and lastly 8 percent growth for the next 3 years then CRSR has a margin of safety 28% and an intrinsic share value of 41. Also remember, I am assuming somewhat conservative growth numbers.

Finally, one of the main arguments against CRSR is that they cannot maintain their growth from last year and they will in fact shrink but this was proven completely wrong in q1 of 2021 where they continued to grow."
2021-06-18 21:49:20,stocks,"I've reached roughly the same conclusion with their potential cashflow. It seems like the risk vs reward is extremely high with this company.

The upside of continued strong growth, increasing margins, segment growth, being prices with multiple similar to their peers, etc... Strongly outweighs the downside of slowing growth. 

In the long term, I think anything under $35 is a great price."
2021-06-18 20:16:08,stocks,"You are really just long a covered call with this stock.  You have the sponsor, Eagletree, who is a clear seller.  The puked another 2.7MM shares after the WallStreetBets pump.  Be careful here.  If the stock goes up, you'll get slammed with secondary sales.  If the stock goes down...you lose money.  Be on the right side of asymmetry."
2021-06-18 20:15:11,stocks,"Bought the peak during the recent meme run up, did you?"
2021-06-19 00:36:50,stocks,"Truth be told, I don't understand the bull case for corsair from a consumer prespective. I'm a very big gamer, the only thing I have from corsair is a $100 cpu cooler. The rest are a variety of other companies' products. I think the industry is too saturated with competitors for it to grow aggressively realistically."
2021-06-18 22:17:24,stocks,"Tons of CRSR posts, trying pump to breakeven."
2021-06-19 05:31:49,stocks,I’ve been trading the channel for months and will continue to do so now that it has returned to previous levels - buying the dips around $30-32 and selling the bounces to $33-35 where Eagletree steps in and drives the price down again. Works like a charm.
2021-06-19 09:00:02,stocks,"Issue with Crsr is Eagletree. They put so much selling pressure the stock will be going sideways forever. They bought company shares for under 10 bucks and will def sell to keep it in undervalued category. Personally I think it will take good 2-3 yrs for it to breakthrough. And thats if company will manage to keep good numbers.

Crsr is nothing special. They release good products and smash earnings,- true, but same with competitors they have."
2021-06-18 20:46:00,stocks,"Being long $CRSR is being long that PC gaming will overtake console gaming in the next 5 years which I, personally, feel is the case and where we are headed."
2021-06-18 20:48:16,stocks,Thank u for this. The numbers are great. Anything else u can tell me about this?
2021-06-18 23:12:29,stocks,You think 35 is an insane cost basis?
2021-06-18 21:29:50,stocks,Definitely an amazing 👏company disappointed it came crashing back down but will trade it
2021-06-19 08:48:09,stocks,What does Corsair do again? I thought it was just rebranded tech.
2021-06-19 14:22:00,stocks,CRSR has shit margins
2021-06-19 10:37:20,stocks,I bought everything Corsair. Then I tried RAZER. And now everything I own is razer.
2021-06-19 07:35:07,stocks,This was NET one year ago. Everyone posted on here how it was under valued but it never moved. Then suddenly Boom.
2021-06-18 23:09:26,stocks,The weekly Corsair pumps are turning into daily Corsair pumps. I seriously think posts about Corsair should be banned for a while. It's getting ridiculous.
2021-06-18 21:34:44,stocks,"Another day, another CRSR pumper."
2021-06-19 09:11:29,stocks,that nobody wants to touch because its now a p&d
2021-06-18 22:30:11,stocks,"Its a good buy, but eagletree is apparently dumping shares as they own a huge portion and are in private equity. It's probably going to rocket eventually, but we may see price suppression until they quit selling. Could be awhile"
2021-06-19 08:32:20,stocks,"> risk vs reward is extremely high

You mean low?"
2021-06-18 22:34:31,stocks,Eventually they'll run out or reach the max they want to hold in a public company and the selling will subside.  I think eagletree slows down around 30. We have seen it rebound near that level multiple times.  Once that ends crsr will do really well. In the meantime it's all about shares! Selling otm ccs is a great way to make some money in the meantime. Would not suggest buying calls
2021-06-18 20:43:54,stocks,"where did you get the 2.7M shares sell frok Eagle tree recently? from IB, the most recent is June 6 with 5M sell."
2021-06-19 03:40:36,stocks,I feel attacked
2021-06-19 02:03:25,stocks,"So you dropped $100 on a Corsair product, and don’t see the bullish case?

Why did you buy that product? Superior quality? Brand name, longevity of the product?"
2021-06-19 02:01:33,stocks,"1.7B annual sales, 2.5B market cap company.

Growing at a 75% clip YoY, in a massive growth market.

You think millennials and gen-X gonna stop gaming or buying computer gear?

All you need to know.

Eagle tree is selling shares. Buy shares, sell $40s CC’s. Free money"
2021-06-18 22:36:37,stocks,They sell console stuff too ;)
2021-06-18 22:53:15,stocks,"Hmm, I thought I was long CRSR until I read this take. I'm speaking from a biased point of view because I'm not a PC gamer, but consoles are pretty damn powerful now. The gap between consoles and PC is smaller than ever imo, and my Xbox Series X with Game Pass is the best console experience I've had thus far. Not sure what PC could do better to entice me to switch in the future."
2021-06-19 05:21:04,stocks,Maybe he means insanely high?
2021-06-19 17:43:03,stocks,Opposite for me. Razer were the most garbage products I’ve ever tried. Corsair and logi are king
2021-06-19 11:05:19,stocks,Sure
2021-06-19 04:16:29,stocks,"The are obligated to hold only 10% 5 years after the IPO. It is going to take a while but i don't mind, more time to accumulated. Low thirties is a apparently a very strong support level as well"
2021-06-18 21:11:40,stocks,Bloomberg has an updated filing from June 15th.  I was seeing in the flows too - GS was advertising volumes and they were lead on prior deals
2021-06-19 02:22:56,stocks,"I bought it because it was a part compatible with my motherboard. For a CPU cooler, it's a pretty insignificant part of my 4,000 dollar build. In fact for my next build, I'm planning to go NZXT for a full water loop build."
2021-06-19 02:11:45,stocks,"You think Corsair has the competitive moat to get that 75% YoY?

Corsair is not the only gaming and computer gear brand out there."
2021-06-19 15:03:14,stocks,"studies show that PC market is starting to eat up consoles market share. As well as a majority of new developing game companies making games for PC over console. As cost of pre-built PC's continue to come down, with how versatile a PC is over a console, in ~5 years we'll see this trend continue and PC's to become more and more popular and mainstream."
2021-06-19 05:05:09,stocks,"Are there many tournaments played by consoles? I see esports as a big thing in future and it's all on PC. But idk how about console esports. But see Dota, LoL and some others PC games have a 40million prize pool"
2021-06-19 08:03:15,stocks,"Read that that rumor is false, but that it's normal to cut down to that level"

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Missing 6/18 $215 strike explanation? Hoping an expert here will be able to point me in a direction as this isn’t something I’ve seen in an options chain before. 

Today’s expiring 6/18 GME option chain went 205, 210, …, 220, 225, and the price was pinned near 215 most of the day. 

I’m not sure if the $215 strike was available at any point and they subsequently removed it, or if it was never available in the first place. I did confirm this wasn’t broker-specific as I checked multiple accounts and none had the $215 strike.

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Clovis Oncology - Cancer Treatment Catalyst Clovis Oncology (NASDAQ CLVS) may be the next magic play for all of us. As you know, we hate hedge funds. We also hate cancer. Cancer kills, and Clovis is working to kill cancer, with a strong focus on advanced Ovarian cancer.

CLVS has a 33% short float, per Ortex, and also had a slight squeeze not too long ago, running up to just over $7/share. CLVS closed today at \~5.96, after running past 6.5 earlier this week afterhours.

CLVS has an exciting year ahead of it. While their Q1 revenue was down 11% from Q1 2020, much attributed to the pandemic, they've also seen a sizeable decrease in R&D expenses, as their Rubraca clinic trials are demanded less money, something that is expected to continue this entire year. Other expenses have also fallen drastically, with expectations to remain lower throughout this year (AKA, guidance good)

As of Q1, CLVS has \~191 million on hand, which can keep them pumping for the next few years.

One of their newer products, Rubraca, is currently approved for adult patients with recurrent epithelial, ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancers. TRITON3 clinical trials are currently underway and positive results likely accelerate approval into mCRPC use. Phase 3 trials are underway, comparing Rubraca by itself (monotheraputically) vs placebo. Results are expected this year. Results for their combination treatment of Rubraca and Opdivo (r) are expected next year.

Another candidate is their FAP-2286, which is a form of peptide-targeted radionuclide therapy. Essentially, it binds to FAP sites (a cell surface serine protease) and has another piece that allows radioactive isotopes to attach to it. FAP is very often present in epithelial cancers. So essentially, it binds to these sites, and serves as a binding site for radioactive isotopes, allowing for better imaging. FAP-2286 is currently Clovis' lead radiotherapy for cancer imaging and treatment, which is a newly emerging technology which hopes to allow radiation delivery more precisely.

Chemo, as you probably know, is brutal, because it damages or kills cells indiscriminately. Targeted radionuclide therapy may serve as a way to end that. By allowing targeted radiation delivery, healthy cells could potentially be bypassed or at least experience a lesser degree of radiation delivery.

Thank you for reading my first DD. I appreciate it. anyway, I'm playing a bit aggressively. I've got 70 8c for 7/16. I might end up rolling them out next week but I want to see how this plays out.

TLDR: CLVS developing new cancer tech, results from stage 3 trial expected this year. Pharma stock with news like that = massive buying

P/BV - banks, miners, industrials

P/S - companies going through a rough patch - sales are generally more stable, so the trend in P/S can give a sense of the discount relative to the recent past.

Dividend yield vs FCF yield - if dividends aren't supported by FCF then they aren't real. Equally I don't trust companies that supposedly generate strong FCF but dont pay dividends - normally means management is going to waste it on frivolous M&A.

Net Worth vs Goodwill & intangibles - if GW&IT is higher than NW, management already wasted their cash on frivolous M&A."

2021-06-19 00:00:00,stocks,"Help confirm my understanding of Covered Calls? So I was thinking about testing the waters with covered calls and I wanted to make sure my understanding was correct.

I buy 100 Stock of XYZ @ $10 = $1000

I can then sell a Call and basically use my 100 shares as collateral.

For example: I can sell a $15 Call for $100 premium.

Based on my understanding, my **worst case scenario** is that the stock goes above $15 and the option is exercised.  So at that point I sell all my shares @ $15 which would ultimately give me a $600 profit (15\*100 + $100 premium - $1000 initial investment).  So while I may miss out on potentially bigger gains if it rockets past 15, there is no way I can actually lose money doing this right?"
2021-06-18 20:14:21,stocks,"The way you lose money is if the stock goes down. When you sell a call against stock, you are synthetically creating a put.  Put/Call Parity is C = Stock + Put + PV(Strike).  Therefore, Stock - Call = - Put - Borrowed Funds.  If you are going to own the full risk of a stock...at least participate in the upcapped upside of a stock.  If you want yield, buy a bond."
2021-06-18 21:14:52,stocks,yes
2021-06-18 21:24:42,stocks,"correct. 

the only other potential risk is missing out on a dividend if the shares get called away before an ex date.

for example, i had 2 contracts for IRM with a $45 strike that was SUPPOSED to expire today, but whoever bought the call opted to excercise it last friday in order to collect the dividend, since the exdate was this monday.

(well, technically the third risk would simply be if you buy shares to sell covered calls against, but the share prices keep going down and you don't get back to your original buy in price, but that's a risk for any stock, not just ones you're selling  calls against)"
2021-06-19 02:25:11,stocks,"Correct - when selling a covered call your risk is “infinite” but only in respect to the loss of more profit if the price skyrockets. You do not incur an actual loss - and don’t forget you keep the premium which is extra profit.  If you choose to buy your sold call back, you can keep your shares and the total profit ends up being the difference in premium and broker fees"
2021-06-19 05:17:48,stocks,"Sorry to hijack the thread. If I wanted to sell calls, where can I do this? I’m in the UK"
2021-06-19 10:41:45,stocks,"If the stock tanks you could just buy out the option at no loss.

It’s when the stock rips too high that a CC is a problem as you can’t sell the shares off without taking a loss on the call"
2021-06-19 11:44:00,stocks,"But it is important to know that it's basically carrying the same risk as if you were to just hold the shares long without doing anything, which is why when doing covered calls vs just longing on stocks plainly, the relative risk and worst case scenario is your opportunity cost if it were to run up, like say, AMC, that is the difference in the current price and your strike price + premium."
2021-06-18 21:30:55,stocks,"> i'm a little confused as well; what is the downside to this?

the biggest downside is probably just the possibility of the price EXPLODING, causing you to miss out on large gains.

for example, there was someone in this sub that mentioned last summer he had bought a thousands of $5 gamestop shares and routinely sold covered calls against  them. no idea how that turned out for him, but if he continued doing that, he would have missed out on literally hundreds of thousands of dollars of profit in january.

now, is this a fringe case? absolutely. but  it's something to keep in mind.

the other  risk is simply the value of the  share going down. if someone buys a bunch of shares at $40/share, sells a covered call, then the price drops to $20/share, that puts  them in kind of a bad spot after the option expires and it's time to write new ones. they have to either risk strikes that represent a loss if it hits, or take WAY  out of the money calls that have near-zero premiums."
2021-06-19 12:28:35,stocks,"I would think any platform that allows you to trade stock would allow for selling calls, but I'm no expert.  I do know, at least in US, there is an application to dip into options and from there you qualify for a certain levels which give you access things such as buying and selling calls"
2021-06-18 22:22:38,stocks,"If the underlying stock is dropping fast, you may want to unload it….but wouldn’t be able to, because it’s locked up in a covered call contract. If it is a stock that you’re long on, don’t worry about it….the stock going down while you’ve sold a cc is a ￼not a bad thing. In fact, some people like to find a stock that trades sideways and pays a dividend and sell calls on it every chance they get. I used to do this with T, until they slashed the dividend in half."
2021-06-18 22:27:37,stocks,Really like this approach. Solid thinking.
2021-06-18 21:34:03,stocks,"> What do you mean you can just close it? Haven’t you got to wait till expiration before you do anything?

when you sell a covered call, you're choosing ""sell to open"", and this is basically short selling the contract. at any time, you can buy someone else's contract with ""buy to close"" to close the position. (in which case you're no long responsible for being able to provide those shares)

the same thing can be done with puts."

I am not an ambulance chaser jumping on struggling companies in hopes that some dumb reddit trend will make me a quick 10%.

But that does not change the facts about what is going on right now. Enthusiast Gaming, the leading eSports organization in North America (*as measured social reach, web traffic and revenue*) is being shorted to death.

After an epic, fundamentals driven rally from $1 to $8.80, the stock has been beaten down to $6.50.

It's very important to note that **the rally was not a senseless meme pump**. The company's **revenue grew from $15m per year to $127m**. They also announced a litany of high profile fortune 500 and government clients that hired them. The company is not fluff.

If the company is doing okay, then how come it's down so much? Well the catalyst that kicked off the downtrend was their announcement of share sales. As a newly registered Nasdaq company, they had to file forms with the SEC that would allow them to sell shares over the next 25 months. That process took a few weeks to complete before they could close a deal.

During that time, the shorts have had their way with EGLX. You can see a detailed chart of shorting activity over the past several weeks here:  [https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

The company has a tiny little market cap and the stock volume has been relatively low. A small number of short sellers have been able to exercise extreme market power over this company.

But now they have overstayed their welcome. They have raised the capital and the financials are sound. The company's actual business is doing great and the industry will continue booming.

Every single morning since the deal closed, EGLX has tried pumping back up, and then it settles down. But the stock selling pressure is not coming from long term holders giving up their positions. It is coming from short sellers trying to make a quick buck at the expense of a great Canadian company.

# According to this source, short interest was 38% yesterday.

[https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX](https://www.nakedshortreport.com/company/EGLX)

I am willing to bet the short interest will be even higher on Monday. The stock started popping off this morning and then fell precipitously again.

But how do I know this company isn't just dog doodoo and shareholders are dumping?

Look at the cost to borrow: [https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx](https://fintel.io/ss/us/eglx)

# This shorting is costing the shorts 9%! Compare that to AMC's 1.16% and GME's 0.59% short borrowing cost.

Get wrecked.

This high cost to borrow means a couple things:

1. There is an extremely high number of short sellers compared to people who are willing to lend out their shares. That indicates its over shorted and holders are hodling.
2. It also means this is costing them ALOT every day this stock doesn't go down further.

Now, if this company was a steaming pile of trash that isn't making money, I would say the shorts will just kill EGLX and win the day. I do NOT advocate in investing in dying companies in hopes of some bogus short squeeze.

But EGLX will not die. It is genuinely a great long term opportunity, and the bears have gotten ahead of themselves on this one. This company is here to stay, for a number of obvious reasons.

**Reason 1: Common sense:**

The eSports and gaming industry is growing and these guys have developed a real business out of it. They are doing business with: TikTok, Samsung, ATVI, EA, President Biden's Campaign, the US military, Ad Council, Disney, Bell, Nintendo etc etc. What's more, they are producing results for them. Take a scroll through the luminosity LGLoyal twitch page, and you can see that EGLX has been getting about a million views on every single video with the program they developed with TikTok. TikTok has already indicated they intend to continue to do business with EGLX.

**Reason 2: They have cash:**

They just successfully raised another $44m in cash. Looking at their recent financials, I think that probably puts them around $60m cash in the bank right now. They are not going to run out of liquidity. They are not some business on the verge of bankruptcy, desperate for funding and debt.

**Reason 3: They are NOT overpriced:**

In a market where most high volatility growth names like say Palantir, Zoom, BB, Score, Tesla, Dkng etc are all trading at like a 10-50X price to sales ratio, EGLX is sitting at a measly 6.5 price to sales. That is a tad high when you compare it to stable value stocks in the Berkshire portfolio, but honestly it's PEANUTS for a growth stock in a hot industry that just expanded their revenue ten fold.

# This stock will rubber band back to $10 when these shorts give up."

They're starting to get really good at sales, and yes, they need to start looking at the cost of sales too - which I believe will look better when they can do their events again, and seeing as their subscription numbers go up I'm not worried.

Sorry OP but being a digital pimp ain't easy. Influencers know full well how to make money on their own and they don't need this BS middle men, and those who do are small/failing and won't ever see a return to long term positive growth. As a company they have *no moat* since there are douzen others who do the same, with similar calls to fame and similar weak finances. I see no reason why these would become dominant, especially since they failed to grow aggressively despite a year when everyone was home.

My concern remains about revenue generation and how they are going to grow / what they are trying to build.

They have signed some big names, but am I correct in assuming these are endorsements similar to when Nike signs with a sports star?  
I’m assuming they don’t collect profits off tyler1 or pokemaines streams/YouTube.  If I’m wrong please correct me.
If I’m right, why are they paying to endorse these players?  What are they trying to advertise / push towards, and how do they make money off this?

While steaming and esports is a large and growing market, it’s also very competitive.  Twitch / YouTube / Facebook / tiktok are the major players in North America; how does the Samsung smart TVs play pull people off those platforms?  Does omniamedia have a chance to really get a foot in the door and get consistent viewers?

I also understand they get paid for traffic on their other sites, but I’m not sure if that rev is sustainable for a publicly traded company… they don’t get traffic like Facebook.

And I get it that they host in person events, which hopefully will come back soon (pending another COVID shutdown), and these can be huge money makers; but there is nothing proprietary about this and companies in Vegas are already positioning themselves to be esport Titans.

I love making money off shorts, but sometimes they are right.  Before I dive balls deep into an investment I do my dd so I don’t wake up with herpes.

2021-06-19 14:55:22,stocks,"I call them an influencer marketing company focused on the gaming audience.

I listen to their CEO's podcasts and such all the time. He regularly talks about how their entire value proposition is getting marketing access to the gen Zers who aren't on facebook, don't watch tv, don't watch sports, and don't read the news.

Right now they are building a massive network of websites, streamers, channels, teams etc. They are literally in the top 100 us companies in terms of web traffic with this network.

Source: [https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152515/0/en/Enthusiast-Gaming-Joins-the-Comscore-100-Ranking-of-Top-100-Internet-Properties-in-the-United-States.html](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/04/2152515/0/en/Enthusiast-Gaming-Joins-the-Comscore-100-Ranking-of-Top-100-Internet-Properties-in-the-United-States.html)

The greatest thing about this is that they have been hyper focused on acquiring web assets that live on ""organic growth"". That means they do not pay for traffic. They are not buying google or facebook ads to drive traffic to their channels. Instead, gamers and young people are going to their channels organically for free, and they are selling access to that traffic.

(*As someone who works in digital marketing, I personally think they should start doing paid ad traffic to their sites and just make sure the spread on ad sales to ad expense remains positive. I think they will get there eventually, but for now they like focusing on organic web traffic growth*.)

I can get behind all this \^ as a stock market investor. But I am unsure if this model alone can drive them to be a real 10 bagger or 100 bagger in the long run.

The **single biggest flaw** in their business model is that their stuff is so spread out and it's not mainstream. As we all know, the internet is kind of winner take all. Everyone flocks to the top platforms exponentially. Unfortunately, all their fan sites like icy veins are all over the place and have a little microcosm of the internet. More concerningly, all their influencers are on twitch and youtube, which obviously they do not own.

BUT!  Here is where the company becomes a big long term gamble for investors.

They are actually developing their own platforms, which I think they have big ambitions for:

1. **Upcomer** \- which is their eSports news source. I see them trying to turn this into the ESPN of eSports.
2. **Project GG** \- their unnamed social media platform that was announced a month ago. I foresee them announcing this being something that incorporates a lot of what discord and twitch are doing. They also obviously have intentions of syncing it up with in-game data (as per their purchase of tab stats) and create plugins that game devs will use to allow games to communicate with the social media platform (*potentially stat reporting, friends lists, and automated social media sharing for say achievements and instant replays etc.*)  I also speculate that they will wade into online betting based on recent comments from the CEO.

Now here's how I see it, if Upcomer and Project GG don't come full fruition, EGLX will probably have a hard time becoming anything other than a fringe marketing agency.

However, if Upcomer and Project GG end up taking off and catching on, I genuinely see this stock breaking $10B USD market cap.

The questions long term investors need to ask themselves are:

1. Will they be able to make GOOD platforms?
2. Even if the platforms are good, will they be able to drive traffic and sign up conversions to those platforms? (*This to me is a definite yes, because that's what they are already doing for all their other customers.*)
3. Even with the right mix of both 1 and 2, will they be able to sustain the long stretch from a financial perspective? Will they need to dilute the stock too much or take on too much debt and never make it all happen?

It's a gamble, and I am personally very very long on the upside.

Based on EGLX's client list and partnership with companies like Samsung (the CEO has commented about installing their channels on smart tvs), I see Upcomer having a moderate chance of success.

But based on their obnoxiously large social media reach and their army of top tier gaming streamers, I genuinely think Project GG has a real chance of getting the attention it needs to get some traction. If the platform is good, I pray that xQc, Richard Sherman and gang will get us the sign ups."

Even if demand is there how high these stocks should be valued and what risks it poses if demand plummets for some reason?"

I personally hate the meme stock terminology but I understand why it's used. For example I've invested in Tesla since 2018 and it might have been called a lot of things, but meme stock it wasn't. It just feels like a lazy way to categorize stocks instead of focusing on the business itself. But I digress, I'm a long term investor and don't get caught up in the momentum stuff."

2021-06-19 14:04:38,stocks,I would think that equipment manufacturers face the same dilema. They are constantly having to update their processes and get new equipment themselves to be able to create the new equipment fabs need. Not 100% though. Have you checked the CAPEX of the companies? That’ll tell you how often they are buying new equipement

2021-06-19 05:55:07,stocks,I'm confused. You're insinuating that it drops?
2021-06-19 09:07:39,stocks,Dilution of shares is usually a detriment to the price
2021-06-19 17:08:30,stocks,Should increase share price if they spend 750 million on buying back shares at market
2021-06-19 15:32:03,stocks,"Am I misunderstanding? 

Is realtortoms saying CLF is buying back over 35 million shares, how would that be dilution? Wouldn't that cause an increase since there are fewer shares available?"
2021-06-18 21:26:54,stocks,"Basically the market believes the fed. Short term inflation and long term deflation/disinflation. Globally there are a lot of people getting older and damage to the real economy (physically moving real tangible things not digits on a screen) over the past year is reflecting in the bond market. Short term supply chain issues will cause inflation, but the saying is that high prices are the cure for high prices and low prices are the cure for low prices. Short term inflation will cause long term damage."
2021-06-19 00:50:22,stocks,"I understand the Fed doesn’t set long term rates, but it has been suppressing them with massive QE, particularly mortgage rates (also LT treasury rates, but those are probably also being suppressed by foreign investors to whom a 2% RFR looks “great” compared to what they can get elsewhere, even if the real yield is still negative). Without the Fed’s intervention, what would be the true “free-market” rate for a 30-yr. fixed mortgage, given current demand?

I also think the market is ignoring the long- term damage being done to the dollar and credit-worthiness of the US government given its massive and ever-growing  debt and deficit,  and ballooning of the US money supply. It seems to think that the dollar will remain the reserve currency of the world forever, but that ain’t necessarily so."
2021-06-19 00:21:53,stocks,"If that’s the case, then why didn’t the sell-off, begin after the last super-“hot” CPI print, or the one before that, instead of waiting for the Fed’s last meeting and “official” response? Instead, the  market essentially ignored the data, bonds sold off, and tech even rallied back to ATH in A completely contrarian move, because the market believed the Fed remained committed to low rates and QE forever, or at least until it was forced to admit that inflation might not be entirely transitory, as “J-Pow” just did, and much sooner than the market expected, IMO."
2021-06-19 01:01:51,stocks,"But what’s (realistically) the cure for out of control and ever growing deficit spending and ballooning of the dollar supply that should be sending the dollar the new lows, but isn’t for some odd reason? Inflation has two aspects,  economic and monetary, and can happen even without supply/demand imbalances in the economy, or even without economic growth (ie the dreaded “stagflation”) if the currency is being devalued — as it sure looks like the dollar is, or should be, anyway based on its fundamentals."
2021-06-19 03:00:26,stocks,"This is the time to be jumping into QQQ/QQQM. Earnings will continue to surprise to the upside. Even if there's another wave of Covid many of these companies will thrive. 

Fed basically said yeah, we have higher than expected inflation, but we're still not expecting any rate increases for at least a year. That's plenty of leash for a sector of the market that has overall been consolidating since late last year."
2021-06-19 02:45:30,stocks,"Australia did a study on the effects of QE on long term rates, with their QE being relatively larger than the US, and they found it lowered rates a whopping 50bps *max*.

You seem to hold two contradictory views. Are foreigners dumb for holding US treasuries with negative real yields? Low rates suggest people anticipate demand for dollars 30 years from now. Can’t they get better returns by holding their own currency against a deprecating dollar? Who is wrong here?

Global USD denominated debt is the problem. Whenever we get into a state where the global economy slides, we see absolutely huge USD credit expansion as the world anticipates inflation from the massive programs the FED launches, programs that are ineffective. That debt is the exact opposite of a treasury. And there is way, way more debt than treasuries. That’s all it boils down to. There is no inflation in the face of this debt. I won’t be too surprised if the 30Y goes negative in the next 5 years."
2021-06-19 02:46:57,stocks,"Check out mr. milkshake man, Brent Johnson. He was the first to really open my eyes on the deflation thesis."
2021-06-19 11:45:19,stocks,"Short dollar and short bonds is a very crowded trade. Fundamentals haven't mattered very much since 2008. Stagflation could happen  and is a signal for longer term economic  damage. The cure would be to reign in the deficit, cut QE, and raise rates, but the fed won't do that. Even though inflation will damage the value of the dollar you would rather hold a safe guaranteed to  lose less purchasing power asset than simply holding dollars or over valued stocks"
2021-06-18 20:09:18,stocks,"In March, for context, it was 0.10%.  I'm not sure that's a big deal at all.  At the end of 2018 when the Fed changed the rules and JPM screwed with everyone, it spiked to 6%.  That's a problem.  This is not."
2021-06-19 09:26:30,stocks,"PPP loans where given out to the tune of 800b, these were serviced by the banks and given to business.
These loans are being forgiven in mass sense about March when the SBA rolled out the new forgiveness platform.  
When they are forgiven the loan goes from an liability to retained earnings on business ballance sheets.  On the banks ballance sheets the loans goes from an asset to essential a liability as the cash is still in their bank but it is not a loan to the business anymore.
So now the banks need to find something else to do with all this cash.
Business are not borrowing as much because of the free PPP money they received, and supply chain and labor problems are delaying expansion plans because they can't buy the property plant and equipment right now do to chip shortages or hire more employees to run the property plant and equipment.
The mortgage market is slowing down too lack of inventory, and slightly rising rates. 
Banks will be stuck with the cash untill the kinks in supply chains are worked out ( 2 years)
But they can buyback their own stock on June 30th"

2021-06-19 10:15:26,stocks,Possible inflation? We just hit 13-year highs.  And why would a business want to hoard cash in an inflationary environment?

Wealth is very tied to luck but not with this guy, this guy would engineer holes to be better and then create a conglomerate out of it. I see this company popping big, if the ARM deal goes through this would be ""the"" semi conductor giant, let me explain:

GPUs are a nice niche and all (I work developing software that targets them) that will eventually become more and more used for everyday every person things as chips ain't getting smaller or/and faster, so the only thing that is not quantum is to parallelize everything.

Guess who owns the architecture that you are probably looking at this from? Yes ARM, those chips are very efficient and almost all the devices use those kinds of chips (as most devices are smartphones). 

So my DD is this you have a company that creates and foresees awesome products in the hardware sense while they have beautiful free software products that they develop as research to push the boundaries of the hw. You get quality (Nvidia) and quantity (ARM) and you literally own the market, even Qualcomm is very concerned if the deal goes through.

2021-06-19 02:21:59,stocks,"One of Intel's largest revenue streams is datacenters. They own majority share of server CPUs around the world.  And it's by a long shot.  

Honestly,  after 10+ years in IT Infrastructure Architecture, here's the truth.  

Intel is good at certain things,  AMD is good at other things,  ARM is great at one thing.  

If anyone says ""AMD is just better,  period,"" they're full of shit. AMD does much better than Intel in certain areas, but they get floored in other areas.  This has nothing to do with opinion.  The math is there to prove it."

2021-06-19 08:42:45,stocks,Hahaha ya right
2021-06-18 22:27:52,stocks,"That’s not true in the slightest. The actual software providing containerization in Linux cloud computing clusters (Docker, containerd, and podman) are all very underdeveloped / in active development in the ARM space, and cloud computing revolves around the deployment of containers. If your container software can’t speak ARM well for 99% of workloads, there’s absolutely no reason to buy ARM CPUs. I can’t speak for the Windows side (like AD or Exchange), but I do know that Windows for ARM has a very low rate of use."
2021-06-19 08:02:46,stocks,Lol no
2021-06-19 14:52:26,stocks,"Oh,  no one is calling anyone muggles.  This isn't a high horse thing.  Anyways,  

Intel's architecture is built to excel at single thread handling.  While AMD has significantly improved their single thread performance over the years,  Intel still leads on IPC (Instructions per clock). 

Now,  the really important part. Intel leads on IPC in regards to power consumption.  Intel does not use as much power.  This is why (1) most current game engines are optimized for Intel and (2) most datacenters use servers with Intel CPUs. 

It's also really interesting to see the Apple MI architecture showing up. Up until recently,  the industry built almost entirely around Intel,  AMD, and ARM; so we'll see.  

AMD has focused primarily on multi-thread processing and have excelled heavily at it for quite a while (going as far back as the Athlon series). More recently,  AMD has been focusing on the ""all around consumer CPU."" Ever since they moved to 7nm, they are coming very close to Intel on single thread as well. 

AMD uses a lot more power and it turn, runs hotter. While AMD kicks ass at multi-core, the power consumption is not ideal for datacenters since 99% of servers work in the business world are single thread processes.  However,  AMD excels in the consumer market for things like video editing and gaming+streaming.  While Intel can definitely do the job,  AMD is winning in that world.  

On top of this,  AMD has had a stellar PR run these last few years.

The interesting thing is that AMD TSMC 7nm is almost the same size as Intel 14nm +++, at least for node size,  gate length,  and half- pitch.  But the big difference is transistor density.  Intel 10 nm and TSMC 7nm processes both produce dies with approx 90 million transistors per sq millimetre and at 150MT/mm² for 7nm and 5nm (Intel's next flagship series is going to be 5nm).

The next aspect is consistency.  I can send you a couple of very lengthy,  detailed videos showing this (if you'd like). Intel wins at consistency.  What I mean by that is, when Intel says ""this processor gives you 2.8GHz,"" it will,  almost always, be 2.8GHz. We're talking 99.95%. 

In AMD's case, that same statement is more around 96-97% of the time.  While that number doesn't seem like a big difference,  consistency is everything.  AMD processors have been shown to downclock by estimated usage.  Is that damaging? No. But, consistency is very important.  HOWEVER

Overclocking. AMDs deficit of consistency is also one of its greatest strengths.  AMD has insane overclock opportunity and those unlocked cores are fantastic.  

My point here is that neither AMD or Intel is better than the other, overall.  They are better at different things.  You want  consistent, cooler, single thread power? Intel.  You want a multi-thread, hotter, beast of a machine? AMD. Are you a business owner looking to host your company servers? Intel.  You game and stream? AMD. 

Heck,  ARM architecture kicks AMD and Intel to the floor in some use cases too. 

It's all about use case. If anyone touts one over the other,  they haven't done their research. They're both great,  at different things.

2021-06-19 18:31:49,stocks,"What do you think about my simple investment analysis for rapidly moving stocks in which I analyze how a stock behaves after a ""rapid pricing event?""

I started analyzing the behavior of rapidly moving stocks, that is, stocks that have shot up in value by 10% or more or lost 10% or more in one trading day. 

I then analyed every single time that particular stock has behaved in its history when its share price has increased by 10% or more or lost 10% or more in a day.[For example, RAMP has decreased by -13.668% on June 11th.](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/RAMP?p=RAMP) 

I [noticed two things about RAMP when its share prices have decreased by 10% or more: On average, the next day, [there was a 100% chance that the shares go **up** in value the next day. Mhy caveat is that there are only 4 sample points.](https://imgur.com/a/X6p5Arc) Moreover, in aggregate, [on **average the share of RAMP after a 10% or more daily decline, increases in share price by 2.88% the very next day**.](https://imgur.com/a/X6p5Arc)

As an active day-trader, my first thought is to quickly buy up shares of this company because there is a very good chance that the shares will appreciate in value. Moreover, on average, these shares will jump up around 2.88% the next day. Moreover, [in one week, on average, the shares will actually increase by 7.13%.](https://imgur.com/a/ODXpcwS)

It’s growing so fast at the current price and is increasing margins so rapidly it can quickly grow into its valuation so people are willing to pay for it at current levels since in 1 or 2 years those prices would seems dirt dirt cheap. Learning how to value a stock can be difficult but as long as you have long term views and can do the math to figure out what it should become in 5 years, 10 years, and 20 years you really can’t lose if you stay strong as long as the company keeps performing well with no worrying news and just keep adding on every major pullback on the ones you’re still bullish on"

2021-06-19 17:59:08,stocks,"Yes.  He is 100% right.  I came to this conclusion as well for the following reasons:

  
1. Reverse repo market is a major ""WTF?"" red flag.  
2. Congress printing (and planning to print) ungodly sums of money. This isn't being done for fun; the elites MUST believe the economy is at great risk. You don't print trillions just for the hell of it.... they are trying to head something off.  
3. Inflation concerns, which I believe are overstated, usually mean people are hurting more than they lead on. (For instance, in 2008 before the crash, I remember everyone complaining about gas prices and how gas was ""making them broke""...)  
4. VERY strange supply chain issues that were occurring even before covid... lots of random goods simply randomly becoming unavailable in all sectors.  
5. Job market. We are being told unemployment is great and employers can't find staff it's just so amazing. I believe this is true for low wage jobs, but I think the job market is FAR worse outside of retail/food service.  
6. Decision to send ONE stimulus check wasn't unprecedented, but three in the same year certainly was... lots of talk about UBI and lots of people wanting it.... when people expect money printer to go brrrr, that's usually a bad omen.  
7. JP Morgan shoeshine boy story is in full effect - Seems like every broke friend/family/coworker that I know who has never saved money or traded a stock suddenly wants to trade stocks and coins.  
8. Stocks at all time highs (coins was at all time highs, and it's behavior recently is another red flag) and rapidly returning and remaining at all time highs during an unprecedented economic shut down/black swan event.  
9. Housing market is giving me massive flashbacks of the 2008 crash.  
10. Lots of strange behavior from the elites (Great Reset talk, World Economic Forum plans, global minimum tax being pushed HARD and FAST out of nowhere...)  
11. Yield curve was inverted last year.  
12. Debt levels (personal, government, corporate) are out of control.  
13. Talk of negative interest rates that just won't die and keeps getting revived in mainstream financial press (WSJ, Forbes, etc) almost as if they are preparing the markets for it.  
14. Anecdotally, people just ""sound like"" I remember them sounding like before the 2008 crash. Lots of people I know complaining about needing a raise, having bills to pay, etc."

They have no real prospects of bringing something new to the market that no one else provides.

2021-06-19 13:20:46,stocks,"Been considering buying KO myself. Obviously a solid company with popular products that not only isn't gonna go under, but is in fact one of the most dominant beverage companies out there. And of course they own many other beverage companies that manufacture just about every type of beverage out there. Great dividend stock too as you pointed out.

In the fairly limited DD I've done on it, the main bearish thesis for it is that this is a company that has been around for a long time and already experienced the majority of its growth, and will therefore see more diminishing returns in the future. Also, Buffett loves it because he invested $1 billion in the '80s, not yesterday.

I would counter the bears here though by saying there are numerous successful companies that have been successful for decades upon decades, aren't doing much more than continuing to be successful, and their stocks are still good investments. Plus, KO isn't just resting on its laurels. They are constantly acquiring new companies and expanding their dominance in their market and sector. And as you mentioned, their dividend is solid.

Bottom line: sure, buying KO in 2021 probably won't pay off like buying it in the '80s anymore than buying Amazon today won't see the crazy gains that investors who bought into it in the late '90s saw, but that doesn't mean that either is a bad investment that won't make you gains. It's the whole risk vs reward equation. At this point, both KO and AMZN are rock solid companies that continue to dominate. This makes them pretty safe bets, rather than speculative plays that might pay off handsomely if successful, but might also go under.

Making KO 80% of your portfolio probably isn't the best idea, but adding some to your portfolio probably won't end up being the worst investment ever.

Disclaimer here: I only just started investing last February, and am hardly an expert or a seasoned vet at playing the market, although I have become pretty obsessed and have spent a lot of time researching, studying, and learning. I'm sure many, many others here are more experienced and knowledgeable than me.

Personally, with the market currently seeming to be manic in trying to make up it's mind with where it's going to go and with so much uncertainty (are we reopening or will covid come back hard in the fall/winter, what impact will rising inflation have and when will it impact the stock market, can the market continue to go on a bull run after the incredible growth it saw last year despite the pandemic and the economic devastation that it caused, etc.), I'm hesitant to take many new holdings right now. I'm only investing as a hobby though, and don't have serious amounts of my money in the market and am therefore mostly thinking fairly short term with my investments. If the market tanks, for example, I'm selling all my holdings and will reinvest when the market starts to recover. Thinking longer term though and if I were more of your classic long term investor (like Buffett), I just fail to see much of a way that KO will be worth less five years from now than it is today, and again, it's a great dividend stock, which is also a major bonus for a long term investor.

TL;DR: There are much worse investment decisions than adding some KO to your portfolio in my humble opinion. I may well buy some shares myself."

2021-06-19 09:06:39,stocks,"I agree, the financial press (as someone who works in finance) has such misinformation and misinterpretations of events that you’d think they were on someone’s payroll. I digress. 

Interest rates will still be ridiculously low for any foreseeable future. For all of you people that will comment on how “discount rates will be now be adjusted higher in dcfs and thus PV should be lower, so we should sell sell sell” - low rates will continue to push people to spend and in my opinion this will give tech companies some level of additional pricing power. This will result in higher YoY growth for growth / tech names which will outweigh the negative impact of a marginal discount rate increase. 

Since feb, the sell off in tech and growth was, in my opinion, a panic caused under the guise of inflation 
 for the bigger institutions to buy back in at lower prices. Are we really that childish to think that big investors and the market as a whole literally changed its stance on inflation in a few weeks?"

Second, sbux absolutely will be able to take market share from all of the other coffee places that closed in the past year. Also they're shifting to more efficient stores and increasing mobile ordering, making them more efficient and lowering costs.

As for chipotle, it is rapidly expanding and had a ton of room to add new chains."

2021-06-18 22:14:07,stocks,"it sounds like your marketing division is having trouble  adjusting to the privacy changes for iOS. Of course your sales dropped because the budget isn’t being deployed efficiently. Negative sales and shrink in ad budget, well, sounds like companies will stop spending cash to advertise then? Lol no, they will adjust and redeploy the same budget differently.

Here is an excerpt from another marketer:

“I don’t think you need to worry about it too much. I’ll try to explain since I work as a social advertisement marketing manager haha. The privacy move from Apple has impact on the effect of remarketing ads. So for reference: our clients now need to spend more money to realize the same profits as before since targeting just got a little less efficient. So we are actually spending more ad money, not less. Also: the impact is only on a small part of the total campaign portfolio (depending on the client, but for us it is often like 20% of the budget is remarketing and 80% proactive campaigns). Besides that: large companies with a big ad budget will have advertisement bureaus like ours for example, who will know ways to still optimize returns (for example we can still remarket to people who we know are deeper in the salesfunnel because for example they’ve watched a video of ours on Facebook / Instagram for over 30 seconds)”

“You need to spend more money to get the same clicks for SOME ads, not all, yes. That is my point with the retargeting (often 20% of total budget or less) vs normal ads. But more ad spend means more revenue for Facebook. Most companies use Google as well as Facebook. Facebook’s MOAT at this point is that they are the cheapest for small companies for advertisement ánd they have a very well developed ad system. So yes, worst case scenario: If it becomes more expensive, these smaller companies will also be looking at Twitter ads or Pinterest ads for example. But I can pretty much guarantee that at this point in time, they won’t skip Facebook Ads, since Instagram and Facebook have so many users - they would be missing out on sales.

As for the sales funnel: You can actually eleminate people who have already made a purchase, but for that you do need the off-platform tracking. 
However: Facebook and Instagram are growing more towards ‘in-app’ / one-click shopping and try to do this on their own platform. On their own platform this will be possible once again.

But to dive into this even further: I can for example target a broad group of people with a certain ad setting and a brand video campaign (brand recognition) with a low cost to reach as much people as possible. After that I can target the group that has watched more than 30 seconds of the video (which is an indicator that they might be interested in the product, since they didn’t click away right away) in the past 5 days again with a conversion ad (for example a picture of the product). So the people I show this to, are more likely to click and buy than If we would have just started with only the conversion ad. Yes: If they have already bought, It won’t have any effect in terms of people buying, but as a good advertiser you’ll have to play with the settings to find out which works best for the target group. 
Trust me: Facebook Ads has one of the most developed advertisement settings out there (alongside with Google).”"
2021-06-19 00:07:22,stocks,"First of all, ios 14 only affect mobile advertising as ios. but i think your company is missing the point. gdpr, ccpa, ios14, and browser cookie limitation are all invented to prevent browsers and publishers from tracking visitors to their properties but each app, site will still be able to track some time of info from their 1st party data like login info. 1st party data is what all the agencies and client are trying to protect. If you know what i mean, look at the big 4 agencies, forming data teams by buying data companies cause they want to create their own targeting and measurement. ios 14 does indeed fuck up the measurement but online metrics has always been trash, I can easily manipulate the online metrics if i want to but does it lead to a sale? the true thing that online marketers haven't solve it how to correlate online to offline sales. Even if fb have less targeting, it facebook can show offline measurement that lead to a sale, ppl will still use facebook. With limited targeting, 2nd party data from google/facebook will still exist, clients and agencies can port their 1st party data into the platforms and do targeting. If all data cease to exist, still don't matter, build custom creative that align messaging through contextual or keyword contextual play.

2021-06-19 00:14:09,stocks,"Ios 14 isn't gonna kill fb or google, it's gonna kill the 3rd party little ones. cause ios 14 doesn't eliminate the scale of users that facebook and google has. There are other targeting plays that youtube and fb easily can do. Facebook and Google can do contexutal targeting.  Youtube has contextual dramatic line ups. None of this use data targeting."
2021-06-19 00:23:02,stocks,"You realize that TOF & BOF campaigns have different conversion metrics and that maintaining a ratio is key to keeping cost per acquisition in line.  

If the 20% of ads that have the lowest cpa stop performing and you are forced to spend more on the top 80%…your going to change that ratio.  

If the 20% ads can’t re-market to IOS devices based on >1 day FB history…and iOS is 60% of US FB…and let’s assume mobile is 75%…we’ll that’s 45% of user that are affected.  Actually let’s assume that 20% opt in - so that’s 36% of users affected.  Let’s use my company’s data that says Android users are 35% less valuable…well I think your going to see some cracks.

Facebook is a walled garden - so they have always kept the view thru and scroll thru (who say the ad or paused on it) a secret.  I believe that now they are being fed their own medicine by Apple.  However, I do believe they have more leniency on view thru conversions.

Btw, not trying to be a jerk.  I would love for someone who has your experience to poke holes in this.  Maybe my company is dealing with seasonal decline as well of impact of opening the economy from COVID.  

I also believe that companies that GET Facebook utilize the impressions more than just measuring last click.  However, if your last click cpa spikes and your not seeing the same lift in other channels b/c they impression quality is dropping - well, your going to cut spend.

Attribution software tells you which TOF campaigns provide the most impact to BOF campaigns.  When your BOF campaigns stop working…that means your TOF campaigns aren’t as effective.  You end up scaling the TOF campaigns down to just the most profitable ones.

Then the fun starts.  Should I shrink my business to maintain margin, or should I spend my way out of it to maintain top line revenue.  

Should I allocate my media elsewhere? but crap, there are only a few places I can get a lot of quality impressions for cheap that fit my demographic.  FB & YT are the top 2 IMO.  SEM & Pinterest are intent based, so hopefully they work (branded always works). Not sure if anyone is getting Twitter to work.  Programmatic media buying?  Maybe.  Hire affiliates to spam email…well that’s generally low quality but we’ll adjust payout to maintain margin.  

I guess if you’re venture backed you try and spend your way out of it.  Otherwise you shrink and wait it out hoping that FB is able to overcome the performance issues.

Does this scenario make Facebook more money in the next 12 months?  We’ll see - but I’m guessing that they may be able to keep it up for a while but they will have to lower rates eventually"

>What identifiers or data are governed by the ""tracking"" policy?
Any user or device level identifier that is used to join data from your app with data from *third parties* (including SDKs used in your app) for purposes of advertising or ad measurement or sharing with a data broker. This includes, but is not limited to, the device’s advertising identifier, session ID, fingerprint IDs, and device graph identifiers. If your app receives or shares any of these identifiers for the above listed purposes, you must use the AppTrackingTransparency framework to obtain user consent.

Think about it. If what you're saying was true, then I would need to allow tracking under ATT to e.g. my Gmail app on iOS14 to be able to access my emails. Why would the friend list be data that an app is allowed to collect and persist, but articles, posts or ads that I click or share would not be? ""Advertising purposes"" doesn't exclude the friend list as something unique here as I can be friends with the official Facebook of Coca Cola or Dollar Shave Club etc.

What FB cannot do, is to e.g. take your e-mail or phone number (or an identifier derived from either of those) and share that with a third party who can then also use the same identifier to link the user.

Can you quantify a bit more what exactly is the change that you are seeing in *your business*? Are sales down, or sales are the same but ad engagement numbers on Facebook iOS platform specifically are down? And if they are down, is it guaranteed that this per se will impact sales? I buy a lot of stuff based on Facebook ads but I usually browse Facebook on my phone and make purchases on my laptop. Also, I've read about users now saying they plan to reactivate IDFA on iOS14 because they prefer targeted ads.

My 2 cents is that you have to forget about Apple and their strategy. Since you are thinking of shorting the stock based on a bet that iOS14 will have a larger than anticipated impact on quarterly earnings, whatever Apple do (or how smart their strategy is) is not relevant enough (it would ultimately factor into a negative sentiment if earnings were surprisingly bad, but only the iOS14 changes themselves can impact Facebook's earnings).

Also bear in mind that Apple is not going to be able to compete with Facebook in social media platforms. I use iMessage and iCloud for communicating with my immediate family in the US whose device choices I control. But to communicate and share with my friends and extended family overseas, it's WhatsApp and Facebook. To communicate with the public, it's Reddit and Twitter etc. Same goes for Google and YouTube, Apple don't have the infrastructure to deal with 500 hours of video uploaded every minute etc. They could build all that, but it would not be a smart strategy. So whatever Apple do with ads, will be restricted to the Apple ecosystem and Apple users - which admittedly is a very large user base (I think iCloud has almost a billion users now).

So anyway, the crucial piece of information for this bet is how much Facebook's near term (next quarter) numbers will be impacted by iOS 14 (and also bear in mind, companies have the ability to fix and manipulate their numbers to an extent).

Lastly, from a valuation POV, Facebook is inexpensive. It's a 20% grower with 45% EBIT margins trading at a market multiple (or below market ex-cash). If you get the iOS14 thesis wrong and the general market keeps trending up, we could also see Facebook rip. Not saying this is likely, but it's a possibility."

2021-06-18 20:16:24,stocks,"I put off buying thinking they were overvalued too but what changed my mind is the market cap is only $9b, which is really low to me. Slack is a pretty comparable company to me and they’re at $26b. Atlassian, which owns Jira, has a market cap of $67b; of course they have many other products, but Jira is their largest.

It’s so damn hard evaluating some of these growth stocks because a lot of the traditional metrics don’t seem to apply. I’m not saying you’re wrong or anything, this was just something that jumped out to me.

I have a long term outlook on them though. I’ve been valuing companies higher that have insiders buying more too, so that was a big factor for me."
2021-06-19 19:04:13,stocks,"Great post. It looks like $ASAN's valuation is correlated to MNDY's IPO. I too was thinking Asana was like Slack's valuation earlier in the year, and am surprised it's been jumping so fast. This space is so competitive (e.g. Jira/trello, Monday, Clickup, Wrike), and there's always the threat of Google, Microsoft and Salesforce to expand their existing suites. I have a hard time believing this run up will continue, and have sold some of my positions at $40-$45, but it keeps going up! Will hang on for the ride, but am doubtful."
2021-06-18 21:15:28,stocks,"Those are good points. I guess my intention was a more short-term valuation, as I just didn't see this company as being quite good enough to run up that quickly and NOT fall back rather soon. It is too hard for me to tell if this is a long term product, but even if they are going to be a great company in the future, it seemed inevitable that there would be a short term pull back. I realize tech companies can lose millions and still be valued at billions, but their product didn't seem unique enough to warrant that kind of hype. I'd also say traditional metrics have mostly gone out the window for the entire market this year, so the whole thing seems like a dice roll, lol. I will admit that having the CEO buy a ton of shares was rather bullish and insider buys tend to make me feel better, but they are also obviously in it for the long-term. I wouldn't be ready to bet against ASAN over a year, but I feel pretty good about the next two months, at least."

They’ve been around a long time now and they’ve been used at 3 of my last companies over the last 10 years, there’s a ton of brand loyalty, which is why I decided to buy. It’s going to be a key product as more teams adjust to remote work now too.

One of my main concerns was/is that it’s still just a single product, so there’s some risk there if people switch start switching to Jira or Trello or something. If they decide to branch out to complimentary products I could see that going pretty well for them though."
2021-06-18 21:46:44,stocks,"I feel like that is both good news and bad news for me. Good that 3 companies have used it over 10 years, but bad that it has been that successful and still just stuck on one product that can be replaced rather easily. If nothing new comes out soon, I still like my odds at a short-term pull back. Maybe a new product coming up is why the CEO started buying so much recently?"

What you said above is wrong so please stop. The issues you are alluding to were resolved by science, literally, back in the 60s... more than 50 years ago. How do you think satellites work?

The problem has always been cost. Storage was too expensive, and for this to work on land, it needs to be interconnected which we already are.

Further, I dont think you understand how we even build our grid. Why do you suppose we get regional blackouts sometimes? You think its because of down lines? It isnt. You think they ran out of coal? LoL. Its almost always underestimating production. 

You see production is all estimates. We use history and such to predict how much to produce then we add another 10% to 30% or so to handle volatility and growth trends, etc. Its not a perfectly efficient system. Not with fuel based generators like coal or uranium. What do you suppose happens to all the excess?

So in other words, we had to figure out ways to make things work despite being imperfect. The solution was to overbuild. This is also how you handle solar/wind. The answer is to simply over build. You build twice as much generators and storage than you need and you add more as needed. In the past the cost was prohibitive... what happens when cost becomes trivial?

Sorry man but I cant see any future in nuclear. Its a total dead end. The only type of burn generator we will need is gas. Reason being is that we can store excess power in hydrogen as a alternative to batteries. We will have tons and tons of excess power so this would make sense. We already have that infrastructure and its even accessible to us peons with homes."

Dream team. 

&#x200B;

>It destroys the narrative that Gamestop is a particularly appealing place for executives to work. FAANG companies poach talent from each other all the time, but for Gamestop to do it the promotions have to be particularly enticing. I'm not saying that it's a mistake but Gamestop is taking employees who weren't super high up and giving them the keys to the company. It's a risk that may or may not pay off.

The head of Australia and the CFO of the North American division aren't high up? You're smoking something good. 

FAANG companies poach from each other, but it is much less common to be poached out of FAANG because they pay so well. 

&#x200B;

>LMAO its revenue grew nearly 45% over the past year, while Gamestop has been shrinking for the better part of a decade. I brought up Amazon because it's ultimately going to be Gamestop's main competitor if they truly want to transition to online retail.

45% growth in a time where almost every retail location was shut down so it had virtually no competition? Very impressive indeed, since the stock has been flat since last September. I ask again: Why would you pick up a company that has been trading flat despite \*stellar earnings\* since 09/2020? Their earnings have been insane compared to expectations, and it's flat? Their main growth phase is over. 

&#x200B;

>You should invest in them because you think four of their former mid-levels employees are capable of turning around a failing business into a rapidly growing one. Clearly, if Amazon's level of talent is as incredible as you seem to think, Amazon is going to be unstoppable.

Not mid-levels, If you run a continent, you're an executive, bar none.

&#x200B;

>Ultimately, Ryan Cohen is one man who created a very successful business in a space that had much less competition than online video game retail. That doesn't mean he is guaranteed to turn a completely different one around. He's also not even the CEO so it's difficult to say how involved he will be, but it won't be the same as with Chewy which he started from the ground up.

Not guaranteed, but I'd bet on someone with experience that took on a titan and won. He's literally calling individual customers about their orders. I'd say that is pretty involved. 

E-commerce and e-commerce are generally the same business. 

&#x200B;

>Uber is an extremely overvalued stock, but at least their revenue is rapidly expanding every year.

Uber's CEO also went on record that it may never make a profit and that its growth is slowing for the IPO, but it is still wildly valued. If your CEO warns of a company never being profitable, probably not an investable company, but you keep saying that it has rapidly expanding revenues.

&#x200B;

>This doesn't make any sense. They're trying to completely change their business model. The stores they are about to shutter won't even provide a capital boost because they're rentals.

No, they are adding to their current business model. They are shuttering stores because they are reducing their footprint. Reducing expenses by 21% yoy, and increasing revenue by 25% at the same time. 

No, they are adding to their current business model. They are shuttering stores because they are reducing their footprint. Reducing expenses by 21% YoY, and increasing revenue by 25% at the same time.

>Just going off of Finviz stock screener, there are only two companies in the Consumer Cyclical sector with a >10B market cap that have a greater P/FCF ratio than Gamestop. One of them is amusingly Chewy, which averaged over 50% revenue growth for the past five years and is currently profitable. The other one is Starbucks, which is one of the most solid businesses around when it comes to profitability. Even if you think Ryan Cohen and his four Amazon employees are enough to justify doubling the value of the company, it still isn't worth 50 bucks a share.

Their cash on hand and revolving credit facilities can take Gamestop \*Private\* at $35/share, so the business itself isn't worth a paltry $15 to you?   


You've also completely ignored a number of points I've made about Fidelity and Morningstar giving bullish recommendations for this company.  
The point is that Gamestop has a core business that will keep it afloat. This business is profitable enough to pay dividends when desired, and the new ventures are going to be more than enough to bring Gamestop to a new level.

One more quarter of similar earnings and they technically qualify for the S&P 500. 

&#x200B;

You may not believe it, but looking at the hard facts, this is a solid bet for a pivoting company, and zero debt with over $2 billion in cash with executives familiar with the best of e-commerce are probably the ideal execution team.

look for $600+/share at 75 mil outstanding within two years. I'll put money on it, and I already have."

>And no, I'm not particularly impressed at all by the Amazon hires. The two people who were relatively high up in Amazon were brought in to be the CFO and CEO. Still massive promotions for both of them.

Mid-level, now ""relatively high up'. Keep pushing those goalposts.

He was pretty close to the top levels of the CFO ladder. Where would he go if Amazon's current CFO isn't leaving anytime soon?lment centers doubled under his tenure, a far cry from \*overseeing deliveries\*. Put some respect on the position, even if you really don't like GameStop.

Mike Recupero was the CFO of the following during his tenure during various times:

* Chief Financial Officer of the North American Consumer business - 6 months
* Chief Financial Officer of Prime Video - 1 year, 9 months
* Chief Financial Officer of the European Consumer business - 2 years, 6 months

He was pretty close to the top levels of the CFO ladder, so it's **not a massive promotion** but maybe he skipped a rung or two. Where would he go if Amazon's current CFO isn't leaving anytime soon? Oh right, out of the company to another company.

&#x200B;

>He oversaw deliveries, which is only a portion of Amazon's revenue, in a country of 25 million people. It's about 300 million worth of revenue, so obviously pretty impressive, but still a massive promotion.

He did run the continent for Amazon, hence country leader. also, [Amazon cracked $1 billion in Australia as of February.](https://powerretail.com.au/news/amazon-smashes-1-billion-revenue-mark-in-australia/) Again, you aren't giving anyone here enough credit, OR you're trying to spout off random facts that you aren't googling to make sure. It's not a good idea to do that.

To sum up:

1. What is a better source for analyst ratings? 
2. Two rungs from the top of a company to the top of a much smaller company isn't a \*Massiff promotion\*, In fact, I'd say it is a step above where he was at.
3. You straight-up lied about amazon's Australian revenue, saying it was 30% of what it actually is just to make your point prettier.
4. you haven't responded to this question: If Gamestop has enough cash and lines of credit for $35/share, why do you think that the \*entire company\* is worth only another $1.125 billion. I'd say you should be able to value a company at 2x its cash at minimum. @$70/sh
5. You still haven't responded as to why I should invest in a company that demolished earnings but is trading flat. Amazon's earnings blew expectations out of the water, and it hasn't really moved since September. Not a good sign.

I joined because it’s associated with my bank I join everything is easy to see all accounts credit cards every thing is there on one screen to see.
But I truly hate using the platform it a 20 minute pulse delay on everything if you use Flight desk is so complicated to use.

I had the same problem I forgot to switch over to USA FUNDS ,so know I have shares in same company in Canadian funds and USA funds. 
I did talk to one person only  only because they called me to settle on cash when I first joined them I guess i didn’t keep track of the settlement day. So they sold my stock I was pissed. I didn’t even know I used there funds in the buying power.
Until they sold my stock. Unbelievable no communication at all no explanation of anything they basically forcing you to buy and sell so they make there money they are not here to make us money they are 100% out for them selfs so they make a living being a broker forcing you to sell so they get paid.
It’s disgusting my opinion.
If it wasn’t for being associated with my bank that I’ve been with for many years I would’ve left along time ago.
2 months only and it’s been hell dealing with them.

Days or weeks later if they do reply back by email they say of you you have any questions regarding trading call our 800- number What da fuK 🤬 REALLY!

They will sell their assets with lower rates of return to invest more in assets with greater rates of return. This creates an equalizing force. Because of this, any asset claiming to have a greater return rate - after adjusting for risk - is assuming one of two things: an irrational market or special inside knowledge. Since both of these things are very rare and hard to prove - and get adjusted for in the market once proven - any asset claiming to reliably return more than about 7% per year - the market average - should be faced with skepticism.

When I'm confident in the stock, I do much bigger plays, 20-60% of portfolio and I ride it out.  Mostly GM, AAPL, MSFT, AMD.  I have full confidence in those so I'm not scared to hold for a few weeks. This has been working extremely well, better than I ever imagined

2021-06-18 20:39:46,stocks,"I got absolutely burned in hopes of a bull run on CLOV. As a newcomer, I read the DDs about the company itself and it's SI. While known as a meme stock, I believe it has short and long term potential. I got so caught up in the perpetual idea of a potential gamma or short squeeze I made bullish calls. Mind you, I'm very new to this so I don't understand a lot of things going on. I watched the ""indicator"" or whatever and Everytime it hit 10k shares left to borrow.. there was somehow another 500k shares to borrow out of nowhere that were used to drive the stock down with absolutely no volume or buy power to counter it. From my tiny bit of knowledge, had the stock price flourished to 15 or above, massive calls would've printed and shorts would've been in huge trouble. Apparently betting against the house was unsuccessful. But I learned alot. 

1) it's time to do some more research on calls before continuing
2) I can't get into a desperate circle of chasing my losses 
3) as I'm new to the stock market I realized I am not ""investing."" I'm gambling doing this. 

I know this was a long answer. 

TLDR: I lost about 1500, which is a lot compared to my salary. I'm going to learn and do more research before I buy options. I'm still optimistic about learning more - but I made emotional decisions instead of rational ones and that is why I lost money and someone else made it."

2021-06-19 15:50:44,stocks,"It's crazy to think this company will earn about $3 per share just this quarter!  Analysts are estimating another good quarter after this too.  The level of cash they are cranking off is amazing and any spike back up in lumber (it's hurricane season) just would be a further bonus.  Also the WSB traders should notice it and view it as a hidden weed stock play with their Toundra Joint Venture where they pump CO2 from their paper plant to greenhouses for cucumbers.  They have more greenhouse space than $TLRY does in Canada and this is surrounding one plant, much more room for expansion for this to other locations, but could be used for cannabis production."
2021-06-19 03:33:18,stocks,"Whoops, you're right about the earnings, I was probably just in a hurry and grouped them with TAP.  My thoughts were that both TAP and BUD were trading at a premium based on their earnings.

You're right that coke and pepsi aren't exactly the same, but they're going to be in a very similar industry and offer something good to compare to.  I like to justify why I would buy a stock like TAP over coke - what makes it better value?  Coke and pepsi are trading at 26-32 p/e ratios, what makes BUD a better value at 64 p/e.  Buying good companies and holding is a good investment strategy in general, but I also don't want to buy a stock that is really overextended.  Will BUD's earnings recover to bring down the p/e, or will their earnings stagnate and their ratio is normalized by a falling stock price?  

All of the looking at ratios part of DD is meant to raise these sorts of questions.  The next part of through DD is to look at company itself to see how they plan to meet or exceed their goals.  Make sure you buy into their story - try to understand how big the market is, how much you think it will grow, and/or how BUD plans to capture market share.  


'I won’t waste my time trying to look any further forward than six months'

The market itself looks much farther forward than this, so if you're discounting anything beyond 6 months you will be working with very incomplete information.  I know it's tough to think that far ahead, but if a company sees sales stagnating 3 or 4 years down the road, the stock will absolutely drop.  

'I won’t hesitate to sell for short term gains and possibly buy back in later'

This is a very different kind of DD, and the vast majority of people who do this lose money."
2021-06-19 11:35:38,stocks,"You will never convince me that looking further than 6 months forward is anything more than a guess. I’ve witnessed too many such forecasts that were completely off the mark. Most of them forecast a better future than what actually happened, but there have been a few where the future was much better than predicted. This year alone with AAPL even my way has been better. My mistakes this year, mostly, have been caused by paying far to much attention to analysts. I won’t make that mistake anymore."
2021-06-19 13:36:37,stocks,"Not really trying to convince you either way, we just have different outlooks.  It's one reason why sharing dd is tough.  When I'm looking for a company I am looking at current valuation but I'm asking myself if their earnings will beat the market avg over the next 5 years.  Stocks will fluctuate short term based on sentiment, but long term stock prices follow earnings.  Look at AMD - when they've had positive news they've climbed to 85, and other times they fall to 73.  That's a decent change on not much actual news about the company.  I could try to time it, but most people who try that lose money, so I buy and hold.  Add to my position when it drops because long term I see them being worth much more than they are now.  

Because of this outlook, I dont tend to take a lot of risks with my investments.  I'm over 50% sp500 + total market fund.  I'm then 20% into some big individual stocks that weigh heavily in those trackers (aapl, msft, Amazon and adobe).  I've got a couple video game stocks and a couple semi stocks as after researching them I think they have a chance to outperform the market longer term.  

My one real flier of a stock is mastercraft, a small boat maker.  I spent about 4 hours reading up on them and the current boat market before investing anything in them, and feel pretty comfortable with where I'm at cost avg wise.  If I thought one of these got really overextended then I'd sell, or if I lost confidence in the company I would sell.  Other than those, I'm comfortable with letting the companies grow their earnings over the course of years.

If you're trading a 6 month time frame, you're really just trading short term sentiment and that's more akin to gambling than investing.  Nothing wrong with that, but it's a much different DD than I do on my stocks.  The one thing I'd say is try to recognize when hype is already priced in.  Yes alcohol sales could jump this summer, but the real question is are those expectations already reflected in the proce of bud and tap?  That's for you to decide"
