2021-04-15 19:40:22,stocks,I know that it’s ICLNs 2nd largest holding and they are going to or are already in the process of rebalancing to include more tickers. Today PLUG traded more than 2x its daily volume. I wonder if there was some ETF selling going on there.
2021-04-15 18:58:10,stocks,"I think it is going through a healthy rescaling period. It shot up dramatically when Biden took office and it needs to even out a bit. I would stay for the long haul. I'm invested myself. 

I haven't heard of anything negative re ENPH. Maybe someone here has more info."
2021-04-15 19:12:07,stocks,"Not just ENPH, but many clean energy stocks / ETFs especially the solar sector are going at a downtrend recently (ICLN, TAN, STPK...etc).

Like the others said, last year's large growth plus Biden pumped them really hard and now people are cashing out / moving the money elsewhere.

If long term I dont think this is a huge worry, but I am not really seeing any catalysts improving the overall sentiment anytime soon."
2021-04-15 19:54:54,stocks,It is just a price correction. ENPH is pretty safe and they are leading solar invertor and battery sector. I don't have a position but will open one soon.
2021-04-15 18:34:19,stocks,Can someone tag me if they have a response for him? Also invested in enph but got in at 20$ by chance and wondering if i should cash out now
2021-04-15 19:45:38,stocks,Maybe. Thanks for this info. It definitely helps. Institutional trading could definitely have impacted prices this way.
2021-04-15 19:16:16,stocks,Thanks

2021-04-15 19:00:54,stocks,Buffet dumped all his J.P. Morgan don’t know if that matters but unloading a huge positikn
2021-04-15 19:52:04,stocks,"Buffet dumped 100% in a couple banks iirc. Could be a retaliation withdrawal from bank employees or people pulling partial shares to play with other things knowing the value will always be there to bank on. Could be people use BRK-A as bank for better interest.
Edit:
JPM
B&T Bank
PNC
All 100% sold"
2021-04-15 18:45:12,stocks,Some cheeky fuck probably went long A short B to buy a shitload of voting rights on the cheap. Given the recent premium evolving on the A's that would make sense.
2021-04-15 19:53:32,stocks,Wouldn’t pay any mind to it. It’s likely just large share holder who wanted to offload some or a whale wanted to buy in
2021-04-15 18:22:51,stocks,"that's what i'd think if it wasn't for the stock barely moving, only 0.44%"
2021-04-15 18:23:20,stocks,"perhaps, but that would more likely explain a jump in price. this is just a massive jump in volume. imo"
2021-04-15 18:28:00,stocks,"Unusual stock volume difference to come across. Why did you find it?

I look at volume compared to averages but mostly at stocks currently at all time highs or near lows. Part of my attempt to find stocks that're overpriced or under priced."
2021-04-15 18:32:47,stocks,it was just pure dumb luck. i don't ~~even~~ have enough to buy 1 share. went to look at it because knowing what 1 share costs is a bit of a party trick lol
2021-04-15 18:49:17,stocks,Remind me not to go to those parties lol
2021-04-15 19:00:31,stocks,Lol more like a fun fact than a full blown trick

2021-04-15 18:38:25,stocks,"Be *very* careful with securities. 

If you charge for money for this advice, yes, that would certainly be illegal. 

Note that because of their “expert” status, people who offer advice are typically held to a higher level of scrutiny and liability, should a lawsuit ever arise. 

2 quick tips to cover your ass:
1. Always use a disclaimer
2. Sit down with an attorney"
2021-04-15 18:26:16,stocks,"People give advice all the time on reddit, we aren't in jail yet."
2021-04-15 18:15:09,stocks,All you gotta say is “this isn’t financial advice”!

2021-04-15 18:10:19,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-15 19:35:51,stocks,"You may or may not have to register as an investment adviser.  In any case a disclaimer would not be a bad idea.  The following letter may provide some insight.  It is the SEC response to someone with a website who wanted the SEC to assure him he was not required to register as an IA.

[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2015/jonathon-hendricks-012615-202a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2015/jonathon-hendricks-012615-202a.htm)

A relevant section:

>Section 202(a)(11)(D) of the Advisers Act excludes from the definition  of an investment adviser a “publisher of any bona fide newspaper, news  magazine or business or financial publication of general and regular  circulation.” The United States Supreme Court has interpreted this  “publisher’s exclusion” to include publications that offer impersonal  investment advice to the general public on a regular basis.[\[4\]](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2015/jonathon-hendricks-012615-202a.htm#_ftn4)  To qualify for the section 202(a)(11)(D) exclusion, the publication  must be: (1) of a general and impersonal nature, in that the advice  provided is not adapted to any specific portfolio or any client’s  particular needs; (2) “bona fide” or genuine, in that it contains  disinterested commentary and analysis as opposed to promotional  material; and (3) of general and regular circulation, in that it is not  timed to specific market activity or to events affecting, or having the  ability to affect, the securities industry.[\[5\]](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2015/jonathon-hendricks-012615-202a.htm#_ftn5)  A person who provides advice about securities through a website such as  the one described in your letter could similarly qualify for the  section 202(a)(11)(D) exclusion, provided the three criteria listed  above are met.

That would seem to give you a lot of leeway for running a website that does not cater to individuals' specific situations."
2021-04-15 19:58:45,stocks,You will definitely be locked up if you give your  personal opinion to random people on Reddit who are not paying for you to give them financial advice. So be careful.
2021-04-15 19:24:26,stocks,Always put in a disclaimer that ‘ “THIS IS NOT FINANCIAL ADVICE”!
2021-04-15 19:10:43,stocks,"Good advice, thank you!"

2021-04-15 18:11:55,stocks,"So I saw that about compensation, and I’m not looking to be compensated at all. The disclaimer would be exactly what you said, just that those are my own ideas and my advice should not be taken as conclusive fact lol"

2021-04-15 19:17:24,stocks,This stock has seen a 7X increase in share price YoY...
2021-04-15 19:45:35,stocks,Let your winners ride. Relative prices should be dismissed when the financials and outlook are strong.
2021-04-15 18:14:48,stocks,"I’m going to lay out the bull case here:

1. Solar is a cheaper source of power than natural gas, and will dominate new installations over the next few years.
2. MAXN crushed EPS
3. MAXN generated >$844 million in revenue in 2020, which is currently larger than its market cap ($780 million). Though sales are down from 2019 due to COVID (also note it was the same company as SPWR in 2019, it has recently split off from it)
4. MAXN panels are considered the most efficient panels produced today

The bear case:

1. All solar is overvalued
2. Q1 guidance is poor, and they know a lot about Q1
3. 16% dilution of shares

The 16% is the most tangible to me, since MAXN undersells itself on guidance all the time. The question is what is the price point that 16% comes from. Is it $30 a share? $28? $24? These are all share prices from the past two weeks.

For solar in general, I can't help but notice the price action is similar to highly speculative hydrogen stocks that aren't profitable yet. Perhaps all solar is overvalued, but I think it's more likely they are in the same basket as far less secure companies. The also all have very high short floats (\~25% or so)."
2021-04-15 17:36:18,stocks,I bought it at like $40 and sold at $55 before but I always liked the company I just had a feeling it was going to pullback at that point. Really happy I sold when I did lol hearing it's at $19 def makes me want to buy more now
2021-04-15 18:37:47,stocks,"I bought October $22 calls two days ago. Ugh. While I can't time the bottom, I feel this is pretty close. I'm still hoping I can at least break even at this point. The bid/ask spread is probably so wide that I can't sell. This amount of money that they're raising makes me bullish that they want to rapidly expand. Even the last time NIO had an offering, the stock went back up later that week.

Isn't the dilution about 23.8%?

$125 million offering

$18.75 million for underwriters

~$38 million for the 1.9 million shares to Tianjin Zhonghuan Semiconductor 

Divided by yesterday's market cap of 761 million, would be 23.8%? Or am I doing the math wrong?"
2021-04-15 18:48:14,stocks,Oof - I thought it all came from the same 125 million. Downside to the offering is larger than I thought.
2021-04-15 18:50:49,stocks,"Does it or is it all separate? That seems like an awfully large offering all at once, doesn't it?"
2021-04-15 18:59:29,stocks,"> The 16% is the most tangible to me, since MAXN undersells itself on guidance all the time. The question is what is the price point that 16% comes from. Is it $30 a share? $28? $24? These are all share prices from the past two weeks.

Also wouldn't it be current price and not the past two weeks, since they announced the offering yesterday and made no mention of anything being offered in the past?"
2021-04-15 19:02:17,stocks,"They mentioned they would raise equity to expand in the US during Q4 earnings. So my interpretation is some of this was priced in, but this year all I do is step on rakes in solar investing."
2021-04-15 19:14:30,stocks,"> MAXN (website) today announced that it is offering to sell, subject to market and other conditions, $125,000,000  of ordinary shares through an underwritten public offering. Maxeon also intends to grant the underwriters an option, exercisable for 30 days after the date of the final prospectus supplement, to purchase up to an additional $18,750,000  of ordinary shares offered in the public offering on the same terms and conditions.

> In addition MAXN has agreed to sell upto 1.9 M shares to TZS in private placement. TZS already owned 29% of Maxeon and they are increasing their position which is a very good sign.

While I’m bummed in the short term, raising money from markets for R&D is exactly what the stock market is a tool for."
2021-04-15 19:19:52,stocks,So is that about 23.8%? Or are the TZS shares a different class or won't affect the dilution?
2021-04-15 19:23:11,stocks,TZS is a large stakeholder - this is to avoid diluting their portion but unless they sell it won’t be in the float. The 18.7 million is optional for the next 30 days.
2021-04-15 19:28:41,stocks,"That's a little more bullish then and less dilution than I thought. While we may not get a run like last September with JKS, I'm hoping solar recovers over the next few months. It's been beaten down but has potential, especially if there are any additional rebates offered."
2021-04-15 19:46:04,stocks,"Yeah. For my part, I only invest in solar or other renewables, but that’s money I can afford to lose. I just want that money being productive toward the climate crisis instead of sitting in a bank. So the rational behind MAXN’s offering fits the purpose I have for investing."
2021-04-15 17:16:23,stocks,To gain 13b in captial in the short term while paying low interest rates on the debt over the long term.
2021-04-15 17:41:03,stocks,"The only way banks make money is by borrowing and earning a higher return than the interest they have to pay. With interest rates low, my guess is JPM thinks rates will rise, so they are locking in cheap loans while they can."
2021-04-15 19:19:27,stocks,It’s an incredible inflation hedge.  Take out $13B in debt while the government is printing money? No-brainer.
2021-04-15 17:21:08,stocks,"But why would they want short term money now, especially after great earnings? More curious than anything"
2021-04-15 17:58:09,stocks,I guess I’m confused on what a bond sale is.. by selling I took this as they already had money invested somewhere and were selling so now I’m really confused lol anyone can explain to me simply :/
2021-04-15 17:51:04,stocks,"Bang on, plus if there’s a big market crash in the next year or so they’re gonna want as much cash on hand as possible"
2021-04-15 17:43:57,stocks,Dont they need to up their cash position cause of the SLR?
2021-04-15 17:24:07,stocks,"I'm not sure they probably have a plan for it. Loan it out as a mortgage, car loan, they're definitely doing something with it. One can do a lot with 13b in Capital. Maybe purchase smaller banks to grow? Plenty of speculation to be had."
2021-04-15 17:24:54,stocks,Probly getting ready to buy more stuff
2021-04-15 18:01:00,stocks,[deleted]
2021-04-15 18:01:19,stocks,"Basically selling debt. 

They'll raise 13b by selling bonds which indebt the company to the owner of the bonds. The value will fluctuate with the par value and interest rate. They will also have a term to be paid back in."
2021-04-15 17:49:50,stocks,Preparing for the inevitable market crash that’s coming
2021-04-15 18:02:51,stocks,Ohh I gotcha so just literally a loan I see. I was like if they are selling bonds that means they fear a interest rate rise and that makes zero sense to their first statement about rates being low right now haha now I see they just borrowing the cash on low rates
2021-04-15 16:42:14,stocks,Big news. Long on dkng. Looking forward to their earnings. Price target $100-$110 by EOY.
2021-04-15 17:14:22,stocks,"Wished I never sold my 1k shares, cost avg @29/share a few months ago.   😩"

PSFE I think works with dkng on payments/wallets

2021-04-15 18:30:35,stocks,"They gonna start the take over on the sports betting with that deal.  That’s what you call executing a pipe dream.   Prelude to bigger things to come.

Bootload of cash and very little debt.  Revenue keep growing, profit is just around the corner.

2021-04-15 19:14:10,stocks,"I agree but still see the price sliding from here. In the end being the official betting app for the NFL doesn't give you that much of a leg up. They are also burning through money, hopefully betting opens up in more states by football season."

2021-04-15 18:37:22,stocks,I had it since DEAC well before the SPAC craze. COVID effected me economically and it was one of the first to go. Now am back up to 50 shares of BETZ at least. I'm hoping BETZ is better long term.
2021-04-15 18:27:28,stocks,Why did you
2021-04-15 19:06:21,stocks,Me too LOL!!!
2021-04-15 19:26:58,stocks,"You can always use options to “hold your place” until you can get the money together without taking a loss.  

For example, i had 300 shares of PLTR that I had to sell because I’m getting work done on my house. 

I sold my shares and bought $23 July CALLS. 

once I have the money to cover 300 shares at $23, I’ll be able to exercise my option and get my 300 shares back. 

If the price has skyrocketed, I can sell the calls and use the money to lower my cost basis on the stock. 

If PLTR plummets, well at least I limit my exposure because i can only lose what I paid for my options."
2021-04-15 17:46:53,stocks,I would do what your username says and hold draftkings long-term.

2021-04-15 17:40:53,stocks,I'd add Palantir into that category despite being considered a meme stock. I have positions in both with the intention of buying and holding and not touching them for years.
2021-04-15 18:15:29,stocks,"(Not an American)

Is gambling completely illegal in California? Or just online? I’m a Brit where every pub has a slot machine and betting ads are on TV so really alien for it to be illegal"
2021-04-15 18:06:30,stocks,"I think those two deals go hand in hand. They were announced roughly around the same time. Genius Sports has the exclusive rights to collect and distribute the NFL Data. Genius Sports will be supplying the data through their feeds. These feeds make up the majority of DKNG’s in-game gross gaming revenue (GGR). Since DKNG signed an agreement with Genius, they’ve shown exponential growth in their GGR. (Check their earnings/presentations I don’t remember the numbers)

For reference, in 2018 NCAA formed a 10-year partnership with Genius to build and implement NCAA Live Stats. This data system, mind you, includes March Madness. The terms of the deal allows them to hold the exclusive license to distribute their data to third parties. Think CBS, Turner, etc. So now, Genius Sports gets paid by implementing these live data feeds from the leagues (NCAA, NFL, EPL) and they get paid to distribute their data feeds to Draftkings, William Hill, etc.

Draftkings doesn’t create these exclusive feeds and data, rather they now expand their partnership with NFL (So did Caesar’s entertainment and FanDuel FYI) and can implement their product on NFL Media Properties (think NFL.com and the NFL)  App). But now since they’re exclusive partners, they will be using the league’s official data feed (Genius Sports). And these data feeds are how DKNG gets their odds. 

I don’t think Draftkings wants to go in to the business of creating their own data right now, as the current big players have signed multi year, possibly even decade long deals. But in 7 years from now, they might!"
2021-04-15 18:39:28,stocks,I am holding the BETZ etf as a long term investment. I set and forget and DCA on it regardless of price action.

2021-04-15 18:23:48,stocks,I found out about dkng a while back from wallstreetbets and for the longest time I thought it was a joke ticker. Literally thought they were saying donkey kong stock to the moon so I just laughed and ignored it.

2021-04-15 19:19:16,stocks,Theyre using their money to expand their business and advertise. Thats a solid growth strategy. Better than holding money and not making acquisitions and partnerships.
2021-04-15 18:59:15,stocks,Maybe because they wanted to take a profit?

2021-04-15 18:05:01,stocks,"Based on what? Year, 3 years, 5 years? Palantir is a bit of an enigma when you consider they're the only ones who do what they do and it's hard to forecast growth. I will say it will be an extremely sticky service though once implemented.It's also not a stock I'd want to try to time given how lumpy new growth will likely be. Price will no doubt be turbulent for quite some time.

Edit: if you're going to downvote then tell me why you disagree. Valuing a growth company - which is what Palantir is right now - isn't an exact science.

2021-04-15 16:58:27,stocks,"Insurance Companies. More new homes -> higher need for home insurance -> because they are new homes less claims for a few years -> higher revenue 

Utility Stocks. More people moving from apartments and rentals -> homes -> use more utilities -> utility companies charge more per month -> higher revenue

Homebuilders -> speaks for itself 

Other mentions: pest control, lumber, hvac, plumbing, electricity, waste disposal, moving companies and truck rental companies, list goes on and on and on

Type any of those words into Google followed by “stocks” and pretty much every single one will see positive returns from the housing market boom. 

BUT, the housing boom isn’t a secret and the efficient-market hypothesis states that stocks prices reflect all available information, so the gains they are doing to make, or have made, are for the most part already priced in.

That, and when the housing boom stops, their revenues in the following quarters are going to look like shit by comparison as it’ll stagnate growth, who knows when that’s gonna happen, but it will. Just something to think about"

2021-04-15 16:38:21,stocks,Builders are slowing down or even refusing new contracts because the materials are too expensive. That will drive demand even more for sellers. I also don’t think Home Depot/Lowe’s are making more money from the high prices. As a home owner about to sell I stand to make a good profit. But I also planned on building a new home and now it’s too expensive. Unfortunately besides selling a home I’m not sure who is actually benefiting right now. Maybe realtors?

2021-04-15 16:54:41,stocks,"I do think DKNG is aggressively priced but I absolutely think it's warranted and I'm really high on the future of it and this industry in general.

I was reading that the estimated betting handle on the sports betting market between legal and illegal bets in the US was somewhere around $250B. Books make about 6-8% of the handle so that makes sports betting roughly a $15-20B industry in its current structure for revenue. Mix in Canada once they approve single game wagering and the growth from exposure and having betting widely available and I would not be shocked if that number doubles if not even more once legal widespread betting is available.

Also I love the groundwork that DKNG has laid, earnings has been mostly held back by advertising and promotional costs but it's clearly paying off. DKNG has heavy market shares in a lot of newly expanded states. Mix that in with the NFL Deal, talks for a deal with Action Network, and all the other deals you referenced, it's a no brainer to me.  I believe will ultimately end up being the #1 Sportsbook in the US with FanDuel being a close second and other books like Barstool and MGM being formidable and getting their share.

I came into investing into this industry with a blank slate in terms of who I wanted to commit my money to and just firmly believing this industry was going to be huge. DKNG has impressed me more than everybody else thus far and by a pretty good margin

EDIT: I can't believe I forgot to mention the Dish deal. I think the next big jumps for this industry are venue sports betting and integrating live betting into viewing experiences (like what I believe Fubo is starting to work towards). DraftKings is potentially getting to the forefront of the latter with the deal with Dish."

Although I will probably add some of that stock when it gets spun off and direct listed. 

In at $54  and $64.   I see $80-85 by end of first quarter 2022.  Massive growth in this market with increasing legalization.    
I eventually see them getting bought out by someone the likes of  MGM, Sands, Ceasars, Wynn."
2021-04-15 16:11:31,stocks,The recent dip makes no sense to me. All DKNG has done is win in 2021 but it’s trading barely over where it was at the beginning of the year. I bought more today

However, I've been following his Twitter, and a lot of his opinions are flawed and problematic.  I don't trust him anymore, however he is a billionaire with some solid connections.  Money begets money, so sometimes his spacs do well.  However, I don't trust him anymore to be forthcoming.  In regards to Virgin Galactic, I believe the company will do well in the long run, but it's obviously going to be about another six months before that happens.

Fact is it never stood a chance. No matter how good you build a rocket the failure rate is anything from 3%-10% As for the idea of supersonic flights, that too isn’t feasible for a whole set of other reasons.

The guy doesn’t even have that amazing a background. Don’t get me wrong, he’s way richer and more successful than I’ll ever be - but in his book “[] Billionaires” Ben Mezrich says Chamath’s “claim to fame at Facebook had been growing their user base - which during Facebook’s boom was like taking credit for the sun coming up in the morning”

So yeah he’s smart but not that smart, just was in the right place & right time at Facebook. How that qualifies him to be some “expert on everything” I don’t get - you’d think from reading Reddit that he’s a younger version of Elon Musk (which he certainly isn’t)"

If people bought SPCE because Chamath went on CNBC and started pumping it, its still on the investors for buying in the first place regardless who says its a great idea to buy.

He was asked about his political aspirations and I thought he was very careful about not saying his mission is specifically to do ""good"".

Don't forget that SpaceX rockets explodes more often then not. NASA shuttles were routinely delayed for weeks, sometimes months. You are right that they probably overpromised (they are now less active on social media for this reason) ; still, it has a good shot at being the first private company to do space travel.

2021-04-15 15:58:19,stocks,Every stock I’ve bought that was recommended as a pick on Reddit has performed abysmally. Unfortunately incompetence and malice are incredibly difficult to separate so I don’t know if any of them were manipulations or not.
2021-04-15 15:57:14,stocks,"I think manipulation happens far more often at the penny stock level than anywhere else. You can trade in large quantities in lower dollar amounts so it's more accessible for investors. The way I see it happen is someone with a large following via social media, blogs, even reddit will buy a bunch of a penny stock then make posts touting it to a wide audience. Even if you get a handful of people to buy this will push the price up. Then the original buyer sells out their position for a tidy profit while everyone else hangs on to the penny stock. I think this happens every day as I see it regularly in people touting their success as a penny stock day trader. I do believe this is market manipulation as it's basically a pump and dump scheme but doesn't get much noise because it's on a small scale."
2021-04-15 16:13:27,stocks,"It's real, but not in the way Redditors often think. There absolutely are tricks both bears and bulls can pull to nudge a stock in the direction they want. The easiest one is stop hunting. Institutional traders know where the majority of stop-loss or limit orders are likely placed, and when the stock price is *very close to that level* they will sell or buy shares to push the price it over thst level, and trigger the orders causing the price to move even further in that direction. It works, but it won't cause massive moves in the price 


But hedge funds coordinating ladder attacks against retail investors to cause a stock's price to drop 50% is a convenient fantasy that people use to justify why a stock that they thought was a homerun moved against them."
2021-04-15 16:36:16,stocks,"> do shorts go out and try to drum up bear noises?

Yes but that's not manipulation. It's just talking your book, which is what everyone does. That's the reason people are required to state if they have a position in a stock when talking about it publicly. 

Manipulation, in that avenue - would be something along the lines of disseminating false information about a company.

It's good you're skeptical about the conspiracy theories, that alone puts you ahead of all those people, subbed to *those* subreddits."
2021-04-15 16:43:55,stocks,"The idea that investment funds managing billions and billions of dollars are risking it all in a desperate need to fuck over ""the little guy"" (even though retail investors are always just a small fraction of whatever share is being ""manipulated), through some convoluted stock manipulations, is just nonsense.

Pump-and-dumps of very small cap stocks are a real danger though"
2021-04-15 16:09:01,stocks,"Yeah, I attribute most of the Reddit picks (and probably many more brought in by the WSB stock) to buying in at the top after massive run ups in 2020. Stocks can't go up forever and we're riding the wave of stock and sector specific corrections down. It sucks, I wish I'd understood it more 2 months ago, but that at least makes sense to me."
2021-04-15 16:07:16,stocks,"I definitely think this happens- I was on the pennystock board a bit and saw the pump and dump all the time. I got burned a bit and decided I wasn't cut out for it unless I really like a company.

I think the ""this stock is great! buy it!"" then you sell as it peaks is definitely a thing. I am curious about people thinking shorts and others try to run stock prices down though- that seems much harder to do."
2021-04-15 16:40:10,stocks,"Ah, in that context it makes a lot of sense. I wonder if the trolls I see are people who have shorted individually and trying to take it down. I guess I usually think of institutions as shorting not individuals, but I guess individuals can too. And you're right, it's not manipulation if they're just putting their sentiments out there in the same way bulls are."
2021-04-15 18:52:10,stocks,"I don't think the big guys even notice us let alone go out of their way to screw us, but I do believe they manipulate markets ever so slightly to make more. Us small fish just get lucky or unlucky sometimes and get steam rolled or rich as a result. The meme stock guys over -----> there are delusional if they really think big money cares about their small fraction (combined) of the stock. They have absolutely no actual effect. They are just riding the waves up and down."
2021-04-15 16:39:03,stocks,"Ackman with Pershing definitely flirted with the line in my opinion with Herbalife stock manipulation. Don't get me wrong, I definitely believe Herbalife is a pyramid scheme. But when he has a massive short position, is sending in undercover folks to Herbalife recruiting meetings to record them, and actively campaigning against the business I think this could be considered a form of manipulation. Takes a lot of capital to effectively influence stock prices in a negative way and benefit."

I am talking about some slacker with a few hundred dollars of headroom on his credit card deciding to make a ""movie"" with a few of his friends. None them know anything about cinematography or lighting or screenwriting.  They cannot even afford to rent a tripod, and none of them can act.  No problem, they think, we'll make a found footage movie.  All we have to do is wave a cheap camera around and the fact the viewers won't be able to see anything will add to the experience.  The result is something that should be shown to family for a laugh, like a Camcorder movie made in a backyard during the 80s.  Instead they put it on Amazon Prime with cover art that makes it look like a legit movie.

Amazon has zero quality control.  In fact, it is sort like Amazon as a whole these days where it is hard to find legit products because the site is filled with rebranded Chinese crap."

I at least buy some stuff from Office Depot once in a while, but the stores that I totally can not comprehend are the mattress firm, literally there are three of them in a 3 mile radius around me, and may be 6 in driving range, who the heck buy all those mattresses, it is not like something people buy that frequently, but if they can stay in business I think Office Depot will survive"

2021-04-15 16:23:29,stocks,"Some general advice that I try to employ as part of my own investment process:

- The old adage that ""if you get the buying right, you don't need to worry about the selling"" has a lot going for it: whenever possible, I invest in companies that I ideally want to hold ""forever""
- I generally don't sell to ""take a profit"", I only sell when I need money for a better investment and when I do, I sell my worst investment / lowest conviction idea first (not the one with the largest gain or loss or anything like that)
- I avoid making investment decisions primarily based on tax considerations (this has never worked out well for me in the end)

In your case, I see the first two points in slight contradiction. IMHO (and I really hate to give you direct advice, but I will anyway), you own businesses that are not good long-term businesses even in good times. Some specific comments:

- DAL: the stock was *much* lower than it is now in 2016 after the Brexit scare of UK/US business travel impact. Doesn't that seem ridiculous compared to what state the whole industry is in now? It's a cyclical trade that could work out for a bit longer, but in the long run, this would be a poor business to own *even* if it wasn't drastically impaired by all the debt, dilution and labor etc. issues that will be coming when things finally (who knows when) return to normal for the airlines.

- BA: see above. The best bull case for this cyclical that I hear is that ""the government won't let them go bankrupt"". I'd personally rather own businesses where avoiding bankruptcy is not the primary concern...

- XOM: read some critical analysis on their ability to continue dividend coverage and debt service. You also own CVX (which is much better positioned) and CVX will benefit from recovery in oil prices and E&P when that finally comes (I believe it will).

To summarize: go over the businesses that you own, do the DD, figure which for you are businesses you want to be a long-term ""part owner"" of and which were just trades and then ""close out"" the trades. When you own a high quality compounder, ""nobody ever went broke taking a profit"" is stupid advice - but here it might apply."

The way I read the proposal was all capital gains tax will be raised to 43% instead of the current progressive tier of 15 and 20%.

Now Fubo is tanking but I’m getting returns on so I was wondering if I can close the monthly cc I have and take a portion of profit and then do it again.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Safe stock or ETF plays Hi all,

I been going through a rough stretch the last 2 months. I have been getting hammered with stocks like Fuel Cell, Plug, Luminar, SPCE, Fisker, Blink, Apha, Canopy, and Charge Point. Literally down about 25% on each. I'm down about 15k. 

Anyone have any advice on how to climb out? Are you holding onto any of the stocks above? Do you have faith in the EV industry and weed in the short term? I have been debating taking my losses and moving to VTI or FAANG stocks. 

Thoughts?"
2021-04-15 13:28:04,stocks,"When I decided to stop fucking around I pumped 30% VTI then went in about 5-8% on Home Depot, Costco, J&J, Diageo, among others. All stuff I know and love, up 3% on VTI and up 5%+ on the rest of them and they pay great dividends. You'll never get the sexy +10% days and probably won't ever even break +5% but I'm never down more than .5% and I've been up just about every day since March which has eliminated so much stress and headache."
2021-04-15 13:50:40,stocks,VTI and call it a day imo. There's a reason why most traders lose against the index. FAANG stocks if you don't want to buy into an index.
2021-04-15 14:22:43,stocks,"Ok, here is the thing. The stocks you have been buying looks like you scanned through the top posts of /r/wallstreetbets and bought those companies. This, in general, is a very risky plan. Especially buying companies in highly speculative industries like cannabis or EVs. 

Now, if you really believe in those companies, a 25% loss over 2 months shouldn't faze you. Two months is basically no time at all. Stop looking at investing as a month by month endeavor and start thinking years in the future. If you think these are good companies, you should be looking to hold them for multiple years. If you believe in these companies, and hold them, it is possible that you see them gain back your losses. 

If you don't believe in these companies, you should sell, eat your losses and move on to things you believe in.

There are a lot of comments suggesting buying AAPL, AMZN, or MSFT. However, you must realize that there is no individual stock that is 'safe'. Some are 'safer' than others, but ALL individual stocks have substantial risks. Even the bluest of blue chip companies can falter. Do I think it is likely for AAPL or MSFT to stay flat or lose value over the next few years? No, I don't believe that is likely. However, what if the newest iPhone is a flop? What if Azure is the victim of a serious security breach?

Buying ETFs is less risky, but still involves risk. Especially if those ETFs specialize in a specific sector. But, in general, they are less risky than individual stocks because ETFs generally hold many, many individual stocks and the performance of a single company is weighted far less as a total of your investment .

If you are looking for the safest investment, put your money in a high yield savings account. The next safest option is probably long term government bonds. The next safest option is highly diversified ETFs. ETFs like VTI, SPY, VOO, etc, are not devoid of risk, but will generally track the performance of market, are relatively stable, and generally go up over the long term.

If you are happy with market returns, putting all your money into VTI is a good, 'safe', plan. If you want to beat the market, then you'll need to invest in specific sectors or companies that you believe will do better than the market. However, anytime you 'tilt' your portfolio away from the market, you will either under or over preform the overall market. But, keep in mind, that on average, people cannot beat the market over the long term."

2021-04-15 11:18:48,stocks,"Everyone is in the same boat dude.
It depends on what is your strategy...
I usually put more and more money every month, with other sources of income, so if a stock goes down let's say 10%, then i average down, since I am averaged down, it won't take the 10% back to go back up... Like this, in a long run, you can get your money back, but if you have put let's say 10k aside and ia only gonna use this 10k to keep growing, it is much harder to recover the losses...

I bought PLTR in any price you can think of, from 20 to 35, i got to be around -15% in PLTR, now that I averaged down to around 23.50, i am breaking even this way.

In my opinion that is a safer way to recover your losses.

But if you don't have a second or third source of income to be covering the losses and trying to balance out, at the moment is very hard to recommend anything, since the market is very uncertain at this point."

Which ones would you not buy, because you no longer have confidence in the company?  Sell those.   I’m “bag holding” a few of those.  Plug for example, I believe in and am willing to hold for years unless something happens to fundamentally change my belief in the company.  FCEL, now that one I’m on the fence about.  I’m gonna do some more research and maybe sell, even if it’s at a loss.  Or if I think their current price is good, I’ll hold on.   Of course, this is just the speculative part of my portfolio.  The majority is in index funds (FSKAX).  Maybe hold what you have that you still believe in and sell the rest for a loss and buy either an ETF or an index fund?"

2021-04-15 15:40:30,stocks,"ARK is by far a better choice than investing on your own if you post about how rough it was, which refers to your trading skill.

The safest call is always to bet on the entire economy. The second safest call is to be on giants that are too big to go down, they will grow (or rather, stay) no matter what happens. And the third best call are ETFs like ARK because they automatically diversify your portfolio while not having to manage anything, meaning no selling leading to taxes on profits, and you know that the people behind it have the #1 goal of making money.

And if you weight this now by performance, then ARK takes over the safe bets like MSFT, AAPL etc. for me because while those are safe, they are slow. I fully agree that it's less safe, but I highly disagree that it's not safe."

2021-04-15 18:14:23,stocks,"I'm not nearly experienced or qualified enough to tell people what to buy but just use the most basic of basic strategies. Look at shit in your house, think about what's going on in your life, what you need and use FREQUENTLY then open a position in the market. For me: I'm a functioning alcoholic so I bought DEO, I watch stuff on Disney plus every day so I have disney, I buy food at Costco, hardware at HD, use cashapp so Square, got a honeywell thermostat so HON. Just right there I have exposure in entertainment, consumer goods, home building, fintech/crypto, industrials simply from looking at stuff in my house. Do that yourself and you'll be absolutely fine. 

On the other hand take a look at reddit hype stocks. You care about space exploration I'm sure but who do you know is actively participating? (SPCE) Would you be caught dead paying 60 bucks a month for streaming garbage? (FUBO) You or any friends going to buy a Chinese electric car you haven't heard of pre investing knowledge? (NIO) Literally why would you ever care about TSM when Intel and Texas instruments have their name on everything? Half the damn population doesn't believe global warming exists even in the current administration why would you throw your money at ICLN?

All that shit is completely speculative and maybe you make money on it eventually but you literally have no clue you ever will and the casual -10% is fucking frightening.

* Jobless claims falling has traditionally been associated with market rises. 2020 was a onetime exception

* Recruiting activity is off the charts right now. Recruiters are going crazy fighting over limited amount of hires

* Covid is still a major problem in many states, so you can't blame those on the sidelines for not wanting to go back to work where they are literally risking their life. There is no shame in taking government benefits to sit on the sidelines. That is wtf a safety net is for and I commend those who are being smart about protecting their family and not wanting to expose themselves to risk.

* Covid should start easing up once vaccine is available to the general labor force. Right now it's been given to those generally not working (retirees)

* Amazon, for all the bad labor press of late, pretty much consumes available labor in whatever market it's operating in. Employers will have to pay over and above what Amazon is paying to get hires."

The truth is the current unemployment and stimulus situation was specially designed to help people stay home so that they didn't spread covid. It has nothing to do with how things are supposed to work in a world where there isn't an active global pandemic. 

If people are staying home collecting government checks instead of going to work, the policies were effective because the goal was to slow the spread of disease.

If you want to argue that the policies hurt small businesses (which I agree with), you are going to have to take that up with your representatives. Blaming people for 'not wanting to work' is a victim blaming copout."

I am. That's why I'm doing the smart thing of not working some random ass job just for the sake of working, when I can collect unemployment and have the time and energy to job hunt. Just because you were a lazy ass until 25 doesn't mean I (or many other people) had that luxury. I've been busting my ass since I was 17 and was just finally in a good place last year before getting laid off because of the pandemic. You wanna know my life story? I'll give it to you if you want.

My point was that there could be ""now hiring"" signs on every business in town but for a lot of people, including me, it makes no sense to go work those jobs (unless you're doing part time to supplement your unemployment and save as much as possible, like I'm doing. But you're right I just gotta take responsibly for myself at some point....), so telling people ""yeah plenty of places are hiring!"" isn't meaningful.

College grad hires are more of an investment that pays off in the next 1-3 years, once they're trained and effective but still cheap.

Then when 2021 came around, they got their new budgets and started hiring again. I'm guessing you saw a bunch of new opportunities in January and interviewed by February."

The simple reality is, most people are very content making enough money to “get by” if it means they get to chill. 

Nothing wrong with that per se, but the government subsidies definitely aren’t helping the labor situation. 
I understand it’s a necessary solution and I don’t have any Better idea, but it’s basically making employers compete with the money printer.

If someone doesn’t have a job, liberals will be more likely to say it’s because they can’t find one, or that their wages are too low. Conservatives tend to say that they’re just lazy or leaching off the system. There is no way to tell on a macro scale what the exact reason for unemployment is. My point is that I also find it embarrassing to be unemployed, as do you, but not everyone does. I’ve known people who are content to work dead end jobs and collect whatever aid they can get their hands on indefinitely."

In a city it might be required to afford, but $15 an hour where I live is big money

There's also only so many construction jobs available, and many more young people who need work than the open positions available.

Union benefits are unreal - if you are able to get into the Union you have amazing health insurance, overtime, and a pension if you work enough time (10 years I think). I have worked with Union Electricians / Carpenters / Welders who are pulling down $150k-$200k per year or more including overtime. The demand for electricians and plumbers is so great that most of them work weekends for themselves and bring in even more money (usually not exactly kosher but everyone turns a blind eye)."

Food for thought though, how many people who got the enhanced unemployment and stimulus spent beyond their means and didn't keep up with bills? Once things return to normal and stimulus/enhanced benefits stop it is quite likely people will now expect or think they are entitled to these things. That is just a bad recipe for society. As much as people hate it money makes the world go round and you can't have a populace who doesn't work.

Edit: What we really need is a national jobs program that could work with unemployment so we get a return on investment. While some people do use it as a support to their next job there are many who abuse the system and stay on as long as possible. If we are financing it let's get them out collecting litter, cleaning graffiti, landscaping, etc. If you don't want to work one of these jobs while collecting unemployment then you would just receive a reduced rate."

2021-04-15 13:50:16,stocks,I still think minimum wage needs to rise everywhere. Then those in cities would pay even more than the minimum wage. The 7.25 has stagnated for over a decade. The purchasing power has diminished so much since the 70's and 80's. Both rural and urban areas need more buying power at the bottom end of the wage earners. We need more than the survivable wage. Survivable is not sustainable. Especially with social security and pensions disappearing for future generations. We will need more social safety nets.

If you are even reasonably smart and hard working you can move up very quickly. I hate to say it but 90% of the people in my class were losers. Had no interest in learning and were just bums. So that was my competition. Getting raises was easy when my boss knew the countless people he would have to go through to try and replace me.

I'll also mention that per the BLS, wages your mentioning are not typical.

Personally, I have mixed opinions on trade work. I think it can be a rewarding career alternative to retail/fast food/min wage positions or college. Several tradesmen I've known definitely paid the price with their bodies unless they transitioned to management. 

It'd be nice to see the US work program revamped to become more trade focused along with an expansion of vocational training in high schools."

The bottom line is — unemployment in most states is absolutely terrible. Imagine a breadwinner of a family being laid off & receiving $400/week? That’s what it is in my state at the highest. That’s not enough to sustain a family or put food on their plates (for most)... let alone pay the bills. 

The biggest issue were low paid employees who made MORE on unemployment then if they were employed still. That’s insane to me. But not as insane as making $10/hr at some shit job — so I can’t blame them either."

edit: Also, I’m normally the type of person that would feel guilty/lazy taking a government handout.

We live frugally though - don't eat out much, our car is paid off and is basic cheap sedan, smaller place than we could afford. We do take nice vacations, but they are supplemented with credit card bonus points which is a hobby of mine.

My point is that this is a field that people from a range of different backgrounds can find work - and that there are lots of jobs available in with good pay. When you extend that to the construction trades, you will find that we have a massive shortage of workers, which I am curious how that works out with the infrastructure bill that Democrats are hoping to get passed. Yes it will create lots of jobs - but as of right now those are the jobs that very few people want to take (even though most of them are very well paid). There is an unwillingness to work with our hands in the United States that has developed as our economy has modernized the past 30 years. The problem is, we have not yet automated those jobs away so we still need people willing to take them - which is why many of the workers in the trades now come from other countries and are not US born.

And for the record, I support a minimum wage of $15-$20, I think it is one of the most important things our country can do."

Again I’m not trying to bitch about the unemployment bonuses - when half of the country was forced to shut down, what can you do ?

I do think there should have been some kind of bonus to employees and employers that worked thru it. 

My business was “essential “ so we never closed. Same with many other stores, including all groceries. 
All those people had to go to work and bust their ass and never got a bonus, but anyone who chose to chill out for a year and not work got extra government help. 

I think the $600 and $300 bonuses should have been just straight payment to everyone - working or not. This way you’d still be incentivized to keep your job .  
The way the government implemented the bonuses basically encouraged people to go on unemployment."

My wife and I were just able to hit $10k with our savings for the first time (saving for a house) so we're pretty pumped!

That is, of course, assuming the person places ZERO value on having free time and less stress.

I personally know people who could have worked for the last year and have chosen not to. And I don't blame them, I think they'd be foolish to take a job when they could get paid just as much without the stress or various job-related expenses like gas/clothes.

So if a Dane is making $24 and an American is making $8, they’re taking home roughly $11 and $7 respectively. If the US increased the minimum wage to $12/hour, then we’d be at roughly the same level.

It's better to have it go straight into accounts you can't touch automatically then having it tempt you where you have to make the conscious decision of what to use it on each month.

For the American worker, those costs are all paid by the worker (employers in the US very rarely provide these benefits for lower level employees, aside from a partial health insurance premium contribution) and the cost to the individual often exceeds the difference in taxes paid (especially if they have children), along with the peace of mind and quality of life they bring.

You are right most loss is paper loss in terms of lost operating days and productivity, but there will be a real, tangible, product loss associated with this, and depending on wafer size, fab size, when in process everything was... it could be pretty darn high.

Even when their response to a prolonged series of technical failures was to promote an accountant, sell off one of their leading product lines, and downplay the issues.  The turning point though was when Apple's first cut at making clone chips for the Macs was so impressive.  That told me Intel's moat isn't as big as perceived.  

Their current plan - if successful - is years away from being realized.  And I doubt the competitors will all just stand still and wait while Intel is executing their catch-up strategy."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"$EXPI - Does it have a future? Originally, I was pretty bullish when it came to $EXPI - They beat the consensus EPS in 2020 in Q1, 2 and 3. 

I sold today, for a loss. I still like the Stock, I think it has a future, but, in the short-term, with the rate, it is falling I could see a price of $30 appearing by late April, early-May at this rate - perhaps lower! 

I was wondering if anyone here who is perhaps more experienced than I can help. What are your thoughts on $EXPI as a long hold?

2021-04-15 09:09:45,stocks,I liked it until it lost me and I’m sure a bunch of others some serious cash. I’m holding this POS at a 45% loss. I want to sell it but I’m hoping it gets a little love and I can get the heck out of it with a smaller loss. For me it was a real estate play since the housing market is on fire. The stock also got caught up in a crazy hype and I bit. There is significant competition from other companies which I think is what is bringing down the price per share. I see Expi having good growth in the long term. For now I’m holding it and might just make it a medium term hold in my portfolio. I’d love to hear some good news but I think it has more to drop.
2021-04-15 12:10:19,stocks,You locked in your loss by selling... I wouldn’t sell this stock rn
2021-04-15 10:03:51,stocks,">	I liked it until it lost me and I’m sure a bunch of others some serious cash. I’m holding this POS at a 45% loss.

To be fair, that’s kind of your own fault. 

If you lost that much, if means you bought at the peak of the runup after the aplit was announced. 

The value today is only a few percentage points off from the pre-split announcement levels. 

Disclaimer: i bought around the same time but my losses were heavily minimized by selling covered calls every step of the way. My first round had an insane $10+/share premium then finished out of the money. 

Now, i just make sure i have a strike over $75 on them so if there’s a run up i’ll at least break even on the shares (without taking all the cc premiums into account)"

2021-04-15 07:04:14,stocks,I think if GME breaks the 170$ resistance today then Friday it will go back to its 250$ to 300$ range.
2021-04-15 07:05:34,stocks,That would help my option out a ton to make a quick buck

2021-04-15 07:41:26,stocks,Its a junk option anyhow I was playing on selling pretty much as I turned positive on it making like 10 or 15 bucks.. its my first option I ever bought and am just playing around with it.
2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Working out the 'fair value' of a company I've been thinking that there are ways of figuring out roughly what the 'fair value' of a company is, but as someone who's not overly experienced with trading, financial markets, stocks, etc, I'm not sure what a good calculation would be.

Initial thoughts I had were that you can compare a company to similar companies - e.g. UberEats to Deliveroo and JustEat - and assess whether the value of the company is what you'd expect for a company in that company class with its EBITDA, revenue, profit, and qualitative markers such as brand visibility or culture.

I would use this method to invest in stocks in a company that I deem undervalued. So is this roughly the way to go? What other indicators are useful? And where can one find the relevant information?

This post was inspired by another which claimed that although Coinbase is impressive and has a positive outlook, the poster thought is was 3x overvalued. Interested to understand what sort of reasoning leads to this conclusion, since many use the simplistic heuristic 'If I like X, then X is undervalued' followed up by '\*positive features of X'."
2021-04-15 09:11:22,stocks,EV/sales is a pretty common one and an easy way to compare companies.
2021-04-15 09:17:07,stocks,DCF (discounted cash flow) is really the only answer here
2021-04-15 06:46:05,stocks,Most valuation methods are based on future earning but if there are no earning the it’s a factor based on sales.  For biotechs it’s a percentage chance to be approved x the possible sales of approved product.  Full on old school is what is your land and buildings worth?  How much is your intellectual property worth?  What are your annual sales worth?  What is your brand name worth?  Minus how much debt do you have?  Any lt medical or pension obligations ?  Subtract that too. And on and on.  Most people go with a factor on sales or earnings.
2021-04-15 16:31:19,stocks,"If you could own it outright, what would you pay for it? For the present value of its current profit? For its growth prospects?

What other opportunities do you have for that money?

And how do others value it? What would you pay for its extrinsic price appreciation?

How much would you discount your uncertainty?"
2021-04-15 06:55:56,stocks,"The ‘old school’ method you are describing, is calculating book value and is already accomplished by looking at the company’s balance sheet. Depending on the industry, book value may or may not help much In determining if a company is undervalued. 

The most widely accepted way that you evaluate any investment is to calculate fair value based on the Discounted Cash Flow. This requires multiple assumptions based on future estimates, which is why there are buyers and sellers.  This is also a reason why high growth companies freak when interest rates move appreciable up."

Now the sector is cooling off and will continue to converge with reality for the next few years. Lots of competitors means they have to be positioned to claim very large market share to justify valuations. NIO is a good buy as a 15 billion dollar company like it was last year, but it is now a 58 billion dollar company with net income of -255.05m last quarter.

I will still buy the lows and expect some return, but I'm not expecting it to go back to a 90bn market cap anytime soon."

Still, I would probably invest in a world index rather than a European index.

As such, in order to balance my exposure I don't invest in European ETF's. If the EU markets are booming/glooming that will influence me as an European already. Therefore I am invested in  ETF's from other markets (SP 500, etc)... for Europe I like to nitpick companies. 
I am also invested in companies from the other markets (US, etc), and the weight of the investment on my portfolio depends if they are already part of an ETF that I am already invested in. 
Basically I like to manage my exposure and avoid being over exposed to a single market or company, and my first step ir acknowledging that I am always exposed to EU market since I live here. 
Anyway, I can't claim that this is the best way to go about it, but it suits me and you should always invest in a way that you are comfortable with.

They're exactly the same, but watch out for fees, and make sure you're buying the one with the cheapest management fees."

I feel like so many people on here expect to make an immediate return. You can hope for it, but never assume it. Gameplan for what you will do if it falls before you financial commit. Prices can fluctuate anywhere in the short term based on a plethora of reasons even if you invested in a sound company and normally you best course of action is to be patient or average down which hopefully you can do more stress free if you've consider this as an option beforehand"
2021-04-15 14:13:17,stocks,"Kind of seems like the whole GME thing happened at the worst possible time.

2021-04-15 08:46:28,stocks,"**Daily Stock Market Forecast**

Things are looking bright and sunny today.

* Companies are smashing earnings expectations across the board
* Unemployment is dropping faster than expected. [Initial jobless claims](https://www.dol.gov/ui/data.pdf) were were 576,000, the lowest in more than a year, and well below the forecast of 710,000.
* [Retail sales](https://www.census.gov/retail/marts/www/marts_current.pdf) are booming, up 9.8% compared to a forecast 6.1%.

I'm forecasting a **green day** with a NASDAQ **high of 14,102** and a **low of 13,996**. 

That would put us just a little shy of ATH at today's peak.

AMD they are super bearish on.

2021-04-15 14:21:27,stocks,"Trying to figure out the option play with the vaccine rollout. There are in my mind four companies - Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca and J&J. it seems odd that the AZN and JJ vaccines are effectively suspended for having stated blood clots issues arising in 39/17,000,000 and 6/7,000,000 respectively. The blood clot issues from people who catch Covid are according to my reading of the WSJ (today's) more than at least five times as high. Specifically looking at the numbers that matter, it was reported that MDNA receives $240 per shot, PFE $125 per shot while JJ receives $18 to 22 per shot and AZN receives $5. I may have these numbers slightly wrong but am sure I will be corrected.

Is it just my misreading or is there something up with the numbers. Who stands to gain at MDNA and PFE - are there government contracts being given and allowing certain affiliated persons to profit? Why does it seem that countries that can afford to pay are being pushed to the higher priced alternatives.

It seems like there is no price impediment to MDNA/PFE right now and we should pile into these stocks for the short to medium term.

Obviously, the above is not financial or investment advice but just my warped reading or misreading of the facts (or fiction)."

2021-04-15 15:11:20,stocks,I bought some ViacomCBS and Discovery today as a knife catch. ViacomCBS is now at 10 PE and Discovery is at 20 PE and both have fallen more than 50% since last month and haven't had a bounce yet. They are cheap right now and if they continue falling it's a good value to average down. The reason why they are falling is completely unrelated to the business and strikes as a great long term accumulation opportunity.

I have PPD stock and TMO is buying PPD. If I hold onto my PPD stock, what is going to happen to it when TMO purchases PPD? The deal is that Thermo will be buying PPD at $47.50 per share. Will I just have mine sold at that price?

I have some OTC stocks like VLVLY and VAIAF. Why is it that VLVLY updates throughout the day but VAIAF seems to update maybe once a week (I haven't actually tested to see when it updates).

My VAIAF stock paid a dividend a few days ago and foreign taxes were withheld. Will I also have to pay domestic taxes? I noticed taxes aren't taken out of my domestic dividends.

I have dividend reinvestment enabled for all of my stocks, but I've noticed that some of my stocks don't reinvest dividends - gsk, uwmc, etc. What's the deal with that?"

2021-04-15 14:35:57,stocks,"I don't think that's necessarily true and you might be missing the forest for the trees. Yes, a lot of stocks hit ATHs and then traded sideways for a little while, but the index as a whole has been doing pretty well. GME started in January and since then the Dow has gone from 30k to 34k, and S&P 500 a more modest gain from ~3.8k to ~4.1k. If you avoided the FOMO/meme stocks and just got an index like VTI, you should be green right now, even if you got VTI at its January ATH.

The stock market in general always has a lot of ups and downs, and the steep bull run of 2020 from the feds pumping trillions into the market was bound to stop eventually. There's a reason ""Time in the market beats timing the market"" is such a popular phrase. Just hang in there. The stock market is very rarely going to be a get rich quick avenue, but you should still see gains at a greater pace than inflation eventually."
2021-04-15 15:29:23,stocks,"the only lessons are that stocks drop sometimes, you can't predict the market, and that confirmation bias is real.

let's say that its Dec 2021 and spec stocks full recover while boomer stocks start dying. the lesson then is going to be ""hold growth stocks and don't chase short term gains""

if spec stocks don't recover until a few years from now the lesson is going to be ""Feb-march"" was just a mini bubble, you need to hold high conviction plays.

if the whole market crashes in june the lesson is going to be ""see, pay attention to the overbought signals, the market was going to collapse its too high""

&#x200B;

Here's a fun exercise for confirmation bias: imagine going back in time to when biden got elected in NOV and telling your november self: ""puts on all clean energy, calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and carnival cruise lines. puts on all growth stocks"" your old self would probably start maniacally laughing ""REALLY? you want me to buy calls on oil and brick and mortar banks and CHEESECAKE FACTORY and buy puts on clean energy? in a biden presidency?

2021-04-15 16:55:48,stocks,"There are a couple things. 

Institutional investors don't trade the same way we do. They use algorithms to do a lot of the decision-making for them. And on top of that, they have way more money to work with. When you put $1M into a stock, even a 1% profit is $10,000. So they can theoretically hold a position for only a few minutes and make a good amount of money off of it.

The second thing is ""Buy low"" while a useful axiom, isn't *always* the best strategy for trading. A stock at its ATH with a lot of upward momentum/buying pressure can easily be a better buy than another stock trading at its lowest point. It depends on the circumstances. Wall street investors also set price targets. All it takes for their sentiment to change from buy to sell is for a stock to reach their target price.

There's also currently a global shortage of semiconductors which isn't great for AMD at this time."

EV to Revenues was 27 for fastly and 50.34 for NET. 

Sales Growth % YoY vs Operating Profit % FSLY: 40% vs -30% = Efficiency Score of <20% NET: 50% vs -23% = Efficiency Score of 20-40%

Pin those numbers vs valuation: Growth+Profit% vs EV/Sales Ratio FSLY: GP 10% vs 26 = Score <20% NET: GP 27% vs 54 = Score 20-40%

FSLY lost TikTok in Q4 which hurt their short term numbers but doesn’t change their long term outlook

We are going through 3 major phases in information

1. Explosion to access to information
-Birth of World Wide Web, and cataloguing of anything and everything from junk to breakthrough science/technology 

2. Storage and mining of information
-What are are going through now. Facebook, google, Amazon, targeted ads, companies, manufacturing shipping, you name it. Getting and holding data is king.

3. Making sense of this stupid amount of information we have
-The is the thing no one really has elegantly solved yet. How do you efficiently go through all this insane amount of information easily? How many times or people do you know who work in supply chains are frustrated as shit because every single system is clunky, Frankensteined together with different systems, legacy systems etc

Palantir I think offers a real solution to 3

I work in medical and their double click demo on healthcare systems fkn tore me a new asshole. And it’s exactly what I’m saying about point 3. We have the capacity to capture so much fucken information these days but no useful way of accessing it and linking things together

Palantir is basically the abacus. It’s a tool that assists humans to improve their intelligence and output artificially.

Maybe someone who works in supply chains can chime in.

Disclosure: I hold PLTR for long

2021-04-15 16:56:52,stocks,Do a limit order and you won’t have that issue

2021-04-15 09:49:33,stocks,You should drop it and buy David Bowie in The Prestige
2021-04-15 10:55:36,stocks,Idk but TAN is hurting me. No idea why this sector isn’t doing well.
2021-04-15 10:16:39,stocks,It interests me that TSM tripled over the last year and yet people are complaining about a slight pullback
2021-04-15 11:05:16,stocks,Disney. I bought 50 but will sell the day before earnings. Will hopefully be 195+
2021-04-15 12:48:08,stocks,">ICLN

too heavy in Plug, which I don't like. Invest in individual green stocks you know."
2021-04-15 12:31:34,stocks,"PLUG is pretty damn low, hard to say"
2021-04-15 15:24:41,stocks,everything that wasn't big tech or boomer stocks got destroyed for no reason today
2021-04-15 15:22:32,stocks,"Not sure

I have a small position and I'm fully on board with rare earth

I might buy on the way down but also confused"
2021-04-15 16:42:43,stocks,Because you're buying stocks with garbage financials.
2021-04-15 16:11:18,stocks,Indexes are heavily weighted towards large caps which are going gangbusters right now. You're probably heavy into small caps and speculative stocks which had a rough day.
2021-04-15 16:03:36,stocks,"Mine has been that way for almost a month. I fortunately moved most of my positions into VTI, which has worked beautifully."
2021-04-15 17:23:40,stocks,"You can't. The only one who makes money on pump and dumps is the one initiating the pump. By the time you hear about it, your already too late."
2021-04-15 17:20:45,stocks,"Usually you can't really. Getting in and out at the right time is 99% luck. Most people who make money from pump and dumps are either the ones orchestrating it, or investors who by sheer coincidence already held that stock before it pumped"
2021-04-15 17:53:14,stocks,"By playing it like a casino - as soon as you’re ahead, get out. I wouldnt recommend doing but you could maybe scalp a small gain then get out quickly"
2021-04-15 18:16:25,stocks,Don't fomo bro
2021-04-15 18:18:16,stocks,"I only have one penny left in my portfolio, and it’s an infrastructure bet. This market is punishing small and microcaps right now. That’s either a buying opportunity or a downward trend that’ll last for a while. Personally, I think it’s the latter."
2021-04-15 18:26:31,stocks,What are penny stocks and how can I get in on the action?
2021-04-15 15:58:51,stocks,maybe because it did 300% last year?
2021-04-15 16:09:29,stocks,Same; bought ICLN at the beginning of the year and have yet to seen green :(
2021-04-15 16:07:09,stocks,"Been a huge struggle seeing all the red next to it, but I sold another shit holding (OPEN) and doubled down on ICLN today. It has to be good long term... If I keep telling myself that it will be true"
2021-04-15 14:05:47,stocks,It'd be nice if the 3080s & 3090s could actually be in stock.
2021-04-15 13:58:15,stocks,Wish I got into NVDA instead of TSM!
2021-04-15 15:16:58,stocks,"The reasons they were growing is completely unrelated to the business, too"
2021-04-15 16:01:54,stocks,"there's a lot of coverage on them on this sub for being a scam chinese company, I suggest that you read those"
2021-04-15 18:18:30,stocks,Yes! Only goes up! I bought in at 453... unfortunately only 3% of my portfolio. Originally I was going to do 6% but I thought it was crazy to devote the same as I have in AAPL and MSFT. Oops :)
2021-04-15 18:34:03,stocks,"Yeah, sometimes the price history for the day on google is buggy and for one instance the price is way out of line, but it's not real."
2021-04-15 18:28:23,stocks,"The thing is that the S+P 500 is pretty much *always* at a new ATH.  I wouldn't be concerned about that so much as with just how quickly it's run up in the past year since Covid.  Do you think it has more room to run?

It will have to correct at some point, but you can't really know when that will be.  Things are pretty uncertain right now.  Fed is staying dovish (low interest rates), vaccination rollout is progressing smoothly and the economy is opening up little by little.  There's also Biden's infrastructure plan and American tech is looking strong as always.  This is all bullish for the market.

Bad signs are that things might be running a little hot right now.  Lots of margin debt, high shiller P/E ratios, stocks trading at high multiples.  Stocks might be getting away from their fundamentals a bit.  Tesla, Coinbase and BTC have insanely high market caps that are arguably getting into speculative territory.  Archegos got screwed making risky investments on the long side, as did Melvin on the shorts.  I heard it said that where there's 1 cockroach, there's a lot more.  This type of behavior could be dangerous for the broader market.  There's also concerns about inflation and if things run too hot that could cause some upward pressure in rates which is bearish for the market.  See the last 1-2 months.  Finally, there's uncertainty in general coming out of Covid.

This is not financial advice and this is just what I see.  I'm sure a lot of people will disagree with my analysis because historically speaking SPY is always a good investment.

I agree with that, but you do have to ask yourself if you're comfortable losing (probably worst case scenario) 30% of your investment in the not-so-distant future.  If you're not, you can try for more conservative investments or wait it out in cash.  Me personally I have a mixture of index funds and conservative stocks."
2021-04-15 18:24:55,stocks,"SPY is near ATH most of the time most of history... I think a major crash is highly unlikely this year, i wouldn't sit it out."
2021-04-15 18:16:58,stocks,[Bob](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2014/02/worlds-worst-market-timer/) has done pretty well. I’m no financial advisor but I’d say for long term holds it’s all about time in the market.
2021-04-15 18:14:46,stocks,I want in. But I’m waiting for a dip.
2021-04-15 19:05:58,stocks,"Metals and stocks can rally together and did last summer.

I wouldn’t consider this to be an indicator at all. 

I’m not sure you’re really going to get one at all. I still lean to a post options expiring pullback that is just more of the same that has been seen in 2021, but this is feeling different so far."
2021-04-15 10:12:41,stocks,"Incremental buys. A couple now, a couple more if it goes down more. That’s how I do it."
2021-04-15 10:24:26,stocks,I'll buy at 110
2021-04-15 10:04:31,stocks,Just do it
2021-04-15 10:07:37,stocks,How much is enough?
2021-04-15 12:34:00,stocks,"I think Eth is more likely to 5x up than Bitcoin in the near term, esp after they finish up that Eth 2.0 stuff."
2021-04-15 12:39:33,stocks,I invested in both months ago and Ethereum has brought more return. You can look at any app tho and find this out. Et has gone up about 1200% over the year vs 850% for bit. Will that remain the same moving forward? Who knows. You're gambling.
2021-04-15 12:50:02,stocks,"Bigger returns on Eth overall. It has sharper spikes and dips, but overall has been better. However, BTC is still the most widely known, and when Joe Schmo gets involved that will be the most likely place they go."
2021-04-15 12:56:32,stocks,ETH for sure. It has the brightest future I feel especially with 2.0 coming that addresses a lot of issues.
2021-04-15 13:04:33,stocks,r/CryptoCurrency
2021-04-15 13:13:46,stocks,\*checks crystal ball ... Eth
2021-04-15 17:26:59,stocks,Not really. It underperformed the market.
2021-04-15 10:18:16,stocks,"What do you think it's going to? It's essentially traded sideways for the last 5 years. In 2019, arguably the best year ever for the airlines, it didn't move all that much."
2021-04-15 10:38:12,stocks,I am so vibing with this comment. I’ve had BABA for about a year now and just end up screaming at my computer every time I look at the ticker.
2021-04-15 15:00:34,stocks,BB has a contract with Amazon so idk
2021-04-15 09:00:16,stocks,"Hypothetically speaking, what if, today, we found out that unemployment is dropping at the fastest rate since COVID began, that retail sales are growing 61% faster than expected, the Astra Zeneca blood clotting fears are overstated, that manufacturing output is growing faster than anyone imagined, and that every company reporting earnings during the most important earnings season of the year is shattering expectations?

Just hypothetically."
2021-04-15 08:58:26,stocks,Why
2021-04-15 12:34:05,stocks,"I've got a small position in $XLI. It's slightly outperforming my S&P500 ETF in terms of percentage gains but nothing to write home about. With the benefit of hindsight I'd recommend just placing that money into an S&P500 ETF unless you know the industry.

Edit

After comparing percentage gains prior to me increasing my S&P holding it's actually outperformed $XLI."
2021-04-15 14:21:21,stocks,You mean KTOS? The dronemaker?
2021-04-15 17:42:59,stocks,"They have no moat and depend on coin prices to remain high as they take a % cut. So outside of this crazy market I would have put them far far lower. 1-2B. Also i don't see investors buying from them, ETFs will take over for the average person."
2021-04-15 18:52:24,stocks,"In that direction it's support, not resistance"
2021-04-15 18:37:45,stocks,I bought in when it was around 40 and I’m legit considering selling if it gets close to there. I hear it’s very heavily shorted for some reason
2021-04-15 06:02:43,stocks,Correction where?
2021-04-15 06:42:08,stocks,Didn't we just have one last month?
2021-04-15 07:22:34,stocks,"Sorry, but 5-7% is not a correction (thats just some volatility)."
2021-04-15 14:07:13,stocks,"I don't think you know what ""tanks"" means"
2021-04-15 10:12:22,stocks,From what I know United focus more on international flights and vaccination progress is very slow for many other countries.
2021-04-15 10:13:27,stocks,"Travel industry took on a lot of debt/share dilution over covid-19. Pre-covid share prices aren’t a good gauge as to market potential.

They’ll probably be fine long-term, but I don’t think they’ll recover to previous highs for a while. Just my layman’s opinion."
2021-04-15 12:01:35,stocks,People were betting on travel opening up at some point in the summer but the EU fucking up vaccines and Japan etc having new waves means this summers tourist season is dead.
2021-04-15 12:12:03,stocks,Jet fuel prices are uncertain but rising at least a bit.
2021-04-15 11:32:35,stocks,"If you really want to purchase that home in the near future, keep the downpayment, or most of it, out of the market.  If you wouldn't mind if your home purchase was delayed several years, you can test your luck/skill in the market."
2021-04-15 11:35:31,stocks,"You are doing really good for your age. 

You need some cash for emergencies so don't worry about not investing enough. If there is a correction and you need money you'll have to realize loss in bad timing.
Don't rush and add money slowly. You can start adding more when you have more confidence in the market."
2021-04-15 11:49:38,stocks,"1.3 million inherited in a Roth? And you ask about investing *more* like you can’t afford a home already or actually have any financial worries at all?

Jesus Christ."
2021-04-15 17:03:45,stocks,"A lot of insider selling, Richard Branson sold more than $150 million worth of the company's stock over the past three days"
2021-04-15 10:50:22,stocks,"Industrials, materials, and AAPL. I wanted to get in AAPL at 119 but didn’t have any cash."
2021-04-15 10:51:18,stocks,Me too! I just took a huge loss on growth stocks I had which are crashing and now want to rotate into safer stocks but they’re all ATH
2021-04-15 11:09:45,stocks,"VTI and chill (add a little tilt towards SPY, DIA, or QQQ if you want to get spicy)"
2021-04-15 13:10:24,stocks,"You just gotta get in - avoid the ""ATH so it's too expensive"" mindset.  Tomorrow will be an ATH too.  And in a week.  And in a month.

I was all cash for a while, sitting on the sidelines waiting for the ""inevitable"" bubble crash.  And I sat there pouting while markets continued to go up.  Eventually friends convinced me it was silly to sit around with cash, and I hopped into some big index ETFs.  Since then, pure green.

Do I think things are totally irrational right now?  That it's crazy to have ATH throughout most of COVID?  That the bill will eventually come due for all the unlimited $$ printing the FED is doing?  For a long, long time I would have said ""absolutely"".  And it very may well still happen.  But it's totally possible that we're in a unique, unprecedented time right now.  Where else are you going to put your money?  The US is boppin, a ton of post-COVID energy is about to be released, and things are only looking up.  Plus it's the era of the individual investor - so much cash floating around, and stocks (alongside crypto and retail) are really the only places to put your money.  International funds are gonna continue to flood to the US as well, as there really isn't a better options.

Right now I think the best bet is to be thankful you're in a position to have capital to take advantage of a inane bull rull, and ride the wave as long as it lasts."
2021-04-15 09:13:27,stocks,Bought 12@119. First stock I bought!
2021-04-15 09:20:03,stocks,Apple is the largest position in VOO. And I have a ton of VOO or VOO-like mutual funds in my retirement account so by default APPL. Every time I think of buying APPL I just look at my overall portfolio and decide to add more SCHD for a bit of diversification away from tech.
2021-04-15 13:18:41,stocks,Every one learns this lesson the hard way.
2021-04-15 11:22:13,stocks,Dips on dips on dips
2021-04-15 17:16:28,stocks,"Lol I only bought one. Wish I bought more too. Even when it hit 525 i thought, I'll pick up some more at 500. And then 🚀"
2021-04-15 13:29:11,stocks,"TSM, FSR, VFF are my majority."
2021-04-15 13:25:32,stocks,"Not sure if you realize this, but not everyone invests in the same exact stocks"
2021-04-15 12:21:55,stocks,Uh no meme stocks aren’t the only ones down.
2021-04-15 14:12:58,stocks,"My biggest position is AAPL, I have other positions in:

TSLA green

OPEN red

PLTR red

CHPT red

PYPL green

RlOT red

ZNGA red

AMD green

I own 3 spacs but those are busts anyway so not counting them."
2021-04-15 15:34:16,stocks,You're kind of understating it. The whole GME thing drew mainstream media attention.
2021-04-15 15:48:53,stocks,You've only lost money when you sell.
2021-04-15 10:56:59,stocks,Take the fucking the profit
2021-04-15 11:01:47,stocks,take the 180%
2021-04-15 10:59:36,stocks,Bro lol
2021-04-15 17:15:54,stocks,"Of course it will happen again nothing goes up like this without crashing down again. 

The better cryptos with more use will fall less but people acting like this time its really different are crazy.

Doesnt mean some cryptos cant be higher than now in a few years ,others will fall back like bitcoin cash and new ones will come and go crazy."

2021-04-15 16:19:46,stocks,sure march was shite but i've had like 10 green days in a row now which has me just as stressed
2021-04-15 17:24:55,stocks,Limit your reddit hype and speculative tech positions and actually get some value. If you were down today you're doing something wrong
2021-04-15 16:19:58,stocks,Quite a lot of large caps and crypto has been green for last 2 months. Small caps tech are being hit hard.
2021-04-15 12:36:29,stocks,That's when the G.M.E. stuff made the news and WSB grew by like 7 million more subs.
2021-04-15 12:48:46,stocks,"Same. Made money off all those picks back then. Then all the weirdos, snake oil salesmen, and absolute dumbasses came out of the woodwork looking for a get rich quick scheme with a touch of desperate. Dunno what to believe anymore.  Plus the whole bonds thing wrecked everyone. Posts around here have been like ""Does this traditionally very safe stock look safe to you?"" ""Is the dip or a falling knife?"" And always somebody jerking off apple cuz it went up 8% after eating shit"
2021-04-15 12:37:19,stocks,I at least didn't get them at the top.  I've been trying to knife catch the last few weeks after they had dropped like 50%.
2021-04-15 09:42:05,stocks,So what you’re saying is I should load up on garbage companies that have like 0 profit
2021-04-15 10:27:41,stocks,"I'd feel a little better if yesterday didn't start as my greenest day in weeks only to end down over 1%

I'm actually down from this time last month whilst a lot of people on here have been talking about how worried they are at how green March was..."
2021-04-15 11:20:22,stocks,Are you implying that WOOF has bigger bags than fubo? Cause I'm down 50% on fubo and didn't even buy anywhere close to the top
2021-04-15 10:42:03,stocks,"Also, I think the new guy will split the stock. Yes, of course, I know that this does nothing to benefit us practically, but splits are always good emotionally for a stock. It gets retail investors excited and puts it within reach of their budgets."
2021-04-15 07:33:43,stocks,__!__
2021-04-15 05:54:19,stocks,"if you can feel it, there won't be any"
2021-04-15 06:27:37,stocks,"We already had a large tech correction last month. I don't expect lower than that, that would be pretty illogical from how things are shaping up. I expect volatility and overall going up nicely this year, thanks to low interest rates for years still, the fact that we already had a correction means there's room for good stocks to go up, and frankly there's a need to invest for retirement or prosperity."
2021-04-15 06:27:16,stocks,"Agree. All this low volume and ""rebalancing"", not to mention that QQQ is already up 17% the last 6 months, 61% the last year"
2021-04-15 07:48:46,stocks,"Minor Fed members. Not Powell.

That shouldn't really impact the market. Just padding out the list for effect."
2021-04-15 08:47:43,stocks,"Hm, strange.

Seems like the rest of the press is selling it as a positive anyway. They're taking the ""blood clot risks are higher from COVID than from the vaccine"" angle instead of the ""actually, all the vaccines cause blood clots"" angle.

[Here's another link](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/covid-vaccine-blood-clots-study-pfizer-astrazeneca-moderna-oxford/) that sells it as a positive."

2021-04-15 12:29:48,stocks,"About the same, just hit $1k in total losses :[

Branson just sold like $150 million in shares, which is following one of the biggest chairmen selling his stake entirely, and also just a very sensitive time for the company overall (still working out kinks for the next test flight after the last one failed, etc.). 

This is a company I where I truly almost feel like they can't fuck up. Their model is solid, space tourism is going to be gigantic and they're in prime position to have almost all that market share. But again just a really rocky time for the company."
2021-04-15 12:31:07,stocks,"Good chance this could be a bottom, so if you can afford it (and if you're buying SPCE then you should haha) definitely hold. But yea I know the feeling, shit sucks when its red."

2021-04-15 18:40:41,stocks,"Actually, you’ve got it backwards.

Hot economic data usually causes TNX to at least be higher. It has often made it spike. 

Honestly, the only things that happened that actually made sense today was tech up and financials down. The Dow rally with TNX on its back was crazy considering that its often been put on its back if TNX pukes too fast and it was puking today."
2021-04-15 13:19:06,stocks,That’s what they do. They get you into panic selling your speculative stocks that you did your solid DD on. You then buy ATH on big tech and they swing in to buy low on the stuff you sold. Know what you own and be confident.
2021-04-15 13:14:54,stocks,I'm just playing with a couple of grand. Not really enough to invest long term. This was more or less an experiment.
2021-04-15 13:01:32,stocks,"Being desperate for money feels like the worst way to get into stocks. You'd have more luck dumping the same amount of money into scratchcards TBH. 

I just see it as a way to make passive income with money I can afford to lose and an additional hobby to pass the time."
2021-04-15 08:09:14,stocks,I work in a completely different industry and still suffer from the same problems you pointed out in #3. It has been one of my biggest issues at work. I literally spend half my time needlessly trying to manage and work with data from a dozen different systems. Mind you the company I work for is drowning in cash and yet all the IT systems are exactly as you described. Multiple different systems poorly stitched together mixed in with legacy stuff that no one seems to know how to figure out. It's a fucking mess and right now Palantir appears to be the only viable solution.
2021-04-15 10:59:49,stocks,"That's where I'm at too, but it's refusing to rise over $40..."
2021-04-15 12:52:52,stocks,"I bought 35 shares at $38 thinking that they were going to go up... I may buy 15 more to bring the average down, but jeezus -- my Crypto is thankfully saving my ass against this."
2021-04-15 13:03:47,stocks,Based on what?
2021-04-15 13:03:50,stocks,I’m out today as well. No more Chinese stocks for me.
2021-04-15 13:03:01,stocks,What are your reasons for it?
2021-04-15 13:07:26,stocks,"I was in NIO at 46 and sold at $56 at the first sign of distress. No diamond hands there.

Sure, I like the CEO, but when I start to think about it...why would I buy a chinese electric car when I can buy another luxury brand with more brand recognition.

And even if I do buy NIO, will millions of others around the WORLD do the same when they could be getting other luxury vehicles....and is it worth the valuation as of today? The answer is NO."
2021-04-15 16:33:22,stocks,Scorpion who? Plz.....sounds like a shitty one man shop that will be out of business when they get their next margin call. I don’t think Bill Gates would be invested in a fraud. Same with VW.
2021-04-15 14:23:56,stocks,This is the way
2021-04-15 15:22:24,stocks,"Exactly. I don't see VT mentioned enough.


Own the world."
2021-04-15 15:14:41,stocks,"Apha 25,40 and vff 18.40 😭"
2021-04-15 15:56:45,stocks,"Very jealous of your entry point, hopefully you still have some to offset! I got in around $8. Those July calls will be printing, man. I've got a few myself. I just can't see RFP going any lower with what's going on in the sector right now"
2021-04-15 16:15:01,stocks,"Totally reasonable. Even buying now I think you'll still end up doing well when they announce earnings, but there will likely be another dip or two for better buying opportunities before then in the next week or two. I bought in around $8 but if it gets back under $11 before earnings I'll probably load up on more."
2021-04-15 17:45:00,stocks,What did your portfolio look like before? What was your experience and what led to the change?
2021-04-15 18:10:59,stocks,What percentage is your portfolio up for if you don't mind me asking?
2021-04-15 10:41:05,stocks,"its looking more and more like it.  We have not even had a true mini correction in the broad market yet since the Covid pandemic. we are so long overdue it's not even funny. 

when that happens, expect the darling stocks of WSB to dump ever more. nio down to 20 or less, PLTR down to 12-15. Tesla down to 300 or less. 

I've loaded up puts on these, as I have high confidence that a correction will occur in the broader market in the next 6 months at minimum. When it comes, it will destroy these growth stocks down to 70%+ from the Jan/Feb highs. ITS HAPPENED BEFORE SO DONT THINK IT CAN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. 

When it does occur, its going to drive the new retail traders completely out of stocks. imagine buying these stocks at ATH in Jan/Feb, holding backs of 20-40% after the first ""correction"", then watching your stocks drop another 30-50% when the true correction comes.

I've loaded up on puts for these growth stocks again, I was surprised how dirt cheap they are. everyone is so optimistic."
2021-04-15 11:32:12,stocks,I doubled up on the TSM. Going along for the ride.
2021-04-15 13:37:21,stocks,I'm not worried about disney.  I'm worried about my options that expire this week that need DIS to make a little run today.
2021-04-15 10:24:51,stocks,"imo, pltr relies on company's willingness to hand over data. I don't see it happening anytime soon"
2021-04-15 17:05:37,stocks,Don’t know much about crsr but I would hold on to the other ones
2021-04-15 15:49:41,stocks,I get it I just haven’t been holding it since the beginning of the year.
2021-04-15 16:32:35,stocks,What did you get into NRZ at to be a big loser?  Pre-COVID?
2021-04-15 11:47:14,stocks,"Gotcha I’ve been investing in VOO, was wondering which one would have better growth"
2021-04-15 12:07:47,stocks,Oh
2021-04-15 12:06:37,stocks,"Same feelings... but thinking of the long run, idk man"
2021-04-15 15:00:39,stocks,Why? It’s already up buggy. You see it continuing
2021-04-15 15:34:28,stocks,I meant in the long term. Their stock has been gradually declining for months.
2021-04-15 15:39:43,stocks,That’s what I thought but I don’t think ten year yield will go down all the way. It’s a nice stock to balance a tech-heavy portfolio
2021-04-15 16:34:15,stocks,Yeah I searched all day and couldn’t find any real news or changes regarding MP...  thanks
2021-04-15 19:37:13,stocks,"Overexposure to the sector. I also hold TD.

I think JPM has a nicer dividend yield but a larger exposure to credit cards. BAC is way more conservative"
2021-04-15 09:53:27,stocks,His first name or his last name
2021-04-15 10:19:43,stocks,"I'm complaining because they beat earnings and revenue estimates but tanked anyway, which destroyed the value of my 4/23 $123 call options."
2021-04-15 10:25:08,stocks,"Slight pullback means being down nearly 30 points from ATH despite nothing but positive catalysts and BETTER outcomes. 

Dropping 3-5% on outperforming all analyst estimates. 

Dropping 1/12 of it’s share price in the last two weeks on these same good catalysts.

It’s absurd."
2021-04-15 13:15:17,stocks,I just sold so it's only going up from here.
2021-04-15 14:21:13,stocks,"Seriously, happens every freaking time."
2021-04-15 15:33:22,stocks,but 9% ?! that’s wild
2021-04-15 16:02:57,stocks,Seems like all clean energy is following a similar pattern.
2021-04-15 16:09:12,stocks,My thinking to. If I check back in a year or two and see it still stagnant along with the rest of the clean energy sector than I'll re-shuffle but I have to believe that clean energy is the way of the future.
2021-04-15 14:06:59,stocks,"Over here with you. I was considering buying NVIDIA on the morning before its announcement which shot the stock up 10% in a few hours, I went with TSM instead. Feels bad. Still love TSM though, i'll just have to wait a little while longer before opening a position in NVDA."
2021-04-15 15:36:33,stocks,Same with the entire market for the last year.
2021-04-15 16:02:55,stocks,"Thanks, I'll go looking.

What makes you say they're a scam?"
2021-04-15 18:23:33,stocks,"Hey at least you got a good amount in. I started researching the stock for my student-run investment fund and was like wholly shit, this is such an easy W. I originally started researching at 445. I bought with real money at 483, 2 shares. Easy W"
2021-04-15 10:24:01,stocks,Air travel is going to return to normal soon.  $60 by year end IMO.  At least back to the mid-50s.  I'd be happy with a 20%+ return from here in 6 months.
2021-04-15 11:31:42,stocks,"Yeah. I gave up cause i saw that CCP doesn't care about foreign investors. Multiple scams from chinese penny stocks. No real audits.

It's BABA so it's probably better but it's just unpredictable, I'd rather go out without profit and make money on some rally."
2021-04-15 09:28:23,stocks,"> Astra Zeneca blood clotting fears are overstated

79 out of 20 million people? They already are overstated..."
2021-04-15 09:03:03,stocks,"I would believe all of those things. 

The market stopped being driven by facts a long time ago though. 

Guess we will find out though."
2021-04-15 09:06:17,stocks,"Kind of the sell the news mentality. 

My take on it is that all the good news we got has been priced in during premarket. Institutions will take their profits. Then market goes down. 

Have we learned nothing though?  Could flip a coin and probably get more accurate predictions. I think I may actually do that for a month and see how it goes."
2021-04-15 14:35:59,stocks,"Sorry, yes, I meant defense technology."
2021-04-15 08:49:31,stocks,"We had one, yes. What about second correction?"
2021-04-15 10:06:44,stocks,"Bears are always predicting corrections. I saw people posting about how they thought a correction was coming, *while the last correction was still happening*"
2021-04-15 07:29:45,stocks,Not even... Its starting to feel like Tuesday morning .. However.. I do predict the boat staying rocky as alot of new money came in in the last 6 months. The people who were here before slaaaaaughtered those pigs. Once we open up.. stablize and hit our stride. its pretty much a brave new world.. at least the white house is less chaotic these days.
2021-04-15 17:12:22,stocks,"Yikes, that does nothing for confidence."
2021-04-15 10:59:50,stocks,"Similar, I want to do what you're doing, but I'm actually doing the reverse. I'd exit growth for safe stocks, but don't find anything in the world of safe stocks worth it, whereas I think many growth stocks are actually reasonably valued, or certain more so than the safe stocks now near their ATHs. With all said, I own a balance of both, so it's really just about rebalancing and increase the safer
 stocks positions."
2021-04-15 09:38:43,stocks,Very nice
2021-04-15 09:46:29,stocks,I have a LOT of VOO and VTI and VYM. So far it’s working out well.
2021-04-15 09:26:58,stocks,"Yeah I recently took money out of stocks and moved into ETFs. Problem is, I did it (and added about $10k) a week too early. The next week all the prices plunged. Can't time the market but still kills me to this day. SCHD is interesting. Gonna check it out."
2021-04-15 13:26:15,stocks,"Of course not, but almost every large cap stock is running and I assume most people have some large caps to diversify"
2021-04-15 12:49:54,stocks,But 50%? Which stocks dropped that massively?
2021-04-15 15:36:56,stocks,"Mainstream media covers what attracts viewers, not necessarily what’s important."
2021-04-15 16:12:05,stocks,"And there is no guarantee individual stocks will go back up; and I went above my risk tolerance, anyway"
2021-04-15 16:33:57,stocks,Here 10 days red... Lucky you...
2021-04-15 12:42:39,stocks,"What was WSB before the GME situation? Anytime I go there, I just find it kinda cringe with how extremist some of the posters seem to be. Has it always been that way or is that because of the influx of users?"
2021-04-15 12:53:36,stocks,It genuinely made me feel sad to see people talking about investing their friggin entire life savings into GME. That's just dumb shit. Don't be dumb.
2021-04-15 12:54:23,stocks,"> somebody jerking off apple cuz it went up 8% after eating shit

yep everyone was cursing AAPL all March but April comes around and it's everybody's favourite stock again lmao"
2021-04-15 12:40:22,stocks,"dont sink anymore money in them

imo if you have any extra cash, buy vti (or any broad market index fund)and just let it work for you."
2021-04-15 10:13:23,stocks,It was the winning move from Oct-Jan. Wouldn't recommend it now though.
2021-04-15 11:26:55,stocks,Yeah same here. Fortunately it's only 50 shares but I wish I never bought FUBO and just bought 1 more GOOGL share to add to my existing 10 and some pizza with my original FUBO investment.
2021-04-15 08:57:10,stocks,Yup saw that pretty interesting on the change in the last couple of hours lol
2021-04-15 12:57:01,stocks,Just terrible timing. Everything looked good for a bounce up off the MA. I feel like I have this bad luck of buying in just as bad news comes about.
2021-04-15 14:37:58,stocks,Crypto stocks are down big-time so good time to get in
2021-04-15 14:01:54,stocks,"Yeesh, yeah that's rough. You're at least holding some amount of your money in index funds, right?"
2021-04-15 11:00:37,stocks,If you do decide to invest in FSLY expect extreme volatility. If 10% swings in a day with no news alarm you then I would avoid it. Long term 5+ years I expect it to be solid. Definitely not a short term play.
2021-04-15 12:40:09,stocks,I looked at Akamai back when I chose to go with NET and FSLY. I haven’t looked at it recently since I already had made my decision and entered positions. I can see if I have my old comparison though. It was back in Q2/Q3 tho.
2021-04-15 13:05:22,stocks,AKAM is the industry leader and I think their growth rates were single digit. Too low for what I was looking for
2021-04-15 16:31:36,stocks,I’ll buy more then.
2021-04-15 18:47:10,stocks,I need to learn more about how these relate; had it in mind that when the markets/economy looks good that rates go down. The cause and effect for me is still unclear.
2021-04-15 13:28:48,stocks,jesus.. THIS!.
2021-04-15 13:17:29,stocks,I'm in a similar position but I plan to keep adding to it overtime. Idk. It's not much but if I get a few hundred dollars out of it in a year or two that's more than nothing in a savings
2021-04-15 15:12:58,stocks,Uhhh yes it is. A few grand is a great starting point to invest long term in major market indexes with monthly contributions. Plug it into an investment calculator with regular monthly contributions for 20 years and see what happens. Compound interest is a very powerful thing.
2021-04-15 12:56:27,stocks,"I wonder what caused the dip today. Doing a quick search and it looks like they failed their earnings report, but that was a month or two ago (I think). I've a buy order set at $20, with a pretty tight stop loss if that gets processed."
2021-04-15 13:26:03,stocks,"Simply put: if you look at the US EV market, Tesla dominates.  The Model 3 is the #1 seller, the Model Y is the #2 seller, the Model X is #4, and the Model S is #5.

Now look at the China EV Market.

\#1 best seller is Tesla, then Wuling, then GAC, then Baojun, then BYD, then a bunch of other stuff, then NIO.

NIO only has one model in the top 20 EV sellers.  With so much competition in China, I just don't see them winning."
2021-04-15 13:20:20,stocks,"I'm balls deep in BABA and JD, I think they represent some of the best growth/value plays in the market.  So I'm not out of Chinese stocks, just NIO."
2021-04-15 16:38:01,stocks,"The stock dropped 12% today, therefore some people gave it credibility. Just saying."
2021-04-15 15:25:33,stocks,Well we’ll see what’s happening with the merger. The decline today is probably because tilray postponed their shareholder meeting to 31 apr instead of tomorrow. I think we’ll see a continuous bleed until the merger is finalized in voting and then APHA will jump to capitalize on the merger deal.  If tilray decides against it the stock will plummet. I’m playing it as a gamble but my avg is lower than yours and I still got some money to dca the coming weeks.
2021-04-15 15:30:35,stocks,Damn
2021-04-15 18:47:07,stocks,"I had individual stocks. Amazon, Apple, Alibaba. Then I bought a bunch of shares of VOO. Watching VOO consistently make gains while Apple and Amazon went sideways and BABA went down got me to go all ETF."
2021-04-15 18:27:12,stocks,4.6% from January to now.
2021-04-15 10:46:55,stocks,LOL Nobody listen to this guy
2021-04-15 10:52:59,stocks,!RemindMe 6 months
2021-04-15 11:05:37,stocks,"Is that your thesis? That is long overdue? If so that’s incredibly weak. 2021 is going to have historic gdp growth for the US and you want to bet against it?

Here’s the kicker, nobody can predict where the markets will go."
2021-04-15 16:46:52,stocks,"Yeah, pre-covid cost basis of $16.58.  I'm definitely setting a stop loss on it once it passes into positive territory."
2021-04-15 12:20:02,stocks,"Their returns over lifetime as well as recently are nearly identical. The huge majority of VTI is VOO, so they’ll generally move together unless small and mid caps take a beating, and even then, it’s a minimal impact due to overlap.

I wouldn’t sweat investing in one over the other."
2021-04-15 12:00:37,stocks,They are both market cap weighted so 95% of VTI is VOO. Only 5% of VTI is other thousands of tiny companies. So it doesn’t matter much.
2021-04-15 12:11:06,stocks,Yeah once it passes 15% down it’s tough. I even noticed Cathie Woods isn’t buying anymore.
2021-04-15 15:39:17,stocks,Biden's hard on china stance & CCP's crackdown on big tech
2021-04-15 19:47:47,stocks,"I have 13 BofA calls spread out until august. Today cut them down 40%. I still have faith and think it will react correctly next week, but should’ve bought shares."
2021-04-15 09:54:32,stocks,"Oh shit, forgot about that POS stock. Buy the first name of course"
2021-04-15 15:35:57,stocks,theres at least 20 stocks on my watchlist and one in my portfolio that are down about as much or worse than that.

2021-04-15 14:10:02,stocks,"TSM is a long hold for me no matter what, but just sad to see it dip when some other semis are roaring (NVDA).

My SOXL has been good to me at least. Slow and steady despite some of the semis going down."
2021-04-15 15:44:31,stocks,"Not entirely. The rate they grew were similar to high grow or speculative stocks, which they are not. Nothing changed in their business that could increase their earnings in the future.

But believe what you want to believe."
2021-04-15 16:19:33,stocks,"https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/m6kxvb/dd_ftft_a_400_million_chinese_scam/

^^^ This. Haven't done any of my own research. Also the archegos blowup will have a lasting effect on chinese stocks, even more small cap ones (GSX for example)"
2021-04-15 16:15:56,stocks,they just said what makes them say that.
2021-04-15 18:36:38,stocks,"yeah I bought More AAPL and MSFT around the same time. These big tech got hammered in Feb/mar for no good reason, these are not story stocks..."
2021-04-15 11:52:10,stocks,"The fundamentals for BABA are incredible -- by nearly every metric the business is far undervalued compared to its peers, and the revenue growth is completely ignored. Foolishly, I keep thinking that something this good AT SOME POINT has to move"
2021-04-15 09:09:34,stocks,"The market stopped being driven by facts because federal interest rates are basically zero, and Powell said yet again yesterday for the 100th time that isn't changing for two years.

You're right though, on a day to day basis it's tough to say."
2021-04-15 07:35:10,stocks,"For sure.  I saw one analyst mention that both longs (Archegos) and shorts (Melvin) have been exposed with their shaky positions right now.  And another said that when you find one cockroach, there's a lot more.  I think this market is still quite precarious and one should proceed with caution."
2021-04-15 11:11:21,stocks,Yeah I’m keeping CRSR and maybe PLTR but shifting from my others.
2021-04-15 09:52:18,stocks,It will work out well long term as well. I did some stupid stuff earlier this year with individual stocks. Somehow overall made some money but only because I sold two of them magically the day before they both crashed. I made a lot on C C ! V by selling on Friday morning before it crashed a ton. Had I waited just one day longer I would have been way down. That spooked me. And I am still holding VGAC and FUBO with huge losses.  So back into VOO I went :)
2021-04-15 09:40:46,stocks,"Not sure if it will make you feel better but I missed out a ton of upside last year. Pulled out in time before the crash but didn’t go back in when I should have. Learned my lesson. Will just park it in ETF and let it ride. 

SCHD is considered a dividend ETF but it has outperformed S&P recently as well. I like their stock selection/replacement process. I am not in it for dividend purposes but having a bit of that as well doesn’t hurt. Currently top holdings are HD, Cisco, Pfizer, TX instruments, KO, etc."
2021-04-15 14:26:13,stocks,You know what they say about assuming.
2021-04-15 13:15:49,stocks,LMND and QS are two examples.
2021-04-15 15:48:03,stocks,"Okay? Well either way mainstream media paid it a lot of attention, and that drew a lot of new people to the stock market."
2021-04-15 12:53:05,stocks,"I barely even remember anymore, I've been seeing Ape this ape that diamond hands yada yada for so long I've forgotten, but I think it used to be alright."

I should add that I'm still up 32% on the stock market over the last year but I was at one point up 140%.."
2021-04-15 13:07:11,stocks,"Thanks. If you find it, plz share"
2021-04-15 19:50:26,stocks,"My understanding is that rates go up when the economy is in good shape.  That's because people are more confident in equities and they sell off bonds (less demand = lower prices = higher yields).

When the economy is in bad shape, people go back to bonds because they're a safer alternative to stocks.  People don't trust in the stock market's ability to perform and flock to bonds to give them fixed income and a safer place to park their capital.  More demand for bonds = higher bond prices = lower yields.

If you don't understand the inverse correlation between bond price and yields, let me know.

\[EDIT: Short answer for why bond yields and prices are inversely correlated: say you have a bond that's worth $1000 face value and has a 2% yield. If demand for bonds has gone down and you must now sell that bond on the secondary market for, say, $800, then the yield has increased. Why? Because the buyer is paying less money for the same fixed return. Less money for the same fixed return = higher overall yield. And vice versa. I encourage everyone to look this up if you're not clear on it.\]

Apart from that, I think the confusion is not only on your end.  Right now is a weird time.  Bond rates went up recently, and people were saying that was a *bad* sign for the markets.  That's because people were saying it was related to inflation.  Imagine: if inflation is going up, bonds with their current 1-2% yields (and negative real yields) are a horrible place to park your cash.  You're actually losing money already due to negative real yields, but if inflation spikes 1-3% you're actually losing even more.  Remember, bond yields are fixed so inflation eats into their nominal (fixed) yields.

The theory was that economic stimulus plus dovish Fed policy (low interest rates, easy money) made people fearful that inflation was just around the corner.  Thus, they began to sell off their bonds.  Remember, less demand for bonds = lower prices = higher yields.  If this were indeed the motivation for the bond sell-off, it's actually a *negative* indicator for the economy.  It means we expect inflation to come.  It means the Fed will be forced to raise interest rates to contain inflation (more expensive to borrow money).  It means that future earnings will be worth less (value of dollars in the future goes down).  This is why tech stocks sank at the same time bond yields went up: A. because they depend on easy capital (low interest rates) to expand their operations, and B. their valuation at the moment is highly linked to their future earnings.

However, Jay Powell and the Fed came out and said any inflation would just be transitory, and the market seemed to believe it.  The bond sell-off was contained.    Furthermore, analysts were saying, like I said in the first half of my comment, that rising bond yields is actually positive for the economy.

So basically the fears about inflation got buried and we're back to a ""normal"" scenario where rising bond yields are seen as a positive sign for the markets.

I'm not sure why bond yields went down today, but a quick Google search said that higher yields have attracted some investors (including overseas investors) back in.

I'm new to this but it was good for me to make sure I understand it and try to explain it.  Anyone who reads this can feel free to correct anything that is wrong."
2021-04-15 15:35:49,stocks,"Okay, I've got plans for that couple of grand in September so where does that get me? If I lost all my money I'd just change my plans, but if I recoup what I lost or just make up the difference with a side hustle over the summer then that money is 100% getting spent in Sept. Again, I was just experimenting."

2021-04-15 12:24:18,stocks,Gotcha thank you. That’s what I thought I just wanted confirmation. Because VTI cost less right now would it potentially grow more than VOO or will that not really affect the growth
2021-04-15 12:37:47,stocks,"VTI is outperforming on literally any time scale. How does that translate into ""doesn't matter much""?"

2021-04-15 15:48:30,stocks,Well I am confident it will go back up. America alone isn't enough to hold China back permanently.
2021-04-15 19:48:27,stocks,I also have a May 157.50 JPM call which I’m down about 25% on.
2021-04-15 16:10:16,stocks,"Same here, going as low as 25%... Hate the mental impact this has on my daily life"
2021-04-15 16:32:34,stocks,I think buy now and sell when they announce paramount+ beat subscriber estimates
2021-04-15 16:23:49,stocks,"Thanks!

I'll give that a read, but I think there's enough from reading for just a few minutes to make me steer clear."
2021-04-15 09:11:08,stocks,Then let the ride continue. I’m not against making money. I just tend to side eye anything that looks too good to be true.
2021-04-15 07:41:11,stocks,"To be fair.. I wasnt about to cut runners.. If it runs.. why wouldnt it later as well. I am salt I missed that february top.. but have enjoyed averaging down. I'm under on some and will hold because they're long. Nothing short of mine is under. BUT I am convinced we are about to ride sideways for a couple ~~days~~ weeks. Money was pulled, pigs got slaughtered.. bulls averaged down."

2021-04-15 13:16:28,stocks,I looked back. Didn’t do much on them as they are the industry leader snd I was looking for e high growth stocks. Their growth YoY was too low for me
2021-04-15 16:20:07,stocks,"Well that's pretty pertinent information don't ya think? That's not money for investing at all if it's already been allocated elsewhere. I mean, you can still plug it into some ETF's if you're good with the risk. You definitely wouldn't lose it all even in the worst of circumstances. You could still stand to make a few bucks in any event."
2021-04-15 16:50:51,stocks,"I didn't do any DD on the stock, I only heard the news. Hopefully you didn't enter in December, otherwise the 'buy low, sell high' could get a bit complicated. Anyway, I wish you all the best with the stock."
2021-04-15 12:36:20,stocks,"They are both 3bps. You mean their current price level?  It doesn’t really matter.  It depends on outstanding shares for each index so if there are more shares of VTI, then their price would be less.  Also their inception dates are different. VTI is older by about 10 years (I think) so that will affect where it is now as well. But going forward growth/return would be almost the same."
2021-04-15 12:42:39,stocks,"Nope. Almost the same. Maybe last year VTI is slightly ahead. But previous years it was the other way around. But pretty minor. And it is driven by that 5%. 

Here is the average annual performance as of December 31st, 2019:

                      VOO	       VTI

1 Year	       31.46%	    30.8%

2021-04-15 19:34:35,stocks,Yeah I honestly think we might see 12 to 13 a share before it’s over.

2021-04-15 19:05:39,stocks,"IF it beats expectations and IF the market reacts positively to it (which is a 50 50 bet in this market).
I'm not giving any advice. You decide whether it's worth it."

2021-04-15 16:32:52,stocks,"I made it pretty clear that I was just experimenting (you know since I mentioned it multiple times now) also my allocation is again as I've already pointed out, flexible. It is/was my fun money. I'd prefer the money be used in a bit funner manner than it has so far, but it did keep me busy during the pandemic. I'm not sure what in the hell you want from me?"
2021-04-15 16:53:16,stocks,Thank you. I just bought today at $35. Been following for a while.
2021-04-15 12:46:23,stocks,Are you taking dividends into consideration?  VOO has higher div return.
2021-04-15 12:31:35,stocks,June and August of 2020 did something eerily similar and look what happened there. I know past performance.... blah blah blah...  but if anyone thinks this can go up at this rate forever they are crazy.

Some highlights:

> The world’s largest contract chipmaker said Thursday that its **automaker industry clients can expect chip shortages to begin easing next quarter**, alleviating some of the supply disruptions that have forced the likes of GM and Ford to curtail production. **But overall deficits of critical semiconductors will last throughout 2021 and potentially into next year**, Chief Executive Officer C.C. Wei told analysts on a conference call.

> [...]

> TSMC now expects investments of about **$30 billion on capacity expansions and upgrades this year, after spending $8.8 billion in the first three months, Chief Financial Officer Wendell Huang said. The company had previously forecast spending of as much as $28 billion.** Sales in the June quarter may reach $13.2 billion, beating the average $12.8 billion seen by analysts, while full-year revenue may climb 20% in dollar terms, ahead of the “mid-teens” growth predicted in January.

> [...]

> **Net income for the January-March period climbed 19% to NT$139.7 billion ($4.9 billion), versus the average analyst estimate of NT$136.2 billion.** Gross margin for the quarter eased to 52.4% from 54% in the three months prior, due in part to relatively lower levels of utilization and exchange-rate fluctuations. First-quarter revenue rose 17% to NT$362.4 billion, according to a company statement last week.

2021-04-15 04:00:17,stocks,I like how everyone gets excited that Intel is spending $20B spread over the next 3-4 years on two new fabs and are all like “Intel is back in this race.” TSM drops $30B this year alone on fab capacity expansions and upgrades.

TSM will be a moneymaking machine in 3 years.

But right now it's capacity-constrained and spending piles.

Intel operates in a very different way to TSMC.

Architecture & Process is a handshake for them and they only build out fab capacity when they have achieved project milestones (and orders) years in advance. TSMC is just process and they can assume to count on hundreds of customers to fill their capacity.

Then there's the fact that Intel is about to roll out its mid tier Ponte Veccio GPU, MobilEye Q5 chips, AI accelerators, etc.  They have a lot going on, they don't just make chips and they need to be more careful than TSMC."

2021-04-15 19:37:45,stocks,Worked in semi fabs for over five years as an engineer. I know this business pretty well. Yeah Intel’s business model is different and they’re not a pure foundry play but Fab CapEx is Fab CapEx. Really hard to keep up in this business if you’re less than half of your competitors.

Hypothetically say I am bringing 100K USD to my Canadian account when the exchange is 1.25.

Would I just minus 1% from the exchange rate (1.24)

OR

Would it be simply 1% of the exchange. In this case the gain on exchange is $25,000, so they would take $250

OR

Do they take 1% of the whole US amount, $1000.

Some help would be greatly appreciated!"

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"DD on fast growing fintech - KSPI.IL (one of ARKF's stock picks) I’d like to share thesis on [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) ([KSPI.IL](https://kspi.il/)), the largest Payments, Marketplace and Fintech Ecosystem in Kazakhstan with a leading market share in each of its key services and products. At the core of its Ecosystem is the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the leading mobile app in the country with 4.9 million DAU (up 155% YoY) and 9.1 million MAU (up 59% YoY), which is roughly half of the country population. The app serves as a single gateway to all of the Company’s services and is an integral part of people’s daily lives in Kazakhstan. As people’s lives become increasingly digitalized [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) expects the usage of its Super App to grow, with the COVID-19 pandemic accelerating consumer adoption of cashless payments, e-Commerce and digital financial services. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) is built around an ecosystem business model, where the growth and development of one service contributes to the growth and development of other services, creating a powerful virtuous cycle. A growing number of services being used by the Company’s consumers results in synergies across all of its Platforms, structurally high profitability and creates a powerful self-reinforcing network effect, giving the Company strong competitive advantages.

According to the recent Full-Year 20202 Financial Results, total revenue reached KZT641,437 M (\~$1.5B), equivalent to adj. 25.5% YoY growth; and net income reached KZT274,318 M (\~$0.65B), equivalent to net income 42.8% margin and 43.2% YoY growth.

**The** [**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/) **Ecosystem currently comprises the following three market leading Platforms:**

• Payments Platform connects customers, which consist of both consumers and merchants, to facilitate cashless, digital payment transactions. The Company offers its customers a technology platform to both pay and receive payments for goods and services, as well as to transfer and withdraw money. Consumers can transact with merchants and amongst themselves using a variety of services, including the [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, a Kaspi Gold pre-paid debit card and/or any bank card or e-Wallet.

In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s proprietary payment network transactions accounted for 66% of total payment network transactions in Kazakhstan, while other payment networks, including Visa and Mastercard, had an aggregate share of 34% of the total payment network transactions in the country. With close ties to Kazakhstan’s government, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) has also emerged as the country’s unofficial national online bank for paying taxes and fines, assuming a role that would otherwise be filled by the civil service or a government department, and further driving new user growth across the country.

• Marketplace Platform connects merchants and consumers, enabling merchants to increase their sales and enabling consumers to buy a broad selection of products and services from a variety of online and offline merchants. The Company helps merchants increase their sales by linking them to its technology, payment options, including buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products, fulfilment, marketing and branding services.

[Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was the largest online retailer in Kazakhstan by sales value in 2020, with an e-Commerce gross merchandise value (“GMV”) share corresponding to 46% of the market.

• Fintech Platform enables consumers to access, primarily through [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Super App, the Company’s digital finance products, including consumer finance and deposits. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/)’s buy-now-pay-later consumer finance products are also strategically integrated with its Marketplace Platform, which means that consumers are able to make a purchase seamlessly with financing and then pay over time in monthly instalments.

In 2020 the Company enjoyed the largest market share of Consumer Loans in Kazakhstan, amounting to 32%.

[**Kaspi.kz**](https://kaspi.kz/)**’s Future**

• [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) Travel. In 2020, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) acquires Santufei and launches online travel platform. Users can now purchase domestic and international flights from over 700 airlines through the app. Over time [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) plans to expand into ground transportation, hotels and package holidays.

• Speed and Risk Management. Credit decisions made in only 10 secs, and time to money 15 mins based on machine learning driven real-time decision making based on historic online data collected by [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) and data purchased from third parties. The second type focuses on the client’s activity immediately preceding the application with the aim of assessing intent to buy. What client did on their phone one minute ago tells you a lot. These checks significantly reduced the risk of fraud. ATM network has face-recognition technology to detect fraudulent activity on the spot. Customers who entered their national identity number or displayed the QR code to the ATM could make any transaction without a plastic card.

• Growth via the Merchant Segment. The merchant network gave [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) another avenue for expansion. The company had daily contact with merchants, both online and offline. Around one third of all merchants’ sales were realized through its marketplace. It could easily provide services to its merchant base including payment services and capital financing tools. Capitalizing on its advanced analytical tools, the company was also able to provide merchants access to sophisticated marketing tools that they could not afford on their own.

• Geographic Expansion. Central Asia and the Caucasus was a natural expansion area for [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/). Russian was spoken throughout the region, and they shared a common culture. Mr. Lomtadze estimated that establishing a presence in any country in the region would take no more than 12 months because [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had a natural advantage: almost everything it offered was online in its mobile app, so they were able to enter the market with a marketplace or payments platform, which required no investment in physical outlets, posed no credit risks, and was not heavily regulated like financial services. Banks, on the other hand, would normally enter a market with loans, and they needed branches. Payments were also a tool for collecting customer data that then could be used for generating a credit rating for consumer financing decisions. “Our mobile app is like Uber,” Lomtadze declared. “Uber can scale around the world because of its simple onboarding process. In today's world, you don’t really need to own a fleet of cars to provide taxi services. By the same token, you don't have to have a showroom and a warehouse full of TVs to sell televisions. You can basically organize everything through technology and sell items via your mobile app.”

o Azerbaijan was the first target. In the beginning of 2018, [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) was eyeing a potential acquisition target in the country that owned three leading online marketplaces for—new and used items, cars, and real estate. Out of its 10 million citizens, almost half live in the capital city. That’s great for fulfillment. An acquisition here would expand target market from 18 to 28 million overnight.

o For the same reasons Uzbekistan and Georgia attractive markets as well.

• In terms of existing models, Alibaba is closest to [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) in terms of the range of products it offers and its multiple contact points with customers. The company, in addition to its mobile app, captured customers in its outlets, ATMs, merchant shops, and retailers’ points of sale. [Kaspi.kz](https://kaspi.kz/) had also been generating net profit for over a decade. Its net profitability was 43%, over seven times more than Amazon’s and about three times greater than that of PayPal.

Baring Vostok, a private equity fund and a majority stake holder, had a long holding period; and recent IPO and subsequent lockup period would allow it to commence a formal exit. The subsequent lockup period ends on April 18th, 2021.

When I believe in a stock that goes down I average down on it and see my average share price go down.  When it goes up I'll sometimes sell some shares at or above the last price I paid for them or at or above my average share price.  I notice that my average share price doesn't change after this.  If I sell a lot higher than I bought a previous one for it would be a gain.  If I sold for less it should be a loss.  I would think both would affect average share price.

If you sold those 10 for 80 each, then on average you realized a gain of 5 each. As long as you sell the remaining 10 at more than 70, you will realize an overall gain. Because your average selling is more than your average paid.

2021-04-15 03:30:49,stocks,"It depends how you look at it. If you use FIFI/LIFO technically it would change but if you keep it simple it won't. It is a way of accounting and you can choose 1 of 3 methods. It might only benefit with doing taxes. However if you choose a method of accounting you can't apply another accounting method on another stock. You either use LIFO, FIFO or just let you avg costs be fixed for your entire portfolio.

FIFO = First in First Out - You buy 10 shares for $5, and than 10 shares for $10. If you sell 3 shares using this principle your avg buy cost changes from $7.5 to $7.94

LIFO = Last in First out - Same situation as above but your avg buy  in after the selling of 3 stocks is now $7.05.

You use fixed avg - After selling the 3 shares your avg buy remains $7.5 because with this method you don't keep track of which specific amount of stock were bought for what price, it is all uniform once it has been purchased, it is like it all blends in together.

The selling price does not affect your avg buy but it does affect the way your profit is calculated and therefore the amount of taxes you have to pay."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"A little help with options? So I been using options the last month or so maybe two. I have made some nice profits I've taken $100 and turned it into $1,000 in a couple days.

I seem to stick to the same stocks, apple, MU, Snap and recently nio. 

So I'm just here to see if I'm doing things wrong. I usually buy calls or puts.

Typically I'll stay in the money with my stock choice. So for example if I see apple is at $132 I'll buy a call for 132.50 or so. 

Now my question is I see people buying out of the money calls and making money as well. Like apple is $132 right I'll see people buying $136 calls and making money. 

I'm not sure how that part works I do know the premiums are cheaper the higher up you go  and the closer you get to in the money the more you pay for a premium.

For example that 136 call might be $60 as opposed to the $132.50 that would be $140.

How do you typically play out your calls? Anything I should be doing different? I can make nice profits but once I get over a grand I blow.mt account up. I've done it twice off of $100.

Should I start switching stocks? 
Am I looking for high implied volatility? How do you find your options plays? I'm looking to expand my knowledge."
2021-04-15 02:51:17,stocks,"First, stick with the same few tickets so you aren’t trying to juggle 30 balls when you’re only capable of juggling 5. 

Second, options only really make money when volatility is higher than expected. Technically guessing the direction right should negate this for a little bit, but when Apple is +-.5% or less for the week, you will be losing money on your options even if you got the direction correct because the implied move may have been 1%. 

Third, keep your bets or risk amounts the same. It’s so easy to go from $100 to $1000, increase your bet amount to $500 and lose two in a row and be broke again. If you keep your bets at $100, you now need to lose 10 in a row to be broke. 

Fourth, find some system, or indicators, that you have backtested and determined to be a winning strategy, and use that to make your bets. You may have turned $100 into $1000 by blind luck, but that won’t continue. Find a system. A good one that is easy to backtest is volume. Use a daily candle and look at large spikes of volume and what happens to a stock after a 200% increase in volume. Set up a scanner that uses that or whatever else you find/learn to make your own custom strategy. Then make option plays based off that. 

Fifth, set stop losses. You’re likely to lose a few here shortly, and it’s better to lose 40% of a trade than it is to let the thing ride and lose 100%. If your system is 70% accurate, you are 30% wrong. Set a limit for how much you are going to let your wrong bets lose."

2021-04-15 05:55:20,stocks,"If AAPL is $132, $132.50 is OTM. It's only $0.50 but that could make a huge difference depending on DTE. If you're buying weeklies for example, and AAPL drops 2% from $132, your $132.50 will drop more. 2% will increase IV, but the loss from the movement and theta will negate the IV bump since it's so close to expiry. 35-40+ DTE, the effects will be less.

It sounds like from your comments in the thread you started with $100, made $500 on one good trade, and $400 elsewhere. That's not bad, but not enough to say your doing well either. Buying options is just gambling and one wrong move will mean large losses. If you have 5 open positions worth $100 each, you could lose 25% of your account value in an hour or 2. Spreads are better for limiting downside risk in my opinion, but are harder to understand, build, and manage effectively.

The farther OTM you go, the bigger the gamble that it will be profitable. Buying ITM options is simply using leverage to control more shares of the underlying with less capital than holding the underlying itself. Leverage can result in a 10x gain in a few days, and a wiped account as well. $1000 isn't much to worry about long term, but depending on your income it could be months before you could save that again so idk.

I'd paper trade spreads if you want to make money guessing which direction a stock will move. I traded a call debit spread on a stock I can't list here assuming, incorrectly, that it would go up with the COIN DPO. It dropped 15% in one day. The individual long contract lost 25% ($350), but my spread is only down about $190. Max gain is $575, loss is $590. I have 15 DTE left so I'm ok holding with the volatility. If I purchased a single naked call, I'd be out of the trade with a loss of $350 in about 3 hours."
2021-04-15 03:30:04,stocks,"Thank you. See how I flipped that money quick was buying soon as market opens and it would drop to it's low then sky rocket up a few dollars or so. I've made $500 on one contract on snapchat in like 20 mins


I think the stop loss option is what I need to do. See I fucked up pretty bad. When I had 1k profit I ended up buying 20 shares of nio and a bunch of other stocks and just kept seeing them in the red. I wish now I had that 1k and could buy all these dips im seeing. I honestly have huge faith in nio to me it's basically the japanese tesla that's just waiting to take off. I don't know when that will be but I feel like it's gonna happen"
2021-04-15 06:03:16,stocks,"You explained that very good. Thank you alot for this.

Im ok with what I lost. It was all profit. I never fully lost anything I put in. I still have about $200 in my account right now. I've always has profits on every single call or put I've made. My problem is I got greedy and wanted more. So now I have to train myself to start taking profits. The ones that cost me alot were snapchat last week. I lost about $500 in a day. And those were with puts.

Both were up about $150 when I put them in the first hour then snap had a good day and climbed up. So now I need to figure out when I want to get out of plays or when I should get out. I believe in my heart if I would have cashed out when I had the opportunity that I had I would be sitting on almost $2700 worth of profits right now. My whole goal was to take $900 in profit when I hit 1k and buy dips in stocks I believed in.

Options trading is amazing if you have a good day but it can blow your account up super quick.

Today I'm gonna buy an ITM call or put and ill work off that and try to get back what I lost. If I lose it all I'll wait till next pay I try not to spend alot."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Does Theta even matter if you plan to exercise a call? So I think I figured out how Theta works. You basically lose value on your call option everyday since the closer you get to the expiration date without being ITM, the riskier it is thus lowering it's value. However, if you planned to exercise the contract then would it matter at all? I'm considering buying a LEAP GME contract, but I'm new to options and don't want to get rekt by some unforeseen problem. AFAIK, the biggest concern is Theta and something called IV crush. Though, IV crush seems to be of less concern to me since I'm very bullish on GME and IMO it's pretty likely GME will remain volatile till the squeeze happens (assuming it does). I think Theta shouldn't be too big of a problem either, since the contract is quite long (Jan 2023). Any technical problems with this LEAP play besides personal opinions on the bullishness of GME? Is some other factor about options going to come out of nowhere and destroy me?"
2021-04-15 03:14:58,stocks,"well I'd say be careful or please don't do this but...

let's say you get the 950 strike '23 LEAP for $2525. I'm thinking the basic nature of your question means you can't afford much more, and if you could, I don't know why you would choose gme at this point, but I digress... Stonk just had a big day 30% gain on contract, so if you buy now and it falls back, you can quickly lose 30% value or more in a flash. no big deal you have time to recover, right?

Theta won't start hurting until you're 60-45 days out from expiration, and then it ramps up quickly, losing more and more value each day. So you'd have from now until Halloween '22 before you have to worry about that. But if on that date GME is at $500, and after 2 years the IV dropped (.77 Vega!), that contract will not be very valuable.

If you were to exercise, then you need to be ITM and have $95,000 on hand to purchase the shares. And GME needs to be at 975 for you to profit. 

Imo, best hope is that you buy right before or intraday during a big run and get out just as quickly. If you're thinking far OTM Leaps are a cheaper way to bag hold I think you'll end up disappointed. 

I've been wrong before, though. Good luck!"
2021-04-15 09:25:32,stocks,Why would you exercise an option? There's almost zero reason to exercise options even ITM. You always make more money selling the contract and just buying the shares on the open market. Only time exercising makes sense is if volume is super low and you can't sell the contract or for dividends.
2021-04-15 02:05:16,stocks,"You absolutely can get IV crushed on a LEAP

And yes Theta does matter


If your stock (GME) doesn't make any significant movements towards the strike, the LEAP will slowly bleed Theta over time.  While you may intend to exercise the call, if you ever need liquidity you may not be able to exit the position at a favorable valuation.

Secondly, you need to compare the extrinsic and intrinsic value of your LEAP.  GME has very high IV, so it's likely your LEAP will have a significant amount of IV priced in.

If the implied volatility of GME falls, it'll affect your LEAP as well.  As of today, it looks like the Jan2023 LEAPs (>.85 delta) are pricing GME @$200 or so.  

So take that as you will.  Good luck"
2021-04-15 02:04:50,stocks,"You will absolutely get crushed opening a leap call on GME. Volatility plays a huge role in option pricing...and has a great impact on leaps. I haven’t checked the latest volatility reading for GME but I’m fairly certain it’s still through the roof.

Look at it this way: At the money contracts in both TSLA ($723) and GME ($166) have very similar prices! There’s a $557 difference in the underlying yet contract premiums are comparable. This should be a big indicator that GME contracts are factoring in tons of volatility. 

Before opening any leaps I would suggest fully understanding the Greeks, volatility and how they impact option premium. Look into IVPercentile/IVRank as a way to determine when’s a good time to open leaps (or any option position in general)

EDIT: After going over your post again you definitely need a crash course in options. 

Intrinsic value = options value if you exercised contract (ie: $20call on XYZ trading @ $25 would have 5.00 of intrinsic value)

Extrinsic value = options value derived from time and volatility 

If you are buying an out of the money option you are buying 100% extrinsic value because it has no intrinsic value. LEAPS have a low theta because there is so much time but it’s important to know that you are buying 100% time value when buying an out of the money leap."
2021-04-15 11:28:55,stocks,Theta matters because if you exercise you lose all the theta immediately lol. Please dojt buy GME LEAPS. You're just donating to citadel.
2021-04-15 12:38:27,stocks,"I mean this respectfully, but it’s clear you don’t know much about options. In general, options premiums are priced so that the buyer is going to lose. Doesn’t mean there’s not lots of money to be made. But it does mean the inexperienced or uneducated are significantly more likely to lose. 

In particular, you shouldn’t play options on meme stocks without a solid understanding of fundamentals. 

I can’t recommend buying leaps on GME. You will lose, and your cash is tied up almost 2 years if you go out to 2023.

Edit: I realize I didn’t answer your question. IV crush means you’re option loses premium as volatility goes down. It does and should impact your decision making. In many cases it’s more profitable to sell the option than exercise it at expiry."

2021-04-15 03:29:10,stocks,Funny enough the liquidity needed to even buy a 950 contract would be coming from my GameStop shares I already have.

Just making sure I’m not overlooking something really important.

Why wouldn't you just sell the contract on the open market then use those profits to buy 100 shares? When you exercise an option you lose the extrinsic value of the option."
2021-04-15 02:15:48,stocks,"Premium is impacted by many different factors.

IV crush is when your option premium collapses *because* of a collapse in IV. A good example would be earnings, typically an underlying’s IV will run up leading into earnings and then drop drastically after earnings are released. This is IV crush. 

In the scenario above even if you accurately predict the movement in price there’s still a chance you’ll lose money just from the collapse in IV (when holding contract through earnings)

The Greek “Vega” determines how volatility impacts your option’s premium"

I figure if I buy a Leap call, it'll be as though I'm holding 100 shares even though I can't afford 100 shares.

Buy a call option that expires in such a long time, that the squeeze is very likely to occur before then. I can then liquidate some of my other stonks and use the money to exercise the contract early and then sell said stonks."
2021-04-15 15:20:32,stocks,"My reasoning for doing this was because it was significantly cheaper than buying 100 shares. Since I don't have enough capital to buy 100 shares, my only option is to exercise the contract. My brokerage does not allow selling naked options, at least for me."

2021-04-15 15:33:06,stocks,That's not how options work. You are buying the RIGHT to BUY 100 shares. You are not getting 100 shares at a discount. Think about how ridiculous that would be. Why would anyone buy shares if that's how options worked????
2021-04-15 05:09:29,stocks,"I disagree, but only time will tell."
2021-04-15 16:41:56,stocks,I understand how it works. It’s not actually 100 shares. If gme squeezes I’ll have enough money to exercise the contract. Get it?
2021-04-15 16:51:51,stocks,"No, you'd sell the contract. Exercising would give you wayyyy less profit and I'm not sure I understand you anyways. Where would this money come from that would allow you to exercise then that you don't have now?"
2021-04-15 17:10:44,stocks,I have GameStop shares. If gme moons I can just sell some of them to cover the cost of exercising.
2021-04-15 17:25:53,stocks,Why would you want to exercise though? Just sell the calls?? You'd be throwing away absurd amounts of money if you exercised LEAPs on a stock with insanely overpriced options
2021-04-15 17:38:41,stocks,"Also, do the math on this... say gme magically hits 500 again... you sell your shares to exercise the calls but now the shares are more expensive so how are you going to have enough?"
2021-04-15 17:28:42,stocks,"Because it's my only option. Where am I going to get enough money to buy 100 shares? I mean, sure the premium would be nice to get back but 100 shares is still a ton of money."
2021-04-15 17:41:21,stocks,What? I’m not selling a call. I’m exercising it. The strike price won’t change even if the stock price does. I’d need 90k to exercise a $900 contract.
2021-04-15 17:37:20,stocks,What??? I don't think you understand options at all. Exercising those means you're having to buy and then presumably sell shares. But doing so eliminates all the profit you can get off of extrinsic value. If you SELL the calls instead of Exercising you will make MORE MONEY. If you exercise you are profiting only from INTRINSIC value and throwing away what makes calls so lucrative in a situation like a gamma squeeze. The only time you'd want to exercise is if the squeeze somehow happened on Friday night after market close on the day your calls expire and your only option is to exercise because they're in the money.
2021-04-15 17:42:35,stocks,Yeah sorry that was dumb nevermind. Anyways no you want to sell the calls not exercise them otherwise you've wasted all the premium
2021-04-15 17:42:51,stocks,How do you think I can sell a call option without having 100 shares?
2021-04-15 17:43:40,stocks,"If i had 100 shares, yes, but I don’t."
2021-04-15 18:01:11,stocks,Didn't you buy the call option ?
2021-04-15 18:02:15,stocks,Not yet. Waiting on funds to settle and then I need to transfer. I don’t need 100 shares to buy a call. I do need 100 shares to sell one though. You were just talking about selling a call option instead of exercising it. I can’t sell it though cause I don’t have 100 shares.
2021-04-15 18:06:52,stocks,You can sell a call if you are holding a call.
2021-04-15 18:08:28,stocks,"If you don’t have the shares to cover in case someone exercises the call (100 per contract), you are risking infinite loss."

2021-04-15 18:11:33,stocks,"But you aren't the one who had the cover assignment, the person who originally wrote the contract does. If you buy a call, and then sell that call, you're not on the hook at all."

Does anyone know any good resources to do a really good deep dive on the stock landscape in a particular industry/vertical? Ideally it would be great if there was subreddit for ticker discussions in gaming, energy, advertising, etc. Most investing subs are just all industries lumped together from what I’m seeing.

Beyond liking the idea of learning more about an industry and developing insights over time from interesting posts, two use cases made me think of this question:

1.  I’m curious about gaming. There is a lot of talk of various platforms like Unity and Epic Games taking the lead on platform creation and the multi-verse, but I’m really green in this area and would love to know more. 
2.  There are a few advertising industry IPOs happening over the next week (AppLovin, Double Verify), and I dont really see much discussion on any of the subreddits about them.

Do the same for Epic Games, Take Two Interactive, you name it. Then browse here, r/options and other subs and post your findings. This will be a short comment as I am getting ready to sleep for work so good luck in your endeavors!"

I was weighing the risk and reward of simply buying $1400 worth of GME shares, or buying a call option with a strike of $900 and an expiration of around mid January 2022. I figure, there's a pretty dang good chance the squeeze is squoze this year. Is there any major disadvantage to buying a call option with an expiration that is so far out? Obviously there's Theta decay, but the way I understand it Theta decay isn't a big deal until the expiration date is close (like 90 days is what I've seen.). Is this correct, or am I missing something? Would I get rekt by Theta if I did this? A 900c GME option with an expiration of January 2022 is about $1253. The Theta on a 900c right now is like 0.10, so how bad would it get as time went on?"
2021-04-14 23:09:02,stocks,there's a high probability you lose the 1400
2021-04-14 22:39:22,stocks,"Buy the shares and hold, esp. when new to options."
2021-04-14 22:55:09,stocks,"This is literally the equivalent of throwing money in water.

First, GME will not reach $900 next January, anyone telling you it will is stupid.

Second, GME is an extreme volatile stock with insane IV, so the best way to profit is actually on the other end of calls.

Third, if you only have $1400 and would like to gamble on far OTM option, VTI $265c Jan 2022 is less than $80 per contract, and I think the chance VTI reach $265 is much much higher than GME reach $800."
2021-04-15 02:34:51,stocks,"Other people have mentioned this, but don't do this!

The option won't behave in a way that you probably expect.

If you own the shares you'll have a gain as long as the shares go up.  If you buy the 900 strike option, it might not print at all.  if GME goes to only $800 by Jan 2022, your option will be worthless while your shares are nearly 5x more.

Also, it's possible for a squeeze to take months or years to happen.  TSLA for example.  If you're wrong on the timing then you've just thrown away money you could have spent on shares."
2021-04-14 22:39:06,stocks,"I’m very bullish on GME right now so don’t take this the wrong way but if you buy a $900 strike price call you will lose all your money guaranteed.

Just today, however, Christoph Rauwald wrote this on Bloomberg:

> The model Audi unveiled Wednesday is among a dozen models including VW’s ID.4 and an electric version of the Porsche Macan that should enable the VW group exceed Tesla’s deliveries by 2023, Bloomberg Intelligence analyst Michael Dean said in a recent report. **VW has targeted selling roughly 600,000 purely battery-powered cars this year** as Europe’s biggest carmaker seeks to gain ground on its California-based rival.

More:

> VW has positioned Audi at the center of its challenge to Tesla by building up its EV lineup and tasking it with taking lead on developing software -- an area where Tesla remains well ahead. The division also is responsible for running an engineering task force called Artemis that’s looking to speed up vehicle development.

And:

2021-04-14 23:43:26,stocks,"Short answer: Yes, possibly.

Long answer: VW Group sold 232k EVs in 2020, the third most of any auto manufacturer. They sold the 2nd most automobiles globally of any auto manufacturer in 2020. They're the biggest car company in Europe and in China, two quickly expanding EV markets. They have a global network of dealerships and deep pockets. The ID.4 is getting good reviews and I think it will sell well. In the long run I think they will surpass Tesla. Whether they reach 600k EV sales this year will depend on demand and production capacity. It seems to me that demand for vehicles globally is still somewhat weak but once it does recover I expect VW to become a major player in the EV market."

They can grow market share all they want but growing market share 5-10% when the market is shrinking 25%+ means revenue and profit are both going down and they'll take the share price with it.

It is not like stocks are directly moved by how well a company is doing, like how delta is between options prices and the underlying stock price.

No, there is no guarantee like delta, if the underlying company makes this much $, the stock price will move by x amount too

A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.

So I don’t really get it.

That’s like if a group of 100 people bought/sold rocks to each other based on what they felt/thought about some rocks. The rocks (shares) are pretty useless though.

We are all just **trading** with each other, and giving shares value. If we all decided no, I don’t want to give this share value, there would be no stock market.

maybe like a giant MLM? Where we want others to pay more than we paid for something but we have an endless supply of people, as long as every generation does it. The people who bought at the lowest are on the top of the pyramid, and the only way the stock market thrives/continues is that the next person is willing to pay more and more. Doesn't this seem kind of sketch?

2021-04-14 23:06:16,stocks,"Wow literally no one gave you the answer: the answer is actually very simple and it's called *dividends*

When a company pays dividends, it basically pays you for holding their stock. Theoretically, people buy and sell stocks depending on how much dividends they believe the company will be able to pay on the future. High earning companies tend not only to pay high dividends but also to increase them with time.

Take Tesla for example. Right now they're basically reinvesting most of their cash back into the company in order to grow it. But what happens when the company achieves all it's goals and starts printing more money than they can reinvest in growing themselves? Well, they can start giving the owners (i.e. the stock holders) a quarterly bonus out of the piles of cash they're making.

When someone buys a Tesla stock for 750$, what they're basically speculating about is: will Tesla be able to give me a good quarterly payment higher than the risk-free money or low risk money I can make buying less speculative assets like bonds.

Will Tesla make enough money to, let's say, pay an annualized 2%-4% on their stock in 10-15 years? Only time will tell. But if you don't believe they will be able to afford that then yes, you're just speculating and betting of you're willing to pay those prices."
2021-04-14 22:31:31,stocks,"> A company can do really well, and if there is no demand, the stock price never moves up.


Not really. If investors were too stupid to ever buy a really profitable company, they would offer a dividend and at some point this dividend would be too good to pass up. For example, Microsoft is currently able to pay out 2.24 for every shares thanks to their profits. If investors became dumb and all sold their shares, at some point this 2.24 would become ridiculously good. Let's say if it became 5x cheaper.... you would make 2.24 for a 50$ share on a company that just keeps growing every years lol"

2021-04-15 02:14:08,stocks,"you guys have already given great and concise answers about dividends being the incentive to own particular stocks. 

But I wanted to discuss also the perception of a company's value. 

Stock is part ownership of a company. So in a sense it's far more productive than a shining piece of gold will ever be. 

Someone once said that the stock market is a chart of rich people's feelings, and I don't necessarily disagree. But if the poor and the middle class realize that owning a few shares of a great company (which is the same as owning a part of that company itself) is better than saving money in a bank (because money doesn't produce any goods; businesses do), then the stock market would be a chart of everyone's feelings. And if traders decided to buy or sell stock based on business fundamentals rather than momentary fads or trends, then the chart would more accurately reflect the health and productivity of the market's businesses as a whole.  

The reason why certain stocks soar and others plateau or fall, is due to the free market's constant assessment of a company's health and productivity in relation to its competitors. 

Taken day-to-day, the movement of the stock market is subject to human whimsy and caprice. 

Taken year-to-year, the patterns become distinct. The market trends, the historical and technological and consumerist trends, become quite clear. A company's innovations and market share gains correspond to (but do not cause) price increases."

It became a path to retirement because there aren't to many ways to generate extra income and put your money to work other than stocks and bonds. Too many people focus on the price of a stock and forget what is they are buying"
2021-04-15 03:57:50,stocks,"As others said, the company can pay dividends, but I'd like to emphasize that it's the shareholders themselves that decide to give the dividend, although not directly, but by the proxy of the board of directors. You don't have the decision power to give yourself a dividend, but you can elect a director (although a single retail investor doesn't have much voting power, obviously) that will represent your interests. In practice, of course, it is more sensible to base your decisions to invest (partially) on its existing board and its history. That's why there are dividend aristocrats / dividend kings. There is a recorded history of how the company rewards its shareholders, but ultimately, it's the collective decision of themselves.

This notion that stocks don't have an intrinsic value is a misunderstanding of equity and its value. When you own 1% of a company, you are entitled to 1% of its assets, 1% of its earnings, and 1% of its debt. How those earnings are treated depends on the company. If they, for example, use 25% to pay out a dividend, 25% for buybacks, 25% for assets purchase / or just keep cash, 25% for R&D / other investment, you will get your share of those earnings - *you* get .25% of all earnings as dividend, .25% of them will be returned to *you* in the form of a buyback, .25% will be added to *your* share of the company assets, .25% will be invested into *your* share of the future earnings (and if you don't hold indefinitely, that .25% will be in a way accounted for in the share price, although perhaps discounted too much or too little). You will not miss out on those earnings.  Even if the company goes under, you will be entitled to your share of the assets sold during the dissolution of the company.

The point is, you *own* that share of the company, and there is value to that, it is not pure speculation. Obviously, the way you evaluate the stock price is individual  and does change based on circumstances (both your own, and global), but it is not speculation. If you don't understand the point of owning equity in a company, you should educate yourself more before investing. I hope this doesn't sound condescending.

I'm not an American, so I cannot say from my experience why it is this way. Actually, in my country, investment into equities is way too underestimated and I think people should invest much more than they currently do. I'm not going too much into depth for that, but it is a consequence of not only financial illiteracy (although a big part of it is that), but also historical circumstances. I wish more people here invested into equities.

Edit: Also, there is obviously too much volatility in daily movements to consider it to be some sort of representation of an intrinsic value. The point is, you should ignore those, and rely on long-term performance (dividends included), during which the charts smooth out substantially and the volatility is greatly reduced. During longer periods of time, the price movements represent the value much better."
2021-04-15 07:00:17,stocks," Very simplistically put: There is this believe that money somehow has value. But that’s not necessarily the case. Money is a way to effectively store and move value. ( that’s why high inflation is a problem, as it destroys the value that was originally stored) Now, companies on the other hand make ( something of) value. As in something somebody wants and is willing to give part of the value they have stored for that thing. If you own a stock, you own a part of something that creates value. Doing that is the only way of increasing the amount of money you have other than creating something of value of your own ( as in working). The fact that the stock market is not rational and does often not reflect real life economic conditions, don’t really change that."
2021-04-15 08:49:26,stocks,"Dividends is the answer.

A young company doesn’t pay dividends because they reinvest their profits back into the company. This way they can grow the company and eventually this will allow them to pay much much larger dividends in the future. A company will generally only start paying a dividend once their avenues for growth have started to dry up.

In regards to earnings reports being good but the stock still dropping - stock prices are based on future earnings, not past earnings. So a company could’ve had a great previous quarter but if their guidance for future earnings is lower than what investors expect, the stock will likely fall. Stock price = future earnings discounted to present value."

It's generally thought to be a component of a Black–Scholes model and is just close enough to how most traders and market makers evaluate options risk and other statistics/probabilities.

Historically, dividends were far more prevalent in the market than they currently are. The reasons for its gradual demise are:

1. The growing sentiment that managers know best what to do with the money (something that is sometimes true, but just look at AT&T's abysmal performance to see that it is not always true)
2. The growing use of stock repurchases. Still puts value into the shares, albeit through different means

Fundamentally, a stock is an abstract concept. You can’t handle it the way you can touch a gold ingot. But when you really think about it, money is abstract too.

As far as a stock price not moving in sync with earnings, there can be a variety of factors behind it. For example, investor sentiment wasn’t significantly affected (for example, “Company A had a really good quarter, but I believe it was only due to COVID and the earnings will go back down soon”)."

The liquidity and value of our assets are always based off how many people want it and how many people believe it has value. The dollar is something everyone wants and everyone accepts as valuable, baseball cards less so.

Stocks give you very little actual rights to the underlying (unless these are shares in a private company you own for example) - with a public company you have no actual ownership in the business, you don't have rights to a percentage of their income or revenue, as an individual investor you essentially have little to no say in business affairs even though stocks give you voting rights.

The idea that you're eventually waiting for the company to enter the mature value stage and start giving you dividends doesn't really make sense to me either - the stock gets reduced by the value of the dividend and you could just cut out the twenty years of waiting and put your money in a corporate bond (which is safer if the company fails) or a stock that gives out dividends already.

By purchasing stocks you are doing nothing actually productive. Your money like you said isn't typically flowing to that company in any way - you're not investing in it, despite them calling it that. So really it's pretty weird that we all came to see this as a great place to put our money."

2021-04-15 04:21:12,stocks,"It's dividends as well as capital appreciation.  The ""popularity contest"", which is theoretically rooted in a stock's fundamentals, and ability to pay dividends, is actually  a recognized way for companies to return profits to their shareholders.  Bear in mind, too, that while 1 share means nothing, someone who owns 5% of the shares, for example, actually has a significant stake in the company.  So while you with your 1 measly Tesla share don't have any real say, whales with 5% stake do, and the price they're willing to pay for that is reflected in the price you pay for your shares also.  Ownership is important.

There's also stock buybacks which also raise the share price in the short-term."

2021-04-15 18:31:07,stocks,This is a good argument in favor of the idea  that the market is in large part) speculative: If we are trading growth stocks based on the idea that they will eventually mature and give out dividends then why don’t we simply buy stocks that already pay dividends now?
2021-04-15 08:17:42,stocks,"Every vote counts. The idea that small shareholders don't have voting power because they hold only a few shares is similar to the idea that voting in national elections is pointless because you only have one vote of many millions. Still voting is not pointless and you *can* make a difference.

I find it very sad that most small shareholders never exercise their vote, which often lets management get away with murder. Our economies and societies would be much better is everyone voted their shares. In particular, this is how we can force companies to be responsible and how we can reduce pay differentials between board members/management and ordinary workers."

Plus, it's not a safe to assume that google will **never** pay a dividend - that's just naïve and short sighted.

2021-04-15 04:00:57,stocks,I feel like this is a major exception. For Google to declare a dividend would be to admit that growth is slowing. And this would probably not make investors feel comfortable.
2021-04-15 04:17:37,stocks,"Did not feel this was a great answer because there are so many companies that don't pay dividends now nor do they seem like they intend to in the future. Google, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix, Shopify, etc"

2021-04-14 23:08:13,stocks,"There's also a theoretical point where if a company were extremely undervalued, you could just buy a controlling stake and liquidate the whole thing for an instant profit without requiring any company growth or an increase in market demand for the stock. Due to the share structures of some companies in real life this may be impossible or require an enormous amount of capital, but the idea is there.

Even if demand for stocks nosedived straight to hell for some reason, there will always be vultures circling in wait some sort of arbitrage opportunity.

The global financial system, or “money wheel” is also structured as a system which has to keep growing or it collapses in on itself.  Both are man made systems which many do not trust.  But enough people trust and use these systems that they appear stable over time and have ways to interpret what might be happening based on human nature.  Eventually enough negative things happen that the entire system and civilization falls apart.  Our present system has been intact since the end of the middle ages.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Disney ($DIS): Disney is the most undervalued company and deserves so much more hype **Before I start**, I love the Walt Disney Company, I am extremely bullish on the stock as well, it is my largest holding at around $5k. I bought it after Corona hit in March and I have a very low cost per share average ($110). I also have my entire family bought in over my understanding of the company.

&#x200B;

**Disney+:** Crushing subscriber projections, Disney+ has found itself in second place in the massive streaming wars. I see a time where Netflix loses its touch and Disney can quickly fill that spot because of their massively known product base. Disney isn't afraid of acquisitions as well, Disney has acquired Lucasfilms and Marvel, and they have an invested relationship with Pixar. They want to own your favorite movie and soon it will be on Disney Plus. Disney Plus has also subsidized the companies loss throughout Corona. 

**Disney Theme Parks:** Disney finds itself in the number one destination for tourism and theme park visits. These properties, theme parks, hotels, restaurants, etc, are constantly being improved and changed to bring in a rotating freshness to all attractions. This refreshing feature of the park allows for revisitation. The constant expansion of the theme parks and their attractions just allows for longer stay time which means more money. Disney's theme parks mainly rely on merchandise for profits, the brand that Disney has built led to endless demand. They have parks in California, Florida, China, France, Tokyo, all of which have the same refresh equation as I mentioned before. 

**Disney Cruises:** Disney Cruises are some of the most profitable ships that sail the seas. Right now the stock is at $187 dollars per share with their entire four-ship fleet docked. Not to mention that Disney has announced and partially built one out of the two new ships. This is a department of Disney that has not even reached 1% of its fullest potential. Disney will have exponential growth in their cruising department as time goes on. They keep information close to the chest when it comes to fleet expansion but I have the understanding that their fleet will continue to grow.

**Disney Media Companies:** Simply put, Disney owns so much. I previously mentioned the endless unlimited universe of Star Wars and Marvel, but they own IPs like Avatar, and media companies like ABC, portions of Fox, ESPN, etc. These companies, names, and movies are bricks of gold for them. They are wrapped and finished products, that pay them dividends in things like merchandise and toys.  It's amazing that they design many characters to be useful in milking all the money out of them. 

**Disney Innovation:** Honestly the level of quality that goes into a Disney project is amazing. It is undervalued almost (same as their stock price). I have picked up on what one of their latest projects really is. Disney is inventing a new type of vacation. Disney is building a spaceship-themed hotel. Not only is it themed as a Star Wars spaceship. It is immersive. You get off the airport and walk to the busses. You see a themed section of the airport owned by Disney. You board the bus which is themed on the inside as a spaceship (the driver is a robot, the actual driver is hidden), the windows on the inside are screens. You think you're in a real spaceship. You arrive at this very expensive 5-night hotel and are loaded in and the hotel has no real windows. It makes you think you are in this space station. 

**VIDEO:** [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DUCDKxXeFg&ab\_channel=DSNYNewscast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0DUCDKxXeFg&ab_channel=DSNYNewscast)

This is **NOT** a hotel, this is a stationary cruise type model. Which is so much better than an actual cruise. Their cruises are so profitable, but they spend so much on maintenance, staff, government regulation, etc. By making a practical cruise-type experience on land is brilliant. Not just brilliant, but this will print money for the company in the near future. They will build multiple of these Galactic Star Cruisers but with different experiences (just like their cruises that are slightly different to encourage numerous trips). 

**Disney Brand:** Disney is obviously a family brand. You know you could pick up any movie, and if it had the Disney stamp of approval you could trust it with the kid. This trait in their brand is so valuable and I feel like no one gives it credit. 

**Why buy Disney:** Disney manufactures happiness. And that is an untouched market, only occupied by Disney. They have a cult-like fanbase that is so brand loyal. At their current price point, they are a massive buy and I am intending the do a couple of calls at certain strikes. They were also given numerous price changes which resulted in their stock getting predictions from $217-$223. I think there is not only a good value trade here, but there are long-term growth and recovery showing in their earnings. Their next quarter comes out on 5/13/21 and the stock is always responsive to improvements in the finances. I can see improvement in the finances because more parks are open which cuts their losses. 

&#x200B;

TL:DR: Disney is a major buy at this price still, price analysts have upgraded the stock to a target of $217-$223. They manufacture happiness and hold brands that yield so much capital in return. Their projects are only going to expand and grow, and that's why I love Disney $DIS .

$INTC - Glorious wedge up right here. If this support holds seeing a full move is possible. I think the low risk and good reward makes this a very appealing play.

$LAUR - This horizontal support is gorgeous. IF this holds we may see some amazing moves. Make sure you notice the lower highs over a long period of time,.

2021-04-14 20:59:17,stocks,"That’s her MO. 

New?  Risky? Crazy high valuation vs current Sales?

I’d be more surprised if she didn’t buy it. More so speaks to lack of genius (proclaimed by many) and just a “newfangled thing” sector she has developed which moves on interest rates more than anything else."
2021-04-15 00:10:10,stocks,You talk as if ARK doesn’t do any research at all. You can bet they’ve been studying Coinbase for the past five years and have just been waiting to pounce on the IPO.

The only cons I see are if certain countries start taxing it more or even banning transactions. The carbon tax is very likely given the environmental impact of mining.

Crypto is starting to become to big to fail, but we’re going to see what happens."
2021-04-15 08:17:20,stocks,You realise GBTC is one of ARKW’s biggest holdings and it’s completely not in ARKF? She has always seen BTC as an Internet play. She has called it Money over Internet Protocol.

I have high doubts buying coinbase today was a smart move since the price will likely go down in the comming days. I also think roblox is overvalued like crazy."
2021-04-14 23:28:01,stocks,"Considering that she's been bullish on bitcoin/defi since something like 2015, it's pretty absurd to say that she is investing in the crypto space simply because it's the ""newfangled thing,"" whatever that even means. She also doesn't think inflation is a major concern right now, which if anything is bearish on bitcoin, yet she's still investing. It's quite a stretch to say Ark is investing purely because of hype or momentum or whatever."
2021-04-14 21:04:45,stocks,They say theres a thin line between crazy and genius. To throw so much cash at speculative stocks is crazy. But to be correct about so many and make crazy returns which she has shown. Proves genius.
2021-04-14 21:05:27,stocks,"I agree, I don't think she's anything special.  I believe sometimes it's pays to be lucky than good. If it weren't for tsla being such an outlier to any fundamentals,  she wouldn't be regarded for anything.  Think about it,  if it weren't for a car company (forget about future tech for the time being,  they are profiting on cars and it's the only proven business model to earnings for them) that is trading at 3x the value of the worlds largest automaker and 1100x earnings,  there wouldn't be any genius behind her picks."

No it doesn't, not with BTC at least. Those coins are still there, but unrealized. It creates less global supply.  


There are abandoned wallets with many coins in them. Each of those coins limits the global supply of bitcoins, never to be obtainable - less supply."

2021-04-15 06:39:56,stocks,"I was reading a while ago about how some hotshot managers fared around the 2000 financial crash. A bunch of the portfolio managers that were hot continued beating the market long-term. But the average investor in their funds underperformed the market. Because they got into the fund after it had been overachieving for a few years then sold when it underachieved over a short amount of time. 

A lot of users in the sub are going to fall into that exactly with ARK, even if she does turn out to be very good."

2021-04-15 06:28:37,stocks,Is having a moat really required for a investment? Lots of people invest in banks and I am not sure they have moats. If today's crypto exchanges are tomorrows banks then now is a good time to get in.
2021-04-15 01:11:08,stocks,And they likely will. ARK can sell later on if smoke is on the horizon.
2021-04-15 03:21:47,stocks,"that's exactly the point. Crypto may be disruptive, but there is absolutely no innovation or unique selling point for coinbase. They don't offer anything that competetitors don't or can't easily copy."
2021-04-15 07:38:18,stocks,"Definitely. ARK’s investing strategy seems to be completely opposed to my own, and in that way it’s kind of thrilling (or nerve wracking) to have a little bit in my portfolio.

I also watch their daily buys. A few weeks ago I saw they bought a ton of Zillow and Peloton so I picked up a little myself and made a quick 10-15%."
2021-04-15 04:15:07,stocks,"Yeah, and does pretty damn well because this market is easy.  I honestly think people (and Cathie herself) are in for a rude awakening at the first sign of trouble.  Take a look at what happened to ARK funds with the rate panic last month."

2021-04-14 23:19:21,stocks,"Their price tracking interface is significantly better for new investors than other exchanges, very clear and simple. They do a great job of showing you which cryptocurrencies have gained and lost the most recently. Even when I buy on other apps due to lower fees, I still track prices on Coinbase because the interface is so much clearer to me. Their transfer from Bank account to app is the smoothest of any app I have tried. It’s fast, it’s easy, you can move money in and move money out without any trouble. No multiple levels of authentication or waiting a week to get my money. They have some nice introductions to new coins and you can earn about $30 without really doing anything. All of these are things geared towards novice traders, but are things they do well. Their biggest weaknesses are their fees and basic selling and buying options without limit options."
2021-04-15 02:28:00,stocks,"For me its pretty much the most well known at least. People stick to what they know unless something major goes wrong with them. ""Hey mate how did you buy your crypto?"" type word of mouth. Getting approved at least in Australia is a small inconvenience so if you already got access with Coinbase youre more likely to just stick it out with them."
2021-04-15 07:09:31,stocks,"People should decide based on the holdings, not based on personal feelings, in my opinion. And I understand if you don't like this exposure, but I actually do like the idea of Tesla and Square heavy ETFs, and I believe in most of these companies to stick around for a long time, but can't afford a meaningful amount of the individual stocks.

Top holdings in ARKF: Square (11.3%), Zillow 4.5%, SE, 4.3%, PYPL 4.3%, SI, PIN 4.13%, SHOP 4.11%, ICE 3.51%, ADYEN, Tencent 3.04%

2021-04-15 01:59:58,stocks,"I don't personally believe that Tesla has much space for future growth (increasingly competitive market and it would be even hard to justify 700 billion valuation). But if you are absolutely convicted that TSLA is gonna be worth 3k by 2025, (we're talking about almost 40% year over year growth) then buying at $800 is still a massive discount (because why would anybody sell at 800 if they think it's going to go to 3000). I think it's an absurd and unreasonable prediction, but Cathie Wood thinks otherwise."

2021-04-15 05:30:57,stocks,I’m not bullish on Coinbase. I’m just saying this is what they do well. The fees are way too much for it to be worth using 95% of the time. Interface is a big reason Robinhood has been successful despite being generally a terrible company.
2021-04-14 23:51:10,stocks,Ui is extremely important. Remember the window phone?

I haven't seen someone turn into a cat on Teams and become a meme yet.

I thought the same about ZM, but then it became a verb.  Google that effect some time.

Everyone I know uses Zoom in their personal lives, and Teams in their professional lives.  I'd rather be invested in Twitter than LinkedIn, if I had to choose.

2021-04-14 23:00:29,stocks,The answer to basically every advice request. Yet it’s the advice that gets rejected most often.
2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"When I hear about Coinbase being a bad investment a couple of other tech giants that were ""destined to fail"" come to mind. Let me get this out of the way. I own 1 (like uno) share of COIN at $320. I'm prepared to buy 1 share for every $20 it falls below that if it does continue to drop. I want to reflect on two tech companies that were supposed to be ""dead in the water"" dozens of earning calls ago. Netflix and Facebook. 

I remember following Facebooks IPO in particular and the internet as a whole (as well as myself) said it's ABSOLUTELY DEAD MONEY. There was no way it was ever going to continue to make money. Everyone around me was ""leaving it."" The valuation was ""insane."" The stock price tanked pretty good out of the gates and everyone laughed. It stayed low for weeks (maybe months if I remember right) and I patted myself on the back for staying away. As earnings gained more and more traction the perception started to change. What was pointed out was that the parents of Facebook users were becoming more active then any of the core group that gave facebook it's start. These same people really enjoyed playing the browser games that most ""kids"" lost interest in. Businesses started using it to reach clients. Facebook itself didn't change but the user base did. As time goes on it continues to make good money and the stock has proven to be a good money maker. It defied the popular opinion. 

When we think about too much competition in the future Netflix comes to mind. Netflix was also supposed to have been ""cooked"" ages ago because of the competition that was coming about. When Prime Video launched it was the ""end of Netflix's growth."" When the users in America were maxed out there was ""no room for growth."" Netflix grew globally and offered exclusive content. There ended up being plenty of room for many streaming companies and everyone has been making money (this could be debated today but I'm comparing to ten years ago here). 

I assume you get my comparisons to Coinbase. The arguments against Coinbase are that the valuation is too high and there is no room for growth. The platform sucks and everyone on reddit is ""leaving it."" There are tons of companies that will steal business from Coinbase to make them unprofitable. 

I would argue we've seen this before. If Crypto has the future so many of you think it does then there should be plenty of business opportunities for everyone. The grandmas and grandpas that aren't in Crypto yet will go to the most legitimate company in the space (COIN). If my kids grandparents can call any video streaming platform ""Netflix"" I assume the same is possible for all crypto exchanges being called ""a Coinbase."" Being first and top of mind goes a long way. The potential customer base out there is huge for COIN and for others. 

Side note: ETFs will be picking up COIN for their portfolios as they are required. A lot of institutions will be holding COIN soon if they aren't already. 

Sorry this post got a bit sloppy. I started out with a lot of good points in my head but they didn't type out that way. I'm on my phone in a waiting room killing time. There are good arguments against my arguments but I don't think we are seeing enough of the supporting ones for Coinbase.

TL;DR Facebook was a ""for sure"" flop when it went public for similar reasons as COIN. Netflix also was supposed to fail a number of times due to capped growth. Lastly, in my opinion anyone who owns TSLA doesn't have a right to talk about stocks being overvalued."
2021-04-14 20:15:36,stocks,"The error in your logic is, coin hasn’t cornered the market. We were all buying and selling crypto king before coin and most of us have never needed it. It has no “niche” that hasn’t already been explored.

That being said, their excessive fees will keep earning them money as people use them without realizing there is better out there so they will grow, not from the point they are at though. They are currently over valued even the original $250  was a bit much, but given time they may well prove they are worth their CURRENT price. I personally don’t see them breaking $500 in the next 5 years though.

Their competitors (kraken, NDAX, etc) may cut into their market share when they ipo as well."
2021-04-14 20:39:13,stocks,"First you are using survivorship bias for every tech giant there is about 1000 that failed. Also most of those companies were not valued so high at around 100b at coins peak. I'm sorry but it is so overvalued it just makes no sense, they have so much competition and their profitability is entirely based on whether the crypto community will take their extremely high fees forever."

I won't buy any at $1000 a ton. At the end of the day, horse sh1t is horse sh1t and stocks are stocks. The risk/benefit of a particular investment  at a particular cost is all that matters.

I've heard a lot of good things about COIN. Cramer likes the management team and the plan. It's almost like Paypal. I love the stock but it's too expensive FOR ME. I can't find a good entry point. I lost a little on Paypal because I didn't wait for a good entry point. 

Cramer says buy COIN below the mid $400. Maybe he is right, but I'm having problems calculating my valuation of this investment. This is also a meme stock and I don't like trading them. Religious belief can change fast, so I'm careful around these kinds of stock.

My plan is too wait for the price to stabilize before I invest. Typically the stock price is controlled by forces we barely understand after a IPO.  I'm not smart enough to play that game.

Or maybe it's time to buy Paypal. Maybe all the traders will run to one side of the boat and sell Paypal to buy COIN.

I've read many posts on this thread saying... just buy bitcoin. They have some good reasons to do so. But they don't document the downside.

You can't buy bitcoin in a 401. Also, there are some ETF's that we can buy but they charge 2% or more for the privilege. I don't pay 2% without some guarantees. And, importantly, compared to my 401 my after tax account is a hobby.

Also, only a fool would not consider what happens when things go bad. Notice I said when, not if. Everything eventually goes bad. Even Bitcoin. 

So, what would happen to me if Bitcoin crashed by 50% or maybe 80% and didn't come back?

I have to assume that COIN would mitigate a crash in bitcoin. People here are saying that COIN would not do as well as bitcoin increases in value but I also thing COIN would crash less than bitcoin. 

So, I think COIN is probably a fine investment, I have to wait until I can calculate, and find, the right price."

Coinbase, while hopefully with better ethics, actually has a practical feature (high fees), that could potentially lead other exchanges to take some market share. I hope they do great though, since I also owe it to them, for giving my start into crypto several years ago, but figured I'd share an opposing way to look at it."
2021-04-15 04:57:35,stocks,"For coinbase to succeed as a company, it is necessary for BTC and the crypto in general to grow even more. But that is not the case for the coins, their growth is irrelevant to what happens to coinbase. Buying crypto is better imo.

And frankly, i would be more confident that the crypto coins continue to gain towards fiat currency than coinbase continuing banking when several other exchanges already exist and offer better services as well. Coinbase may have the first move advantage but for how long will it be enough?

But then again, we are using fundamental metrics and analysis for a company that trades magical internet money lol."

I don't care for IPO hype - regardless of company, but if you have to convince people to invest in an IPO that doesn't have a strong history of financial success. 

To Capial's point, the moat is very small for Coinbase, and once more companies see Coin's valuation, they're gonna hop on board and aggressively acquire marketshare. These companies are likely also subject to a shit-ton of upcoming regulation (lawyer fees).

Will be interested to see how all this pans out, but my intuition tells me the Coinbase price is more hype than anything."

And they show you the top gainers for the day. Retail investors with FOMO will be converting regularly, giving Coinbase free money each time. To start out, they also give you about $30 of free crypto over a few different currencies. If you watch $6 grow to $8, you'll be tempted to start thinking what if I had $600 or $6000 in there.

2021-04-15 06:32:19,stocks,Linux originally IPO'd on 6 december 1999 at 30$ per share. In the first day of trading it soared 698 percent only to drop down to about 8$ a share later. Eventually the company shifted away from hardware production and even changed its name from VA Linux to VA software. Later it changed names again and operated under the name Geeknet untill they were eventually bought out by Gamestop (lol) in 2015.
2021-04-15 13:53:32,stocks,"Don't act dense about this. In a reply below, you separate out VA Linux and Linux, and note *Linux* verbatim was not the IPO. You **clearly know** what I was talking about---don't act like you didn't."
2021-04-14 21:32:18,stocks,"Excellent points!  We can also use other industries to see how they transitioned and new players were brought in:

* Western Union charges a whole lot of money to remit currencies to a different location.  It's not just the fee's, but the FOREX spread which they capture.  They are obviously high cost, but the value is also high because of the ease in which to pick up payments in thousands of locations.

* Banks and PayPal are middle of the road here.  They'll have a FOREX spread which benefits them and also charge a fee.  

* Wise (or whatever they are now) are the best in terms of fixed fees and very close to real-time XE exchange rates when doing global money transfers.  

Any of those companies (and banking institutions) can do what COIN does right now, and the fee structure will be identical to what is happening at real-time.   So COIN will need to include other services, such as portfolio or investment options.  

Retail users will go with what they know, and what is easiest.  COIN is very new and doesn't have the known branding.  Then users will want to know how much they could have made / saved and as such, shop their options.

Looking at Robinhood (RH) as an example.  People got in, but a whole lot of them transferred out to Fidelity, E*Trade and others with no consequences.  It's simply that easy in this day and age for stocks for a 3-5 day transfer to occur and all equities winding up with the new firm."

No it didn't. Linux never IPO'd. Linux is not an organisation but a piece of open source software maintained by Linus Torvalds and a large bunch of volunteers.

I think you're confused. Linux and VA Linux are two completely different things. VA Linux (the company) was using Linux (the open source software not maintained by them) to make their products. They never managed Linux (the software) in any way.

Linux is very much still going to this day, under it's original name, and is easily one of the most influential pieces of technology in modern society."

Actually I didn't - it was the person who replied to me who had to clarify it for me, because you mentioned the Linux open source project by name and not the software outfit formerly known as VA Linux. VA Linux was *never* synonymous with Linux, nor was it even that big a player in the Linux space.

TSLA would be a good example of what I am speaking of. In FA I wouldn't buy in until the high 300 low 400 range, but the public has faith and wants to see it much higher.

Tesla fundamentals are overall not that bad. As of right now yeah their earnings are no way reflecting on the stock price but their profit margins are increasing very rapidly. This shows that they are improving their fundamentals and becoming more and more profitable. Will their earnings justify their current price in the future? Probably not because they are already priced in at a 700 billion dollar company. Me personally I dont care about short term volatility because I buy and hold stocks long term so FA is very important for me. Also you make it sound like taking advantage of short term volatility and hype speculation is super easy way to make money in the market which it is absolutely not. Thats how a lot of new people who go into the stock market with no education and think its a get rich easy scheme lose a bunch of money. I can give you many examples but I would just use one that we are discussing which is TSLA. A lot of people did buy into the hype and bought Tesla at the $890.00 mark. Because “Meme stonks never go down 🚀🚀🚀” You can even go on the Twitter Tesla group and there was a lot crybaby idoits on there tweeting at Elon saying that bought TSLA believing in him and he failed them. Like I said I can give you many examples of people getting burned on short term volatility in the market. FA is a very educational way of analyzing stocks because math and numbers do not lie.

EDIT: Just to add: the difference between the Linux distributions that went bust and the ones still alive is the effort they put into catering for their audience. Many felt that selling a Linux distro was simply an easy way to make a buck, and those are the ones that failed. The RedHats and Ubuntus of the Linux world, the ones that made serious investments and efforts, keep on going. The same happens with the 'shitcoins' trying to make a quick buck too."

No but the fact they never brought anything to the table certainly does. Selling machines prebuilt with Linux was nothing new even back then.

Well, you clear as day said that you were talking about Linux, not VA Linux, even though you meant the latter. That is *your* miscommunication.

Its like if I brought the ""PlayStation"" into the conversation, then threw a massive bitch fit because you assumed I was talking about the Sony games consoles and not the obscure Nintendo add-on that never saw release. Except even then, they were both called the PlayStation, but 'VA Linux' was never called 'Linux'.

> You even reiterate it here: There. Is. No. For-profit. Company. Named. Linux. ... not realizing you're repeating exactly what I said: Why did you bother making your first reply about Linux the OS when it's open source and not a for-profit company?

Because. You. Specifically. Named. Linux. Not 'VA Linux', not the software house, the open source project. How are you not understanding this? 

> And yeah, you can find that link you posted and just ignore the very first result that pops up on Google, so long as you get your point across.

Because unlike you, I don't need Google to tell me that an open source project does not do IPOs, so why the fuck would I ever type that into Google?

You keep talking about how it's supposedly obvious what you were talking about, but as someone who's been using Linux for the past 15 years, it's not obvious at all. When you say Linux, why on earth would I think that you're talking about some software house who's only achievement was conning investors and doing the same shit a whole bunch of other outfits were already doing? Why would I *not* think you were talking about Linux, the OS?

Then you can look at a FHA loan with a 3.5% down payment.  Or more.  Anyhow, you'd be looking at a 30 year mortgage which would be about the same.  

You'd miss out on the growth on your $5000 for a while, but be paying yourself back at a 3.5% interest rate (delta the 6% market or whatever you figure VTI is operating at to that 3.5% to repay your 401K loan).

This is to just get you started.  It's far better to ""borrow from your 401K"" and purchase a house than to try and cash out of your regular account (keep that for a rainy day fund ... liquidity)

Be aware that owning a home comes with maintenance, insurance, PMI, property tax, etc. bills so that $600 may be reasonable - but your geography plays a huge role, as does your first home (good quality, age, size, etc.)

What will make you feel like you're throwing money away is if you buy a house, everything starts to break causing repair costs, etc... You'll be dreaming of that $600 rent again lol

Also owning means ""throwing away"" money on home insurance, HOA, and property taxes. Also interest is front loaded on a mortgage, down payment, potential closing costs, etc. Your friend is simplifying things way too much.

Anyway just being a devil's advocate when it comes to purchasing a home... It's not as simple as just ""oh I'm no longer throwing money away!...""

2021-04-15 17:23:17,stocks,I agree I think it was the right move as is their intent to have more of a walk in clinic type vibe. Possibly even more relevant now with covid.
2021-04-15 17:27:31,stocks,100% agree. I’m a big fan of the minute clinic model as well as the payer/provider integration they have. Maybe hold past $80 ;-) lol I think we will see $100/share by end of 2022 for whatever that’s worth
2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"""exercising"" $SQM.RT (and .RT shares in general) I own a few shares of $SQM, and recently was granted $SQM.RT.

My understanding is that each ""share"" of $SQM.RT gives me the right to buy a share of $SQM at $50. Sort of like a call option, but tradeable individually. The .RT ticker ceases trading April 16, and I think they exercise on Monday.

My question is, how do I make sure these are exercised and don't expire worthless like typical options? I haven't seen any notifications from my broker (Fidelity) about them so I'm a little confused on the subject."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Here is a Market Recap for today Wednesday, August 14, 2021 **PsychoMarket Recap - Wednesday, April 14, 2021**

Stocks traded mixed on Wednesday, with the Dow Jones rallying to intraday highs while the S&P 500 (SPY) and tech-heavy Nasdaq (QQQ) pulled back. Market participants digested a slew of corporate earnings reports from big banks in the US and remarks from Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell

Earnings kicked off this morning with several banks reporting first-quarter earnings. JPMorgan (JPM), Goldman Sachs (GS) and Wells Fargo (WFC) blew past analyst expectations, driven by lower loan losses, robust trading and investment banking revenue. Expectations for a strong profit rebound have helped financial stocks and the equity markets rally but have also set a high bar for companies to clear. 

Wall Street analysts are expecting a surge in corporate profits in tandem with the recovering economy, with the reopening of the economy and a rise in consumer spending set to boost companies’ results. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at LPL Financial said, “We could see upwards of 30% year-over-year earnings growth in the first quarter. That would be the most we’ve seen since coming out of the financial crisis. Expectations are for about 25% earnings growth in the first quarter. And let’s not forget in the previous two quarters what happened: massive, massive beats.”

Jerome Powell reiterated that a near-term move on interest rates remains unlikely until economic recovery, and particularly the labor market, are able to build up momentum and said the Central Bank would slow the pace of its bond purchase program “well before” raising interest rates. Powell said, “We will taper asset purchases when we’ve made substantial further progress toward our goals from last December when we announced that guidance. That would in all likelihood be well before the time we consider raising rates.”

Looking ahead, market participants will closely monitor the report of March retail sales set to be released tomorrow. March retail sales are expected to be strong, with stimulus checks making their way into the economy and the economy gradually reopening due to effective distribution of the vaccine. Economists expect March retail sales to rise a consensus 6.1%, or 5.3% excluding autos, according to Dow Jones. That compares to a sales decline of 3% in February

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Walmart Thesis Statement (04/07/21) Did my own personal DD on a few companies and WMT stood out.  Thought I would share it here.  Not really looking for comment or criticism just sharing my own findings.  I've been writing my own thesis statements for investments > $10,000 for the last few years.  My last successful venture was $DIS and I also shared my thesis statement here around two years ago.  Full disclosure, I've purchased 80 shares as of this morning.  Writeup was completed as of 04/07/21 and I will send my analyses via excel to anyone interested.

**Walmart Thesis Statement:**

Walmart Corp. is growing its eCommerce presence and maintains a dominant position in the retail industry. Walmart is able to differentiate from its competitors due to the niche market of affordable products in a brick and mortar format that is augmented by its growing online presence. Walmart maintains the highest revenue amongst its competitors (listed below) and is currently relatively undervalued due to short-term financial statements which show a negative net income growth which can be directly attributed to investments in online growth. Assuming a rational market, Walmart is undervalued relative to its direct competitors. It maintains its market capitalization as a retail corporation which will reap the benefits of a growing online economy.  In this paper, a justification for a Market Capitalization of $500B will be made with supporting fundamental and competitor analyses.

**Background Information:**

Price as of Wednesday, 04/07/21: $140.16

Direct Competitors: Amazon, Target, Costco, Kmart, Kroger, ALDI, Walgreens, Tesco, Carrefour, Best Buy

Market Capitalization: $394.78B

P/E Ratio: 29.53 (Growth Mode)

Div. Yield: 1.57%

52-wk high: $153.66 (9.63% Upside) approx. December 1st 2020

**Benefits:**

As of Wednesday, 04/07, Walmart is the lowest risk retail conglomerate and is priced at a multiple less than its direct competitors including Target and Walmart. Walmart is currently in the midst of a transition to eCommerce which has not yet been sufficiently reflected in its Market Capitalization.

**Competitor Analysis:**

[**https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp**](https://imgur.com/a/XBizaMp)

**Conclusion:**

A conservative P/E ratio of 40 would bring Walmart in line with its three top competitors. This computes a 36% P/E ratio increase. This P/E would result in an increased EPS of $9.87/share; in line with Costco and slightly higher than Target. Adjusted Market Capitalization to offset this P/E increase can conservatively be estimated at 25%. A fair valuation for Walmart can then be computed at a Market Capitalization of $500B. Translated to cost per share, a sell price of $176.93 can be computed.

**Debrief:**

In the coming year, the most important metrics to watch in Walmart’s financial statements will continue to be Revenue, and P/E Ratio. Also important is Walmart’s net income which will be the star of the show as a turnaround in this financial datum will likely result in an increased price per share."
2021-04-14 21:12:00,stocks,"would love to take a deeper look into your excel file if you don't mind sharing. i bought some walmart after doing a little DD into their transition to e-commerce but tbh after personally trying to order some stuff, i am less confident in their abilities to rival amazon. i think its undervalued relative to the rest of the market, but thats only because everything else is so ridiculously overvalued"
2021-04-14 20:56:38,stocks,"I picked up WMT about a year ago (March, 2020) and sold out of it about a week ago at $136 (give or take).  

* It moved very slowly.  
* Dividends were nice, but growth is nicer
* There were better options out there

So it may be a good deal, I simply found other deals to be more compelling and liquidated my position.  Their leadership has struggled with the ecommerce side of things, the app needs work and their purchase-to-pick fails for me many times (in stock, to out of stock or swapped ... long waits to pick up, etc.), and I'm seeing struggles with their technology and employee engagement.  

I do not consider them ""in growth mode"" at this time and wouldn't consider re-investing."
2021-04-14 22:10:17,stocks,"Me too. But, why put money into a market that is going to take a massive hit. Take your money out. Buy shit on sale.

Yeah I'd say so."
2021-04-14 20:14:51,stocks,"Hi.  Yes, in fact my thesis statement is based on the premise that Walmart currently has a majority of retail market share and is strategically placed to build on that market share via eCommerce.  There's a lot you're missing and it may be better to address it via a PM but in essence, fundamentals in market analysis refer to looking at financial statements and drawing conclusions from data such as multiples and financial ratios.  

The theory is that companies in the same industry should share similar financial metrics.  This becomes increasingly difficult in a blended market where companies such as Amazon are doing more than one thing so their multiples result in outliers from the norm.    

Maybe I can address u/7loUge and u/Stock_Resolution7866 here as well.  P/E is simply the price per share over earnings per share.  Typically, or so I was taught, a P/E under 15 is indicative of a value stock whereas a P/E greater than 15 is a growth stock.  Has Walmart ever been at a P/E of 40?  Of course not.  But then again, Walmart has never been considered an eCommerce retailer until very recently.  There's certainly a paradigm shift in HOW Walmart does things not so much what they do.  To say that 40 is not viable long-term is to also say that a P/E of 70+ for Amazon is irrational.  Whether it is or is not doesn't matter in this analysis.  The bottom line is that in a fair market, WMT is undervalued.  

Key takeaway:  Walmart doesn't have to grow their business through eCommerce (though they will) to increase their Market Cap. there are scores of ways they can do this.  One such way is if they maintain market foothold while decreasing operating costs through eCommerce.  I do not believe a P/E of 40 is irrational whatsoever.  Sometimes people look too closely at a stock and forget the only thing that matters.  Market Capitalization.  WMT is a $400B company and Amazon is at $2T (? fact chk.).  Yet Walmart has a much larger share of retail and more distribution channels.  Now obviously its much more complicated than that.  But to say WMT can't reach $500B market cap. which, all things being equal, directly translates to a P/E of 40, is false."

2021-04-14 22:35:01,stocks,Got a link for those rules?
2021-04-14 21:24:36,stocks,Really appreciate you doing this
2021-04-14 20:51:31,stocks,"Ty for the explanation. But don't get me wrong, I am very thankful 🙏 for your insight and I'm very bullish on WMT. In fact I recently bought in after they announced their fintech startup business. This is because I am more of a business model and leadership driven buyer. Only thing I'm bearish about WMT is the CEO. He has not so good approval rating and when I went through his track record, he is more of a broadening business type guy. But WMT should focus its efforts in efficiency now more than ever imo. WMT is losing its footprint in Asia due to high cost of operations. Also for fintech business model I went in because I thought it would give them more efficiency not because they are broadening their footprint in e-commerce.(Also that part of fintech is already populated by companies like Square and Stripe. So unless WMT aquires a fair size fintech company, their entry barrier will be quit high, imo)"
2021-04-14 20:29:21,stocks,"Comparison only works when it's apples-to-apples. Amazon is growing almost 50% revenue per year and over 100% earnings year-over-year. Walmart's revenue is growing 7%. Even with the most optimistic growth of their e-commerce, I can't see how they are going to seriously compete in a tight market. Walmart's earnings multiple is expanding, Amazon's is getting smaller. 

If you're thesis is they should all be trading at the same multiple, then we run into the issue with KR, which trades at 11 multiple. These are all different kinds of businesses, though they are considered retail. If the theory is all of these businesses should be a 40 multiple, KR is going to be the highest appreciation in stock price (which I don't see).

Saying 15 is value doesn't apply to all companies. Amazon consistently traded at a much higher multiple, but their earnings growth (the E part of P/E) has grown so much, they are becoming cheaper and cheaper. Their forward multiple is down to 50 now. 

Not sure why you are trying to limit discussion on this topic, by saying this should be on PM. Everyone here should chime in with their analysis on the topic."

This fundamental analysis is for me and has been peer reviewed but don’t try to neg it’s bad for the community.

Edit: very flustered that you would say comparisons only work on apples to apples. Don’t spread false information especially when someone is clearly learning. If what you said were true, then competitor analyses would be horseshit."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"IPO: It's Probably Overpriced - What are you thoughts on this? Did you buy Coinbase's DPO, or any of the IPOs last year? As an investor I often find it hard to not jump on board when these big companies plan on going public. Last year we saw a record breaking amount of companies IPO/DPO (480 on the US Stock exchange alone). This year, already over 200 companies have gone public. Of course we are in a bit of a bull run, so when the market overall looks good, companies use that because they will do a better job of getting people excited. It's hard not to get caught up in that. 

I found myself reading about all of these companies going public, most notably airbnb and snowflake and ended up getting caught up in the hype and buying in, when really I hadn't planned to. I evidently ended up getting burned, but it's taught me quite a big life lesson. 

My question for you is, do you buy them? How do you trade them if so (momentum, long term). Or if you don't, why?"

However I have done pretty well with some other IPOs. My most successful one so far was C3.ai ($AI), bought ASAP around $90, sold once it rocketed to $170. Almost doubled my money in less than 2 weeks. I don't expect that to ever happen again to be honest.

I'm now buying back in at current prices and plan to keep on buying for years to come. I think we'll be above $100 again soon."

I am currently 21 years old, and started investing during the crash last year. I slowly grew my portfolio to around 8,000$ and had $1000 cash saved up. I had a strategy of dividend stock investing with some growth stocks in there. 

Fast foward to Jan 2021 and I was addicted to the stockmarket. My friend told me to learn about options and debit spreads and all that good stuff. I started making a ton of money with options (because of state of the market before mid-febuary). I grew my portfolio to around 15,000. I had no guidance I was just learning as I went. 

Well, since I did not realize the downside of options, I was heavily leveraged in options so my portfolio over the last month has basically evaporated. Im down to 4,000 dollars now, and I know I should just construct a good portfolio with risk taken into consideration, but at this point, I feel so set back that I am discouraged to just live my life with some safe stocks and continue to add money over time. 

Basically, every time I think about the money I’ve lost it makes me discouraged in investing in big cap stocks that will make me 5-20% because I will still be far behind compared to where I was before. I feel sick to my stomach thinking about the money I’ve lost and wished I had someone to tell me to take some profits when I was doing so well. I did learn a lot from losing all this money, but I have so little now that I feel like it doesn’t even matter. 

Also I know the amount of money is peanuts to many, but I am just a college student and wanted to use the money I made in the market to invest in real estate, and now I feel like that goal is 10x farther than it was in Feb. 

Any advice would be very appreciated."

You spend about $4000 to learn 4 things. First, and most importantly, don’t let leverage get out of control. Borrowing money to buy stock is usually foolish. Anybody that tells a 21 year old to leverage options doesn‘t have your best interests at heart.

Second, you have learned that there is a big difference between what you believe will happen and what actually happens. You now know to think about the consequences of risky actions. You have purchased some humility. That’s good.

Third, you have learned that many people here on Reddit have not learned the first two lessons. People who grunt, “diamond hands, diamond hands, to the moon, never sell” can be ignored. They have nothing to teach you. Ignore the children, but watch them, you can learn a lot. That’s why I’m here.

Forth, you have learned that investing is hard, and like boxing, you must protect yourself at all times and stop the fight if you can’t. Unlike boxing there is no ref to stop the fight for you. Learn to invest the right way. 

As a bonus you have also learned that you can fail. What you say or believe doesn’t matter. You are measure by the market. A heartless bastard who has no emotion when it takes your money. My first real job was climbing telephone poles. A very dangerous job, especially at the time, where you learned quick to think about things going wrong and how to avoid catastrophe.

2021-04-15 04:13:23,stocks,"I lost $7,000 (all my savings, 23y.o.) over the summer last year during the rebound by betting on a second crash over and over again.

 In November, my balance was down to literally $200 if not less. I took some time to reevaluate my approach to the market (i stopped buying puts in August when I was down to $2k) and made a commitment to never spend more than 2 hours a day trading/researching/monitoring/reallocating my investments.

 Like you, I had become addicted to the market. Even though I lost a massive amount of money (to me) i still couldn't pull myself away. I decided to try to never have more than 10 (max 12) positions open, so i could easily monitor each company I was invested in. 

Since November, that $200 peaked to around $17,000 at the end of January and has since slowly receded to about $11,000. So both periods of decline I lost around 6 grand. But by keeping my head cool and not frantically buying and selling several new plays every day, ive minimized my losses and have been increasing again steadily since mid March. 

My point is, once you've lost almost everything, you gain a lot of wisdom about risk vs reward, patience, market trends, and, most of all, the true value of money when you already have everything you need to get by. 

(Hint: it's not much)

2021-04-15 02:59:45,stocks,"As others might have said, I didn't check all the comments, but while your experience really sucks now, it's good that you didn't make it with lager sums closer to your retirement.

What we just experienced in this crazy last year from the crash until now, was a stupendous bullish rally back to the top and towards new all time highs. Until especially tech growth stocks started correcting in mid February. I also had such a great adrenaline loaded time, but the truth is: this was not normal and that is okay.

Some general advice:

* Your first and absolute top priority should be to create an emergency budget with 3-6 months worth of your normal life expenditures in it. This money does not belong into the stock market and should never be touched except during an unplanned emergency situation.
* Your second highest priority should be to use your 20s to invest as much time and effort into yourself. You get wealthy (w/o inheritance) through 3 factors: Your income, your spending habits and proper investment choices. To massively increase your first factor, income, you should be spending as much energy as possible into your education and value to the job market. Believe me, if you do this, you won't be bored for very long that your option plays didn't work out.
* Parallel to your education, you should already start budgeting. Now this does **not** mean that you're not allowed to have fun anymore. This means that you give yourself limits on how much fun you're allowed to have (money-wise) and plan how you manage your money in general. In reality this means that, as soon as you receive any paycheck or money, you pay your bills in full, take part of it and put it into a savings account (to have fun in the future, e.g. travel, holidays, car, whatever) and put something into your investment depot. **After** these three criteria are fulfilled, you can do whatever you want with the rest of your money! And that's so nice! You have absolute freedom this way and a clear conscience!

Regarding stocks / investing:

* I participated in some risky trades myself recently, but not with options. I use a virtual portfolio to play around from time to time with options but mostly get f\*cked by my trades. That's why for myself, I concluded that this is to risky. Especially short options can in theory go to negative infinity (the real stock value just keeps rising). In short: With options you can get badly hurt.
* **However:** I'm not the one to tell you to invest everything into index funds or ETFs. I do believe that most of your regular investment should flow into those, but, you can allow yourself a little 'gambling' or 'speculation' money. You know, for the shits and giggles.
* If you like to learn more about index investing, you should check out Ben Felix on YouTube.

Some final words: Don't let yourself get pulled down by your loss, it's only money. Especially if you're young, you can still afford to make risky decisions and mistakes. Always restrict yourself to money you can afford to lose when speculating. Time in the market beats timing the market (I know, 'blah blah blah, you're boring', but it's true): [https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM](https://imgur.com/gallery/BlK4jzM)

If, by your question ""How to bounce back after losing so much?"" you mean something like ""How to make big money quick so my mind monkey is happy again?"", you are going to have a bad time. Don't make stupid decisions now by sacrificing your future. Don't be a dopamine addict. Best of luck!"
2021-04-15 03:25:59,stocks,"I was in a similar position to you, at 18 I managed to trade my account to about 90k, but due to some macroeconomic events out of my control, my my portfolio dropped to around 20k. That being said, if you understand the companies you are buying, you do not have to be worried. Stocks by nature are random, and on average a security will have a 50% range peak to trough range in a year. Just hold your high conviction stocks and they will eventually recover if their fundamentals are good and you will come out fairly unscathed. As for me, I just held and I am now back up to about 50k, well short of the peak, but still well up for the year."

Additionally, Nio, Tesla and Baba have been heavily beat down recently. Baba to me is a great value play and I’ve got some Nio as a 17% drop in a month was hard to resist.

I turned 10k into 2k in about 6 months. Then I learned patience, conviction, and how to do my own DD.  I've since turned $60k into $800k in \~12 years.  And in 12 more years, that $800k will hopefully be \~$5mil. The idea that new investors hit the market and think they can consistently time catalysts with options is laughable. You're up 300%. That, is, amazing. Like seriously. Do the math and figure out what 15% compounding returns year after year will get you, and you'll likely feel a bit better reducing your risk exposure. If you return 20% per year on your $4k for the next 50 years you'll have $60mil in the bank. Obviously, you won't return 20% per year for 50 years unless you're reckless, but hopefully, this clarifies to you how insane it is to expect to be consistently returning 100%+ per year. And taking positions that have that level of return come with requisite risks.

Not necessarily true at all.

I work in a field completely unrelated to my degree but have been promoted and given responsibility over colleagues 20+ years my senior in part because I have a college education and they do not.

 I have been witness to many hiring processes and having a degree is often why one candidate is chosen over someone without a degree.

I’ve never bought a new car—the most I’ve spent on a car was $9K for a used Subaru.  Luckily Ms. Heavy Tomato is a saver, too.  She doesn’t work outside the home, so we save because if I lose my job, no income.

I started at Vanguard, but I chase sign up bonuses so I have some in Ameritrade ($600 bonus), Merrill Lynch ($900 bonus) and Ally and Schwab (can’t remember the bonuses).  Less than $5K in individual stocks—its all mutual funds and ETFs.  I got lucky and picked some winners like Vanguards Health Care fund that I owned for a long time but the bulk is boring stuff like VTI, BND, and VXUS.

I'm saying it's a better goal to have, particularly at 21.  And if you come up short, it's not like saving less than 4k a month is a bad thing -- it's just not *as* good."

2021-04-15 12:14:56,stocks,"I would like to explore this idea.

My first thought is that crypto is different than gold in an important way.

when the US government outlawed the possession of gold they had an advantage. Gold is heavy and you need a place to sell it. If I decided to keep some gold and disobey the law I could probably get away with it.

But, if I got away with it what would be the value of it? I couldn’t buy more and I couldn’t easily sell it. I would be dealing with the black market upfront and personal. I would meet under a bridge late at night to buy or sell thousands of dollars of stuff easy to steal.

crypto is different. It’s traded over the internet. At most you would need is Tor. The proper controls would be developed to protect traders because who would trade otherwise.

The problem with this is that I don’t want crypto because I want to amass a pile of it. I want to buy a yacht. Suppose I have a pile of crypto and I need after tax cash.

Money laundering has been around for a while and I image this would juice it up a bit. I don’t think it wise to discuss this illegal activity here.

I think they can’t outlaw it effectively. I think any attempt to do so would create a gold  gold or maybe a better word is crypto rush."

The real question is that COIN is building a security team. Who are they? What technologies will they use? How can they compartmentalize to limit damage.

The “hack” risk can be managed and limited. If I determine that COIN has the team and the resources to build strong security controls then the hack risk isn’t that great.

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Total return swaps tl;dr: Please explain the effect of a loss in the underlying to a total return swap (e.g. the cashflows)

&#x200B;

I'm trying to understand total return swaps and I think I get the gist of it but I don't get what happens if the underlying (e.g. a Stock)  returns a loss, because (and please correct me if I'm wrong) 

a swap is basically that parties 1 and 2 have an agrement where party 1 pays party 2 a fixed percentage rate of a base of X $ and party 2 pays party 1 the percentage return of an underlying (e.g. AAPL stock) of the same base X.

if the underlying outperforms the fixed rate, party 1 makes money and if the underlying underperforms the fixed rate, party 2 makes money 

&#x200B;

>consider that rather than appreciating, the S&P 500 falls by 15%. The first party would receive 15% in addition to the LIBOR rate plus the fixed margin, and the payment netted to the first party would be $205,000, or \[$1 million x (15% + 5.5%)\].

this is what investopedia says happens if the underlying doesn't just underperform but realises losses. If I get this right in my example party 2 would get the fixed rate it would get anyways but also gets those 15% losses it had because it holds the underlying, therefore he doesn't have a loss. but then this seems to defeat the purpose of the total return swap to relieve party 1 of the risk of holding the underlying."

Most of the time the other party will buy it as a hedge and collect some fees for holding it and giving you access to the margin. This means that if the reference asset increase by 1%, you get a 2% return assuming a 2x leverage, and visa versa, -1% of the reference = -2% return for you."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"What’s stopping me from dumping my life savings into a stock right before a dividend payout just to collect dividends? I’m not sure if it’s a dumb question, but it’s a serious one at least. What are some potential drawbacks of doing this? Is it normal for someone to buy a shit ton of a high dividend paying stock the day before it pays out, then the next day just sell all of those stocks?"
2021-04-14 21:09:42,stocks,"Good question, when I was younger I considered it.

* The price of what you get.  The dividend payout is over four quarters and you've got to look at the percentage payout (annually) divided by four.  Still, not bad right?
* Selling and buying a stock becomes income.  That is not always a capital gains and will be taxed at the highest rates
* The dividend is also taxed at income

But hey, free money right?  Here's some experience:

I recently sold USA at $7.60 and it's now jumped to $8.24 today ($0.80 increase) because of the announcement of the dividend.  I bought it last year at $4.89 and had the dividends reinvested taking my share total from 2500 to about 2700.  

That 1 year growth at 2500 x $4.89 is a 55% growth.  If I focus on the dividends, it's 200 shares at $7.60, about $1550 or 8%.

If I waited from 3/31 (when I sold) to today at 4/15 (two weeks) I could have realized a larger gain, right?  $8.24 - $7.60 = $0.64 x 2500 = $1600.  

So if you look at the play above, you can still capitalize on dividends, reduce your tax liability AND have growth.  

Point is:  Don't just wait to buy it ""the day before"" but be aware that if you want, you can get the dividends AND the growth.  When you get this, then you start looking at how to maximize your income (from dividends, and then from growth) by minimizing your expenses (aka taxes)."

1) The person isn’t just seeking answers to simple things that are easy to google. Until you learn the term dividend rollover this isn’t an easily google-able question.

2) This question shows that op has some understanding of the stock market as well as dividends enough to think about this situation.

3) op is able to see where a potential good opportunity could come up and is asking about it because they don’t fully understand, or more so they just don’t understand why it wouldn’t work.

This is exactly the type of question people should be asking. A stupid question is what stocks should I buy to make the most money. Or which stocks are going up tomorrow."

2021-04-15 00:00:00,stocks,"Looking at buying into BST, but it's currently trading at a very high premium. What's ""normal"" for a closed-end fund? BST is a closed-end fund, which means that they don't issue new shares unlike an open fund such as an ETF. There are certain advantages to this, but one potential downside is that the share price discount/premium compared to the fund's underlying NAV (Net Asset Value) can be quite large.

I was about to pull the trigger on BST until I saw that the fund is currently trading at a whopping **+9.38% premium** compared to the underlying NAV: [Blackrock Science and Technology Trust](https://www.blackrock.com/us/individual/products/270141/blackrock-science-and-technology-trust-fund)

My gut tells me that this is not a good time to enter a position in BST simply due to this fact. However I don't know much about closed-end funds, and if this level of premium is normal in any way. 

Can anyone confirm my suspicion or shed some more light on this?"
2021-04-14 21:22:08,stocks,"It's kind of normal.  The underlying assets can be ""in demand"" and the business team can be top notch.  

Like any stock with a high P/E, you may see this also reflected in the premium of a CEF.  Buy a home in a pricey zip code, you're paying a premium over the average market price.  It'll be a premium more than likely today, tomorrow and a few years down the road.

You're looking at CEFs typically because

* Dividends (probably)
* Price
* Underlying asset class (probably not)

The premium is indeed something to look at, but by that logic, we'd avoid companies that never turned a profit (high P/E) and typically choose laggards (little to no premium).  

I'd flip the above bullet points in reverse, focusing on the CEFs that are holding assets that I would want to hold, a price that is affordable (compared to the NAV) and then the dividends.  

I picked up USA about a year ago, $4.89 and it was at a premium.  Sold on 3/31 and made a nice profit in addition to the 8% dividend payout over that time."

I'm also in QYLD for the same reason, but QYLD would limit my upside when tech does finally take off again, so I want to diversify.

Agree, it makes sense that this fund in particular would be selling at a premium, given the recent tech growth retail boom and some of the NAVs dropping recently. Historically it looks like BST in particular is all over the map in terms of its premium, so I'll avoid it for now: [https://www.cefconnect.com/fund/BST?view=fund](https://www.cefconnect.com/fund/BST?view=fund)

My concern though and why I didn’t purchase shares of it today is because it’s a realllly shitty time to buy Coinbase...we’re in the midst of another “euphoric crypto bullrun” and they based this valuation off of a good crypto year.

I find it hard to believe that you won’t get a deal on Coinbase when BTC drops 90% in ~8 months or so.  Let’s see what those numbers look like when everyone’s getting rekt.

Chances are Coinbase will take a shit then (IMO).  I really like Coinbase in the long term but this is like buying the absolute high."
2021-04-14 22:06:04,stocks,"Imo the biggest downside case for Coinbase is the uptick in crypto investors using the app to open positions that they then move to private wallets. Their revenues are based on transaction fees. If the site of transaction is displaced from Coinbase, they are really just facilitating an entry point into crypto. Obviously this is not the case with every Coinbade user, or even with a majority, but it has implications for long term value when the debut price is reflective of a comprehensive bull case with continued upside. 

The HODL mentality also compounds this risk. People discuss crypto as a store of value vs fiat currency, which is valid to a degree; but it ignores the requirement that purchases continue to fuel enough demand to increase the market price of crypto in proportion to whatever the implied rate of inflation is. So far the frenetic pace of appreciation seems seems be doing a remarkable job at this. But once the exchanges become saturated with the latest rounds of late to the game bandwagoneers, is there really still a compelling case to be made that the velocity of new transactions will keep pace with the required volume needed to support Coinbase valuation?"

2021-04-15 01:11:41,stocks,"I think what a lot of people are not understanding, is that the competition for coinbase currently is pretty shit. Binance is even sketchier than coinbase, although with lower fees (they prevent withdrawing of coins, their coin bnb is not fully decentralized and is arguably against what crypto is all about), and Kraken seems good but it’s just not as accessible to the masses. Coinbase’s fees are higher, but still not that high (0.5% max on their free pro version of the app for more experienced traders). Their USDC stable coin is arguably also the most stable/trusted and stable usd coin right now. At a glance they might seem like you know just relying on fee revenue or whatever, but crypto is also just beginning, and they have their leg in the US market, which is a huge advantage unfortunately (first movers advantage)."

2021-04-15 06:14:09,stocks,"Here, I'll give you the real answer:

Nasdaq explained that it has given the Coinbase shares a reference price of $250 “Because COIN has not had recent sustained trading in a private placement market.” This price would value Coinbase around $65.3 billion on a fully diluted basis, according to reports. Meanwhile, Coinbase’s implied valuation on the FTX exchange was almost $150 billion on Tuesday.

The reference price is not an offering price, Nasdaq further explained, adding that “nobody has purchased or sold shares at that price.” It added:

>***The opening public price will be determined based on buy and sell orders in the opening auction on Nasdaq.***"

2021-04-15 05:33:38,stocks,"Edit: Ignore this, wasn't aware that $COIN was direct listed rather than IPO. 

During an IPO institutions have a period where they can trade shares between themselves, this normally starts at market open. Only large institutions can trade during this period, normally after a few hours it's opened up to the rest of the market. 

So an IPO likely goes live at 8:30am but you as a retail investor can't buy any of those shares until let's say 2pm. During this time the price might have moved significantly from where the offering was.  So it may be priced at $250 but the first moment you buy the lowest ask might be $350 or $150.

Also generally if you're not an institution at IPO you're not buying the shares from the company that IPOed you're buying them from an insto that participated in the IPO, they can set whatever price they like. Some companies allow retail to participate in IPOs but its very unusual."

What's worse is that a lot of them seem to actively want world currencies and the global economy to collapse, somehow thinking that will give btc value. There's a ""the 1% are evil"" sort of mindset while simultaneously they view themselves to be the future 1% and yet seem to share all of the same faults that we complain about with the 1% today. Lastly there's a delusional level of denial to the discussion of downsides, they're largely ignored, dismissed with memes, or you're actively attacked for trying to discuss them.

2021-04-15 12:14:37,stocks,"That's not how it works. You're taking the word ""overvalued"" literally. A stock is ""overvalued"" when its price is detached from the company's fundamentals and higher than the financials indicate it logically should be. It doesn't necessarily mean it is worth too much, because market forces dictate the price that a stock trades at, but what it means is the stock's price doesn't reflect the corporation's performance. 

Before everyone had the internet and the ability trade from home, stockbrokers, investors and traders would use a company's financials to decide which stocks were likely to go up in value over time. It only makes sense that a strong performing business would see growth in its stock price compared to a weaker company; investors prefer ownership of good companies. They had to draw price charts by hand, and wait for ticker updates, or call the exchange to get a price quote. It was not efficient compared to today. So instead of speculating based on gut feelings, they would use fundamentals to decide how to value a stock. And there are formulas to determine the ""fair value"" of a stock, but again fair value doesn't mean the price that a stock is supposed to be trading at.

But growth stocks are volatile because their price is detached from fundamentals. Investors don't like uncertainty, so when a stock climbs at an unusual rate for a period, there will always eventually be a ""correction"" because investors knowing the stock has been ""overvalued"" will take profits in order to secure their returns. 

We have access to a wealth of information at our fingertips that stockbrokers and investors didn't have even 30 years ago, but fundamentals are still the primary source of information regarding how a stock can be expected to go up or down in the long term. So a stock can be ""overvalued"" based on fundamentals without that meaning the price is inherently too high."
2021-04-15 16:53:33,stocks,"lol it's not a ""myth"". The value of a company is the sum of its discounted cash flows. The current market price often overestimates the real-world value of a company, in which case you hope not be the one left holding the bag when the market crashes back to reality..."

2021-04-15 07:27:51,stocks,"The price does matter indirectly because they take a percentage of the trading volume. And when the price is low, it is likely to affect the trading volume too.

You can be right about adoption of cryptocurrency and right that coinbase will be the winner/hold major market share for commissions and right that commissions don't race to near zero like it did for traditional currencies and stockmarket and yet still vastly overvalue a company because of hype/FOMO.

And that doesn't take into account risk that coinbase doesn't survive or its not a great company, just an early adopter like myspace, friendster, [pets.com](https://pets.com), etc."

2021-04-14 20:34:03,stocks,"You are entirely accurate in this statement. The internet has allowed for groups of people to wall themselves off from outside information and create another projected reality. It is a delusion, yes - and it's not the only one out there. 

I agree that many are betting on hyperinflation of currencies due to quantitative easing, that in reverse will send everyone flying to safety in crypto assets that they hope will propel these speculators into multibillionaires. This won't happen. At most, the world will return to a managed float system that works in central bank issued stable coins to reduce the challenges of cross-border transactions (which every OECD government admits has become a quagmire). 

The primary issue with the fanaticism occurs when are groups of people deep in crypto  are literally (qanon-style) trying to decode messages from public figures about hidden plans to abandon fiat and adopt currency as new national currencies. They microanalyze transaction volumes and try to connect those with tweets and statements made by public figures to draw a conspiratorial conclusion. This is just farcical, and it's unfortunate that so many of us are aware of the misinformation plaguing us at all times on the internet from intelligence agencies, yet compartmentalize that knowledge about reality off from the part of ourselves that really hopes that they will be incredibly wealthy beyond their wildest imagination. 

I've also been watching and investing since 2014, and as my history has been in cloud computing, the scaling issue is also major turn off for me for the viability of btc on a globally adopted basis. All we're seeing now is the outcome of effective marketing. At the end of the day btc will more or less be a toy for the wealthy and a mechanism for hyperlarge transactions, other coins will find their footing in specific industry verticals where they'll design trust mechanisms that pair 1:1 with their operations, while stable coins are used by the other 99%."

2021-04-14 20:17:06,stocks,"The burgeoning crypto industry will go through a major consolidation phase, yes. It's inevitable. The demand is not there now, nor will it be, for widespread mainstream adoption of popular cryptocurrencies - especially with centrally planned stable coins. Almost all the traffic is coming from investors and money laundering. Investors are all expecting to make a healthy long-term profit but jumping into the pool all at the same time, this is exactly what happened in the early 2000s. Even ripple has tripled in price over a few weeks despite it not being available on major exchanges and at risk of being categorized as a security. 

It doesn't matter if there are a limited number of coins, as the exposure increases to the other sectors, so do the risks of contagion between sectors. You'll start to see trading patterns between S&P and crypto. When growth and adoption doesn't pan out for several quarters, some other reversal or shock within the retail trends, or regulation, there will be a massive correction. That will be the best time to invest in favored winners - but not now. 

The ones that survive will find niches that they can hold and expand within in specific markets, while the mainstream will go to stable coins. This is exactly why coinbase has tripled their marketing spend for 2021, because they need to find actual footing. I have nothing against the industry, I practically breathe high-tech disruption throughout my entire career, I am just aware that the sector is ripe for an external shock and it will not end well when it happens."

2021-04-15 10:07:58,stocks,"Lol wat.


The value of a bitcoin is unknown, and its agency fluctuates on a daily basis. Companies who have invested in them reinforce a floor value of this ""currency,"" but no one really knows what the value of a Bitcoin is - everyone is just buying and no one is selling, which means the price only has one way to go - right?


My risk tolerance for Bitcoin is not high enough, and the currency itself has no real backing behind it. It's easy to manipulate pricing and there's no regulation on the concept - it's simply a belief system.

The US Gov also has a shit-ton of them from when they raided Silkroad, and all the corporations are hopping on the bandwagon because they'd be considered stupid by their investors if they don't.


Does bitcoin have value? Yeah I mean, it's there, but what is it really? We're going through the biggest inflation right now, and I don't think Bitcoin is immune to inflation because its price is fueled by actual currency - so it's actually backed by all the money Bitcoin supporters say they wanna escape from - ironic, isn't it?

My opinion? It's a hype train that keeps getting more air. Blockchain is where the true value is, but I think some people just hear the same things that were said in the Dot Com bubble. People have a shit-ton of disposable income right now and they wanna spend it, even if that means making extremely risky investments, of which BTC is one.

History shows that nothing grows like this and doesn't pop. There are people who control the prices of BTC because they have more money and pull than anyone else. Once they decide they want out, they'll convert it to actual money and use it to buy actual things. What will others do with their BTC? Keep playing in the market?

I love Bitcoin supporters... they're fun to talk with. I'm happy on the sidelines knowing that My money is backed by real and tangible things that have a history of success instead of buying and building castles in the sky."

Frankly I don't see how this isn't a commodity. 0.5% fees are not sustainable, a competitor will simply offer a fraction of that to attract customers and drive the price close to zero like it is for every other kind of exchange. So as an exchange it's not worth much until it actually proves it can withstand the competition over the next decade, and as a bank it's pretty worthless too since anyone can be the trusted guardian of your coins, it's very easy to move them elsewhere without restriction that's the point. So there's no moat here."

Regular coinbase, despite its higher fees, actually does let you immediately withdraw your coins after buying. Useful if you need some crypto liquidity in a pinch and are fine with coughing up a higher fee."

2021-04-15 01:51:17,stocks,"> Nah, it’s a way and has been for a while, to hedge against regular currencies. 

No. No. No. No. No. Bitcoin or any Crypto is NOT an inflation hedge. At least, they have not a single shred of evidence that they are effective at hedging against inflation. Just because an asset goes up over time doesn't make it a hedge against regular currencies. 

There are multiple reasons why Bitcoin can NOT be called a hedge by anyone with even a basic understanding of how the market works.

1. NO crypto has been around long enough at a reasonable capacity to accurately make any long run predictions about how the investment behaves compared to other things. None. Not one. They are all in their infancy. 

2. The absolutely insane volatility will throw the fuck off any sort of regression you're trying to run comparing inflation to crypto returns. 

3. The most important one.... We have not even seen high levels of inflation in any of the major 1st world countries where the majority of the bitcoin money is invested. So how the fuck are we supposed to be able to say that Bitcoin is a hedge against inflation when we've had incredibly low inflation since Bitcoins inception? An inflation hedge is supposed to do exceptionally well during periods of high inflation
 That's the whole point. You literally, and I mean literally not figuratively, can't even remotely begin to predict that without having some evidence to back it up. 

People keep making this claim about Bitcoin because they think due to it's deflationary nature over time it will counteract inflation of other currencies. But that idea is predicated on a dozen hypothesis that have not actually been tested or observed in statistically meaningful ways."

I own this shit for two reasons :
10% an edge against inflation because you uneducated armchair economists value deflationist assets
90% an edge against the dogmatic libertarian whose power and wealth increase stupidly and irreversibly because of this crap

2021-04-14 22:34:48,stocks,"Your argument is a fallacy, because you are trying to argue that institutional adoption is not happening because they are not “really using it”, according to... you, I guess? 

So, TESLA and MSTR (and Square, and Galaxy digital... that we know of so far) purchasing and carrying BTC as an asset on their balance sheets, with the former even running their own node to accept payments without ever converting to USD— that doesn’t constitute “usage” to you? GRAYSCALE growing into an institutional behemoth with $50 billion of custodial crypto assets being held in trust for many of the largest institutions in North America— that doesn’t count as adoption in your view somehow?  VISA and MASTERCARD both separately announcing that they will be moving toward settling funds on the Ethereum network instead of traditional settlement networks, that doesn’t register in your beautiful mind as an example of institutional adoption?

In my experience when an exchange has low fees somewhere, they have higher fees elsewhere.

Most of the bitcoin splits to altcoins was simply big market makers who didn't want to give up market power to protocol changes.

2021-04-14 20:20:40,stocks,"I'd say there's approximately 50 (+/-5) coins that are already being used and already have a use case. That number will most likely grow in the future, as the field is very new and still being explored. Some of those will fail in the future, some will stay, and more are being made all the time. There are already at least 100 different fiat currencies being used today, so I disagree with your claim that there isn't a place for 100 different coins."
2021-04-15 04:09:00,stocks,"Hey there.  I'm sure people are using it, I was being hyperbolic when I said ""nobody uses it"".  The point I'm trying to make is that it doesn't make sense to buy things with a currency that's so volatile.  Why would I buy a Tesla with 1 BTC today when I could possibly buy 2 Teslas with it next week?  

And what if I'm holding most of my cash in BTC and suddenly it tanks 10%?

A fiat currency with a steady 2% inflation rate is much more reliable in this regard.  I'm not familiar with how other cryptos are trading, but BTC is the most popular and until the price stabilizes I don't see it as a useful currency except for dark web, etc."
2021-04-15 09:29:29,stocks,"I've read plenty about it. I see the use for blockchain.

I don't see the use for bitcoin. Nor do I see the justification for any crypto currency to ever be valued in the tens of thousands. 

From all the use cases I have seen, there should be no need for an artificial cap on the number of coins. And the nice thing about crypto is companies can always make their own variant for their specific application. So there shouldn't be a need for one coin to rule them all. 

The companies using the tech should be the investment. Not the coins themselves. See what I am saying? The companies will be the ones turning the technology into a better product or service. Which is where true value comes from."

If not, what is the calculation we can do to calculate the exact worth of a company and why is everyone trading stocks if the exact worth is definitive. Seems to me like everyone has different ideas of what a stock is worth(including the assets) and that idea is heavily dependent on what other people think it's worth. There's a reason analyst are wrong on price targets 9/10 times because no one has a clue. We are all just guessing. I don't know value in general is a confusing topic for me, I try to wrap my ahead around ""but stocks have value in the assets"" but even those assets are all tied around speculation. On top of that most stocks are way above PE ratio highs but no one cares almost like the stocks were never tied to their performance in the short run.

2021-04-15 10:58:04,stocks,"No Coinbase is an exchange, that's not transferring crypto. Coinbase is what people use to get from fiat to crypto but that's only because we are all paid in fiat with some exceptions. If fiat didn't exist, Coinbase wouldn't exist. If you move your money off of coinbase to your own wallet (which they allow) you can send money to anyone with no middleman unless you consider the internet a middleman. Without the internet then yes crypto will not work.

I could send you any amount of money at anytime with just your wallet ID and you will get that money within a 10 minutes typically depending on the crypto being used.

Here is an example of one of my wallets where you can see all transactions to and from it. You can see that I can send money with no middleman.

Folks in the space are possibly even more excited about Ethereum, because it’s already enabling decentralized finance applications (and has many more use cases than Bitcoin). Fees are currently high, but several upcoming protocol changes will make it the most scalable and secure decentralized crypto. Coinbase is a centralized on-ramp to the new decentralized economy - they’ll offer custodial services for people that want them, and as other assets become tokenized (real estate, stocks, etc), I’m sure they’ll host that activity as well."

You would have missed Tesla using this logic. With investing in growth companies you have to think a little bit outside of the box and think about other potential verticals.  I agree they are one Robinhood feature away from cutting their fees in half but Coinbase knows this and are diversifying out of their reliance on transaction fees and unlike ICE because they have a retail component which makes their addressable market is much larger.

Aside from being able to go around the SEC in entering the market, a company is free to have their shares floated at a price decided by an issuer that may very well be ludicrously overpriced **and they're free to just dump it out of the gate if people are willing to buy at (almost) any price**. An IPO, while often involving the sale of overpriced issues anyway, is not really a ""scam,"" per se, because it's basically in line with the speculative market anyway. Unlike a DPO, though, in an IPO its insiders have to hold on to their shares for some time before selling, and that means that their business has to be legitimate enough to survive (and apparently prosper) that long. I should probably clarify that when I say this is a ""scam,"" I'm referring to the *process*, not Coinbase specifically. It's not unimaginable for some charming company with promising outlooks and airs to exploit the DPO process by having their (fraudulent) enterprise valued at some ridiculous price that they know their fans will open their wallets for, and then just proceed to make a killing when they know for a fact that their business is relatively worthless and could be dead in, say, less than a year."

Robinhood sells your orders to citadel which plays the margins by tenths of a cent and coinbase buys your your crypto for less than they sell it to you. Also, there’s a fee that if it super cedes the margin they charge you that. Crypto isn’t going away but the exchanges (coinbase) will feel market pressure as other exchanges lower fees. This was seen in the stock market until we got zero commission trading through apps. Best of luck my dude we obviously disagree but that’s okay. 🍻"

Since you are so hung up transactionfee let’s extrapolate that a little bit and cut the fees in half, if they manage to increase their MTUs to 10 million, what is the revenue then? Also, based on their data the ARPU/user increases as they spend more time in the platform, so what’s the increase in subscription revenue from that alone?

So remember that a wallet is more like a “door” to a specific address which gives you access to your coins on a blockchain, meaning multiple wallets can still connect to your assets. If you own ethereum, you can have Exodus as your phone wallet and metamask as your computer wallet for your assets.

But the cold storage requires the physical device to perform any transaction regardless of what wallet it’s from. I can see my eth and move my eth around in Ledger Live, Metamask, MyEtherWallet, as long as I have my ledger connected to my computer. Since exodus is mobile I’m guessing there’s some Bluetooth integration there."

Yesterdays transaction volume was about 70$ billion just for BTC. A spec to the 2 trillion moved daily in the fiat system, but still not nothing. If you are a property developer and it costs you 50k to move certain securities from one country to another and 10k with crypto, why wouldn't you save 40k with some calculated risk? This is driving the revolution. These people don't want tulips, they want to reduce their transaction/processing costs.

Since I'm invested in anything I made 30% with ETH last 12 month. And due to regulatory systems where I live, I paid 0% income tax (instead of 25%) on this asset. This is similar in other parts of the world, which adds interest in this asset class."

Recent events:

Store count growth: from 2013 to 2020 store count increased from 170 to 360, and expecting to open 20 new stores in 2021. Some of Sprouts' new stores will be in a smaller formats which may increase margins.

Share buybacks: 20% of outstanding shares have already been bought back and recently they were authorized to buy back $300m worth of shares.

Multiples:

TTM eps: 2.43 (trailing p/e of 11) 2020 earnings for many grocery stores were higher than normal because covid closed down restaurants

TTM Revenues: 6.47b (55 per share), with about 4.5% profit margins.

Forward eps estimates(# of analysts):

2021: 1.86 (7)

2022: 2.05 (7)

2023: 2.57 (2)

2024: 3.16 (1)

2024 estimate seems ambitious but if they can achieve that it would be \~12% annualized growth from 2021 to 2024

Discounted cash flow: This is my first time using reddit charts so it'll be overly simplified and i'll try to be conservative with the estimates and i won't capitalize their leases, feel free to do your own as grocery chains are fairly easy to value compared to other industries, and if you i would appreciate a lot if you can share ($, in millions)

|Net cash|\-1320|||||
|Value of equity|4638|||||

Recently they have been trading around 27 dollars a share. One risk to be aware of that has nothing to do with the company is their high short interest of about 15%

Seems very similar to discussion about AI. At some point under Clinton in the 90s we loosened regs for proliferation of technology. This was around the time when Chinese spies walked out of New Mexico labs with advanced tech. 

Prior to this time frame, software companies like Novell, SCO, etc could not sell high level encryption to foreigners without State Department approval. Encryption tech was rightly considered to be a military grade munition.

2021-04-15 03:51:00,stocks,"For the benefit of anyone who might not know how this works, this is obviously not true.

The EU, like many European democracies, does not elect directly the heads of the various branches. They vote for the parliamentarians who propose candidates and then they vote for them. Perhaps only France is the exception. British, Italians, Germans, Belgians, Dutch, etc. they all elect the parliamentarians. The President of the Republic (or Head of State) then typically begins consultations by appointing the leader of the major parties / coalition to form a government. Only the citizens in say, Boris Johnson's constituency, actually voted for him. Nobody else did.

*Yeah but the Commissioners.* They are the expression of the national governments. They are appointed by them.  So in a sense, they are the expression of the citizens who voted for the parties in that country. But I'd be completely in favour of a more transparent structure. I wish there were pan-European and transnational lists.

And you know, the Electoral College, is not really the greatest expression of Freedom and Democracy. Not unless you think some people in Wyoming should have the same weight as California or New York? We do have the same problems with the very small nations such as Malta. But unlike here, in the US it would be much easier to do something about it."

This release on two models, both brand new, on certain sections of Pre-qualified  north American highways. No real mention of non high way driving, driving in any other country except America/Canada, or full self autonomous driving. 

Let’s paint a picture. You’re an insanely talented engineer (robotics, electrical, software, mechanical you take your pick) and also interested in EV/AI

How many companies are ahead on your list of EV/AI companies to work for before you land on Ford? We are taking about a space that has 99.9% job security. Tesla receives thousands of applicants daily from qualified engineers who are dying to join. Seriously, the most talented minds in this space aren’t working at Ford. Bigger and more popular companies pay more, offer more equity and prestige. 

So just like everything else Ford does with vehicles, it will be mediocre quality, mildly popular in America, and they will try and copy from leaders in the space by poaching the talent that isn’t that good and ok leaving to work for Ford. 

Nothing listed in this article is that impressive or revolutionary."

I would be looking at FAANG stocks, Google and FB are undervalued right now. I believe you want to own companies with good growth and financials and not built on hype. If we get this much needed pullback it’s good as long as your are invested long term in companies with good fundamentals. 

Some more riskier tech options with great fundamentals are CRWD (growing at 86% YoY) however it is trading at a very high multiple so you are paying a premium.  Like SQ but it’s no where near the same category as FAANG and it’s currently too expensive. Would be waiting for a large pullback to enter it. 

CRM is also worth doing some DD on. Not flashy. But steady growth at good value.

I would also look at your investing strategy. Don’t wait for pullbacks or try to time the market. Contribute a set amount every month no matter market conditions. This both protects you and forces you in."
2021-04-14 23:59:49,stocks,Google. 100%. Probably best value of the FAANG stocks right now

2021-04-14 22:06:13,stocks,"Given the almost irrational exuberance today we have of tech stonks that only go up, I present to you a very different perspective written by Aikya investment fund analysts on every Redditor's and his dog's darling, BABA.

Note the views below are Aikya's and not mine and should only serve to generate discussion on BABA's profitability and prospects. I'm personally vested in BABA @ 250 before chancing upon this Aikya report so would like to hear fellow Redditors views if they are worth keeping. 

Will BABA stonks ever get to the moon? According to Aikya, the upside is extremely fraught with accounting issues detrimental to minority shareholders (99.99% of Redditors). I definitely think the Aikya report is worth a read for BABA investors.

2021-04-14 22:31:24,stocks,"Thank you for this, I like to hear the bear case for shit I get to giddy about.

It seems like a lot of the arguments against BABA are written in long form but not much different. It was also authored at a time when many though Jack Ma was dead (12/31/2020). So the ""poliitical headwinds"" argument made a little more sense then but the bulk of its criticism of BABA is that the proverbial ""other shoe"" that has now dropped. 

The conclusion sums-up the only skepticism of the profitability of BABA because of shady accounting practices. While I get why people think that's a problem, I think BABA has an incentive to make their books clean by any measurement. I don't think BABA has a huge incentive to do really shady shit as they're company is basically too big to fail in China.

What I mean by exceptionalism might be summed-up this way: Companies are unstable when favorited and propped-up by their governments. What about Lockheed Martin? BAC? Big oil? Would the author agree that a XOM is a bad investment because government interference?

2021-04-15 09:51:54,stocks,"Yeah of course the tricky part (and what makes investing so interesting) is that some of your 'losers' are temporary losers. The old adage of 'the worst investing mistakes are usually sells' is applicable here. You don't want to sell your stock JUST because it's a loser.  


Basically, I stand by my point about selling a stock if you don't believe in it anymore, but this 'not believing' needs to be based on the company's trajectory as opposed to ""I don't believe in you anymore because you're \*currently\* losing me money"". 

Some of your biggest winners will go through immense drawdowns, but if you believe in the company, you'll be able to stick with it even when sh\*t hits the fan (for whatever reason that may be)"

2021-04-15 09:55:49,stocks,Finally someone who understands the price function. People here talk like the market is completely unaware of the upcoming growth of TSLA.
2021-04-15 16:26:04,stocks,"I think you misunderstood.

When adding the 3.8% NIIT tax, It looks like I'm most likely in the 23.8% capital gains tax rate.  If I'm not I'll be very close to the threshold for this year.

So, If I sell TSLA, I'm going to pay 23.8% on the proceeds.   Since I bought it at 1/10th of the price it was now, if I sell $11K of TSLA, that would be $10K of gain, of which I'd give $2.38K to the government.  Plus, this might have the effect of making me subject to AMT, which means even more taxes.

I don't need the funds right now, I expect to be back down in a lower tax bracket in a few years, and I believe TSLA is a good long-term play, which is why I'm holding it.   If I was in the 15% bracket, I might have gone ahead and sold part of it."

2021-04-15 02:01:22,stocks,Hmm...I’ll have to read more on that. How much of their business is dependent on Alberta? Alberta looks grim at the moment.
2021-04-15 04:56:21,stocks,"They are heavy in Alberta and the prairies. I think Alberta is artificially low. But I'm a mid term oil bull (exploration has all but stopped, but demand is set to rise which may have prices pop over the next 2-3 years). I worked in potash in SK and they supplied all of the modular components for the work camp at the big BHP Jansen site. It is a versatile business model. But I'm also very bullish on Canadian commodities in general. (Lumber, potash, uranium, agriculture, metals, green). I think they are poised for a lot of growth through a potentially expanding Canadian raw materials sector. The financials seemed solid and had nowhere to go but up after covid and still hasn't fully recovered (famous last words). Bear case is that Alberta and the west may continue its decline, investment in Commodities stagnates due to environmental constraints (ATCO aids in the logistics of growth, but doesn't gain from prices increasing) and ACO.TO revenues have slid for a couple years. still positive PE of 19 even after a low 2020. Healthy debt as I remember. I've been looking for value plays in Canada and these guys are a utility that doesn't act like a utility (stability and growth combined). Seemed like a unique company in my simple opinion. I also have a position in ZLE (Etf with Suncor and Enbridge etc), SNC Lavalin (battered by bad press and a weak 2020 construction year, sounds like they are making some positive restructuring and are poised to be profitable in the next quarter or two) and looking at Aecon and Bird construction. Just sold my Canfor lumber position, which was getting a little volatile for my liking. I'm just a grunt field engineer in the prairies... But invest in what you know right? Let me know what you think once you dig a bit deeper."

2021-04-15 13:52:15,stocks,It's bananas what the real estate is doing in Canada. We own three small properties in the prairies and even there the price is climbing. It seems to have a few years of additional growth until the interest rates step in. We as a society are so addicted to low interest rates so it's going to be slow coming off of them.
2021-04-15 04:08:14,stocks,"The company has moved into a different place in the past 2 years. People don't seem to recognise the shift is very seriously towards faster pace,  maintaining safety, meeting milestones, and going commercial. You can ignore the early years. There is a new, stronger team at the helm now. Lots of strong new hires. Such as, top director from Lockheed Skunkworks. 

Plus Chamath still indirectly owns about 15.8 million shares of SPCE through Social Capital Hedosophia Holdings — the special purpose acquisition company that he formed with investor Ian Osborne.

That is still worth far more than double the stock he sold in March to fund other ventures.

Don't fault him for his transparency. He would not be chairman of VG if he didn't believe in it. In fact, because he is Chairman is a strong buy signal for me, since he will be driving the commercial operations goals from within, which is what we need as investors.

I think Chamath is great. His TV interviews show how smart and driven (and ethical) he is.

Branson sold 9% but still owns 24%. Same story. 

VG are 1 year duration ahead of SpaceX relatively in putting passengers in space this year. Remember SpaceX started 2002, VG started 2004. So they are not 'slow'. Quite similar in duration actually. 

So much unnecessary negativity on this Reddit. Look at the step change in performance last year. 27 of 29 FAA milestones met. Measureably very close to the line. Strengthened top team. New SS3. Big global strategic plans being executed. 

VG to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🌚"
2021-04-15 05:23:23,stocks,"Chamath has not sold all his shares. He still holds twice the value of VG shares (through an investment company) than he sold. Branson sold 9% and still has 24% of VG. 

They are still highly invested and I expect VG to keep going up this year and next. It will remain volatile but the trajectory is definitely up as they achieve key milestones this year. Such as the new SS3 was delivered on target. 

This sort of emotional and negative talk only brings the price down. It is unreasonable and not supported by the true state of the business, which is clearly transitioning to commercial operations this year on a published timetable. 

I prefer to stick to facts not emotions. Once the May test flight is completed, I believe the share price will begin to soar again. 🚀"
