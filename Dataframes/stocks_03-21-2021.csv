03/21/2021,stocks,"Hi!  I was just doing some more DD on VWAPY. I made few K last week when it exploded and luckily sold in time before the pull back. However I think it has quite a bit of potential although it was a bit overvalued at those overhyped prices after the power day. 

I am torn - I want to buy it again but it still seems a bit expensive...

03/21/2021,stocks,As a Mexican every year we see line 10% depreciation of our currency so that makes stocks in USD a better option for me that of Mexican companies in pesos.

03/21/2021,stocks,As a Canadian all of my holdings are in USD so I get the 25% bonus when I transfer it back to my native currency. I have a wrinkle on my brain.
03/21/2021,stocks,"That’s what Ray Dalio said. Jeremy Grantham said similar thing, but he is expecting market crash, but emerging market seems better investment option. 
Japan, EU printed more money than US per GDP capita. At the end, everyone printed so much money and expecting inflation. 
However, idk if u watched Scott Minerd ( guggenheim ) interview. He is saying no crazy inflation like others expecting, and he is expecting negative fed rate. M2, the money circulation is low bc people are not spending much as we expected. People are saving their money and not spending as what fed actually anticipated.
I always listen to multiple asset managers who play with billions of dollars, and everyone has different point of view on economy.

Also, what kind of stocks would you buy? Growth stocks seems risky with fear of inflation, value stocks seems the right choice recently, and what if the fed start ‘operation twist’ you will miss the big upside of growth.

If everyone is expecting inflation, commodity price should go to the moon, but it’s not. Some argue that the oil price went up. I think it went up because of the Biden admin stopped allowing new drilling on fed land. Less supply, same demand or slightly increased demand.

At the end, it’s what you believe and how comfortable you are to invest your hard earned money.
I always keep 1yr worth of surviving money incase there is opportunity to invest or economic down turn and i don’t have a job anymore."
03/21/2021,stocks,"U.S markets maybe be the best option most of the world has, cause this is a global issue not just the U.S"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Honestly, fear of inflation is affecting my desire to own stock PERIOD. I am slowly coming to the realization that the stock market is fundamentally flawed in the sense that nearly every company without hardly any exception revolves around depreciating currency that is backed by nothing at all. When you think about it, that is straight up SCARY.

On another note, the more I research prolific Ponzi schemes, I realize that there is little to no meaningful repercussion for people who break the law and manipulate the market, effectively robbing investors and Joe Shmoe. Look at the Bernie Madoff scandal to see what I am talking about. The SEC was warned at least five (FIVE!!!!) times that something was not right if not highly illegal and they didn’t do anything until AFTER IT WAS ALREADY TOO LATE. 

Sure, Bernie is in prison, but what good does that do for the people he stole from? For you and me how is that meaningful in any way? You may not be able to bet successfully on the stock market, but you can bet your ass he wasn’t the last person to game the ridiculously rigged system. The more I know, the less comfortable I am putting a single dollar in the market. 

The system needs a massive tune up and there is no-one that is really up for the job. In my opinion, the future of the market looks pretty dim and that makes me extremely apprehensive regardless of what currency I own stock in.

Just my two cents."

Also, where it's based is less important than where it's activities (drilling) is based.

Yes America is going green, though seriously, we need OIL. 

Finally, a tidbit of useful info, but hardly news.

> We saw what happened during the last Texas storm. Consider doing some DD here.

***Consider doing some DD here.*** 

Yes, this!"
03/21/2021,stocks,"How exactly was ""oil"" supposed to help during the Texas storm?  It's not like oil is banned in Texas, they weren't ""without oil"" when the storm hit."
03/21/2021,stocks,Love MRO. FANG is another good one. Located in the Permian Basin. Brent is going to hit 85-90 easy and these companies will follow.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest that you need to do a bit more DD. There is more to oil than Texas.

The Texas grid doesn't use any significant amount of oil for power. Their thermal plants running coal and gas were not (and are not) prepared for freezing temps and their wind farms are not prepared for ice because the equipment for that costs money, and that's why they lost generation. This lack of preparedness for ""occasional"" cold snaps has burned them periodically for years. They have plenty of natural gas and wind - what they are missing is the motivation to actually harden their systems for cold events that are nothing-burger for the same systems in colder climates. It had nothing to do with the availability of oil or any other fuel.

The US and world market (and OPEC, a cartel) set the price of oil, and oil demand is driven mostly by transportation and shipping. It doesn't matter if Rick Perry or Greta Thunberg is the governor of Texas; state politics means nothing in that market. 

US producers are in a pickle. Demand is down and OPEC is controlling price with production limits. If US producers start ramping up supply they will drive the price back down. OPEC can and will flood the market and drive the price down to a point where US producers can't compete."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Well I did look at OXY. Being old and being told I'm wise,  OXY didn't hit me the same way.  It is a GREAT company, Had I more money i would've bought some. Chose to go YOLO in the oil sector with MRO and put all my spare change there.  And while I appreciate and value your DD; I have been in the stock market for 30+ years. Not professionally. Just a player. I dont short, do calls. puts; options or even play squeezy, because i have a day job that keeps my mind in another space. An oil stock is all about perception. And  yes, you are right, the oil grid isn't ""dependent: on oil. Though people in Texas dont necessarily know that.  And you gotta' use your marketing brain in this equation. Marathon Oil is being pumped and NOT dumped. I've ridden it from three to higher than where it is right now.  11 something? Should it downtick tomorrow, I'll be picking up a few more shares. (I spent more money on a dinner with friends than a few shares of this stock costs.)  I am also not selling unless i catch a whiff of trouble ahead. (My tribe sends smoke signals). I've made more money on MRO, faster, than ANY stock in my portfolio since a month before i joined Reddit. (Im a new poster here though I have lurked on Reddit FOREVER. Do not own GME or AMC) I think OXY doesnt have the retail MOJO Marathon Oil has. I also  think you are one smart/savvy investor. However, most people arent like you. They don't think. They emote and react viscerally. There's something about Marathon/MRO that sparks the spirit of many Americans. And Texans. Old cowboys, cowgirls and greenhorns alike are now investing in this stock. Im riding their enthusiasm and it's a blast. And marketing-wise, think about it. Fundamentals didnt move GME and AMC;  retail investors did. Look what happened when the word got out about those companies which are NOT worth their stock price?  However,  I found MRO on Wall Street Bets and then saw some hype about them on Robinhood. That got my curiosity up real early. As for DD, lets say that's what I do for my day job Investigate. Backgrountd, asett checks, looking for shell companies, hunting liars, cheats, thieves and monsters. So trust me on this, I have done my DD on MRO.  And the key people who run  it.  Now I'm just settin' here on my day off, looking forward to sunset; another sunrise; and another MRO uptick. And should she go red, I'll be buying more. I do  think you are in a great place with OXY. Happy trails and trades to you."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Haha ..  I think the idea is people, going forward, will rely on kerosene tanks for heating as they are more reliable vs. the grid."
03/21/2021,stocks,"well some people froze to death because of no energy. Its about perception, because perception is reality. Texas ""forgot"" to maintain windmills for winter. They were so screwed their politicans left town. And  Texans who are Red hate Green energy. When you got a Texas Oil Company (Marathon Oil) there's a sense of state and domestic brand and product loyalty. i think the storm brought that home. Texas says ""next year this aint gonna happen again."" Thus Buffet recently bought a huge load of Exxon. Same day,  I bought  a load of  MRO. A bit less expensive, lol. Been buying on the dowitck since. i am NOT a shill. I am a Boomer who hates seeing people lose money/everything in the market. Because that happened to me once. Just Sayin'. Been looking at real loss porn out there, its pretty disturbing to know how deperate these people are going to be when their losses sink in. The market shows no mercy."
03/21/2021,stocks,FANG is great.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'd suggest you are way smarter than your average bear. or bull. Do you think the majority on investors in GME or AMC truly comprehend funadmentals?

You are a very intelligent stock savvy person living among some real dodos. People are now buying stock based on their gut and the hype. I am investing in this company long terms based on the fundamental. And yes, their MOJO."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Texas shutdown because their FOSSIL FUEL power plants weren’t running or winterized, windmills were marginally at fault here."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The main reason Texas lost power was because their gas wells weren't winterized and froze.  The oil refineries also shut down.  The windmills did too, but they are a smaller portion of electricity than the gas/fossil fuel portion.

I don't get how oil is related to the Texas freeze at all.  The problem that causes it was deregulation, not a specific type of energy production."
03/21/2021,stocks,most people in texas are pissed at their current politicians. allegedly there are some Republican polticians and donors politically and financially invested in this company. that may or may not be true.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The price of the stock on its own has absolutely nothing to do with its inherent value because you also need to account for the number of shares issued in tandem with its valuation. A low stock price does not mean it’s “cheap” or some kind of good find. If you have an account with one of the major brokers, you can buy fractional shares of companies of any size, and that lets you decide what you actually want to own for whatever reason totally independent of price constraints. Seriously, looking at the price in a vacuum is a mistake."
03/21/2021,stocks,Individual share price has no significance whatsoever. Invest in companies you believe in and buy fractional shares if your budget is limited.
03/21/2021,stocks,ZNGA is a really good company under $10. They're kind of dominating the entire mobile game space and they generate a lot of revenue.
03/21/2021,stocks,">Lately, I have been trying to find some actually solid stocks/ETFs trading for less than $10/share (or in that ballpark) as an attempt to leverage my limited capital a little bit more.

you have a fundamental misunderstanding of what stock price even means.  low price stocks dont let you ""leverage"" anything.  no matter how many shares of something you have, if it goes up 10% you go up 10%.

penny stocks are bad because good companies dont start off as penny stocks.  bad companies become penny stocks because they have no earnings so they have to raise money through serial dilution, or they are just bad companies and stockholders have no faith in them.

theyre also bad because they might not have enough volume to be liquid.  you might not be able to sell when you want to sell, or might have to get a much lower price.


if you have $100, why not buy $100 of amazon?  or apple?  fractional shares are a thing."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I used to be super bullish on self driving cars and thought that it would 100% be a thing by ~2025, but I'm getting less and less sure that it comes soon.

For one, considering how bad actual drivers are, self dirving has to be better almost by default to garner any confidence. And of course there are going to be million roadblocks, from weird accidents that are bound to happen that will slow down legislature to software bugs, cybersafety concerns and at the end things the good old moral dilemma of who should the car protect in a crash and so on.

It may end up being one of those things where getting 80% of the way there was easy, but the last 20% will take a decade. Still, self driving is coming, just maybe slower than we expected."

For example you have a 1-107 chance of dying in a motor vehicle accident, the odds of dying in a plane crash is 1 in 11 million yet more people are comfortable driving than flying and these companies understand that and airlines especially have spent the last century making planes as safe as possible. Point being a single crash from these ai cars will scare people. Elon may be optimistic, it took airlines decades to improve safety to a satisfactory area. But honestly this is brand new technology and there’s really no way to guess."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah with FSD he is off his nut. The problems you're seeing are because of what everyone's been saying this whole time - you can't do this reliably enough with computer vision. Their competitors are way ahead with LiDAR because it's reliable.

Aside from the fact that it drives incredibly weirdly, it fails to reliably detect cars right in front of it... Elon has balls releasing this, it shows just how far behind he really is. Perhaps he can't justify the risk of lying about it anymore."

The same is going to be true for AI drivers. Until as you say - they are as if not more safe than airplanes - it is going to be hard to convince most people to ""trust"" the software to keep them safe, and allow people to be comfortable giving up ""Control"".

03/21/2021,stocks,"Shareholders are the only owners of a company.  Shares are either common stock or preferred.  A company can buy back and own its own shares (when this happens it’s called treasury stock).  For most companies the largest owners are mutual funds or other institutional investors.  If a company is publicly traded then all the shares are public.  Preferred stock percentage can vary but it’s Usually less than common.  Preferred share benefits:  usually has a higher dividend and people use this as an income strategy, has claim on income above common shareholders— so if company goes bankrupt they get paid before common but after debt holders.  I believe that yes anyone can own preferred shares.  Can it be both public and private: no"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Shareholders own the equity in a company and it can be split among common and preferred holders. Some are available to trade, some can be non tradable. 



Bond holders own the assets of the company and the bonds can trade or not depends on the company. 

Stock options are in theory ownership in a company but do not have votes unless exercised."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Private companies are owned by partners and you can’t trade them, similar to the way law firms operate. They are owned by their “shareholders” who happen to be partners. 

Once company goes public, then we regular investors can become part owners. 

In some cases one entity can own more than 50% of the company. For example, POAHY (Porsche holding company) owns 53% of Volkswagen’s ordinary shares. So they control voting rights. But you can also buy those ordinary shares and be a part owner of VW. So all of us, regular investors, would own 47% of ordinary shares and POAHY would own the other 53%. The rest of the company is owned by shareholders holding preferred stock. But yes, shareholders all combined own the company. 

Bond holders are not owners of the company.  In case of bankruptcy through, they get paid first."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Shareholders means owners.  So, what you're really asking is How much of a company is owned by the owners?"

03/21/2021,stocks,"But is the entire company always owned by shareholders?

Are there cases where a private person owns half and puts the other 50% on the market?

03/21/2021,stocks,Bond holders do not “own” the assets. They have a contractual claim to certain amount of assets and preferential treatment in the event of bankruptcy.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Where can we usually find information about how much of the company is owned by executives, institutional investors etc in a much easier way? As I understand it can be found in the annual report but it there a summary of it in a website or somewhere else? Thanks"

03/21/2021,stocks,"You might be getting caught up in terminology. There are many cases where a person or group owns more than 50% of the company. They are still considered shareholders. 

Someone will probably point out cases where this is not the case, but as a C-Corp, you will issue shares/sell to all owners. Those shares then can (but not always) be traded on open markets which transfers the ownership. Shares can, but not always, have voting rights in the company. This can get tricky as some shares can be issued with different voting rights (10 votes per share for example). Example of this is Facebook. 

So although we determined it is possible to own 50% or above of a company, usually outside investors do not like this, as the majority shareholder can vote for things that can negatively impact minority shareholders."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Good question.  This is a corporate governance topic.  Yes, look up Carl Icahn and hostile takeovers.  Once an individual accumulated a certain amount of outstanding shares they must file with the sec...5% I think.  Umm yes so if one person owns 100% and then takes it public, yes they could own the other half and do the other half as an IPO"
03/21/2021,stocks,But Typically there are other investors involved between when a person owns 100% then does an IPO.  Usually they go through VC funding stages and the VC company takes some ownership position.
03/21/2021,stocks,finviz.com is generally somewhat reliable but don't take it as gospel I've seen them have incorrect #s before. Better than like yahoo finance's numbers usually though
03/21/2021,stocks,The info online is often incorrect or not up to date. Only the annual reports should be relied on.
03/21/2021,stocks,"What's that got to do with anything?  Private companies have shareholders also.  Private just means it isn't publicly traded.

edit:  Or are you asking how much is a public company privately owned?  The answer to that is none."
03/21/2021,stocks,Thanks!!
03/21/2021,stocks,Ok thanks.
03/21/2021,stocks,Well half of the company isn't traded but part is is what I was asking.  I guess the answer is no.
03/21/2021,stocks,So?  You are still a shareholder.
03/21/2021,stocks,Just Barstool hype imo
03/21/2021,stocks,"They’re pivoting. I don’t think it’s fair to compare revenues for anything in 2020 - their core business was basically shuttered the entire year (casinos).

They’re now spending to expand into sports betting in many states. They are poised for a huge surge in revenue once more states open up to sports betting and their regional physical casinos can open to the old normal. 

They’ve also been wildly successful with their online sports book compared to others in the states they’re in. December 2020 they had a 19% hold (profit from all bets; [source](https://twitter.com/darrenrovell/status/1351636718437490688?s=21)). Industry “normal” is between 5-10%, with anything above 10% is seen as an unreal profit.

Their differentiation between them an DKNG, FD, MGM, etc - is they aren’t spending millions on promos and advertising. Penn’s purchase of a portion of Barstool has allowed them to have a built in marketing army that doesn’t need to offer $500 play credit with initial deposits or needs to run advertisement during nationwide sporting events (disclosure - I don’t live in a state where Penn operates an online sports book - they very well may be advertising hard in those states). Barstool does their shtick, makes money for themselves through their sponsors with their streams, shows, blogs, events (launch weekend in Chicago this weekend for example) and makes money for PENN through their droves of fans using Barstool Sportsbook as their online interface. 

They’re only operating in 5 states or so (no research but I think it’s just NJ, PA, MI, IL for now - I’m sure I’m missing somewhere). I think the price is reflective of the inevitability of it coming to 20, 30, eventually 50 states plus territories.

While I think they’re probably overvalued on today’s metrics - I see the appeal long term with the projection they can duplicate their current success in the states they’re operating in when then add other states (note: currently not in FL, CA, NY, TX, OH, GA, NC - 7 of the top 10 states in terms of population). 

Disclosure - I am long in DKNG and think the TAM for online sports betting is HUGE and will be eventually legalized in all 50 states in one form or another."
03/21/2021,stocks,Sounds to me like it’s a little bit of all the above.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Three things.  A 12 month comparison is against a world that was fully, totally, utterly closed, including every sport.  Today, every sport is re-opening.  

Secondly, same concept, but with the casinos re-opening.  

Thirdly, state after state after state are approving online gambling."
03/21/2021,stocks,You must be new to the market..
03/21/2021,stocks,I got in at $12 last year and sold at like $60. Happy with the profit but really didn’t expect it to shoot to $100 plus
03/21/2021,stocks,"Just don't buy overpriced stuff like this, yes the market is quite irrational right now my opinion is this is the second largest bubble of all time even surpassing dot com, but there is some value in the US and abroad or emerging markets are great. The simple fact is the higher you bid up the price in the short term the lower long term returns will be its just inevitable you can't have your cake and eat it too, either it all comes crashing down, or people can enjoy super low returns for years, judging by the past its likely the former."
03/21/2021,stocks,"PENN has been good to me and I’ll
keep buying as long as the trajectory is up."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Bullish on PENN and all the gambling stocks in general. Online sports gambling is a massive market right now and it will only continue to get bigger with more states legalizing. Without Barstool, Penn would of been dead competing against Fanduel, Draftkings, and MGM."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You realize they own 50 on premise casinos and racetracks. That was obviously going to decline last year. But purchased a 33 percent stake in Barstool Sportsbook, with the option to purchase it all in the next 3 years. The TAM for sports gambling is much higher than cannabis with a much shorter road to legalization and immediate profitability. Draftkings analysts are projecting them to continue to lose money in the 3 year outlook, but it has a 50 billion dollar market cap and no onsite premises in a reopening. Sports Gambling is one of the easiest justifiable secular growth stories and there are very few players."
03/21/2021,stocks,The shareholders and company are feeling like a gamble
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sports gambling is going to be extremely profitable. It’s highly addictive and people will have easy access to it. Once every state legalized it, it will even better. Barriers to entry are low so this growth probably won’t last. 

I don’t have any positions in PENN, but BETZ is a huge chunk of my portfolio."
03/21/2021,stocks,"True, the market is currently priced in for years from now, it's crazy how the PE ratios have changed too. The DOW PE ratio has doubled since 2019 btw and the S&P 500 average PE ratio is almost the same as 2000.

03/21/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/21/2021,stocks,Yes paper hands Portnoy gonna pump! pump! pump! & most importantly dump before the rest
03/21/2021,stocks,"100% agree and am also long on DKNG for same reasons.  Now, if PENN ever came back down to earth, I would definitely consider pouncing (although doesn't seem likely in short term)."
03/21/2021,stocks,Good post. This is why I own BETZ
03/21/2021,stocks,"There's a lot of truth to what you're saying but to say that we are ""surpassing the dot com bubble"" is ludicrous. There may be a bubble since many companies are absurdly overvalued but it's nothing like the dot com bubble. These companies may be currently overvalued but they are still valuable in the long term. The dot com bubble saw any company that could get themselves a "".com"" turning into a billion dollar company overnight for no apparent reason lol. Comparing the two is a like apples to bowling balls."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I dont think that's what he's really getting at with this post, the fact that when revenue declines 32% yet the stock goes up 1300% is indicative of irrational exuberance, you may be bullish on penn but this is some heavy speculation and this is happening all over the place and tbh there are some really bad ones like riot which has a profit margin of -250% and a p/s of 500 and is valued at 5b."
03/21/2021,stocks,That’s NOT PENN NATIONAL THO
03/21/2021,stocks,My prediction is that Portnoy will day trade gme and just miss the blastoff.  He will also behold penn far too long.  He will age dramatically from FOMO.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Also, to your point, the 10-year yield is still lower than the S&P earnings yield.

But to Comment OP's point, things are as expensive as they were back in 1999.

So with both things factored in, I see prices at the best stay the same for the next year while earnings improve, driving down multiples."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm talking about every aspect of the bubble, we have the most overvalued bond market plus a very overvalued stock market alongside a massive real estate bubble, yes dot com had a larger stock market bubble but we have a larger bubble as a whole"
03/21/2021,stocks,The revenue decline was because of Covid because they own many casinos.  DKNG is valued at 28B when they did 322 million in 2020 revenue.  The market in general is very high on sports gambling right now
03/21/2021,stocks,"That's not quite a good thing lol, it just kinda demonstrates how euphoric things are."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think you are underestimating how big the sports betting market is. It's predicted the march madness event alone (Mar 18 - Apr 5) is going to generate $2 Billion revenue alone with the states that allow sports gambling. Now imagine when it gets legalized everywhere and all it takes is a push of a button to submit a bet.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I understand that, but the speculation is what I'm focusing on not necessarily if or of if not sports betting will be big"
03/21/2021,stocks,"How about this for speculation... over the next year, talk about increasing taxes will only increase, and there may be historically high chances for that to happen in a good way with progressive influence in govt, leading to massive price drops in companies like these when the earnings go for a blip."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I hope I'm badly misunderstanding your question here and that the concept of abnormal returns is actually some sort of rare, genius-level finance concept...

Abnormal returns? Like out of the ordinary? First you need to know what normal returns are, and I would hope you've gotten a grasp of where to start looking for that type of information before you start a freaking *dissertation*."
03/21/2021,stocks,I would say no? Need to describe what you mean more
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’m really quite clueless as it’s my first ever research, do you mind helping me out?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"“A thesis or dissertation is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings.”

I can’t get past the part where you’re writing a dissertation and don’t understand how to start researching average returns. (“Hey Google, what’s the average return of the S&P 500?” Is a really good start, btw.)

Tell me about this dissertation. Is it for a degree? From a higher learning institution? It implies you have studied the topic for multiple years before starting the project. What have you studied?"
03/21/2021,stocks,Do some research and learn ffs rather than ask Reddit to spoon feed you
03/21/2021,stocks,I live life the easy way ;)
03/21/2021,stocks,"Hi.  As a head of Data science, i evaluated both Snowflake and Databricks.  At the end of the day, both are excellent tools.  I personally chose Snowflake.  Why? Because the total cost of a fully automated data warehouse solution was extremely compelling.  We are a midsize firm that has big firm data needs.  The fact that i don’t need expensive database administrators to manage our data infrastructure is extremely compelling.  

Tbh when i selected Snowflake almost 3 years ago it was a bit of a career risk. Fortunately the solution has been incredible and they have lived up to their promises

Now. Back to stock.  Do i like databricks? Sure. But it’s more a solution for experts and has a higher TCO imho.   The valuations seem a bit ahead of their growth.  Is it a great product? Yes. Do i see it growing to a 100b firm???  Maybe but i am personally betting on SNOW first"
03/21/2021,stocks,I also have had my eye on databricks and was wonder what anyone thought about them possibly taking the spac route or direct listing as opposed to a traditional ipo
03/21/2021,stocks,"Invest in Swee Lim, god of rest.li— ditching virgin LinkedIn for his big chad IPO databricks next play

I’m jk I don’t know wtf I’m talking about I just hate voyager API"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Been waiting for Databricks as well. At a valuation of $29BB, it’s possible that it can go via the SPAC route, but if I were to speculate, I’d guess that it’s more likely they’ll go with either a traditional IPO or a direct listing."
03/21/2021,stocks,I was leaning towards direct listing also especially considering the volatility of the spac market
03/21/2021,stocks,Direct listing is also what I was expecting
03/21/2021,stocks,"""Performance is shown on a Net Asset Value (NAV) basis, with gross income reinvested where applicable."" Maybe it is because of unprecice reinvestment? Could be because tracking error is very small."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you are investing over the long term and dollar cost averaging, you can use a leveraged ETF that tracks the S&P and just buy that. I saw someone posted that they only bought triple leveraged DIA, SPY and QQQ over 10 years and crushed the S&P. The only thing is when you have a correction like last March you're going to lose 90% of your portfolio value but if you are buying consistently through dips and/or Hodl long-term you will win"
03/21/2021,stocks,So you think that the benchmark is not accounting dividends?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Last 10 years were pretty bullish though, how does that work in a bear market I wonder."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I do believe that the benchmark includes dividends. But if you want to replicate an index with shares, you will never succeed 100%. Sometimes you buy a little too late, too early, at different prices etc. These deviations are called tracking error. But it is a bit strange that they are purely positive. However, the deviation remains relatively constant over the years. So I can imagine that there was a deviation at the beginning of the ETF (which was positive) and then remained constant until today."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Dont listen to these people. Investing in leveraged ETFs over the long term doesn’t work. That’s why the creators of them say don’t invest in them long term. 

You have bigger losses, it takes longer to recover if it ever does. 

The best example I read was if TQQQ existed back in March 1998 before the dotcom bubble, and you held it until December 2020....you’d have had a return of 27%. If you had bought the non leveraged QQQ, you would’ve returned over 600%."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think it would take longer to gain it back. TQQQ is a good example of a leveraged ETF vs QQQ. The drawdown is huge in comparison.
03/21/2021,stocks,Yea you would get hit hard on the way down but would be accumulating when dipped or flat. Over a 10 year period it's trending up so it's just a matter of time. Maybe throw in some dividend stocks and ETF's for cash flow. You can also buy the inverse ETF'S as well. Those will shoot up in a bear market
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, being purely positive is the weird part. 

The problem is that the deviation in each year is still large. Even if it was a deviation at the beginning, wouldn't the % difference in each individual year be randomly positive/negative? Because it does not depend on an initial difference."
03/21/2021,stocks,It just makes no sense that the values they show for the benchmark are different from what is shown in other websites for the total returns of the S&P 500.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well, in a bear market the index can trade flat, going up 1% a day and down 1% the next day. The problem with leveraged ETFs is that when this happens you are losing more money than in a standard ETF. I do not look at them as a good long term strategy, but I really don't want to get a lot into it. There is a lot of information online about that even on investopedia.com."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I can't think of a better explanation. Really strange"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yea I would use them if the market is going up but they have high management fees usually so that will eat up profits in a flat market. The other thing is you have to look at what type of changes are coming and where the money is going to flow. For example if corporate tax rates go up in the US under Biden, that could make European or Asian stocks or ETF's more attractive. I personally am buying the digital payment space and for I buy VTI as my main holding. I just started writing covered calls/puts so if we're flat for a while I will generate income with that and use the money to buy shares of more stocks to sell covered calls. Not sure how much experience you have with options. But if you are looking for ETF'S, I would look at industries and companies that did well when Obama was in office since a lot of the policies will probably be the same since Yellen, Gensler, etc are in the cabinet"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Robinhood I know you had to pay extra for the Level 2 stuff TD you don't. Umm News on a specific stock on TD is abundant. For each stock there is a NEWS tab and you can go back months to look at what made this specific stock go up or down. Unlike Robinhood which just gives you the latest news and usually for me the news on robinhood was worthless. Also in their News they tell you information on SEC filings for a stock for example CEO of the company bought 10,000 more shares where I never saw that with Robinhood. Then also again the amount of information on a specific stock is just so much. I am an amature investor so a LOT of the information goes right over my head but I know I have seen some stuff and been oh that's good!
I hope this helps to be honest what I did when I left robinhood I just went in and applied to multiple different brokers and looked at their apps and I felt TD worked best for me."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’ve done a lot of DD and this seems to be the preferred way for most, I just did this on Friday. Fidelity seems to be the one with the least amount of fuckery so most are choosing that, but it’s your choice. A few things to remember. Be sure you have an account set up with fidelity and be sure there’s at least $75 of settled $ in either one for the transfer fee. It’s quicker to just do a partial transfer of some stocks then a complete account transfer. If you have any other stocks or crypto in RH it might be worth leaving something behind and perform the partial transfer of all your GME. The partial transfer typically has been taking 2-5 business days. A complete account transfer can take longer. And most won’t transfer certain crypto or partial stocks so while shares only. I hade some crypto and some partial shares of GME I left behind until my transfer of all my whole share GME was secure (especially if it’s time sensitive. Then call fidelity on Monday and initiate the partial transfer or attempt it online via their site. Hope this info helps your decision 🦍🚀💎"

03/21/2021,stocks,Remind me! In one year
03/21/2021,stocks,So like... they’re making trees?
03/21/2021,stocks,"The idea is cool but I'd say the technology is pretty far off from actually being implemented on a large scale.  It's not strictly *necessary* at this point.  You might see some green buildings having some of this tech as a proof-of-concept thing, but I doubt that cities are going to be clamoring to install these things in the next century, let alone decade."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Isnt that - what trees are supposed to do? and trees have been doing this for millions or billions of years?
Curious to know what is the new technology?"
03/21/2021,stocks,The problem is we can't plant enough trees to overcome our pollution.  This technology will help once it becomes mature enough and advances.   There are places where planting trees aren't feasible too.  Trees also awesome and I love trees but let's not pretend trees aren't expensive to maintain too.  You need crews to trim them and they fuck up the ground when they get too big.
03/21/2021,stocks,Yes. The best way to beat nature is to become nature! Its called a pro gamer move ahah
03/21/2021,stocks,"It has already been implemented in Mexico but I understand what you mean. This is a long play but I would like to get into it, if ofcourse the company was worth it.

I think that solutions such as this one will end up being implemented. Either because is actually needed, but also in terms of politics and making cities more sustainable, greener... etc.

I'm a city planner and I see this happening for a number of reasons, some of them not making much sense, but cities tend to do things that don't really make sense at first glance."
03/21/2021,stocks,"So the main idea is that cities despite having the goals pointed to sustanability, still have bad air quality and problems with surface heating etc.

So it has been tested and developed a technology that creates artificial trees, that some of the models look like robot trees. In sum, they are air purifiers in a big scale, like 1 of it can do the job of 500 trees. Now imagine that you have a street or a city area that has a lot of traffic and pollution where you don't have space to plant a little florest. Thus, you install a few of these robot trees and help with air quality.

These types of solutions can be more than robot trees: you can have it on buildings, underground parks... just name it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, I agree :D"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Planting more trees seems a lot cheaper and more durable, honestly. I googled it and it looks like an insane waste of money.

It’s not worth investing in a market where the planet is your main competitor."
03/21/2021,stocks,I feel like this is kinda important to mention
03/21/2021,stocks,"You can't plant trees where there is no space for trees. This is an in situ solution for specific pollution problems. I does not aim to end global warning nor fight against the deflorestation of Amazónia. I aims to solve street/city wide problems :) 

The technology is still pretty much in the start and things are in fact quite expensive. But if you can manage to to reduce costs, like millions of objects and technologies do over time, I feel like this is a excelent thing"
03/21/2021,stocks,VW is a really good pick. They have great brands and actually the third highest R&D budget (right after Amazon and Apple) in the world. Would you buy shares or LEAPS?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Finally a post mentioning PAH3/POAHY. Why all the attention is placed on the purely VOW/VWAGY (priced) play astounds me - we don't think the same EV tech will transcend to Lambo, Bugatti, Porsche, Audi, Skoda, SEAT in some form !? There is even MAN and Scania trucks under this umbrella which are big in Europe."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The automotive industry on its own seems to be undervalued in my opinion, except Tesla obviously. VW, Ford & ESPECIALLY Hyundai are these that come into my mind. I'm extremly bullish on VW and Hyundai, and they'll be my biggest positions (after I'm out of GME)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"VOW is better then VOW3 in my opinion, it has more action

&#x200B;

And VW wants to make 1 million EV this year that is 250 000 more then Tesla is aiming for, VW actually makes profit on cars rather then carbon bond selling"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I bought POAHY instead of VWAGY, as there's less volatility."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Every day that goes by I get more and more convinced that Short TSLA, use proceeds to go Long VW is near risk free money"
03/21/2021,stocks,They don't offer options for volkswagon.  At least not in TD.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not only that but Volkswagen can make vehicles that don't have roofs, windows and bumpers fall off."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I wrote the wrong ticker in my title, then.  I was referring to the commons, not preferreds."
03/21/2021,stocks,I put a sizable chunk of my relatively small portfolio in $POAHY last week trying to get in on the VW action indirectly.  What do you think is a reasonable EOY price prediction for Porsche?  My thinking when I got in was $20 per share but after reading your DD now think that may be a little conservative.
03/21/2021,stocks,oh yea sorry
03/21/2021,stocks,"I don't know, but I'm much more bullish on Porsche than even Michael Burry.  He doesn't realize that [bubbles are good for technological innovation and mass adoption](https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2021/01/why-bubbles-are-good-for-innovation/), and that the next bubble is in traditional auto.

If Cathie Wood is right about TSLA having way more room to run before popping (then recovering), then the bubble is only in the third inning.

But yes: POAHY is trading at a massive discount compared to VWAGY."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thank you for the great DD and this reply.  I now feel confident that it’s not only a long term hold but will also keep adding into it.  Hope $POAHY stays under the radar though, lol."
03/21/2021,stocks,So of the companies you've mentioned you're most bullish on POAHY?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I guess.  As long as you're knee-deep, in some way or form, in the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto, you should see lots of upside."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I have stocks from 20 different companies. It is ok by me because I can keep up with it and I feel I have enough knowledge of those companies future. And these are the stocks i'm planning to hold for a long time.

I guess, you can say you have too many if you are starting to have difficulty keeping track of it. or you have too many of the same sectors. 

I've been thinking about streamlining my portfolio to more ETFs (70% etfs/30%ind stocks) but so far it's been doing within my expectations."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You see people say they have very diversified portfolios with only 4 stocks because you're on reddit and a lot of the people here are extremely fucking stupid. 

You're doing fine."
03/21/2021,stocks,20 to 30 seems to be the commonly accepted sweet spot. Peter Lynch claimed to have 1400 at one point and he's rich as fuck from his stock picking. Do what works for you.
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s not bad to have that many. My rule of thumb is to only have enough you are able to keep up with. For example, I have 5-10 long term dividend stocks and 5-7 that I buy and hold for a minimal amount of time. Sometimes closing out the position after making 10%-20%"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Just know you can NEVER have too many stocks, it’s a good idea to have your money scattered instead of in one place. So you’re fine just don’t be buying random stocks because that is a different story"
03/21/2021,stocks,I have 35 stocks! Buy and then build elsewhere. Not interested in dips or pumps. Long term investor. I want 50 total. Sell them all in 2024/25 and pay 0% capital gains tax while living in Puerto Rico!
03/21/2021,stocks,I'd say diversify even more but you are doing awesome.  If you are comfortable there then keep it that way.  Just 4 stocks is definitely NOT diversification.  If you don't see anything else that looks good maybe just increase some positions you have high hopes for.   Good luck building your portfolio.
03/21/2021,stocks,I think you are doing ok. Diversification is ok. The only reason not to diversify is you know you are 100% right on a position. You have to feel comfortable with your portfolio that's really important.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Like someone else said, I hold as many as I can keep up with."
03/21/2021,stocks,Make sure to hold some cash to buy the dips and hold long you will be fine try keep it to 20 imo or less
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you think you have too many, see if there are ETFs that may group some of your current holdings, or may group some of your current holdings with things you may have an eye on.

Ultimately, it's your money, it's your comfort zone.  If you like those 20 things, they're meeting your investment goals, keep them."
03/21/2021,stocks,"20 positions is reasonable.

In general, be cautious of too many positions if you have trading fees or struggle to keep up with news on all of them. 

Besides that, if you accumulate too many positions, likely the more it will just act as the market does, in which case maybe it was better to just buy the market."
03/21/2021,stocks,I have hundreds.  The more diversity the better IMO.
03/21/2021,stocks,More concerned that your top 2 positions are Chinese companies. There’s a saying “Never bet against the US”.
03/21/2021,stocks,I think that as long as it's below 40you should be good
03/21/2021,stocks,I roughly keep it between 20-25. 20 is a nice round number because you can work it in 5 percents and balance it more easily.
03/21/2021,stocks,Look into VTWAX.
03/21/2021,stocks,Boomer portfolio. No space plays in there
03/21/2021,stocks,"Think of it this way. Doesn't matter how your split your money, whether it's $10k into a stock that costs $10k, or $10k spread out over 10000 penny stocks. 10% gain is 10% gain. Obvi this is an extreme example, but same logic applies"
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm doing the same thing thanks.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Do what this guy says, get in some ETFs and you will be diversified to the extreme."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I don't think this is strictly true. If you have a huge number of stocks you aren't going to outperform the market. Your portfolio is just going to behave closer and closer to the market itself. It's true you're lowering risk from 1 large position tanking, but you're also can't get big rewards from a large position going up in value.

And if you're trying to just match what the market does, it's way simpler to just buy ETFs which already have a bunch of different stocks. Then you don't need to manage them either. Depending on how your commission works it might be way cheaper to buy 5 ETFs than 200 stocks too"
03/21/2021,stocks,I've heard about how Puerto Rico has become a tax haven. You also have 0% tax on all passive income. Amazing!
03/21/2021,stocks,how do you keep up with that many stocks.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The new saying is ""never bet against China."""
03/21/2021,stocks,Right now I’m waiting for the real estate crash for the US then I’ll invest more into real estate stocks or REIT’s so I get in at a good time
03/21/2021,stocks,my brokerage doesn't have that. (trading 212)
03/21/2021,stocks,Fuck off
03/21/2021,stocks,"But you can still have a lot of stock for ETFs, I like ETFs as well but I don’t like how it’s all bunched together, yes I may like that sector and majority of stocks in the ETF but there can always be those couple of shitty stocks that will make the ETF only go up by a few cents meanwhile the stock you actually liked in the ETF went up by dollars, there are pros and cons to ETFs. If you can’t be on the market all day to make sure your stock isn’t doing bad then stock to a couple of investments or ETFs but it looks to me like the OP can go on the market a couple of time a day so I see no problem with having more stocks"
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm retired
03/21/2021,stocks,fair enough
03/21/2021,stocks,I heard JP Morgan is pretty reliable idk tho
03/21/2021,stocks,I use chase for all my accounts and have been happy with it so far. Transfers between accounts happen near instantly.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I use it. Just don't try to put a large sell limit cause they will cancel it without warning. I set AMC at 10,000 and poof, canceled. 1,200, canceled. I did another at 996.89 and it has been fine all week. Instant transfers are a plus if you need to get some dip.

Edit: on second thought, it sucks! Don't try to check your tendies, options or open orders with your cell after hours or on weekends! Fuck....I gotta go get my laptop to work some transfers and open buys for tomorrow 😩 😫 🙃 😅"
03/21/2021,stocks,"It's bare bones but I've found it to be reliable. Definitely suited for long term only.

If you use Mint it seems like it's not supported atm, and won't connect to your investments accounts like your checking account or credit cards.

That said, it's not like anyone can really tell who which brokerage is going to be the most reliable in the event of a squeeze or whatever."
03/21/2021,stocks,FYI Chase You Invest has now changed to Investments by JP Morgan. This happened last week.
03/21/2021,stocks,I JPM is a financial tank but putting all your financial relationships in one basket limits your options.
03/21/2021,stocks,"All good if you use it for simple trading like buying and holding and selling later. OTC trading is not supported and interface is not good. No live price updates after market closes at 4pm so until the next day, you are clueless how stocks moved during after-hour market. 

Not ideal for day trading too.

Besides this, it is solid."
03/21/2021,stocks,I mean Iberdrola is up 40% in the last year.  It's not really being overlooked.
03/21/2021,stocks,Same goes for Gazprom and look at how shit they're doing.
03/21/2021,stocks,How much of its revenue/earnings comes from traditional power vs green sources?
03/21/2021,stocks,Hydrogen is a very hard pass.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Clean energy stocks ran up, some running triple digits when Biden was edging closer to securing the Presidency, and when he eventually secured the Presidency, they really had a reason to run. 

Now that he's been in office for ~2 months, and hasn't signed anything into law regarding clean energy, they're coming off the hopium highs. 

That said, with the stimulus in the rearview mirror, the Biden adminstration can now turn their attention to fixing America's infrastructure issue, which may or may not contain things related to clean energy."
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm looking at Yahoo and it says 22% YoY
03/21/2021,stocks,"EBITDA: 48% grid, 26% renewables, 26% wholesale and retail. Revenue isn't broken down by segments, if I'm seeing correctly. 

They're pivoting hard to renewables though, targeting doubling of capacity by 2025. Grid is also good business despite it being regulated, and they plan to expand here too."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Like I said, they‘re only dipping their fingers. And there will be green hydrogen produced in some quantities for industry, if no one else then at least the EU means it when it says it will be net zero in 2050. But there won‘t nearly be a hydrogen economy that would justify the current shares prices for any company that‘s ever seen a fuel cell with its own eyes."
03/21/2021,stocks,"[Webull shows it up 39%](http://imgur.com/a/9l7aLhK), unless I'm on the wrong ticker."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I assume this may be the reason you’re looking for then. If they are 75% tied to traditional power, do they deserve to have been caught up in the green wave?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I see, if it’s for industrial uses I’m down. I was thinking you were trying to sell it as a fuel like most folks. That’s just throwing money into an incinerator, but it’s a super-useful industrial gas so cornering the market on producing it green-wise is smart. 

Ignoring hydrogen, the company does seem like it’s got its priorities right, diversified energy and innovative. Plus a decent dividend! Too bad it’s on the otc exchange."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think you should be looking at IBE.MC
03/21/2021,stocks,"Looking at generation:
- 55% renewable
- 20% combined cycle
- 20% nuclear
- 5% cogeneration

And grid is neither/nor IMO, you can‘t really say it‘s traditional. Also, it‘s a completely different business than generation and supplying."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, most serious long-term net zero studies see it in industry, maybe in the power sector and maybe maybe a little bit for heating. Hydrogen for transport is a gambit by the fossil industry.

I‘m new to this, what does the OTC mean? There‘s also IBE.MC that trades in the Madrid stock exchange, or am I getting this wrong?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Fair enough. I’m not an expert here just theorizing. It could also be related to grid prices? Assuming these have been low or stable, or relatively fixed? Maybe they have been getting a better multiplier for renewables but they’ve been hit in other parts of their business. 

Otherwise I do see your point. That they didn’t seem to get much of the green wave that other companies did the past year. Whether that means they are better positioned for the future vs a company like Orsted that has a slightly higher P/E, I’m not sure."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Over-The-Counter exchange. It’s usually where crap companies list their stocks, but some reputable companies do too. Generally they list there if they can’t meet minimum requirements for a big exchange or just don’t care to jump through SEC hoops and just list as pink sheets. (Nintendo, for instance)

For me if the stock doesn’t trade on NYSE or Nasdaq, RobinHood generally doesn’t let you trade it."
03/21/2021,stocks,thanks!
03/21/2021,stocks,Institutions are licking their lips hoping that the plebs will dump all their stimulus checks into the market so they can take that too
03/21/2021,stocks,"Very very few are even interested in the market, even less are going to dive in. This will have zero effect on anything. The consensus is less then 10% of the population even cares about stocks/investing."
03/21/2021,stocks,"LOL, fuck BUZZ and Paperhands Portnoy"
03/21/2021,stocks,Even if those numbers in that poll are correct it still just a drop in the bucket to the hedgies.
03/21/2021,stocks,"When it comes to buzz, a better investment would to buy your favorite drink. Get a slight buzz for cheaper than this etf, then invest in something not driven by hype. 

My stimmy check went towards semiconductors and oil."
03/21/2021,stocks,I believe the article said half of young INVESTORS will put half their money into stocks. The headline was misleading. Not as much cash as you think. The poll was sent to 430 investors aged 25-34 across multiple trading platforms.
03/21/2021,stocks,Big money waiting for these new ~~b a g h o l d e r s~~ before cashing out.
03/21/2021,stocks,It’s called a stop limit. Learn it. Live it. Love it.  Does not matter what money is coming from where if your just chucking it at something you heard of your most likely just FOMOing your money at something your hearing about at the peak.
03/21/2021,stocks,Institutions will make money regardless if we make money or lose money.  Even if “squoze” happens they’ll reposition themselves to win while they’re losing.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Bingo. 👍

Diamond Hands = Bag Holding/Missed Profits

Watching them get outflanked on that first magical run was just heartbreaking."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Which is the worst part of it all. To each their own, but it really doesn’t take a rocket scientist to learn about basic investing rules and the resources are all readily available"
03/21/2021,stocks,I’ve said it elsewhere.  No matter what happens with this Meme stock stuff the fact it’s exposed people to this market will most likely result in so many people making more money than they would of otherwise. Simply by becoming part of the investing 10%
03/21/2021,stocks,yeah sure but the fact of the matter is a lot more people are interested in investing after gme (for better or for worse) and recent polls said that 25-34 yr olds are very likely to invest half their stimmy. That is a huge influx of money and will have an effect on market prices of stocks that demographic is likely to invest in.
03/21/2021,stocks,not really my guy. you are talking about billions invested. do the hedgies have more? sure. but it is enough money to have impacts on the markets
03/21/2021,stocks,why oil?
03/21/2021,stocks,EEENF. An oil play with better risk/reward than GME.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Education is the key, information is easy to find but harder to sift through for actual proper facts, it deters many from even attempting to learn...then they come to these subs asking for help and get pump and dump schemes which turns them off completely"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Or losing substantially with uneducated bets, I can see this helping a few that get lucky but also bankrupting a few that get the gambling bug"
03/21/2021,stocks,IIRC the people polled were already retail investors
03/21/2021,stocks,"Still undervalued in my opinion, especially with re openings driving demand back up."

“So why not just sell them?”
Because you don’t know if the market downturn is a correction (-10%) or a bear market (-20%). 

Let’s say you anticipate a bear market (-20%). That’s easy right? Just sell on the first sign of a drop maybe at 10% so you’ll still be able to take advantage of the next 10% drop, but what happens if it turns out to be a correction? Then you just sold at the bottom.

External factors can be political, or even the market overvaluing the company to a point where all future expectations are set so high that stock price has no room to run (like Microsoft from the 2000s/ .com bubble). 

When you invest in a company, you invest in it after you’ve done all your DD and analysis and come to the conclusion that the future outlook of the company is worth your time to invest to a point where taking on the risk is worth the reward.

There were be plenty of US-based startup companies looking for investors too.  Why hold bags in a foreign company that will need to penetrate the US market that so many people/companies have been working to prime for explosion for years? 

I know TLRY will jump if/when the US legalizes, but there has been pretty much zero talk of that happening.  Individual states continue to legalize, but TRLY can't legally access that market.  

To me it seems like a better idea to sell after the merger and then maybe go back in on TLRY once serious US legalization talks start happening.  They have struck some deals supplying medical marijuana to other countries but I don't see how those deals are really going to increase the value of their company long term.

Honestly, a freshman is college should be able to tear this “model” to shreds. 

42B for a human ride hailing network: Double Uber/Lyft combined on a service that they don’t even have a business model for? Using on Tesla’s vs all cars on the road in the case of Uber and Lyft? Doubling the size of the ride sharing network while driving Uber and Lyft to 0 in 4 years? 

Insurance: 300% more profitable than Progressive, State Farm, etc? 24B from essentially nothing in 4 years? Nobody in insurance has 40% margins for a reason. It’s not because they don’t know what they are doing like the Tesla fans would like you to believe.

Growth: 80% revenue growth compounding. On a company that grew 14% in 2019 and 28% in 2020 despite still being a small company where larger growth rates are possible? Elon himself hopes for 50% growth, which in itself is pretty unrealistic as the company scales.

Autonomy: Did anyone watch that Oakland video? This software is years out. Assuming by some miracle it was achieved by the end of 2022 (unlikely at best), that would give them roughly 2-3 years to scale from nothing to over 300 BILLION in revenue.

This! Insurance is a highly regulated industry and providers must apply in each of the 50 states separately. In the meanwhile, each state has different rules/regulations from the other 49 and the insurance provider MUST follow them to offer insurance in the state. As someone who was once licensed to write in all 50 and spent years working for an international insurance conglomerate, insurance is very very difficult to be profitable in. The combination of adhering to regulations and operational costs (Underwriting, claims, servicing, etc.) eats into your profits."

Then I figured it would all happen way faster than I expected, because europe is really far behind on all of this, nevertheless they have put up quite some efforts lately and I presume if europe does okay on all these things, the U.S. must do great and china is going to completely crush it. I was highly sceptical of the whole FSD thing but now I am not anymore. Also the margins on insurance, FSD ride-hailing and so, I mean these margins are not remotely comparible to that of theconventional ride-hailing and insurance industries. I think it may turn out to be even better than expected. Even though I agree the TAM purely for selling Tesla EVs may be too optimistic. I dont really like them selling cars, its pretty useless because margins are mediocre compared to what they could do, e.g. tokenize the cars and build a network of FSD vehicles that do everything from transportation of goods to ride-hailing for people etc. There are a couple of start-ups that actually buy Teslas, tokenize them on the ethereum blockchain and people can invest into the cars to get a share of the profit the cars make. I hope Elon has the balls to do it. Wouldn't even mind the stock to crash 50% cuz people dont get what's really happening. Good buying opportunity then. But lets see what happens.

Human Ride network revenue is a joke, Uber and Lyft have brand awareness and I just don't see Tesla wanting to have a money sink like that current business is. Nobody in auto industry has 40% margins, so I assume that is including FSD into it. If I were making a model, FSD subscriptions as % of the fleet make sense to me. I don't think Tesla can have a robo taxi fleet within this decade. But next 5 years the car will be safe enough to do almost all driving for most people. So you could see like a $150 monthly sub for FSD. 

Having about 1 million HW3 cars on the road. Add in about 6 million cars total by 2025. And have 30% of owners using a subscription. That's 3.2 billion per year in software profit, with a massive growing fleet and converting more users as it gets better."

I highly, highly doubt that the ride hailing industry is 6-7x larger than the market today. If it were, all ride hailing/taxi/limo services combined wouldn’t be in 60B range."
03/21/2021,stocks,"> There are scenarios where FSD outperform human drivers, but there are edge cases where human drivers can easily navigate through.

Which is why it's a winner take most/all market. The game is about who can stack 9's after the 99.999% in edge case performance. Whoever has the biggest data collection fleet and best sensor/AI chip vertical integration will stack 9's faster and faster and cross the human edge case barrier first. 

Lol at people saying Volkswagon is going to hire a few AI technicians and get to similar 99.999% FSD rates. Tesla will have added a dozen more 9's by that point. Better performance will increase adoption which further increases data collection which further improves edge case handling, etc. It's Tesla's market to lose. 

25 years into the internet age and most people still don't understand exponential technology."
03/21/2021,stocks,Unexplained tesla accidents seem to be happening fairly often lately.

03/21/2021,stocks,"> He has never really embellished IMO.

December 2015: ""We're going to end up with complete autonomy, and I think we will have complete autonomy in approximately two years.""

January 2016: ""In ~2 years, summon should work anywhere connected by land & not blocked by borders, eg you're in LA and the car is in NY""

June 2016: ""I really consider autonomous driving a solved problem, I think we are less than two years away from complete autonomy, safer than humans, but regulations should take at least another year,"" Musk said.

March 2017: ""I think that [you will be able to fall asleep in a tesla] is about two years""

March 2018: ""I think probably by end of next year [end of 2019] self-driving will encompass essentially all modes of driving and be at least 100% to 200% safer than a person.""

Nov 15, 2018: ""Probably technically be able to [self deliver Teslas to customers doors] in about a year then its up to the regulators""

Feb 19 2019: ""We will be feature complete full self driving this year. The car will be able to find you in a parking lot, pick you up, take you all the way to your destination without an intervention this year. I'm certain of that. That is not a question mark. It will be essentially safe to fall asleep and wake up at their destination towards the end of next year""

April 12th 2019: ""I'd be shocked if not next year, at the latest that having the person, having human intervene will decrease safety. DECREASE! (in response to human supervision and adding driver monitoring system)""

April 22nd 2019: ""We expect to be feature complete in self driving this year, and we expect to be confident enough from our standpoint to say that we think people do not need to touch the wheel and can look out the window sometime probably around the second quarter of next year.""

April 22nd 2019: “We will have more than one million robotaxis on the road,” Musk said. “A year from now, we’ll have over a million cars with full self-driving, software... everything.""

May 9th 2019: ""We could have gamed an LA/NY Autopilot journey last year, but when we do it this year, everyone with Tesla Full Self-Driving will be able to do it too""

Dec 1, 2020: “I am extremely confident of achieving full autonomy and releasing it to the Tesla customer base next year. But I think at least some jurisdictions are going to allow full self-driving next year.”"

03/21/2021,stocks,"So calling out ridiculousness makes people bears?

03/21/2021,stocks,"Her models have not been tested.

She through out an insane number right before a stimulus fueled bubble started.

The stock price isn’t even trading based on her original assumptions, it’s just a speculative fueled rally."
03/21/2021,stocks,At least spell it Cathie or the official Catherine
03/21/2021,stocks,I mean she was saying this way before the run up though?
03/21/2021,stocks,lol you think retail has that kind of impact
03/21/2021,stocks,Fanboys and hype alone will not push the stock to $1500. I feel like a lot of people mistakenly think fanboy retail investors can move the stock a lot.
03/21/2021,stocks,lmao... are you smarter than burry then? he is tsla bear.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Regardless of how smart the ARKK team is, they don't have a time machine.  They are making a bet, just like all of us who invest, and their picks are extremely high risk high reward, which you can see reflected in the returns and volatility of their funds.  Because of this strategy, they will hit the jackpot a bunch of times, but they will also be wrong A LOT.  So I think it's completely fair game to be skeptical of their analysis.  Even if they are wrong on TSLA this time, their funds might still do extraordinarily well.  In fact, even if they are wrong on TSLA, the rest of the world might also be wrong, causing the price to hit their targets.  It will still be years before we know whether Ark's projections from a year or two ago were right, even though their price target has been met."
03/21/2021,stocks,He is.
03/21/2021,stocks,Her team isn't all that special. I looked them up on her website. They seem fairly young and many don't have all that much experience. It made me realize that these are just normal people doing their jobs and people mess up models at work all the time.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Which members of the ARK team?

The Red Bull intern/sailboat captain?

The guy that worked at a local news station in Lansing Michigan?

The guy that previously worked at Tesla as a quality engineer before joining ARK 6 months later (how is that quick a turnaround time allowed)?"

I outperformed Ark last year and didn’t hold
Tesla at all. 

Call options on F, DIS, XOM, FDX, BP, WMT, etc

I struck a nerve because you can’t refute any of my arguments.

If you believe the shit Ark is selling, you’re not fit to be an investor period. 

Any serious investor wouldn’t touch any of Cathies funds with a ten foot pole. 

The people who do? They hold 99% TSLA and 1% some other speculative “growth” company. 

Good luck."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think your getting op mixed up with yourself....tsla_gang 🙄
03/21/2021,stocks,"Lol struck a nerve there.

Why not try to refute the arguments I listed above vs hoping the bubble expands?

You can’t because it’s nonsense."
03/21/2021,stocks,"People didn’t underestimate the internet, we had one of the worst sell offs in history due to the bubble the internet created in 99-00.

It’s obvious that AI, EVs, etc will be big one day. Literally everyone sees it.

Where the Tesla bulls get confused is that they don’t understand how long fundamental shifts in infrastructure, business, etc take. 

It took 40 years to move from coal to oil as the dominant form of energy.

But yea, tell me about the trillions these companies are going to rake in over the next 5 years...."
03/21/2021,stocks,Yeah If I managed an ETF I’d definitely shit on the stocks I chose.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Perhaps so. Maybe a bit of both! I don't own any stock in her ETFs, it does feel a little bubbly."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I own a Tesla, and love the car. However, there's some really big fundamental issues with Tesla, such as battery supply, semiconductors, autopilot (specifically Tesla's response to Cali DMV), the cybertruck, and other EV competition. 

There has been a ton of bad news for TSLA lately, and tbh, I don't think the market cap is justified. Stating it's going to 3k bull case and 1.5k bear case just doesn't seem realistic, even if things were going their way.

In regards to Cathy, she is very intelligent and not dumb enough to talk poorly about one of her biggest holdings. However, people should also recognize this is the case and not follow her blindly."
03/21/2021,stocks,"So many short sellers have set up shop in EV stocks that Tesla probably will hit 3K after the resulting short-squeeze.  

Mark Cuban said WSB should be exploiting shorts, except big money has set up an ape playground in GME to distract them. Cathy is just taking Cuban's advice and taking the easy steps to burn short sellers for profit... it's why Wall Street spends big bucks to find out what their competition's positions are."
03/21/2021,stocks,Feel like it could go either way. Shorts might go all out just to spite Cathie wood.
03/21/2021,stocks,"No argument here. Pants on head retarded, I like that"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well, exactly 12 months ago, that would be correct."

Maybe whoever was projecting them was being entirely ""way"" too aggressive, but meet them through better earnings and that would just about justify where the S&P has been hanging out for a while, at least in my book (because at least IMHO, a 21 P/E or so is not bad at all).

Question is if it can manage to push further for 2021, or have we entered a pattern where you're going to see repeating pull backs after OPEX all year because of how it's being front-ran."

I don’t think people understand how big a number 300B is and how long it takes to scale to that size. 

Only a couple companies have ever done it: large oil companies, Walmart, and now Amazon. Took each of them like 20+ years at a minimum.

Now Tesla is going to go from 24B to 650B+ in 4 years?

03/21/2021,stocks,If more people use the robotaxi service won’t that hurt Tesla’s sales?

Someone is not infallible just because they have a lot of experience. Michael Burry has been in the business for over 20 years and he’s bearish on TSLA so what do you make of that?

Heck, if we only cared about experience then there'd be little reason to invest into anything other than Berkshire."

03/21/2021,stocks,"You don't need to make it so black and white. 

I'm just saying that in general, somewhat random young inexperienced people without any real history of success is nothing all that special. 

If I was putting my money into an investment company to have it managed I wouldn't want some young recent college graduates managing my money. I would rather go to a more established company where people had been there for a period of time (not necessarily older people with outdated models).

And I would say that there are plenty of people out there as smart as or smarter than the ARK team. I really don't think there is anything so special about them other than they devote more time into their models than most people."

Ark's model has Tesla robotaxis driving ~1.4 trillion miles in 2025 to generate that revenue. To understand how big that number is, total vehicle miles traveled on all US roads has been ~3.2 trillion miles the last few years (pre COVID). Also, $300 billion is just Tesla cut, gross billings for the robotaxis would be almost $900 billion in their model."
03/21/2021,stocks,"> Even if you’re right, that market won’t develop and scale to full size in 3 years.

03/21/2021,stocks,There is energy in space. SpaceX YOLO
03/21/2021,stocks,Irrelevant. My point about the analysts was that they sandbag and still arrive at current price as their consensus estimate and so they still have room for upside today.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Noting - a lot of the lower end 'urban' areas are much more similar to rural areas than true urban areas (I want to say the US will include towns down to 2500 people as urban areas). 2500 person towns have essentially nothing in terms of ride-sharing culture (and in my experience it doesn't seem to kick in until well into the 100s of thousands).

Basically, that 60M/270M stat isn't very accurate in this case of rural/urban divide in car culture."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Exactly. 

Nonsense.

All this from the company that experiences constant delays on things like the roadster, semi, cybertruck, etc."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Well no, then Tesla pays for it.  The capital to create this robotaxi fleet needs to come from somewhere.  If Tesla is going to cut 1/4 of my payments for it to be used as robotaxi 1/4 weeks a month then they have to pick up the cost of that on their balance sheet somewhere."
03/21/2021,stocks,Not really... If autopilot is a direct cause that any normal operation would have prevented... That's a major flaw in the system... It either works or it doesn't... You can either take your eyes off the road or you can't.  And if it keeps failing... That increases the chances it will be disallowed from use.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Lol they arrive at current price because it's current price and they don't stick their necks out so they don't look foolish.

It's entirely relevant because if it was fair value now they'd have ""forward looked"" and seen it.  Except it's a bubble born mostly of hype and bong smoke."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Obviously there will be a mix of people.  Some will live in downtown cores and not want/need a car, and can take a robotaxi.  Those who live in the suburb and work all day and are usually home in the evening can allow their cars to be used.

Personally, I am not sure how many people will like the idea of others riding in their cars.  People are so disrepectful of things that are not their own."
03/21/2021,stocks,Hmm it’s the people who use the robotaxi pays for it?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the good info.

I’m asking about crashes. They happen. Do they happen significantly more than other existing cars? For other self driving cars? For all cars in general? This data should also be based on ratio not based on general quantity.

Otherwise, Tesla’s “increase in accidents” only equates to more media notice and not true data."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sure, they do tend to follow the price rather than lead. I'm not disputing that but behind every estimate is a detailed analysis of what is included and excluded. The point is they still have room to revise prices upwards considering how much is still excluded and any credible analyst knows it."
03/21/2021,stocks,True. There are plenty of videos online shot by Uber drivers showing disrespectful behavior by customers. This requires regulations/rules by the government or Tesla to discourage that kind of behavior.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Like I said, fill your boots.  

But comparisons to non-selfdriving I think are a red herring. If it is determined crashes are caused by failure in autopilot then the system doesn't work and could well be banned until it's proven that it does."
03/21/2021,stocks,But only upwards lol
03/21/2021,stocks,Sounds good. Guess we’ll fill our boots and decide ourselves.
03/21/2021,stocks,"They follow whatever the direction of the stock price is going in the longer-term so, yes, upwards in this case 😁"
03/21/2021,stocks,I mean do you think it's only Teslas that would show up in the news if other autopilot systems were being investigated for crashes ?
03/21/2021,stocks,I wonder what they said about Cisco in 2000...
03/21/2021,stocks,"On the flip side of that, how many texting related accidents have been avoided with autopilot, or other computer aided driving tools?

I would hazard a guess it’s been more than 3 in the last couple weeks."
03/21/2021,stocks,Valuing by analogy is pointless.
03/21/2021,stocks,And that's why there's been a huge social movement against it..   What do you think will happen the first time a Tesla on autopilot kills a child?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Oh so what analysts say applies only when it's optimistic about a stock you believe in, got it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I feel like my last response may have been misunderstood, but I would say the response would be unfairly more severe than the lax societal response to distracted driving."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If an analyst compared Tesla to Cisco, they would back it up with credible analysis. It would be one potential outcome weighted with a probability. Otherwise, they should be fired or they're being compensated to spread misinformation."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I dont think the societal response to distracted driving has been lax.. And thats not even a cause you can point to a specific culprit for... If a Tesla kills a child on autopilot I think the public outrage and distrust will be huge and if it happens more than once, could be game over."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Again, you put way too much faith in analysts.  Try checking individual track records."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I don't put any faith into analysts. You're really missing the mark. That Cisco comparison is also flawed in that there is no analysis of the business itself. Sure, if as the article says, if Tesla the business only grows at 30% cagr then the stock will only grow at 6% annualized from the January starting point around 850. If they meaningfully exceed 30% cagr, which is their goal, they will outperform proportionally."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Lol you literally started your argument by talking about what analysts were saying.

I mean it's like you're just arguing to argue at this point."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Try going through it again and maybe you'll improve your reading comprehension while you're at it. Regardless of whether analysts are right or wrong (I don't care either way), their detailed analysis showing fair value at today's prices are sandbagged. This is just a shortcut to help people like you out since I know you're not doing any real analysis on your own. For example, people can piggyback on ark's model and go from there whether they agree with it or not. I don't think human ride hailing is going to happen and insurance is overstated but they aren't including storage or solar in the bear case. Adjusting those out of the model and making a case for a lower bear price would be a easy way to come up with a semi credible estimate. On the other hand, your main arguments are a joke."

Hedge fund manager Steve Cohen became a billionaire thanks to insider trading. How is he not in jail? On top of insult, he bailed out Melvin Capital* and is allowed to buy the NY Mets. 

FRONTLINE documentary link:
[To Catch a Trader](https://www.pbs.org/video/frontline-catch-trader/)

I finished watching this Frontline documentary and was flabbergasted to learn that only the people working under him were found guilt and sentenced to prison. In one instance, Steve Cohen literally tells investigators that although he opened an email with insider information, he didn’t pay attention to the screen right before executing a criminal trade! 

This pisses me off because most of us on Reddit are investing our hard earned money one day at a time. We are doing it honestly and are still getting better yearly returns than Wall Street. These guys are playing with house money, cheating, breaking the law and becoming billionaires. 

The same guy bailed out Melvin Capital when Individual investors were beating Hedge Funds fair and square:

03/21/2021,stocks,"Read the book Black Edge.  It's a good insight into the whole Cohen thing.  At the end of the day, the SEC and FBI had trouble building a solid case against Cohen.  They lacked a key piece of evidence or two, and they couldn't get one of his lackey's to flip and testify against him.  Hence the settlement.  It's unfortunate, but I think the other commenters saying that the SEC/FBI weren't really trying because of regulatory capture are missing some context.  It might be true, but read more and decide for yourself.  

The SEC loves to go after insider traders, it's just difficult to prove if the insider trader is smart (unlike Raj, who was an idiot)."

He watched every trade put on by his people and could act on it for his own piece of the portfolio before they did. You can imagine all kinds of ways his people could give him hints that they know something without actually telling him what they know. Still, that fine was epic and it caused all of Cohen's institutional clients to leave. Almost all of the money at Point72 is his own now. Institutions won't touch him."

Take Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tanin from Bear Stearns - they were prosecuted criminally, however not only did the jury acquit them but one juror reportedly said afterwards “I wish they could have managed my own money” (this despite the fact they ultimately lost several billion $ of investors’ money).

So in that context, I can understand the Justice Department’s reluctance to go further having been burned a few times already at that point."

03/21/2021,stocks,Watch the show Billions on Showtime.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Because our government has been bought and paid for by billionaires. These crooks own the government. They steal their billions using illegal and manipulative methods. They then donate to corrupt politicians so that those politicians win(the politicians are good at convincing the public they are the good guy but money and illegal voting also go a long way). Over time you end up with a lot of dumb ass corrupt politicians in power that are easily bribed, and that is what happens. That is what happened. This shit has been going on for 100+ years but probably in the last 60 is when it took off(starting in the 60's and really turning the corner in the 70's).  Drugs, hookers, mansions, trips, etc... all used to entice these politicians(remember that either they were already rich or somewhat poor so either they already played the game or were easily swayed buy the riches). The problems started stacking up bigger and bigger. And now we are here....

The government isn't going to fix itself, it can't, how could it? It's like asking a child to build the space shuttle. It can't even if it wanted to. It doesn't know how.  Most politicians are literally morons(Avg IQ < 100, ok, I know a moron is technically like < 70 but in some sense many of them are when you include modern advancements like the internet and society). They never actually learn any real world skills that enable them to truly government an advanced society in a positive way(They might learn the political game and have to be two faced but they don't learn about psychology, mathematics, science, etc). Of course they all think they are geniuses because they won their election... but they just go on to fuck shit up. Take any politician you can find, NONE of them are qualified! NONE! There are people out there that are truly intelligent and could make a real difference. 10x more intelligent than all the politicians combined. But if they ran they would not win since the billionaires would see them as a threat and throw as much money as needed to stop them(they know they can get the money back easily so it's not a big deal, it's not a waste but an investment).

This is the kind of shit that happens. The slaves don't think about this shit because they generally are too busy working and just trying to survive and have been manipulated to waste their lives on meaningless shit(i.e., they are dumbed down intentionally).  Notice how hard it is to get any criminal politician, cop, bureaucrat, billionaire, or anyone part of the system to be held accountable even in the minorist of ways. Even things that used to be logical such as: If someone steals money they have to pay back more and go to jail. Now that only applies the slaves.

What happens if that when you end up with a group of people that work together there is a distillation and concentration of the core mentalities. This is how cults are formed. ""Dissidents"" are kicked out/excluded/ostracized/belittled/etc. Over time all organizations turn in to cults because of this. This is ""crystallization"" and it's the same thing that happens with crystal formation(Because the same abstract dynamical processes are at play) and many other natural phenomena. It's not a bad thing except cults generally are just an echo chamber and any contradictions/falsehoods that show up by the leaders can't be challenged by the followers(since leaders do not want to be challenged nor lose their position(rather it being about who can actually best lead)). So, we have these very basic problems that cause major issues in societies and our governments are the biggest manipulators of society... and they have these problems but no politician is intelligent enough to understand them but even if a few were, they would be ignored by the ignore morons. 

&#x200B;

It's just the way it is. As humanity gets more intelligent it will try to shed off the ignorance of the past... that is what is happening now. It is a very slow and sometimes very unstable process. IF humanity lasts and has no major negative setbacks(like nuclear war, biowar, etc) then it will eventually figure this shit out(a lot of it is already known/discovered but it just hasn't been absorbed in to the ""DNA"" of humanity yet). Most people have an intuitive sense when things are wrong but no intellectual sense, this makes them less effective at creating proper change but they generally do go in the right direction given enough time(sorta like a biased random walk).

For example, If someone suggests that our politicians need to be intelligence tested, show a wide variety of knowledge and experiences, force their policies to be stress tested, and have restrictive limits put on them, no one wants all that. No one really wants to require politicians to be properly educated. The morons do this to themselves. They want their cake and eat it too. The morons want to remain morons(go party, fuck, have fun, drink, fuck some more, have kids, get rich doing nothing, fuck some more) and they want their politicians to be like them. Socrates and Plato new over 2500's ago the kinds of things needed, yet man kind still hasn't learned these basic principles(because the morons refuse to educate themselves because fucking is easier and more fun).  For those people that want a better work and try themselves to do better, they unfortunately are stuck in a world dictated by the masses. This is why education should be the #1 focus by humanity. All our energies should be pored in to it. Free education for all. Only shelter, energy, and food come first. Educate the masses of morons(pay them to get educated and make it a life long process) and things will start to change drastically. Almost all the problems man today have been analyzed for millennia by millions of humans. The answers are more or less out there, but it requires the masses to at least learn about the questions first."

The insider trading that was happening was a small time case in terms of AUM that was happening from junior members of SAC, Cohen had to book the monetary penalties because he was fund manager at the time. 

The way the insider trading happened, was that Cohen told his junior analysts they had to produce “edge”, Matthew Martoma would be the one producing illicit information but Cohen made it clear he didn’t want to know how anyone produced their high convictions. This purposeful ignorance of the junior employees crimes saved him for jail time since the SEC couldn’t produce evidence that Cohen committed more than negligence himself.

Other than that, Cohen is practically a genius. When he worked as a junior trader at Grumel he could trade literally anything. Made the firm millions on high frequency trades and managed a 75 million dollar portfolio made from pure profit in his 20s.

Not many people understand the industry or it’s relationship with other players in the finance sector. I’m going to clear up some misinformation I’ve read in this thread:

Some people are even saying “The SEC doesn’t prosecute because they want to work in private equity,” The PE sector is NOT the HF sector. Others don’t even know that hedge funds can’t be owned by the big SIFI banks because of the Volcker rule and think everyone in the HF sector was trading MBS in 2008 (lol).

Also, the term “tax-payer funded” bailout of banks, is misinformation.

They don’t get bailed out by tax payers. The 2008 financial crisis was in part solved by the federal government purchasing dying assets and securities like MBS by selling US Treasuries to the Fed to create liquidity. This isn’t tax payer money, it’s basically a money printer. Also, since 2008, that federal investment of low grade securities as well as the conservatorship of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae resulted in the government turning a profit of 8 billion USD by 2018. So no, taxpayers never have bailed out the banking industry.

Also, the largest banks were responsible for the 2008 crash, and the relationship they shared with hedge funds was totally separated after the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Section 619, so effectively hedge funds are just private money managers."

If they are unlucky (or brazen) enough to be sent to Federal prison for financial crimes, they often learn even more *inside* from each other in a sort of *financial masterclass.* I would liken the Federal prison system for white-collar criminals to a publicly-funded business school where the next monetary and market schemes are already being hatched."

First off, most of the active traders on Reddit underperform the market as well as hedge funds. In fact, they don't just underperform, they lose money. Second, you can outperform Wall Street by just buying an S&P index fund.






Outperforming Wall Street when the market has been in a bull run for 11ish years isn't impressive. They invest for different goals and in different ways from retail investors. If the whole market is constantly increasing its much harder to pick winners and losers so them doing relatively poorly is expected especially since many do not try to beat the market."

He was pretty skilled at playing dirty while (technically) keeping his hands clean. Think the guy lived by the mantra of ""It's not what is-and-isn't illegal that matters. It's what you can prove."" and from the doc I watched on this on Netflix 5 - 6 years ago - I believe there was a loophole in 10B-5 that he was exploiting via information ""brokers"" or something along those lines (that was subsequently eliminated by the SEC after the fact), but again, I'm pretty sure I watched this doc like half a decade ago."

Are there any victims if the people who run the lottery rig it to give all the prizes to their friends and family?  What if during a military draft if instead of equal chances the wealthiest and most connected are never called to the battlefield?  Obviously!

Even besides condemning the working people of the country to poverty and early death, the economic impacts are severe because insider cheating undermines faith in the market decreasing investment.  Why invest if a bunch of sociopathic terrorists will simply rig the system?

That said insider trading is apparently as common as jaywalking. Few are actually arrested.  Very hard to actually prevent.

Also, since 2008, that federal investment of low grade securities as well as the conservatorship of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae resulted in the government turning a profit of 8 billion USD by 2018. So no, taxpayers never have bailed out the banking industry.

Also, the largest banks were responsible for the 2008 crash, and the relationship they shared with hedge funds was totally separated after the 2010 Dodd-Frank Act, Section 619, so effectively hedge funds are just private money managers."

And these things never get enforced. Too many people up and down the line of the judicial system are in the pockets of various interests.

If they turn a blind eye, it costs them nothing and someone will even contribute to their re-election campaign. If they do something, now they have to fill out paperwork, head investigations, keep up with other people to make sure the process continues. And then if they end up persecuting someone over this, the person who rocked the boat has a target on their back.

But the entirety of American government is designed to ""protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.""

James Madison, founding father:

> Mr. MADISON. We are now to determine whether the republican form shall be the basis of our government. -I admit there is weight in the objection of the gentleman from South Carolina; but no plan can steer clear of objections. That great powers are to be given, there is no doubt; and that those powers may be abused is equally true. It is also probable that members may lose their attachments to the States which sent them-Yet the first branch will control them in many of their abuses. But we are now forming a body on whose wisdom we mean to rely, and their permanency in office secures a proper field in which they may exert their firmness and knowledge. Democratic communities may be unsteady, and be led to action by the impulse of the moment. -Like individuals, they may be sensible of their own weakness, and may desire the counsels and checks of friends to guard them against the turbulency and weakness of unruly passions. Such are the various pursuits of this life, that in all civilized countries, the interest of a community will be divided. There will be debtors and creditors, and an unequal possession of property, and hence arises different views and different objects in government. This indeed is the ground-work of aristocracy; and we find it blended in every government, both ancient and modern. Even where titles have survived property, we discover the noble beggar haughty and assuming.

> The man who is possessed of wealth, who lolls on his sofa, or rolls in his carriage, cannot judge of the wants or feelings of the day laborer. The government we mean to erect is intended to last for ages. The landed interest, at present, is prevalent; but in process of time, when we approximate to the states and kingdoms of Europe; when the number of landholders shall be comparatively small, through the various means of trade and manufactures, will not the landed interest be overbalanced in future elections, and unless wisely provided against, what will become of your government? In England, at this day, if elections were open to all classes of people, the property of the landed proprietors would be insecure. An agrarian law would soon take place. **If these observations be just, our government ought to secure the permanent interests of the country against innovation. Landholders ought to have a share in the government, to support these invaluable interests, and to balance and check the other. They ought to be so constituted as to protect the minority of the opulent against the majority.** The senate, therefore, ought to be this body; and to answer these purposes, they ought to have permanency and stability. Various have been the propositions;but my opinion is, the longer they continue in office, the better will these views be answered."

2021-03-21 18:48:04,stocks,"Rite Aid, No Matter How You Cut It, It Is The Right Stock #  Rite Aid, No Matter How You Cut It, It Is The Right Stock

Mar. 16, 2021 5:59 PM ET by **The Sound of Money** (as seen on Seeking Alpha)

Summary:

* Rite Aid has a growing retail pharmacy business generating over $15 billion in annual revenues.
* RAD owns a Prescription Benefits Management (PBM) service, now known as Elixir, currently generating an additional $8 billion in annual revenues.
* Comparing revenue to market capitalization of RAD to both Walgreens and CVS shows a significant upside to RAD's stock price.

Rite Aid is a stock that has been trampled on in the past. Even now the stock has a much lower market capitalization than its main competitors, CVS and Walgreens. One possible scenario for unlocking the value of RAD involves the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business and Rite Aid brand. What is left is the ELIXIR PBM organization.

An estimation of how such an approach might play out will start with a valuation per store. In 2018, Walgreens acquired 1,923 Rite Aid stores for $4.4 billion in cash. That represents an average price of $2.275 million per store. At an average price of $1.8 million per store, RAD could reasonably generate proceeds of $4.4 billion with the sale of the entire Retail Pharmacy business, including the 2,450 locations and the Rite Aid brand name (assigning no good will value to the brand). Should RAD seek a buyer for its Retail Pharmacy business, it could sell its 2,450 remaining stores as well as the Rite Aid brand. Even though many of these stores are in highly attractive locations (CA, OH, MA, MD, NJ, NY, PA, VA, etc), let's discount the average value of each store by 20% (compared to the average price-per-store paid by Walgreens), and arrive at a relatively conservative estimate of $1.8 million per store. The remaining RAD organization essentially consists of a PBM branded as ELIXIR and a net amount of cash on hand of $1.2 billion, if $3.2 billion of the Retail Pharmacy sale proceeds are used to pay down the entire existing long-term debt on the company's books.

ELIXIR's projected sales for RAD's fiscal year 2021 (ending February 2021) are approximately $8 billion. During each of the past four (4) quarters, RAD has reported ELIXIR's year-over-year growth rate to be in the range of 23 - 29%. ELIXIR's projected EBITDA for fiscal 2022 (beginning March of 2021) will likely be approximately $200 million. Once again, I am taking a conservative estimate, and basically considering that a business that has grown 23 - 29% each quarter for the past year, will suddenly see little to no growth in the upcoming year. With only 55,000,000 shares outstanding today, the $200 million EBITDA generated by ELIXIR translates to roughly $3.60 per share in earnings. Using a highly conservative PE multiple of 8, a stock price of $28.80 results. However, the cash-on-hand of $1.2 billion (from the sale of the Retail Pharmacy business after long-term debt payoff) produces additional value of $22.00 per share, resulted in a stock price value of more than $50 per share (which is almost 2X the closing price of $25.70 on Monday, March 15, 2021). The newly created company, ELIXIR, would be well-positioned for growth in the small-to-mid-size opportunity segment of the $400 billion per year PBM industry. With a net $1.2 billion in cash, that future growth could be achieved both organically as well as through acquisition.

Another comparison to the revenue and market capitalization of Rite Aid to direct competitors shows that Rite Aid's revenue is approximately 16% of CVS and Walgreens, yet the market capitalization of Rite Aid is less than 2.9% of Walgreens' market cap and only 1.4% of the market cap of CVS. Either both Walgreens and CVS are extremely overvalued, or Rite Aid is significantly undervalued from a revenue vs market cap comparison with direct competitors.

Before the failed merger with Walgreens and the reverse split in 2019, Rite Aid had more stores but also held more debt. The sale of stores to Walgreens and the lower debt created a smaller company roughly half the size it once was. Since the deal was valued at approximately $10 billion, $9 per share pre-reverse split or $180 in today's share price, you can see that Rite Aid shares were valued at a much higher multiple than today. A $5 billion market cap, estimating for the much smaller company Rite Aid is today, would still command a $90/share stock price. Why then is Rite Aid only trading for just over $25/per share?

Of course, there are risks with any investment scenario. Rite Aid has a large amount of debt, presently over $3.2 billion according to their Q3 earnings presentation. Every quarter, their interest expense is slightly over $50 million. This could easily grow larger and produce an even higher net loss per quarter. Rite Aid is also experimenting with a new store design concept. It is still unclear whether this new store layout will draw more customers into the stores or just be a significant remodeling charge with no real benefits. Rite Aid is also not a nationwide chain anymore. It is doing battle against two much larger chains who both have a nationwide presence along with more cash and market clout. To truly become successful and acquire positive earnings, Rite Aid will need to draw significantly more people into their stores and sell higher margin goods and services. The next earnings call and forward guidance, estimated as falling on April 15, will shed light on Rite Aid’s plan and whether the reorganization is working.

In conclusion, this analysis indicates that the conservative value of RAD today is $50 per share, well above the current share price being attributed to the organization by the market, which is just over $25. The purpose of this post is not to suggest that a breakup of the Rite Aid corporation is the best strategic path forward. (I personally believe that the company has the potential to generate a price per share north of $100 in the next 12 - 24 months if it keeps the entire organization fully intact.)

03/21/2021,stocks,"Personally, I haven’t shopped at Walgreens, rite aid, CVS or any other pharmacy in years. GoodRx consistently sends me to a grocery store or Walmart for the cheapest price. Outside of prescriptions I can get everything else for less money or more convenience at Walmart, target, Costco, or Amazon."
03/21/2021,stocks,Personally I love rite aid. The discount program has my family going there all the time. How they have a market Cap so small is beyond me. Where do you think this could head?

03/21/2021,stocks,"I worked for rite aide as a pharmacy tech before Walgreens purchased most stores. 
They paid us shit. The only reason most of us stayed was due to our management team. 
This was years ago.. but the same people are still in charge. 
I would be weary of them."
03/21/2021,stocks,"There is no fucking way Rite Aid’s PBM business grows market share substantially with the barriers to entry for most of that market. Drug companies have no reason to shell out big rebate rates for them until they can offer volume or something else compelling. Right now EnvisionRx is like 2% of the market and all of their growing profits have come from just general pharma price squeezing and acquisitions rather than true share growth, which are coming under more and more scrutiny by the federal govt these days and is therefore risky to bet on continuing.

Unless Rite Aid can truly differentiate their PBM’s value prop (maybe something like outcomes-based contracting), they will continue to be vastly inferior to competitors CVS, OptumRx, and Ascent (inclusive of Walgreens and Express Scripts).

Would also echo what everyone else has said here in that Rite Aid stores are unclean dog shit. Even a location design revamp would best case bring them to parity with their competitors, again unless they do something truly revolutionary. But no signs of that so far. 

For now, this stocks right where it should be. Show me  a clear sign they’re taking an innovative path and I might think differently."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Walgreens merger didn’t go thru?
I think it was around this time. 2019
Walgreens agreed to buy it for 6 dollars (presplit, so that is like 120 dollars post split). It ultimately didn’t go thru cause it was deemed a monopoly if it went thru."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Two failed buyout attempts --- first by Walgreens, and then by Albertsons.

After a reverse split, the company has only 55 million shares outstanding (that's 10 millioni less shares outstanding than GameStop).

After the company flirted with bankruptcy, a new management team is building a great American turnaround story with the Rite Aid corporation.

The stock appears to be undervalued. Conservative estimates such as the one calculated in the Seeking Alpha article posted above show the breakup value of the company to be $50 per share. 

The fact that a company previously took a tumble in the past under different management is not relevant to the organization's prospects heading into the future.  Check the merits of the due diligence piece posted above and you'll find that the research is solid."
03/21/2021,stocks,Rite aid is the Kmart of pharmacy chains.
03/21/2021,stocks,Anecdotal but I live in the Nashville MSA and I know of exactly one Rite Aid. The rest all closed. Everything is Walgreens or CVS down here.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The fact is that Rite Aid stores built in recent years are clean, spacious retail operations that are very inviting to customers.

Rite Aid also currently has a strategic campaign in place to roll out its vision of the store of the future that provides a layout that focuses on health, beauty, and wellness.  I have seen one of these completed stores and it is outstanding.

As for the discount program, I started using the Rite Aid app to make purchases about twice per month.  I am able to buy discounted items, including buy-one-get-one-free deals and buy-one-get-one-50%-off deals.  In addition to this, the Rite Aid app often gives me a QR code that knocks an additional $10 off my purchases of either $40 or $50 (depending on the special run that week).  I've compared the shopping experience to other pharmacies and even Walmart, and I found the savings at Rite Aid to be superior."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’m guessing you could barely tell the stores that were shut down for a year apart from the key locations.

I can imagine someone parking in an empty lot as a tumbleweed rolls by. The person approaches the automated doors, and only when they fail to open do they realize that the business result on Google was never updated."
03/21/2021,stocks,They bought out the awesome pharmacy. Rite aid is rebranding. They are going after the beckys. It’s going to be a Becky stock soon enough.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Used to love getting Thrifty's ice cream. And they had those cylindrical scoops instead of spherical ones, which made it easier to stack up 2 or 3 scoops high."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Excellent question.  Let's have a look at some of the areas in which Rite Aid put its cash in 2020.

First of all, you are correct, that on November 30, 2019, Rite Aid had $289 million in cash on hand, and that amount was reduced to $51 million by November 28, 2020, a reduction of $238 million.

When considering available cash, it is important to also have a look at the net accounts receivable level.  This is the amount of outstanding payments that are owed to the company.  In the case of a pharmacy such as Rite Aid, the net accounts receivable level is largely representing the amount of outstanding reimbursement payments that are owed to Rite Aid by the US government and insurance companies for previously filled prescriptions.  From 2019 to 2020, RAD's net accounts receivable level increased by $80 million.  Therefore, this $80 million in the higher receivable level can explain a portion of the year-over-year reduction in cash on hand.  After subtracting this $80 million from the $238 million cash reduction however, we are still left with a year-over-year cash reduction of $158 million.   So where else did Rite Aid's cash go?

Well, in the 4th quarter of 2020, Rite Aid acquired Bartell Drugs and its 67 pharmacies in the state of Washington for $95 million.  So if we subtract that from the remaining $158 million shortfall, we still have to explain the remaining reduction of $63 million in cash.

Now let's have a look at Rite Aid's long term debt situation at the end of 2019 and 2020:

RAD Long Term Debt November 30, 2019 = $3.566 billion

RAD Long Term Debt November 28, 2020 = $3.201 billion

\-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

RAD Year-Over-Year Debt Reduction = $365 billion

So, when considering that Rite Aid was able to reduce its overall long-term debt by $365 million over the course of the one year period, it may be logically concluded that the reduction of cash on hand can be attributed to:

1. The increase in the net accounts receivable level.  ($80 million)
2. The acquisition of 67 Bartell Drugs retail pharmacies.  ($95 million)
3. The reduction in long term debt ($365 million)

Once again, thank you for the thoughtful and important question."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Rite aid makes most of its money from the pharmacy. The front items do not matter. In Walmart and the grocery stores, the opposite is true. They are enticing you to come to their stores by losing money in the pharmacy.

Rite aid is making money via pharmacy and front end. They are more profitable than Walgreens and grocery stores in the pharmacy. Especially now they got away with the rite aid discount. Ppl are paying cash for their meds"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Back in the day, a lot of people were saying the same thing about DFV / Roaring Kitty's focus on GameStop when he came up with his thesis on why GME was so undervalued.  So I'll take this comment as a compliment."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I agree with you that no one should assume that anything found on Seeking Alpha is automatically good investment advice.

However, this particular article appears to represent strong research and outstanding due diligence work.

Every article / post must be judged on its own merits as to whether or not it provides a sound, logical thesis."
03/21/2021,stocks,This isn’t pharma. It’s a pharmacy. Rite aid doesn’t make its meds...
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thank you for you comment and insight. However, despite the view from a single store, Rite Aid as a whole is rapidly becoming a terrific American comeback story.   Rite Aid did install a new CEO in 2019, and the new management team has done wonders during that time.   Since the new CEO took over, RAD's stock price has tripled.

The company has grown EBITDA to +$8 or $9 per share and now has free cash flow. The new-look stores of the future are being rolled out in select areas. Also, the PBM business, ELIXIR, has grown revenues between 23 - 29% each of the last 4 quarters on year-over-year comparisons.

They company has indicated that they will continue to work to address situations in which individual stores may not be performing as expected, as all good companies should do. However, this view on a single store is clearly not representative of the tremendous success story that is building for RAD, nor is it indicative of the fact that the valuation currently assigned by the stock market is only half of the break up value of the company.

Once again, I appreciate your view and comment(s), as the point of my post was to spur robust, healthy discussion on the topic. Good luck to you in the future in all of your professional career pursuits."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thank your for your comments.  However, here are the facts:

1) Rite Aid's PBM which is branded as Elixir has grown at a rate between 23% to 29% each of the last four (4) quarters.  You can look it up.  It is an indisputable fact.  So to say Elixir is not able to take market share is an incredibly wrong statement.  The PBM has demonstrated not only that it can take share, but that it can do so while growing revenue and profits at substantial double digit rates.

2) Your statement about the cleanliness of Rite Aid stores is offensive and incorrect.  Everyone can visit their own local Rite Aid stores and see for themselves.  As for the rollout of the revamped stores, this are incredibly attractive retail locations that cater to women seeking health, beauty, and wellness products, which typically yield very promising profit margins."

I've never been into Rite Aid and seen more than 10 customers in the store at a time, and never seen anyone at the pharmacy. I find myself calling it CVS from time to time because I forget it's a Rite Aid.. People walk/drive a mile down the road to Walgreens, which is always packed.

Your DD seems sound and solid, I just don't see it in the real World. I will look into Elixir and see what it is they actually do, but right now Rite Aid seems so far behind."

You see, after acquiring more than 1,900 Rite Aid stores, Walgreens either converted them to Walgreens retail stores or simply shut them down so they could not compete with already existing local Walgreens."

All posts therefore come from one perspective or the other.

I do **not** work for Rite Aid.  If I did, engaging in discussion of due diligence pertaining to the stock would be illegal.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Perhaps the article appeared in a different subreddit, but this is the first time I've posted this Seeking Alpha article, ""***Rite Aid, No Matter How You Cut It, It Is The Right Stock***"" here in r/stocks

As for my previous due diligence piece that I posted weeks ago ""Right Time for Rite Aid"", the author of the Seeking Alpha piece clearly lifted some of the research directly from my reddit post.  Oscar Wilde said, ""Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery..."" so I will accept the compliment and feel flattered.

Considering the amount of discussion generated on the topic underneath the post, it appears that some have appreciated the introduction of the subject here in this subreddit.  I am sorry if you have read the piece elsewhere previously.  However, in the future, if you see a post involving subject matter that you recognize, wouldn't it just be easier to move on to the next post versus trolling and posting disparaging comments about it and the OP.

If you search all of r/stocks from top to bottom, I highly doubt that you will find many posts concerning RAD over the past six months.

2021-03-21 18:02:22,stocks,"Payment for order flow vs. market making Am I understanding this correctly? Citadel pays for order flow and is a market maker as well.

When Citadel pays Robinhood for order flow and you want to buy 100 shares of AAPL at 120$ or better (limit order), Robinhood will route your order to Citadel who will when buy 100 shares of AAPL for fractions below 120$. It will then sell you your order for 120$ and pocket the difference. It also uses the data from order flow to strategize against retail investors in its own investments. That's how Citadel makes money from payment for order flow.

However, as a designated market maker, it also maintains inventory of AAPL stock and profits off the spread between the bid and ask size.

Profiting from order flow and market making are two different things."
03/21/2021,stocks,Honestly payment for order flow is much better then paying $10 to buy and then $10 to sell like I used to. Y’all need to stop complaining
03/21/2021,stocks,"My understanding and interpretation is that the payment for order flow is applicable to the role of the market maker where algorithmic trading is involved. Investments are longer term and I don't see how short-term trends would reliably aid in long-term investments.

So, as an example in my mind (Note, I have no clue how the algorithms are actually implemented), if the market maker algorithm sees that there are plenty of incoming bids for AAPL at $120 (every 5-10 minutes), then the algorithm can decide to buy (bid higher quantities of shares) as the price dips further below $120 and sell higher quantities to divest of excess (profitable) shares as the $120 target is approached."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If the AAPL price to me is 120$ how can they buy it for less? Can they always get it for less than me? If so why? What if the stock price is going up, how do they make money fulfilling my order if the price has risen? Also they don’t necessarily “ strategize against retail investors”. In some cases their algos might show going with retail. Sounds shady af either way..."
03/21/2021,stocks,"No, pfof and market making are the same thing. 

The pfof basically allows a market maker to be in a brokers routing pool. The broker will still route to which ever exchange or market maker has the best bid/ask."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Usually it's market makers who pay brokers for order flow, this is pretty common and not limited to Citadel. It gives market makers advanced info on retail trades which they can use to make some money using HFT algos etc. It's a shady area at best and things such as frontrunning are common.

Brokers are in competition to reduce fees so taking payment for order flow has become a popular way to offer retail accounts with zero fees (the order flow payments then cover the broker's cost), even though investors who sign up for this get screwed upstream by the market makers. It works as long as small investors don't make the effort to inform themselves and figure out what it's about."
03/21/2021,stocks,"There’s a process called internalization whereby the market maker (Citadel) will match up X buy orders with X sell orders rather than going to an exchange and paying a fee. Because retail investors are idiots who have no idea what they’re doing, the orders are random and Citadel can make a profit this way. If retail investors consistently bought before a price increase, and sold before a price decrease, Citadel would lose money. That’s why they prefer internalizing retail orders."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Pretty much, a market maker pays for order flow not just for current market making strategies, but also for predictive analytics, so they can be prepared for future order flows much like Amazon uses consumer analytics to know what to stock in warehouses beforehand.

Essentially, if you wanted to sell F, and another few parties wanted to buy F a few minutes later, the market maker might act as a stop gap and profit a fraction off of the bid ask spread (in essence compensating the risk being taken).

Usually transactions are near immediate, but many times they can take more time, in which case data becomes that much more valuable."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, they can manipulate the data and use it to maximize profits. How the hell do you think these HF's get trillions of dollars collectively? It's not by actually contributing to society doing real work like building shit or cleaning toilets. They literally take peoples money. It's similar to how that one guy make millions buy taking 1c from a bunch of bank accounts every month. It's what they do but it's legal since they are billionaires and bought a lot of politicians and bureaucrats."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I'm not complaining. I actually prefer it. I'm just wondering how it works."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thank you. The biggest complaint everyone was up in arms about was that “free trading” isn’t really free. They don’t like the idea that if something is free you are the product. Nothing in life is free. But, I would much rather RH, TD, Webull, etc takes fractions of a penny for trades, rather then pay a commission."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, they use HFT algorithms to front run orders and intensify momentum and make extra profits that way. Market makers have level 3 access giving a bird's eye view of all orders and routing, which can be exploited by HFT algos. In recent times they also use algos to trade on news and social sentiment before anyone else has a chance to react."
03/21/2021,stocks,It’s you put in a limit buy on aapl at $120 - you’ll sometimes see the price filled is like 119.99666 they get to pocket those fraction of a penny and you get a “cheaper” price
03/21/2021,stocks,"Supposedly, if you have a buy order for AAPL at $120, Citadel will wait till it hits $119 or $119.50 (or whatever number) and pocket the difference.

Idk if it's actually true, but a lot of stuff came out recently that suggests it is.  Supposedly that's one of the reasons the free trading apps like Robinhood are ""free"".  Instead of paying a broker fee per trade, you buying shares at slighly higher prices than they are actually selling at and then Citadel or whoever pockets the difference."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not really. In the old model the broker paid fees to market makers for exchange access and passed those fees to the broker's clients; they routed freely between market makers in the interest of the clients. Payment for order flow allows a market maker preferential access to certain trading information and volume originating from a broker, which in turn gets routed though their system. This allows the market maker to make extra profits which they share with the broker. That covers the cost of the broker's access to exchanges, so that the broker can offer no-fees trading to its clients. The clients who sign up for this pay through the fact that they don't get the best possible deal for their trades due to preferential routing and due to the fact that market makers use HFT algos that exploit such information to skim some money from trades above and beyond the bid-ask spread.

The broker is obligated by law to provide the best price to its clients which is allowed by its routing arrangements (which may or may not include PFOF) but that does not mean that they are forced to give you the best deal that can in principle be found off-tape in the *entire* market (they couldn't do that even if they wanted since it's not technically possible). The whole market includes dark pools and other off-exchange/private trading."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Wow, I don't think anything you just said was accurate lmao. That's actually amazing."
03/21/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/21/2021,stocks,"“Best price” is the current price on an exchange.  Market makers have buyers and sellers that are offering better prices off exchange.  

Imagine if there’s a Walmart and then in the parking lot there is a flee market.  You could shop at Walmart or you could buy things for a fraction less in the parking lot from other people.

It’s not that they are waiting for the price to drop (that would be dangerous) it’s that they come t you with more people than are at the exchange.

It’s sort of a self fulfilling prophecy.  The bigger they get, the more people go there than to an exchange, the more people, the better pricing.  Basically they win by having better and faster tech."
03/21/2021,stocks,The role of a market maker is to provide liquidity they assume the risk of holding a supply of the stock. When you look at a stock price for instance AAPL the bid is 120 and the ask is 120.59 most of the time the market maker is both the one selling and buying he he buys for 120 and sells for 120.59. Market makers do not speculate on the stocks value for instance they will not hold on to a stock when they think the price is going to move up nor do they sell when they assume the price is going down. They make the difference between the bid and the ask and that is their role.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Technically it should be, but afaik it happens quite a bit. Even more serious things happen all the time in HFT trading, but most people know too little to even suspect them. Traders with level 2 access get a glimpse of this, but even most brokers don't have the kind of very low latency level 3 data that some market makers have. HFT trading is characterized by secrecy and it is the domain of market makers and of certain firms with very deep pockets. It is notorious that HFT trading is poorly regulated and supervised."
03/21/2021,stocks,"They do a lot more than exploit the bid-ask spread, since many of them have proprietary trading outfits that use HFT algos. Those are used against institutional traders as well, including in dark pools."
03/21/2021,stocks,Yes what I said was just an example of what they do. But the fact remains their role is to provide market liquidity and they are always market neutral therefore taking all upside during market run ups and all the downside during meltdowns.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Definitely, though this doesn't mean that they don't make some extra money on the side beyond the bid-ask spread while providing liquidity. PFOF is part of how they get the info and preferential access to trades that allow their HFT algos to skim some extra profit. They are market-neutral only on ordinary time scales, the extra profits they make are on time scales that are not even visible to human traders."
03/21/2021,stocks,I agree. When Robinhood first came out I suspected that whoever they were selling the order flows to must be also profiting by manipulating the limit prices in order to guarantee profit. Otherwise how else can they sustain being Robinhoods only source of revenue considering they were the first to offer zero fee trading. That is why I never use Robinhood and tell everyone not to use them as well they are essentially giving you the worst possible price to enter or exit a trade which will offset the cost of paying for the transaction fees. Nothing is free.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, the market maker ""sees"" all limit and stop order information (unless intentionally hidden, but even in that case they can ""ping"" hidden orders) so their HFT algos can use that info to place trades within the gaps. One nasty thing that they can do is to trigger stop loss orders (""stop loss hunting""). It's a grey area but most of this hasn't been regulated and hence it's legal. Only certain things (such as spoofing orders and a few others) are illegal though they are hard to detect and prove so usually they go unnoticed and/or are not investigated."
2021-03-21 17:24:43,stocks,"Trying to wrap my brain around electric vehicles I see a lot of posts about ev being the future.  In todays thinking yes I can see that, but there are a few skeletons in the closet and hurdles to overcome from my point of view. 

1. Electric motors contain cobalt.... look up to see how its processed who processes it and you'll see it's a dirty dirty process and not awesome countries to deal with.

2. Lithium...same as above plus Incedibly dirty to recycle.  Rare earth metals.  If China decides to cut supply...uh o spaghetti o.

3. The power grid. Current projection is even with major renovations the power grid is inadequate at best for just standard usage . Thats not including charging your 2.5 cars every night. 

3a. The power grid. Where does said power come from. Natural gas  power plants nukes? Solar without a breakthrough is as efficient as its gonna get. Battery power is at its limit without technology breakthrough. 

So what's the timeframe for sustainable ev's. Should investing at this point still be more speculative than value oriented?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"So a few things here..  

Electric motors do not contain cobalt that I'm aware of.  Copper and iron.  I think you are thinking about the batteries which do contain cobalt.  Electric motors are beautifully simple machines.  They contain far less parts than an engine and will last much longer than them.  The vast majority of cobalt use comes in consumer electronics like the cell phone tablet and laptop you upgrade every 6 months.  

The lithium batteries are not great, no.  Manufacturer are looking at steering away from cobalt.  The Lithium itself is not a very environmental friendly process no, but it's comparably less than oil refining over long term.  The other thing about lithium batteries is that they're just the best we have right now.  The motors in these cars will far outlast the batteries which could in future be replaced with greener and more efficient technology.  If we had of spent the last hundred years developing battery tech instead of internal combustion, we would be a lot further ahead than we are. 

As for the power grid and production sources, well that too can just get better over time.  Infernal combustion is stuck at where it's at.  

The pros greatly outweigh the cons and I'm just scratching the surface."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Most of your concerns are either unfounded or just plain wrong, no offense meant. Your first problem is cobalt content. Cobalt is already used throughout many industries as an alloying agent. The main use of cobalt in EVs is battery, not electric motor. That said, there are already batteries being developed with no cobalt. 
[https://observer.com/2021/01/electric-vehicle-battery-cobalt-free-gm-panasonic/](https://observer.com/2021/01/electric-vehicle-battery-cobalt-free-gm-panasonic/)

Secondly, General Motors has already committed to
[phase out internal combustion engines by 2035](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.forbes.com/wheels/news/gm-phase-out-gas-diesel-cars-2035/%3famp) while Audi has said they are not [developing anymore internal combustion engines](https://www.roadandtrack.com/news/a35851952/audi-will-stop-developing-internal-combustion-engines/).

Imo this is just the start. With big player coming on board, their r&d money drives the future of transportation around the world."
03/21/2021,stocks,"4. Why are the current EV companies valued higher than the previous car market that existed. Are margins going to increase?  Are people going to pay more for electric broadly?  

Or maybe Are people going to pay more for a self driving car? That would cannibalize the industry as people would just driverless taxi everywhere instead of owning their own."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Some of your points are really bad.   
Point 3a, for one thing: Solar may not be getting considerably more EFFICIENT but it's been getting, and continues to get, CHEAPER. Efficiency is ""power out/power in"" which used to mean ""what you get/what you pay for"". But sunlight is free. Meanwhile, using US utility-scale numbers, solar was [$4.05/watt](https://www.seia.org/sites/default/files/us-solar-market-insight-report-q1-2011-120627093305-phpapp01.pdf) in 2010 and about [$0.80/watt](https://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-market-insight-report-2020-q4) in Q3 2002 . Wind isn't growing quite as fast or dropping in cost quite as fast, but it's something like a factor of 3 improvement, mostly from capacity factor improvements, in the last 10 years.   


Same with batteries- 10x reduction in price per watt-hour from 2008 to the present. Tesla has some huge alleged improvements [planned](https://www.businessinsider.com/tesla-battery-day-announcements-highlights-elon-musk-annual-shareholder-meeting-2020-9) (admittedly they're the people whose $50,000 car is a $70,000 + car ), but sane battery people who get held accountable for their statements also expect battery prices -stationary and mobile - to drop considerably because of the experience curve.   


As far as ""electric motors"" being a problem ... have you looked at the total horsepower of electric motors we already have? I'm not going to say we're fine on cobalt, but the burden of proof is definitely on you there."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I've decided not to spend too much time on EV companies.  I'm speculating that the money play will be in battery tech and battery companies.  Mainly those working in the solid state battery field.  They are aiming to highly recyclable, and wont use cobalt.  Batteries will be installed at homes, power grids, EV, etc since wind/solar/hydro will need storage. 

Long term, I even see Tesla not as an EV company, but mainly a battery company, and clean energy company due to increase in EV competition.   Regardless of EV competition, every EV will will need batteries!

03/21/2021,stocks,"EV is a long term play. Currently the EV market is far from possible potential, we will have to wait for scientific breakthroughs a bit, but its a step in the right direction, even if today the leftover ecological footprint is almost as big as gas powered car production."
03/21/2021,stocks,"One thing that a lot of people miss in the EV history. The first truly popular and somewhat successful “EV” was the Chevrolet Volt. Yes it had a gas tank, but many owners could run it on electric 100% of the time unless going on a long trip. 

The part that most people don’t know about is that it cost GM roughly $90k to make one and they sold it for about half of that. 

How? Government subsidies. Not a huge surprise but that’s a big part of the future of EVs. Seeing it already in Europe. 

Most people don’t care about the disadvantages of cobalt or lithium, they care about the personal cost. Once an automaker can make an electric car that’s more affordable (seems like Tesla and GM might be getting close), people will buy it. 

Good point about the grid though. That’s gonna be a big mess. They’ll probably have to add more nuclear (like Europe)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’m taking a different strategy for the EV craze that will inevitably happen.  I’m accumulating stocks in mining operations that produce Nickel, Lithium, Manganese, Cobalt, and Copper.  Additionally, I’m investing in companies that are into battery recycling. Increasing the demand on these commodities will most likely increase their price.  I’m interested in operations in Canada, USA, Mexico, South America, and Australia."
03/21/2021,stocks,"This is actually pretty silly. 

1.	Not going to verify your claim about cobalt use in motors, but motors already exist in vast quantities in the US and if they’re cobalt reliant it looks like we’re already past any of those hurdles. 
2.	Same as 1, also lithium is available outside of China. 
3.	I think you just made this up."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yup. Jaguar and some of the other high end car companies have already abandoned plans for electric car roll outs because they can’t get the materials for the motors and batteries.

I’m on strata in a townhouse complex and we have already discussed putting in chargers- the fact is that each building can only support a couple of chargers- out of the 8 units each, and that’s just the local level not considering the actual power grid. We are looking at hundreds of thousands for our complex alone if everyone wanted an electric car."

03/21/2021,stocks,"This post reminds me of a discussion I overheard between two old codgers when I first started trading/investing.



OC 1:  I don't know about these new machines.  Automobiles?  They are constantly breaking down.  Can't go more than a mile before something goes wrong.  So, can't really go outside the city .

OC 2:  Sure.  Range anxiety is real.  And I can get a horse anywhere.  Automobiles, at least the one you can afford, is built by one company.  You get rid of your horses and the company goes out of business, doubles or triples prices, etc.  What then?

OC 1:  And they run on what?  Gasoline?  Who makes this stuff.  There is one farmer with a still in this state.  And it's made out of oil which is dug from the ground.  What if that runs out?  I mean how many dinosaurs were there in the world?  500?  1000, max.


OC 2:  And where are they all made?  Hardly an awesome state and too close to Canada.  


OC 1:  Also, aren't they real dirty.  The shit that comes out of the tailpipe is terrible.  At least the horse's shit is organic and can be recycled.  According to Martha, the automobile smoke will wreck the earth.  Yeah, I'm sticking with my horse.

OC 2:  Me, too.  We are two woke codgers.



I telegrammed my broker and bought me some Ford and Standard Oil."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Check out the company Ambri. Backed by bill gates, created by MIT professor and his students, liquid metal battery formed mostly by the rare earth mineral Antimony. World changing technology if it becomes adopted. Allows for all batteries to essentially be run by renewable energy, and exceeds the limits of lithium ion batteries by far. This battery will be used for much more than EV’s IMO. Better Charging, battery life, etc... 
then check out $UAMY, the only company in the US that mines for antimony :)"
03/21/2021,stocks,I was just discussing this with a few friends the other day. I think Hydrogen fuel cells combined with E.V will be the future.
03/21/2021,stocks,"You’re also missing a key component: government investment. I live in a county that has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030. 60% of the greenhouse gas emissions come from on-road transportation, and the best way to hit that metric is to help people get into EV’s.

To one of your points, that means Government investing in the infrastructure - charging stations and the grid, for example. Government investment drives demand."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Your first and second points aren’t likely going to be relevant in the long run as EV companies invest into finding new methods of storage. In fact one of them (Hydrogen Fuel Cells) even fixes your third problem for the most part.

Assuming however we stick with lithium ion batteries we need to strengthen our power grid with some better form of power storage in the long term. I suspect rather than buying EV company it will be WAY better to buy companies that develop batteries and other electronic storage devices. I’ve got a feeling that with battery companies it’ll be really boom or bust but if you keep on studying battery technology you should be ahead of the curve. Both power grid and mobile battery tech has are at a super important point in their development where we have to decide what method of storage will be the future and whatever companies guess that right will be taking in hefty profits."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Judging by texas we need to upgrade the grid anyways. Also, even if you use natural gas, the emissions are much cleaner. Also, there are lots of ways to produce renewable energy, not just solar.

The biggest hurdles is American attitudes and big money at play."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Much of this might be true BUT you are assuming it is a binary situation. As EV grows things will be modified to support them. As more people buy EV then more stations will come on line, more grid infrastructure will be created, more nuke plants will be created, etc. Yes, it could all end very badly... but it might not either.

The thing is, electric motors are far more efficient so ""global warming"" will be less of a problem(although you can bet people will still try to profit from it).

Gas Engines have a max theoretical efficiency of 50% and usually are around 35%. Electric can have upwards of 95%. There is a lot of waste with FF's. The processing, the transportation, the combustion.

None of that happens with electric. If coal or nuclear is used then it has some problems but nuclear is millions of times more effective. (if we could make plants better, you know, not by the sea where a typhoon can hit it and learn to deal accidents better rather than hiding them)

Electricity can be efficiently transported over wire. You don't have to haul gas around and use gas to do it.

Electricity is the future for such things. It isn't a matter of if but when. Does that mean it won't be a colossal failure? Anything the government tries to do has the potential to collapse.... rather than worrying about the tech one should worry about the government. Engineers are far smarter and ethical than politicians."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Except for the stuff about cobalt and rare earth metals, you're not really wrong.  

EVs are getting to be as hyped as 3D printers once were, and google glasses, and a bunch of things that never become things.  

Still, the love for EV's seems real and more further developed, so I'm. It saying they'll crash to reality like the others.  

But the benefits will not be as net positive as assumed and the electrical implications you raise won't be solved any time soon.  

I'd maybe add a point that at the end of the day, an EV car is still just a car.  And if we go back a year or two or three, cars weren't all that popular to the largest and most influential demos.  They're having a moment in the sun right now. But at any point, people could realize: they're just cars.  And cars are a pain in the butt that the younger half of society decided isn't something to be owned.  

Once a few years of EV life have occurred, people will be griping about having to spend money on brakes and tires and shock absorbers and pretty much all the stuff that makes car ownership suck.  But they'll have new nightmares, not about expensive repairs to their gas motors, but to their electric ones.  And to their complex computer controllers.  And replacement of their failing batteries.  

EV's might very well replace gasoline cars.  But they probably won't permanently restore or expand the number of people who want to own such a swiftly depreciating and expensive-to-hold asset."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think that within 5-10 years, my house will be entirely solar and I will own an electric vehicle. Don't know if this helps you or not, bu I feel like it helps the planet so there you go."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I too have the same doubts I cannot get over with, the EV play seems completely dependent on major breakthroughs in batteries. It also doesn't help seeing Toyota and other Asian manufacturers being cautious and even putting some of their chips on alternative power supplies."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I want an electric car future, but there are a lot of issues to figure out as you note. On top of that, EV cars right now are very reliant on government rebates in America because the cost is much higher than a similar non-EV. What happens if that goes away? That makes buying an EV in America much more expensive until prices come down."
03/21/2021,stocks,Wish all these fucking hippies wouldn’t be so god damn afraid of nuclear energy. If those cucks would let us have nuclear we’d be fine.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Ok so here’s my 2c... electric vehicles, from an environmental point of view aren’t that good. There’s a terrible amount of pollution from manufacturing at all levels of the process. But in terms of stock prices, it’s irrelevant unfortunately. It’s simply about where the sentiment goes. All manufacturers are investing in EVs because governments are pushing for it. So manufacturers are a bit of a gamble because they will simply transfer production from ICE to EV. Suppliers however, might be a better bet. But what do I know? 🤷"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Drive one, you will understand."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s just the “euphoria” phase of a market. Any teenager with access to the internet can figure out that EVs exist solely because of government intervention. Progress in solving major problems like battery technology, materials, and charging structure, has been practically zero over the last decade. Even if you waved a magic wand to get all the ideas that have already been priced into these stocks, gas will always be a requirement for many use cases."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think the answer to your 3a point is that if you transition from gas to electricity. You use electricity as a medium for energy storage that is more adaptable. I think it is much easier to change the sources for generating electricity going forward than obsoleting over half of all transportation whenever new technology comes out. I could be wrong but that seems to be the argument.
03/21/2021,stocks,"There's still too much R&D required for battery technology. About the automotive industry, I doubt that they are going to offer really affordable EVs before 2040 or something. Mostly because they will try to layer existing products with EVs so that they can maximize the return on that R&D. And we are still not taking into account how much time it would take for existing owners to replace their old vehicles (it could be subsidized though)

From an investment point of view, the money is probably on energy and battery tech. Tesla is also a good bet, but mostly because of their apple-like approach to cars. But I would expect Apple, Google, Microsoft, and even Facebook to answer soon, on top of or in collaboration with the existing automotive industry."

03/21/2021,stocks,Yea I agree. It's tough to set the timeframe in my head when you see a lot of hype for companies.  It's also weird that things like blue hydrogen and other alternative aren't very popular but easier and more efficient to mainstream.  I'll assume is has to do with sexiness factor.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Hybrid is actually a very sensible option.  I like the volt a lot as well as the older Fisker.  Yes they gave gas tanks but they're not like the Prius or other vehicles that have ICE drivetrains with added electric motors.  The volt has an electric drivetrain with smaller battery bank and an engine that charges the batteries for extended range.  The Chrysler Pacifica is good also because it has two electric motors in the transmission, no reverse gear and no altinator.  One of the motors acts as a generator and reverse is electric only.  

The conundrum with all electric vehicles is people are worried about range anxiety yet at the same time the average daily commute is like 40km.  Why have a huge battery capable of 400+ km when you rarely or never need it?  Smaller battery for daily driving and an ICE range extender makes a lot more sense."
03/21/2021,stocks,Long on uranium?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not a fan of nuclear, but even adding generation sources doesn't fix the problem.  The equal (if not larger) issues are with grid and distribution.  Few people have the high current power sockets in their garage or driveway, and adding such heavy demand devices can often not be trivial for the electrician.  And even if they did have sufficient power in their garage, the neighborhood wouldn't.  

All the 5 and 10 watt savings here and there that we've been finding over the last few years are going to be more than eaten up by everyone putting up 5000 watt EV chargers."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Agreed.  There are very promising Canadian companies that will have a a major impact on the North American market, not only in mining and processing of cobalt, but also the recycling of black mass of old EV batteries.  I am very high on First Cobalt as a key player in the next 2-5 years with their environmentally friendly metallurgic processes, their ownership of cobalt rich land in Idaho, their R&D on black mass, and their proximity to Ford, GM (Lordstown) Honda and Toyota.  Their leadership is sound and they are being financed by the Canadian government.  Worth a look, IMO."

For another, as electric vehicles become more common the power grid and supply will simply have to keep up one way or another.  With more options like tidal power, landfill recovery, etc, one at or another we'll figure it out."

OC 1:  And where's the infrastructure investment?  You can't drive these automobiles on the roads we have outside the city.  They'll be wrecked.  You need roads made out of bitumen.  And there isn't enough of that to build roads outside the cities.  This country is huge.

OC 2:  Oh, yeah.  Even if they do take off they won't every be used for more than tooling around town.  Also the infrastructure for gasoline stations?  Nothing.

OC 1:  Of course, no one is going to build gasoline stations until there are enough cars.  And people aren't going to buy cars until there are more gasoline stations.

OC 2:  Sure.  Chicken and egg, amirite?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"AEP and a number of other electric companies (Duke, Dominion, etc.) have formed a coalition to create EV infrastructure to handle the future growth.  From the March 3rd Columbus Dispatch (AEP headquarters), 

“The utilities have formed the Electric Highway Coalition to give drivers of electric vehicles access to a network of fast-charging stations in a major region of the country that stretches from southwest Michigan to Texas throughout the Southeast and up the Atlantic Coast to Virginia. The utilities will set up the charging stations in their service territories...”

The infrastructure will be there.  Also, charging station companies are growing and GM is assisting in the development of EVGo charging stations.  The U.S. in the infancy of a major change and I believe now is the time to jump in."

03/21/2021,stocks,Thanks for telling me what I was looking for ......
03/21/2021,stocks,"I am an electrical engineer working on some of the issues regarding the power system.  You are correct that if every ICE vehicle were to be instantly replaced with EV the current system would fail.  As it stands there are high penetration areas of EV in neighborhoods that have problems when everyone gets home and starts charging. 

That all said, the current bulk power system was designed for a single direction of power flow.  But we are working to solve problems that are arising from bi-directional flow.  The same is true with EV.  The areas that are slow to evolve and upgrade are that way because of costs to the utility and subsequentially to the consumer.  People don't want to pay more when the current system works.

That said, there are people currently working on issues that allow charging your vehicle while driving on the road (future) there are new battery chemistries that will reduce the impact to the environments, there are companies working on battery swapping in lieu charging where you hit the ""gas station"" pop in afresh battery and drive off, among other ideas.

The generation mix is being updated but is a slow process.  As we see higher penetration of distributed energy resources that are successfully paired with existing ICE and nuclear, we will see the associated improvement to EV charging infrastructure also. As is think of it, right now our electric system is built on the beach and tide is eating away the foundation.  All we are currently doing is shoveling more sand under the walls to hold the house up.  What we need to do is pick up the house and move it to a new location with a new foundation that is solid.  The walls (infrastructure) are the same but the foundation (generation) are stronger. But to do that costs money and requires action.

You originally asked for a discussion for/against.  Let me make it even easier than that.  I am not sure who the victors will be Tesla, Lordstown, VW,  or some new firm in the future but if the is not a request and demand for more environmently friendly transportation, buildings, and generation then no corporation will work towards them. We as investors are looking to make money from the corporate work but we as consumers must help to guide the corporations on where the needs are and where they should invest time and money. 

Currently, green tech is just as ""dirty"" as oil.  That said, when more brain power is spent in improving the technology, the sky is the limit.

Considering that every automaker on earth is claiming they want to go heavy into EV's, they're going to need to get batteries somewhere, soon.  

The Internet likes to hype things like sexy lab experiments by QS, but those 2022 cars and trucks and buses need batteries now, not in 5 or 10 years.  And besides, whatever QS is researching, the more mainstream battery makers also have their own R&D, except their R&D can get replenished funding as they sell ""regular"" batteries and swim in revenue."
03/21/2021,stocks,There are some countries investing in a hydrogen network... but it remains to be seen
03/21/2021,stocks,"Correct me if I'm wrong but the problems with hydrogen are

1).  Needs to be kept cold.  Hydrogen boils at like -250 degrees C so it's not really a fuel you can just put in your car and leave there for a week.

2).  Hydrogen is super-explosive and needs to be stored at very high pressures (sometimes 10k psi).  The chances of a major explosion in a car crash compared to a gas powered car is much, much higher.

Both these problems already have solutions, but these solutions are pretty expensive.  So hydrogen might be fairly economical for busses or semis that are large and usually have set routes and destinations (and can also store the tanks up out of the way where they most likely won't get impacted during a crash), but for consumer vehicles I don't think it will be a viable option anytime soon even if there are proof-of-concept vehicles that have already been built."
03/21/2021,stocks,That's what made me really start thinking about this a show about the power grid. It led me down the rabbit hole I was a bit shocked how bad it is and how much electricity American use.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The likely and more obvious final answer on the challenge of rebuilding our multi-trillion dollar distribution grid is: we'll give up. We won't do it.  Politics and anti-science factions will never allow the sustained decades of commitment for such a project.  Instead, we'll go with local and self-generation.  Those who want enough extra juice for their EV's will need to make/buy and store their own, close to home, from sun, wind, water, and gas.  Large scale EV adoption doesn't work without large scale electricity source reformation."

That plant was a fucking miracle and it was 70 years old technology wise."
03/21/2021,stocks,Communism doesn't work in practice because of corruption.  It's not bad in theory.  Just like democracy.  It's a nice idea but there are not currently any real democracies in existence.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I beg to differ.  Not sure why the downvotes.  Tesla was indeed working on wireless power transmission (successfully) and JP Morgan shut him down.  He did indeed envision anti gravity vehicles that did not need their own power source.  Look it up.  He was a genius ahead of his time and I'm sure if he thought it was possible, it is.  

As for ancient history, again, do some research before dismissing this.  There is ample evidence that a large chapter of our history has been lost or hidden from us, and that includes the existence of an advanced civilization that preceded our own.  The ancient Sumerians and Egyptians were the shadows of remnants of it."

Adding some residential secondary storage could help, either as part of the charger or integrated into the building supply (Tesla Powerwall or whatever).  I can envision an automatic source-switching system that adjusts between utility electric, gas/fuel cell, solar, and wind depending on rates and weather.

Could obtain some efficiency improvements with higher service entrance voltages (480V?) or 3-phase but that would be much more complicated, especially for residential.  Achieving a reasonable ROI would be difficult though."

It sounds crazy based on how we live currently in this country but other nations are doing it somewhat successfully. 

Once the government bans coal and starts to take profits away from nuclear through new regulations, you will have innovators across the globe creating new solutions that we can’t even begin to understand yet.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Thanks. I think I just clicked on the chain and not relating to a specific comment.  I am passionate about what I do and have recently relocated to a new position where I can work on exactly these issues. I am currently working to cipher utility scale microgrids and part of that is how to allow people to continue to use electricity including EV.  I don't work on EV directly but on the medium voltage system which is where the issues and fixes need to start.

I have some EV like TSLA and NIO and had some QS for a bit which I sold at the peak right after they introduced.  Even have some XPEV cause why not. I am not particularly partial to any one yet as most are still in their infancy. TSLA is great and will go higher I bet but to me I look at the field as you can't go wrong at least buy holding some.

In the beginning of autos there were fantastic makers who are no longer here but as long as an investor keeps listening then I can't see where they will go wrong.  

The new administration is going to push hard for renewables, EV, hydrogen systems, and carbon capture. At least for the next 4 years there should be some great opportunities in these areas and well worth the investigation and money.

I'm 27 and I work in the mining industry (Chile) with 14x14 turns, so I want to make some money while I am in my two weeks off. 

A month ago, I invested around $12.5k in ETFs (90%) and mutual funds (10%) and I'm planning to hold for 15-20 yrs while I add $400 a month from my salary (around 2.4k).  My personal expenses are around $1k considering rent, food, health and sports, so I have some bucks that I'd like to trade.

Right now I'm trying to educate myself by reading A Random Walk Down Wall Street (Malkiel, Burton) and watching videos in youtube (The Plain Bagel, Investing Made Simple and New Money) and some podcasts.

Please any advice, personal experience or other would be truly appreciated before starting this walk.

03/21/2021,stocks,"If you're interested in actively trading coupled with a more passive approach, I'd suggest to start with a very small allocation of your capital.

As you're doing research through books and videos, you should be trying to develop an idea for a trade strategy. I won't go into detail, but you'll essentially want to know how you'll execute your trade before you even think about buying shares in a company, or whatever you're interestedin trading.

Most people take many months or even years to refine their strategy, so expect a lot of evolution as you learn and grow. Don't expect to learn everything you'll need to know in books/videos. Deliberate practice, review, and refinement of execution can be a great teacher.

Some people might suggest paper trading initially until you feel your trade strategy can produce a consistently profitable outcome over a long enough timeline. That may work for some, but everyone is different psychologically. The risk of losing play money may cause you to become loose with your rules since there's no real world consequences for mistakes.

Above all, be pragmatic with your approach. Although some people have generated huge returns in short periods of time, I can assure you that these people are true outliers. Trading shouldn't be seen as a means to get rick quick. 

Enjoy the process of learning. Take things slow. Only trade an amount that wouldn't cause your emotions to override your logic when unexpected events take place."

03/21/2021,stocks,"This is the only good reply here and it isn’t even upvoted. Daytrading can be profitable, unlike what a lot of these other comments are saying, but it just takes a lot of time and dedication."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah at this stage they should probably just put some money into index funds and some other money into anti-inflationary commodities. Which by the way no longer includes gold, because it reacts negatively to all the things that governments do to try to prevent inflation."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Came here to say the same.

I'd be amazed if anyone can read that book and then go ""hell yeah, let's day trade!"". It's an amazing book, probably my favourite but it's entire point is to explain why active trading should be avoided (because you can't beat the market reliably so not much point trying)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"People don't realize how hard of a mental game trading is too. You got to have zero emotions, whether you're winning big or losing hard, especially with daytrarding. There's good reason why PMs and professional traders don't get emotional at all about their investments"

High risk, high reward. Educate yourself before diving in."
03/21/2021,stocks,"This is poor advice I've seen echoed too much.  Options are a great tool to have at your disposal.  Discouraging people from using them is a disservice.  

If you want to help a new investor offer them advice on how to learn them safely.  These can be very high risk, don't yolo, start very small, try multiple strategies to see what works for you, etc."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Short term like that is fine but still risky. No one can predict a stocks movement in the short term.

Swing trading is just different, and I personally find it easier than day trading (PDT rules, time window for research/trading, etc.) If you swing trade on stocks you are already long on, you don't mind having to hold it."
03/21/2021,stocks,day trading requires a full day's attention on the trading day. OP sounded like he was interested in doing day trading PT. if that is the route i would definitely recommend doing some paper trading to start off. people with regular day jobs wont have the time to day trade.

If you think about it, there's no reason day trading even *should* work. There's no value being created in a single day, so there's no reason to expect any price appreciation, so there's no reason to think money could be made reliably.

I have a nice portfolio built up where if I'm doing a trade for $5k profit, I don't mind paying $10.  Charge me $10 every time if you want if I'm making $5k.  I know my brokerage won't halt trading on one side because they have the assets to cover their trades."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes everyone’s risk tolerance is different. Some may ride the stock through it’s ups and downs, some set it to sell after it drops a certain percentage.

03/21/2021,stocks,Thats pretty much what i do. Maybe make a day trade if something jumps big but really thats rare. I mostly try and buy before catalysts or in companies that seem undervalued like Palantir.

03/21/2021,stocks,"If you want to watch the stock closer, sell shorter expirations and then roll it out to the next period on expiration even if it's ITM. You keep the shares, get more premium.

If you want to hold the shares long term, it's a totally valid strategy."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Similar to my strategy. I have a lot of my portfolio in etfs or solid blue chips. 

The rest is “play money” that I do more risky plays with. Finding stocks with high IV and selling CC’s has been working well for me."

Investing $100,000 into the S&P 500 during the absolute bottom of the financial crisis of 2008/2009 would yield close to $600,000 today. $100,000 in Apple would yield well over $1,000,000. What would you buy next Monday (29th) if you could tell the future and we hit bottom precisely on Monday?"

Without a magic 8 ball I'd probably put it in chunks. 10k at a time. 8k to VOO 2k to SSO. Yeah you could make more in individual stocks but you don't Know which companies aren't gonna make the cut. If it's a bad enough recession there's no garuntee. I mean there's no garuntee with the sp500 either but if it goes down and stays down forever we have much larger problems then my retirement so who cares.
03/21/2021,stocks,"In 2008, I had $50,000 in cash available to invest.  I waited till January 2010, as it was obivious that the market was going to take off.  I bought ten stocks, investing $5000 in each. They were: Apple, Amazon, Hasbro, Ford, Bank of America, Lululemon, Priceline, Home Depot, Netflix and Microsoft.  By 2016, Lululemon had tanked and recovered.  Ford never moved.  Priceline had become [Booking.com](https://Booking.com).  Apple did a reverse split and then took off. The portfolio was worth $253,000 in 2018 and I cashed out.  The money was in my retirement account, so no taxes for now.

My point is, don't invest in one sector of one stock too heavily.  Invest and be prepared to change as your objectives change."

Reasoning:
TQQQ is a 3x leveraged nasdaq 100 etf, although it’s usually best for short plays after a crash it should do very well for a month or two (however long it takes to get almost back to previous prices) and I feel the leverage will be well worth it.

VIOG is the s&p 600 growth stocks, these will not only do very well after the crash but I can keep holding on to this stock until a few years before retirement and make very good returns. This is a set it and forget it pick.

NVDA I think will be very successful and would look at investing in them crash or no crash, but getting them at a discount would be very nice.

AMD is the same story as NVDA.

AMZN will continue to do well as many people have now started using them or have been using them more frequently now that stores were closed and it was their only option at times.

In the Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis, Ben Graham and other commentators point out that growth stocks are usually the ones that fly the highest based on speculation during a roaring bull market and once they crash during bad market conditions (and they crash hard!), they are labelled as ""risky"" by the Wall Street crowd when, in fact, they are likely to become value stocks with relatively little downside (this assumes that despite being a growth stock, the company has strong fundamentals - a lot don't, I wouldn't buy those - Nikola and Workhorse, I'm looking at you). A crash may render stocks like NIO and Tesla actually viable investments for once. There's other stocks that I like, but are extremely overpriced at the moment - Square, Shopify, CrowdStrike holdings, some renewable companies, cloud and cybersecurity, online retail, etc.

Stocks with real negative value would be decent bets, too. Graham points out that during the aftermath of the Great Depression, plenty of stocks traded for values BELOW their cash on hand! These types of situations are ones where your downside is minimised to the extreme. If a crash happens, I'd go on a stock screener and look for those - Yahoo Finance or FinViz have such screeners.

Indexes would be good, too. Somebody recommended TQQQ, that's one I'd definitely get, SPX (or the 3x leveraged fund) may also be good options. They'd probably be my safe bet/hedge and I'd put some, but not all, of my money in them."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Here's a real answer.

First of all, there's been a true recession for close to 8 months. A recession and the stock market clearly have nothing to do with each other. As every good investor/trader knows, the stock market is NOT representative of the economy. The stock market has been pumped like crazy. 

If what you mean is if the **stock market tanked by next Monday, I would probably buy a mix of strategic puts, and some ETFs like VXX and maybe TZA etc. These are still subject to decay, but they will still accelerate as the market declines. Options would be best, but the prices are often very skewed and can end up working against you. So it would be best to use a mix for safety. If you knew what was causing the sudden drop, you could maybe buy some puts in those specific industries. 

As for what to buy after? Anyone's guess. Again, helps if you know why the stock market tanked. The best choice is always to follow proper price movement. But you're not going to have a good idea of what would or might bounce with 8x like this last market. You can only tell after the hysteria clears.

In the same way, you could also leveraged long ETFs, some kind of mix of them, on the way up. Call options would again be risky because of how their pricing works, but you could mix in some of them."

Most of europe is decriminalized and legal for medical purposes already. 

Its downright stupid that these countries don't legalize it considering 

1. Alcohol is legal. 
2. The amount of tax that could come from this would be nuts. Colorado has brought in over 1.6 billion dollars in the 6 years that weed has been legal there.

Colorado accounts for 1.7% of the US population (currently, its seen big growth too over 6 years). That would be nearly 100 billion dollars over 6 years."

03/21/2021,stocks,"The Nasdaq always outperforms the S&P over time - it's where the growth and innovation is. The QQQs do a lot better than the SPY in almost any time period. Also, the IWM (Russell 2000) performs extremely well - better than the QQQs in almost any time frame. If you buy individual stocks you subject yourself to ""single stock risk"" - you never know what will happen to any particular company, but if you buy an ETF your risk/reward is a lot higher - the graph of the daily prices will be much smoother. You are buying instant diversification. In recent years many companies that create ETFs have come up with funds that buy stocks that are at the leading edge of innovation - like the ARK funds. However, these funds tend to have high volatility - they become overbought then oversold in wide swings. The ARK funds have had a stellar performance record over recent years, but got clobbered recently in the Tech Wreck selloff that we have been in for the past month. Happens from time to time - major sector rotation."

03/21/2021,stocks,There’s always money in the banana stand
03/21/2021,stocks,Ape like banana
03/21/2021,stocks,"While I agree with you, the main reason these stocks performed so well after the covid crash is because people realized that the pandemic made people way more reliant on technology in general, which consists of the products these companies offer (for Disney it was the entertainment aspect of the technology in watching movies and tv shows at home)"
03/21/2021,stocks,Huh? Wouldn’t you want call on VIX? Lol
03/21/2021,stocks,Puts on VIX are horrible because you get IV crushed by VIX itself falling so you barely make any money even if your puts that were previously otm go itm
03/21/2021,stocks,"The VIX usually drops after a crash. The way I see OP's question, buying VIX after the fact would be a waste of cash. If you bought it before the crash though... 🚀"
03/21/2021,stocks,Finally an answer that doesn’t rely on speculation!
03/21/2021,stocks,This guy stonks.
03/21/2021,stocks,If you could invest in hookers and blow it would never go down. Would be a perfect investment for pension funds.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Commenting on folks that do think it's a free 5-10x. I have yet to see a compelling case for Palantir being valued at $200bn - $400bn given that it only last year broke $1bn in revenue, lost money every year it's been in existence, and margins don't appear to be improving. With that said, I like the company and what they do. I just wouldn't be expecting returns like that for any sort of rational reason other than a bet on brain damaged retail investors bringing it to those levels somehow."
03/21/2021,stocks,I don’t know if I would put Tesla’s balance sheet on the same level as Microsoft and Amazon lol
03/21/2021,stocks,Simple and future proof.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Company growth doesn't always equal stock price performance. In 10 years, TSLA will be that much more developed so people won't still want to pay 1000-1500 P/E. If you bring the P/E down to something more reasonable, even 50, the market cap would have to go to 15-20 trillion (13.5 trillion based on the most recent sell off). And that's assuming 0% stock price growth. If you think TSLA will be worth that much then sure. Whereas you could get 100% stock price growth from MSFT and it'll be valued around 3.6 trillion. I think TSLA is a good company, but we're talking about investing. The price already has a lot of the next 10 years built in. The revenue and earnings of MSFT, TSM, and AMZN are completely different than TSLA compared to their market caps. You could argue TSLA will grow the most from an earnings perspective, but again, the fundamentals are already saying that."

03/21/2021,stocks,This is the way
03/21/2021,stocks,"Why do you believe in $TSLA so much? Tesla as a company sure is great, they're the gold standard for electric and leading self-driving currently, but overvalued by sooo much, nearly 4x the next car company Toyota (and subsequent brands) of which sold 4x more cars in 2020 than Tesla. Other established companies are catching up on both EV and Self Driving and Chinese startups will more than likely dominate the Chinese market with how much integration with CCP they have over Tesla and the amount of data they could collect.

On the flip side, everyone has been saying this for the past year or so"
03/21/2021,stocks,Did you buy the stock outright? CSP? CCs? I assume something like that since you wanted the money in your IRA that allows trading options.
03/21/2021,stocks,I am on the same boat... hell even sub 500$ I would seriously consider a position...
03/21/2021,stocks,"Is it a good idea to invest in a company long term that seemingly relies so much on the dynamism of a single person?  

Not making a definitive statement,  just genuinely curious.   If Elon got hit by a car a year from now and died,  would that still be potentially worth a long term play?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Eh, it has a 4-digit PE ratio. It has a LONG way to fall and/or a LOT of growing to do in order to reach a fair price.

I don't mean ""make more cars"". I mean ""literally monopolize the auto industry"", or possibly ""make an order of magnitude more cars, sell two orders of magnitude more batteries, and sell three orders of magnitude more solar panels"".

If I had that much conviction on timing, I'd pick a stock I'm confident will recover (or more likely, a broad-based leveraged etf like others recommended)."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you bought AAPL almost 1 year ago to the day, 3/23/20, you'd have a 125% return even with the recent dip. I guess that's not good enough?"

03/21/2021,stocks,America’s a scam. Always has been. In fact I’d say its worst was in the late 1800s. It’s best not to think about because it’s never gonna change. Too much money in the hands of people who can keep it from changing. Doesn’t mean you can’t make some good stock picks though.
03/21/2021,stocks,Peter Schiff gave a 100% accurate assessment of the real estate crash as it was happening and he got roasted by everyone on CNBC and Fox Business lol. Bernanke got put on the cover of Time Magazine as the Man Who Saved The World.

03/21/2021,stocks,I would buy mobile homes and seller finance them to retiring boomers at 15% interest. Give them a little bit of land like half an acre or so. Easy money. Or buy land and put a mobile home park and seller finance and also charge lot lease per month. You'll make all your money back in a year or so and everything on top of that is gravy. Lumber is up and all building materials are up so new construction homes will cost more. Mobile homes are the ticket. Ask Uncle Warren

03/21/2021,stocks,"Not sure what your family situation is or where you live but you can get a 3D printed house, shipping container home (although containers might be hard to come by right now), a mobile or manufactured home, etc that are cheaper than a typical middle class house. Look up Earthships too that are sustainable off the grid homes. I couldn't do the Earthship thing but I would take certain elements of it. Tennessee also has homes with tons of acreage for good prices. There's a ton of places to go and if you can work remotely you have a ton of options depending on your needs for your family or if you have any health issues or anything. Obviously a tiny home where you have to go upstairs isn't probably the best for a retiree as they get older. But a one level container home or 3D printed home that's basically the size of a condo, then make a big ass deck area to get more outdoor space, would be good for a retired couple or small family. You can get a few containers and arrange them how you want them. Lumber prices and other building materials are getting more expensive so the companies that are creative and building with alternative materials can crush it. In New York (I think) the first legally permitted 3D printed home just sold for $399,999. You can buy land and pay that company or a similar one to print one for you. It's basically concrete and then they finish it up. Not sure if what states allow this though. I wouldn't buy your ""dream house"" especially if you have to take a mortgage. You can rent something and use the money to buy investment property and use the cash flow to pay off your rent and all expenses and live for free or have most of your monthly bills covered, with a mortgage you are paying the bank and losing in that game. You're better off renting somewhere you can get a good deal like from a wealthy landlord losing their shirt (especially in NY, California, Vegas, etc) and buy a bunch of mobile homes and rent them out or seller finance at like 15% interest. Blackstone Group is doing the mobile home thing as well. I think they just raised $500M to buy and owner finance mobile homes. The rates are usually like 12% interest on mobile homes"
03/21/2021,stocks,Become a Primary Dealer and get access to the discount window. Good luck
03/21/2021,stocks,Yes and they bought mobile homes and seller financed people for 18% interest or something like that. I forget the name of the company

And before anyone asks, yes I know they manufacture their semiconductors at TSM, but that can be changed easier than the entire company being overtaken by an authoritarian government."

It's so exhausting and I really don't believe that multi billion dollar funds that have done this for decades, have all the connections and enough funds to rival some countries GDP will have been sitting around this whole time going ""well fuck, looks like they really got us this time, best we can do is throw money at some news hosts, a shitty news company and get some Reddit bots""."

03/21/2021,stocks,This whole thing was cute at first but this whole thing is just getting a little pathetic now.  Not to mention the propaganda and rhetoric is probably hurting more small guys buying into this BS than hurting the hedge funds (the big guys) this was originally about.

03/21/2021,stocks,"It usually is a short term play, but I knew the market bottomed and we were heading for a yearlong bull market, I would use the TQQQ. It’s expense ratio is like .95% to the QQQ .2%. Really not that bad when you consider the TQQQ Is up like 200% in the last 12 months compare to the 50% the QQQ is up. 4 times the return. If I did my quick math correctly"
03/21/2021,stocks,TL;DR TQQQ is the way during epic bull runs like in 2020 but you’ll get burned if it trades sideways (and say goodbye to your money during a bear market).
03/21/2021,stocks,You can hold it long term because time decay is not significant enough to outweigh the benefits of the leverage. The real risk with TQQQ is the wild price swings due to the leverage and that it can lose a lot of value in a bear market. The solution is to keep buying in and waiting for the next bull market.
03/21/2021,stocks,Very nice. You should have done pretty good with that play. 👍👍💲💲

03/21/2021,stocks,There will not be a squeeze unless the board of directors recalls the shares to see if all are accounted for.

Like the ARK and VACQ moves too."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Honestly... I could say, look at the recent ARK evaluation/prediction ... Or many other things.  But the reason I like them is nobody will be able to compete with their low prices.  They are investing so much into throughput and efficiency.  This is why Tesla will win in my eyes, in addition to all the other stuff people talk about."
03/21/2021,stocks,Just bought the stocks.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Amazon also had a 4-digit PE ratio and got to friggin 3000 - 3x higher than Tesla. When you consider the entirety of the master plan they're working towards achieving, the PE ratio for today seems fine. They've executed on the impossible many times before.

Just trying to play devil's advocate as I do agree that Tesla is risky."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah I mean I’m that confident about Tesla in the 10 year window (I frankly think there’s no point in owning any other brand of car if you have a 35,000+ budget), but on a 2 year time frame there are much more compelling investments"

03/21/2021,stocks,"A huge part of capitalism is essentially a scam or pyramid scheme. People always focus on the part of capitalism that stimulates innovation and growth, but there's a whole subsection of capitalism that is committed to rent seeking in all its forms. The simple principle of making money with your money by yoking people and skimming off their production for your gain all by virtue of simply having the power of a mass of capital."
03/21/2021,stocks,Politics is literally just a chess game between billionaires
03/21/2021,stocks,"Far far worse. Now conning is big business and it's about 1000x larger. I think before most people were good and tried to help each other(since it was ""We are all in this together"" and there was a lot of struggle).  You had religion, for better or worse, that kept a lot of people from screwing over their fellow neighbor.  Of course there was a few... but now there are 100's of thousands of Rockefeller wannabe's that do their best to screw over society while pretending to be the good guys.

It's basically always been like this, since the pharaohs though. The rich are rich precisely because they enslave others to do the work while they reap all the benefit(that is the capitalistic way). Bezos doesn't work 100000 times harder than anyone at his company and he didn't deliver any of those packages himself. Nor did he build up the company by himself. He hires other people to make more money which lets him build up a bigger company to make more money in which he can hire more people to make more money. It's slavery. People don't get it, the only difference between now and the past is that slavery doesn't involve whips and chains. It's more subliminal and cordial. You get your 401k and a house, maybe a small boat if your lucky. If you are real lucky you get a vacation or two. So, yeah, it is better off... but it's still slavery. Slaves do all the work and master gets all the reward. I mean, back then the slaves did get shelter and food. They have to give us something to keep us working. But the whole concept of fairness and ""If you work hard..."" is total BS. They had a good thing. If they were not so greedy most slaves would be happy. If they would have given people healthcare and a decent minimum standard of living/safety net that works then children wouldn't be living on the streets.  So ultimately we are going to have another revolution because the same shit is playing out(Again, it looks different but under the hood the same mechanics are at work). The rich will lose(well, they might have a robot army(Boston Dynamics) and AI this time so maybe not. Unfortunately most slaves are really no better than the rich. They are just ""temporary slaves"" in their minds thinking they will get to be master one day(and they might). Everyone wants to be king."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Monday after next/this Monday would be valid. But I also think what’s literally correct is different from slang people use in certain places. 

I think people that say next Monday and mean the following Monday is more like a North East New York type thing."
03/21/2021,stocks,"My rule is to use the easiest words to describe the day. If tomorrow is Monday, I would say “let’s do that tomorrow” it wouldn’t make sense to say “let’s do that next Monday”. If someone says “Next Monday”, and it is Sunday, I would never assume they were talking about tomorrow. Sometimes I say “Awesome I will put you in my schedule for Monday the 29th.”"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think it's because, if you say ""on Monday"", that implies you are talking about the week you are currently in. If you want to specify that you are talking about farther out than the week you are currently in, you need to add a qualifier, so the other person (s) understands which Monday you are referring to ""next Monday's class will be on..."". Although technically correct (the best kind of correct IMO) the Monday that will happen the soonest is the next Monday, we have seemingly agreed, as a society, that ""next Monday"" isn't ""this Monday"", it's the next one.

But what do I know, I have three fingers of gin in my coffee?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"You make a good point. My only argument would be semantics. If we say ""I'll pay you when I'm in town"" it sounds like you are arriving soon/on your way. Whereas, if you say ""I'll pay you back next time I'm in town"" sounds like you'll be back eventually, you just don't know when. This changes though if you come to town once a week and the other person is aware of this (like how Mondays are once a week). You would say ""I'll pay you back when I'm in town"" if it was a Thursday and you would be arriving on Monday (like you always do). Whereas if you come to town every week you would likely say ""I'll pay you back next time I'm in town"" if you were already in the town. But even then you would likely just say ""I'll pay you back next week"". Overall I think this whole argument will forever exist due to no uniform understanding of what each person means. Similarly how 3/4/21 can either mean March 4 or April 3 (I am aware there are regional differences e.g. USA vs UK but even within the regions (I can only speak for Canada) people sometimes decide for themselves whether they want the month or day to come first.)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I always use it like ""we're going Monday"" means the next happening of Monday, wether I say it on a Tuesday or a Sunday. ""Next Monday"" means the one after ""Monday"".

And it sounds really stupid now that I typed it out."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think that you could infer that next Monday means 8 days out? I could be wrong. I know that the true “next” Monday is tomorrow. 

Talking from today’s perspective, I would refer to tomorrow as Monday, but the Monday next week would be “next Monday” to me."
03/21/2021,stocks,[reference 😂](https://youtu.be/71nvWNAvZfs)
03/21/2021,stocks,"It's a time thing. If it's a Monday and you want to refer to Wednesday of the next week, next Wednesday makes sense, as this Wednesday would be refered to as such. I'm sure different places just have different interpretations as well though."
03/21/2021,stocks,Man I always say the same thing. It’s an argument we will never win!
03/21/2021,stocks,Fucking this all day god damn
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s a reasonable inference, because if someone meant  the upcoming Monday they would say “this Monday.” “Next” connotes “Monday of the next week”"
03/21/2021,stocks,If I meant this Monday I'd have said this Monday.
03/21/2021,stocks,"This and next refer to an implied week. This Monday is the Monday this week. Next Monday is the Monday next week. This Monday doesn’t really make sense without the implied week, but next Monday can If you define it your way. You are definitely using an uncommon meaning though.

That said, what day does the week start on? If your answer is Monday then this Monday already happened."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Because if the person meant the Monday coming up you would just say Monday. Eg it's Tuesday, and I say I'll pay you Monday. You know exactly that it's this coming Monday. Why would you say I'll pay you next Monday if you could just say Monday."
03/21/2021,stocks,The following Monday
03/21/2021,stocks,"""I'll pay you back next time I'm in town"" is still valid with the definition. You are currently in town so when you return that's the ""next"" time. It's the same as if you said ""next Monday"" on a Monday. It's the next one to occur."
03/21/2021,stocks,"This Monday = tomorrow, the Monday of this week. Next Monday = the 29th, the Monday of next week. Last Saturday was yesterday, this Saturday is next weekend - as we're currently on a weekend. Tomorrow this Saturday will be this weekend, and today will be last weekend.

If you're currently in town, next time your in town is when you leave and come back. If you're not currently in town, the next time you're in town is the first trip you make in after this point in time.

Time is relative."

Some things you just can’t avoid. You can prolong it. Same as if your dad tells you to go to your room and wait for him as he’s gonna whoop your ass with his belt for breaking a TV. And you ask can you use the bathroom first. You know the ads whopping is coming, you’re just prolonging the inevitable. And while you’re prolonging it, there’s a hope your dad would simply forget about it and move on to another thing. So you got your free pass out of the situation by distraction."

The *bare minimum* they had to do was buy maybe 2% of float each trading day since January, and you bet your ass they have done that by now, especially with how much publicity it got.

GME will not squeeze again. This run up is not a squeeze (nor is it a pre-squeeze, delta, or gamma squeeze). This is just the denial phase of grief. The idea of bagholding has been fetishized, and the only people still playing this now completely lack any shred of sense or market knowledge. It’s confirmation bias to the extreme and I’m really tired of seeing it everywhere. There isn’t some crazy conspiracy to hide the shorts — we just lost and the hedgies won.

Step 1. Split shares 5 to 1    
    
Step 2. 1 time dividend to all share holders knowing very well that will be going right back into buying the now cheaper stock.    
    
Step 3. Cohen officially made CEO + Earning report exceeds expectations meaning the bears begin to show a little interest as well    
    
Step 4. Recall shares triggering short squeeze which in turn triggers gamma squeezing which together force the mother of all short squeezes.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Shorts must cover. The only way it doesn’t squeeze is if GameStop goes bankrupt which is highly unlikely given the recent developments, or they just keep delaying covering their shorts for years and years, while paying interest on them. They can only stay solvent for so long."

I know they will continue to be a massive company for years to come. But I'm not rushing to get one of the nearly 18 billion shares that exist either.

Every single person I know who has owned one has had a major quality control issue within the first year that would never make it off the assembly line anywhere else. I don’t think the Reddit discourse on Tesla reflects the every day person’s opinion necessarily. I personally still think Tesla has a lot of growth and maturation to do before I could be that confident about the 10 year prospects.

03/21/2021,stocks,I agree. I think GME has a cult following now and if they were smart they would create a tokencoin to be used at their stores and in gaming similar to the Geoffrey dollar from Toys R Us. They can easily get into branded products now because I think the brand has gotten so much recognition in the last year. There's a lot of opportunity for them if they're smart

Meanwhile; every year it gets harder and harder for the average person to coordinate civil dissent nationwide without the companies who own their lines of communication being able to monitor, shut down, alter, or even fabricate their communications at will.

Within the next generation, AI monitoring, and corporate penetration into your every day life, will be at a point where you will not be able to organize a nationwide protest or disruption; meanwhile those you oppose will be able to bring an entire nation or more of resources against whatever isolated and uncoordinated action you bring."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Normally I would agree with this, but the problem is that America has a near-flawless propaganda machine within it's borders. A very large piece of that propaganda involves convincing people that things aren't really that bad and if they are, a very specific group of people (usually the opposite political party) are to blame and their suggested methods of improvement won't work. The result? There are a lot of lower/middle class people in this country - probably more than you'd feel comfortable with - who are willing to forgo comforts and guaranteed basic needs because they've been thoroughly convinced that providing those comforts and basic needs to *everybody* is a bad government system, in spite of evidence to the contrary.

There are *everyday citizens* in America who would legitimately, physically *fight* to keep the country the way it is financially because they'll be damned if people who ""don't deserve it"" get help, whether those people are of another party, another race, or simply just another thought process that isn't the singular one they've been hypnotized into believing over the last few decades.

03/21/2021,stocks,This seems like confirmation bias with little relation to fact. What is your basis for thinking that retail GME holders have anywhere near enough volume to be making any difference in the stock price whatsoever? GME’s activity after the January spike looks a lot more like big institutional players making moves with retail caught in the middle (for better or worse).
03/21/2021,stocks,I’d hope they don’t actually hold for good. Gme long term is a 40 stock at best. Everyone should be holding to push it until they can sell for gross overvalue and gains. You don’t just ride this train forever or you miss the stop eventually.

03/21/2021,stocks,"This is related to Grice's maxim of quantity, which describes how humans speak in normal conversation. When we speak, we don't give extra information, saying next monday violates this if you mean tomorrow, so when people hear it they think ""that extra information must have been necessary, they must mean a week from romorrow""

The typical example is when saying stuff like ""This soup contains no human flesh"", if you hear that you think either the soup must contain it, or that some other soups must have human flesh in it, since that statement has too much uneccessary information.

It's interesting how logically ""next Monday"" is wrong, but because of the way people speak we often understand it by reading between the lines (even if it is sometimes confusing)."

I watched the price skyrocket that Thursday morning from 350 to 500 at open only for it to plummet down to 100 when RH castrated buying power of Americans. That was fucked and it sucks but since then I think this whole thing has been dead and I agree the recent rise is just hype/fomo buying.

Since then? Yeah, I don't believe there is any secret, conspiracy. Short interest is accurate and people buying now are just deluding themselves. The market always corrects and Gamestops fundamentals really only support a $20-40 price depending on optimism about their new leadership.

There's reason to be optimistic, but like... $60 in a year or two kind of optimism. And that's still *supremely* optimistic."

03/21/2021,stocks,Look up the action on options on airlines on 9/11. Many brokers had a few hundred thousand percent return but never collected their money
03/21/2021,stocks,"Don’t compare modern day capitalism in developed nations to chattel slavery lol.

But yes I 100% understand where you’re coming from. [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vG37wwhbS88&vl=en-US) does a good job showing that to the owning class, we’re no different from factory farmed cattle, chickens, or production line robots. We’re Human Resources that need to be exploited as much as possible in as many ways as possible at all times."
03/21/2021,stocks,"...also the most peaceful and prosperous period in human history. So we have that going for us, which is nice."
03/21/2021,stocks,Damn.
03/21/2021,stocks,"No, In the south we say this Monday for the following Monday, and next Monday for the Monday after."
03/21/2021,stocks,Awesome! Well TIL.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Let's solve this issue today, it's the day, month, year,

01 January 2021.

Issue sorted."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I personally just find the ""next"" for the upcoming Monday redundant. If you say ""I'll see you on Monday"" there is no confusion about which Monday. Saying ""next Monday"" brings up confusion. Conciseness is important in language. *Why say lot word when few word do trick*"
03/21/2021,stocks,I know the difference between the two and I'm fine with how I typed it 👌
03/21/2021,stocks,It's  southern thing. You don't have to understand 👌
03/21/2021,stocks,Makes sense. I was just commenting because it seemed as if you were valuing the company and it’s potential for future growth based on the share price alone. Market cap and P/E ratio will be more informative and tell a more complete story.
03/21/2021,stocks,"People pick SOXX because they’re too scared to go balls deep in SOXL.

SOXX is just a more “conservative” and not a 3x leverage stock like SOXL. Thats pretty much it. It goes up fast but when it falls, man does it *fall*"
03/21/2021,stocks,About 3x as risky
03/21/2021,stocks,Leveraged ETFs usually have drift. Learn about this before investing.

03/21/2021,stocks,Some DD to start Monday morning. Now that is due diligence.
03/21/2021,stocks,You really think the poor have money in the stock market? The poor are still living check to check unfortunately. If you have any money in savings or the market consider yourself privileged.
03/21/2021,stocks,I like how you said “shouldn’t” instead of “can’t” LOL
03/21/2021,stocks,This is the way.
03/21/2021,stocks,"It's interesting to see more and more people unwinding their diversity holdings to throw it all into GME. That will make a sell-off hit even harder, I imagine. Maybe not by much, but it certainly makes it harder to some scale to get money out of wider holdings."
03/21/2021,stocks,This is why 20% of my portfolio is in extremely low risk devices.  Market dumps?  Immediately move all of that into banks or tech uk will rebound like nvda or aapl
03/21/2021,stocks,What about FTD numbers in GME? Would you consider them significant?
03/21/2021,stocks,"There’s a lot of dd on how they do it

HF lost $B I L L I O N S."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Are you sure?

2008 was a result of stupidity and hubris by so called financial titans. Just because they got bailed out in the end, doesn’t excuse how dumb and greedy they were to get to that point."
03/21/2021,stocks,Do you mind explaining this? I googled volatility decay before and I still have a hard time understanding it. LETF’s are new to me but definitely have aroused my interest.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Awesome, thx. For some reason I always stayed away from leveraged ETF, but might look into them some more"
03/21/2021,stocks,You can come eat tendies with me. I’ve got a few extra.
03/21/2021,stocks,Who's playing games buddy?
03/21/2021,stocks,"No, you buy a put contract from someone who has enough capital to buy 100 shares at the strike price. The person selling the put contract is then selling a cash secured put. You’re talking about someone selling covered calls."
03/21/2021,stocks,Actually Investopedia clearly writes that none of the participants need to hold any stocks for the put option contract.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The simple answer is more shares are shorted than exist amd a significant portion mare being held and won't be available. Depending on how things play out there's a good chance the massive volatile shorts cascade and cause large dipa in other stocks across the board.
When the shorts come due, they will have to sell other stocks to create liquidity to purchase the shares of GME. It could be a painful correction of between 2-5 percent, or a massive collapse.

No one knows when those shorts are due, but if enough come due at once and Hedges go bankrupt it will start to impact brokers and clearinghouse. Legally somone HAS to buy those shares."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The point is, when the losing hedgefunds need to cover the shorts, they'll need to/will liquidate their whole positions and get margin called. That whole liquidation, which is a fuck ton of money, will bring down a lot of huge stocks. Of course other hedgefunds will profit from GME and put it back into the market, but there might be one or two red days on some stocks"
03/21/2021,stocks,lol pump and dump? whens the dump
03/21/2021,stocks,listen hedg. You are not seeing the picture. Your username checks out
03/21/2021,stocks,"Absolutely not. Go and read deep and you'll see what's going on, and why we're winning. Patience is the key, and yes if they are just holding like us it eventually has to pop. They're paying mad money each day the longer this goes on. It costs us nothing"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes and no. 
Since the hedge funds have their investments spread across tons and tons of other things. 

If HF 1 owes $10B to buy shares of GME to cover their shorts they need to get that money. Only way is to sell other things. So if all of a sudden a hedge fund who owns 500,000 shares of Apple, Microsoft and Amazon each sells all those to cover it will tank those shares. 

So now people see them tanking and panic which may cause others to sell and so on. So basically GME or other shares in similar scenario go way way up which forces everything down by relation."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The idea is that it will cost so much to cover (for the hedge funds) that they will have to sell off the other stocks they’re holding, which is a lot, and the market as a whole will feel it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I don't believe so. Personally I'm of the opinion they shouldn't be bailed out. 

They made poor decisions and have to live with the consequences. If I make extremely risky moves with my money and get screwed I don't get bailed out. They shouldn't either."
03/21/2021,stocks,No Walmarts in Spain m'afraid...
03/21/2021,stocks,is Bazaar trading a thing?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well you can't buy shares of VIX, you have to buy VXX, UVXY, etc. You can buy options on VIX directly though.

But yeah, calls on VIX works (providing VIX goes up) but the options are pretty illiquid so they can be a pain in the ass to trade sometimes as there's usually a wide spread and you almost always have to sell at bid instead of at least getting to sell for mid. Forget about selling for ask.

Alternatively you can trade VIX futures, but DO NOT do this if you are new to trading, new to futures, or new to trading volatility products in general. VIX futures allow you to both long and short without having to worry about IV crush since IV and the greeks in general don't exist on futures."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Have you bought puts on VIX before? You get IV crushed every time. 

Let's say you buy 20p when VIX is 30. VIX drops down to 20 and you'll only be up like MAYBE 50% if you're lucky because of IV crush despite the underlying dropping 30%. On top of that VIX options are very illiquid and the spread is horrible. The r:r is terrible with puts. I'm speaking from experience here.

Calls work very well, providing VIX is spiking of course. You still have the issue of them being illiquid with a wide spread though.

If you want to short VIX either short VIX futures or short one of the stocks that tracks VIX."

03/21/2021,stocks,Care to expand on that?
03/21/2021,stocks,interesting - thanks for the reply
03/21/2021,stocks,Thank you
03/21/2021,stocks,"Ahh, sorry I didn’t understand. Thanks. I like the picks btw :)"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Teslas also have a shit interior compared to what you get in most comparably priced ICE cars.


But more generally, there are plenty of reasons to not own a Tesla. Most people don’t really care about their 0-60 time or how much torque they generate, and outside of a few specific performance metrics it mostly just comes down to subjective preferences.

Just as an example, like I mentioned I generally dislike their interiors, and I make long range trips often enough that their range and charging speeds would be an annoyance. I’m also not a big fan of their massive touch screen approach to interacting with the car, and ideologically I’m not a fan of the general saas trend, so I don’t like to see subscription based ownership extending to things like cars or their software. I don’t think that Teslas are objectively bad or anything, but they aren’t my cup of tea and that alone is plenty enough reason to not consider buying one. I know lots of people who love their Teslas, and if that’s the car you want then more power to you."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Storage capacity also isn't great for a hatchback. I really wanted to like the car because it seemed like a no brainer buying used with their reliability and I only wanted a car out of necessity, but I wouldn't be able to fit my shit for long distance travel"
03/21/2021,stocks,I personally prefer the taste of Reign much better but to each his own. Reign ironically is part of Monster.
03/21/2021,stocks,"You really don't know? Well, maybe you shouldn't know :-)"
03/21/2021,stocks,For sure. They can create cold storage wallets too. Branded gaming chairs and basically anything Amazon can make as an Amazon Essentials product to do with gaming or a derivative of gaming (office chair instead of gaming chair)
03/21/2021,stocks,"I cringe at the thought of a future where every company has their own coin.

""Sorry we only accept WalCoin here. Feel free to use one of our WalCoin ATM's with a small withdrawal fee.""

""Will this work?""

""No that's a CosCoin we're not costco."""
03/21/2021,stocks,"In all honesty though, GameCoin sounds like an awesome idea! It doesn’t even sound gimmicky, it sounds like a proper token/currency that could easily be implemented across all gaming platforms"
03/21/2021,stocks,I haven't been in there so I don't know what they're posting but basically the game is rigged to a certain degree. This is nothing new. Some people are just finding this out and they're minds are blown. Now they think every little thing is connected. They're not necessarily wrong it just goes overboard and then all the crazy and stupid stuff is what spreads on the internet. I think a lot of people are finally realizing how rigged everything in their life has been and can't handle it yet lol
03/21/2021,stocks,Normally I would agree with you buy we live in clown world now

03/21/2021,stocks,"Spent too much on special interest items... Smaller amount on sustainment checks to the people...and the people rejoiced...

03/21/2021,stocks,"Strictly speaking, the US hasn't historically done well against small groups of guys with guns. We're probably the most capable nation in the world if we're fighting another nation, but we've been in the middle east for twenty years trying to fight a bunch of guys in caves with AKs."
03/21/2021,stocks,Haha...you saw them storm the US Capitol right? If those people had more malicious intent they could have killed a lot of politicians. That also wasn't even a large group of people. Imagine millions of Americans with guns. What do you do against that? Nobody wants dead people. The rich just want servants and slaves. Hard to be treat your servants like shit when they outnumber you and have the power to kill you.
03/21/2021,stocks,"People are too comfortable. Revolutions in France and Russia happened when people were literally starving. As long as the majority have food and Netflix, the people in charge can rest easy."
03/21/2021,stocks,That was not nice to say 😕
03/21/2021,stocks,Shut up 🤡
03/21/2021,stocks,that comes down to risk management. you should already have those drawdowns planned for.
03/21/2021,stocks,Isn't that the name of the game in capitalism?
03/21/2021,stocks,"GME has a promising future, expanding into a large gaming sector which for so long has been neglected. With a new management team on board, I see GME doing very well. I'm bullish on GME."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It's true. Everyday we all play this game but most people have no idea this game exists and that they are playing and losing this game. The game is called ""who is in debt to who"""
03/21/2021,stocks,"Hits a bit different when you realize the vast majority of that prosperity flows directly to the top, since productivity has skyrocketed and wages have stagnated"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes and the fact that each generation has a new wealthiest individual - Gates, Bezos, Musk etc. No more monastic and dynastic wealth and power (at least not nearly on the scale of what it was even 100 years ago) is really nice. Some people don't understand history and will always blame others for the lack of their own success."
03/21/2021,stocks,That peace is only between powerful countries. There’s still plenty of violence perpetuated against weaker countries by powerful countries and between other groups.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I know another guy who started multiple LLC's and invoiced himself from the different LLC's and maxed out his credit cards and took the cash to flip multi-million dollar homes. His credit would go from the 800's to the 500's back to the 800's, etc after he sold the house and paid off the credit cards. They tried to stop him but he was legally abiding by their own Terms and Conditions (a written contract) and had to let him keep doing this lol. I think they've since changed their contracts but you never know. I know another idiot who got their money stolen by a contractor and had to sell an incomplete home. They still made money because homes were going up over 50% or more in a year in some areas for multiple years. These people's project increased 30% in 6 months and they sold to another investor lol."
03/21/2021,stocks,Yuck.  Why not just follow ISO standards?  8601 is clear it's YYYY-MM-DD.

True for everyone everywhere 👍"
03/21/2021,stocks,"You clearly don't ""understand"" English."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm sorry. I should have clarified, I meant SOXX vs SMH. The primary difference I see is TSM's weight."
03/21/2021,stocks,"When it falls buy calls

When it peaks, buy puts

You can even do both on the same day lol and sell both on the same day."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I literally am in debt, make a little above the minimum wage and still have around 50-200 to invest in stocks each month. i don't go out to Mcdonalds eating, i don't buy a stupid phone each year and i don't buy clothing each month... so what?

If you literally have no money left end of month you either didn't write down your spendings and earnings precisely and figured what bs you do, live in an area to expensive for you right now or work a job that is literally not worth a minute of your time.

After work im not done, im educating myself (reading books mostly) , cooking for the next day and i do sport as often as my body allows me too. If you do nothing you can't expect something to happen, however if there is nothing to do you should do nothing.

This mostly is a problem created by short thought materialism and not playing the long game. Do i really need those 3 pair of nike shoes? Ask yourself the real questions!"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I mean look at the GME threads.  It's either, ""hey guys, I invested my life savings of $500, hope this wins big!"" or ""lol, just went in for another $50k, holding 500 now.""  Poor people might end up making enough to cover another rent payment or two.  Already rich people will be paying off their second house."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Am poor af, I bought 3 stock though don’t count us out.

Edit: some bills went unpaid/stimmy helped"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well, I can't see the future. But there is reason to be optimistic"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, squeezes of that size can happen. The gigantic one that people on the GME subreddit keep talking about won‘t. It’s not going to go far over 1k, if it goes there at all. And the market won’t care much about that."

03/21/2021,stocks,I think I missed it 😄
03/21/2021,stocks,Checks what out?
03/21/2021,stocks,"As someone who owns GME, you sound like a new investor. Not a putdown, just truth. Do you realize how much they're paying in interest for the loaned shares? Likely 1.5% APY or less. Are you familiar with options and do you know what a put is? Do you realize at each new ATH, hedge funds can and do open puts and ride it on the inevitable way down and that as a trader, you can make money on both sides of a movement in a stocks price? With GME, there is a possibility of making money IF the stock goes up. Once it does, opening a put at say $300 is a near total GUARANTEE of making money given 2-4 weeks. Funds have more liquidity than you and I, more tools at their disposal, and key people and institutions both on speed dial and in their back pocket. 

I doubt you'll listen to a word I say until you get burned once or twice your self but I encourage you to actually learn how this stuff works OUTSIDE of near cult-like ""DD"" in a ""blind-leading-the-blind"" approach. There are many smart people invested in GME who are 1) hedging their position with derivatives you likely are not familiar with and 2) have an insanely attractive cost-basis and position. Chances are you're not one of them. 

Again, not in any way trying to disparage you because I'm in GME myself but what you wrote and the way you wrote it reads amateurish and the only way to success is real knowledge, which takes work."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sry, I lack the deeper understanding. I don't really get why anyone would start selling like crazy.

To stick to your example, if one hedge fund starts dumping stocks, obviously it will affect the markets - but since people know it's due to hedge funds trying to cover their shorts, why would everyone else start to dump their stocks as well, especially knowing that nothing is wrong with those companies?

I get herd mentality and all that, but everyone should be aware of the fact right now that any major loss in stock value is directly connected to hedge funds trying to survive - so why not simply ride out that storm, buy the dip and move on? Why would anyone who understands stock markets dump all their stocks just because on hedge fund needs cash?

If this would all happen behind closed doors without the slightest indicator, sure. But as of now, everyone is mostly informed what's about to happen and why - so why would there still be panic selling?

I hope my question/viewpoint makes sense."
03/21/2021,stocks,Greed is rampant. Another bail out to companies is a no no. Let those companies fail and the people can make new companies.
03/21/2021,stocks,Lol what’s the Spanish version of Walmart?

03/21/2021,stocks,not to mention I think more of us would be on board with a reborn gamestop than amazon
03/21/2021,stocks,No one wants crappy products like that from a video game store.  You’d go bankrupt again due to unsellable inventory.
03/21/2021,stocks,"And just a generation later well ne right back to company stores, company scrip, and generational debt between families and companies preventing social mobility or escape"
03/21/2021,stocks,That sounds like future giftcards though. I'd be down for it
03/21/2021,stocks,I mean when the dollar ends up being worthless due to hyperinflation....
03/21/2021,stocks,I think it’d be more like “we accept the standard coins and offer perks/rewards for customers who use our coin”
03/21/2021,stocks,"Back in the day, stores would give sticky stamps to buyers that could later redeemed for goods. In Canada, the national currency is Canadian Tire bucks.

03/21/2021,stocks,Well thankfully in the US companies are required by law to accept US currency.
03/21/2021,stocks,I thought a CosCoin was when you put Roofies in someone’s butthole.
03/21/2021,stocks,How would that differ from a loyalty/rewards program but with more of your money involved?
03/21/2021,stocks,Haha most likely.

03/21/2021,stocks,"They’re giving $1,400 more to most people and $300 a month per child indefinitely whether a parent works or not. That’s good for them and also for stocks like WMT, COST, and TGT. A lot of those kiddie bucks will ultimately find their way into DIS too."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It fucking sucks, but the way inflation works, giving money to rich people who already have what they need, will result in them investing it which inflates the stock market (good inflation), whereas giving money to the people who actually need it and will spend it on the services and goods they don’t already have will inflate the costs of those services and goods (which is bad inflation). It’d actually be a lot better for the economy if everyone who received stimulus dumped it into stocks instead of spending it elsewhere"

It’s offensive the flippancy with which they talk about our money in the trillions."

03/21/2021,stocks,A couple grand of free money to households would create even greater inflation in consumer goods than were seeing now. You have to consider feedback mechanisms here. It's always better to prop up jobs than simply give money to people.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Having a bit of money left each month won’t make you rich.

It may instill good habits, but in order to get rich you have to either 1. Have a high paying job like Software Engineer right out of college. Or 2. Be willing to put in another 40 hours on top of of your minimum wage job into a business that may or may not work.

You do realize that every single CNBC profile on a financially independent person is one of those two things. It’s a LOT easier to invest and make big life changing gambles if you can gamble $15,000 on a 10x stock than just $200.

Not to mention every single story about someone not buying material goods in order to be frugal is 1. In the extreme minority, promoting a blog or other hustle and 2. Was doing it *after* the biggest financial crisis modern history where everyone who’s not a complete idiot could make massive returns over these past 13 years.

I wish I had money in 2008 to buy a home or invest in the stock market.

I was living in Los Angeles with my wife and we were paying $1600 for 400sq ft.

We didn’t make that much. My wife took the bus to work and I commuted 60miles a day.

We had little debt, but very little savings. We wanted to buy a house so bad. A fixer, anything. But we couldn’t afford to put any money down nor could we afford the house payment.

If someone told me that we needed to drink less coffee or be more frugal than I already was I would have snapped.

We now make 4x what we made then and our net worth has gone up dramatically but it wasn’t just from being frugal, it was primarily from making more money AND having a lot more money in aggressive mutual funds AND the ability to diversify with that extra money."

I'm not saying that it makes you rich or anything, just that there are plenty of people who don't have even that luxury. Also ""being in debt"", doesn't mean shit. Everyone I know is in debt. Student loans, mortgages, medical expenses... yet none of them is poor. 


I'm happy that you managed to make it work, and I agree that generally if people were smarter about their spendings they would be better off. But be honest with yourself, to get where you are it took just as much luck as hard work."

Do you have a car? Do you know how much a car seat costs for a kid? A good one is around $250. Now imagine you have two kids. Or three. If you can barely provide for yourself even though you are doing all the right things and providing benefit to society then you are still poor."

S3 also has two numbers it reports on: short interest using the traditional calculation and S3 using it's own in-house calculation. The in-house calculation existed before the GME craze and is not in any way a response to GME. It's also hilarious that anyone in that thread who pointed this out got downvoted and called a shill."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yep...put a $5700 bill in one of our pockets ..a check for $1400 in another...and the people rejoiced.

Personally...if they were helping businesses, and making sure unemployment was adequately funded, I don't see the need to be passing out checks.  But if they are going to pass out checks, I don't think they did it very well.  $1,000 per household for 16 months would have been a lot more helpful than $1400 one time, and a bunch of special interest projects."
03/21/2021,stocks,Because that’s what they exist to do
03/21/2021,stocks,"You were missing the point. How much of the 1.9 trillion dollars goes towards the affordable Care act?  And how much goes towards their special interest items, to include tunnels, bridges, etc, that have zero to do with the pandemic.

What would the cost of the bill been if it was only things that helped with a pandemic?  I doubt it's validity, but I've heard 10% of the bill are direct benefits for the pandemic. 

it's not about whether or not there are good things in the bill, it's about all the BS in the bill that went along with it. 

And you sound like somebody who bought off on it, that that 5700 per person debt that is going to be passed on to our children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren... Is somehow justified because 10% (or whatever the actual percentage is) of the spending actually went to benefit the pandemic."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I personally don't believe in passing out checks. I'm just saying, if they are going to put taxpayers in that huge amount of debt to pass out checks, it could have been done much better.  I think these stimulus bills have put about $15,000 worth of tax debt on every man woman and child in the United States.  It is something that our children and grandchildren will be paying off.

I don't believe the checks being passed out is what has caused the inflation. Everything is going to go up in cost, because we're all going to be paying $4-5 a gallon for fuel here shortly.  Anything that is transported to be sold, is going to go up in price.  And when they pass $15 minimum wage, that will put one and a half million people out of work and cause even more inflation."
03/21/2021,stocks,"$5700 is the cost of the stimulus bill per every man woman and child in the US. There's about 325 million people in the US. Divide $1.9 trillion by 325 million, and it's about $5,700. 

There's about 122 million households in the US.  The $1.9 trillion is a little under $16,000 per household.  So the $1.9 trillion is about enough to give each household $1,000 a month for 16 months."
03/21/2021,stocks,Good point but I believe you mean US military. The US military and US government do not always see eye-to-eye as that event pointed out.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Luckily for the government. I seriously believe that. Never underestimate an armed and desperate people. Remember most of the Capitol rioters were not armed. Their reason for doing what they did was retarded but I did love seeing our indignant politicians shit themselves and it was a reminder of how quickly they can be overrun if people are desperate enough. If more of them remembered that, they might work in our interest more.

I also believe far more active and retired members of our armed forces would turn against our government in a revolution than you'd think."

 Properly does not remain material fully, but god damnit use birth control before you set them up to fail.

No one works at wendys cause he likes to do so.

Does tqqq drop 100% essentially wiping out your entire investment?  I honestly don’t know the mechanics of tqqq, but in theory that’s what would happen. 

It is extremely unlikely so I wouldn’t be too concerned about it if you have some cash to play around with. Although it isn’t anything I am invested in. Regular Nasdaq is risky enough for me. But I am also at a point where I have some decent $$$ so I am not as concerned about tripling it as I am not losing it while still getting some upside."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that is an interesting idea. Right now, usually wait for the nasdaq to get overextended from the 50 day MA on a monthly chart. Then I start thinking SQQQ. If the price is near the 50 day MA on the monthly chart, I start thinking the TQQQ. That of course only works in a bull market, but like tug said, the market’s tendency, or bias, is up"
03/21/2021,stocks,You just gotta be careful because those work on the downside as well. a 5 % loss in a day is 15% in the 3x leveraged. I just wait for a nice enough dip. Patience is key
03/21/2021,stocks,"I never said I would own them at the same time. If the market is oversold, buy the TQQQ, if way overbought, buy the SQQQ. And just keep cash when uncertain of a market direction"

Like Last March Covid hit, etc.  Even right now, I buy very small amounts on a monthly basis, and I will sell when the volatility spikes. Never sure when that will happen though.

It's tired, and it doesn't work for everyone otherwise *they'd already be doing it*. Your preconception of people just not understanding how to budget is so completely insulting.

The only reason I have that I'm not still there is I had a GI bill to use for school and even then I had to work full time *and* go to school which would have been impossible with a kid or literally anyone else in my life that depended on my presence.

03/21/2021,stocks,"...I’m probably missing what you’re saying, and I said my comment in a semi joking manner, but I’m serious. 

I’ve built a fantastic life for myself. I’m a scientist (one that worked on one of the covid vaccines) and am getting married soon. I was born to a working family. My fathers a chef and when 2008 hit, it hit us HARD because he bought a restaurant a couple years prior. I worked and paid for EVERYTHING I have, and I got here by not eating out everyday, getting a new phone each year, etc (not saying that’s literally it, but that was a big part of how I made sure I had enough money to make my life happen). I try to give advice like that in good faith to people, and while I understand that it shouldn’t be necessary, unfortunately it is, so why do people give me shit when I’m trying to help out?

The heat McDonald’s had a couple years ago when they released that budget help thing for employees and that interview with an employee? Yea, what everyone glosses over is that the guy had a new car (not used, new) and only lived a mile away when he could’ve ridden a bike, bought designer shit, ate out, etc.

Again, I know it shouldn’t be necessary, but for a lot of people it is. If you want a better chance at changing your situation you have to be willing to make sacrifices unfortunately, and that’s why I try to get at. Yeah it’s not fun, but eating out, getting Starbucks, etc adds up quick. The amount that a lot of people spend on takeout/eating out each month could easily be a car payment or a monthly payment for community college...I just don’t get why I get yelled at when I tell people what worked for me and that while it’s not ideal, they should really look at just how much they’re spending."

As for shorted values, I looked at a tweet by someone on twitter called Ihor Dusaniwsky. 

https://twitter.com/ihors3/status/1364320869858820100?s=19


In addition, it could be confirmation bias, but the volume that was traded for XRT recently more than doubled compared to 1 march at 2.7M.

Edit: In the case where both our numbers are correct, I would assume that 3.44% is the latest updated number only after rebalancing on Friday. Which I'm hesitant to claim this since idk how long it takes for XRT to report their changes"
03/21/2021,stocks,So which are you buying on Monday?
03/21/2021,stocks,Thx mate. We did a research a while ago (AI-lab) and the volatilty was actually predictable to a certain degree... might be worth a second look💪
03/21/2021,stocks,"I ain't your amigo, dude."
03/21/2021,stocks,"To be fair, I replied after they had already finished their convo. Still, gme bull af"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Absolutely, I just love that every one of the GME talking points is completely devoid of facts and when they are asked about it the just call you a shill and move on. ""Robinhood shut down trading to help Citadel"" - no evidence. ""There is more than 100% short interest still"" - no evidence. ""They are naked shorting!!!!"" -less than no evidence. ""Short ladder attacks"" - made up term, no evidence. ""The hedge funds are losing money big-time"" - technically sort of true but only some of them and the rest are making bank off of the rube retail investors."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I have no idea what you are talking about, no one has responded to any of my comments with a source. Jesus, imagine calling someone else a clown and being that wrong.

03/21/2021,stocks,I see you have very high expectations there.
2021-03-21 16:52:39,stocks,"If I have decided I will buy a certain stock if it falls below a certain price, what is the downside to just selling a put at that price? For example, let's say I've decided I'm going to buy 100 shares of Ford if it falls below $10/share. What downside is there to just selling a put for 100 shares at $10 per share and make a little extra money at the same time? Why would anyone use a buy limit order instead of just selling a put and making a couple extra bucks?

To be clear, I'm 100% not doing this, I'm just curious."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Two downsides/considerations: One,  if the stock drops below your strike price less premium received and you get assigned, you are losing money immediately. Two, if the stock moves up significantly, you missed out on the gain, which could be more than your option premium.

Edit: Selling in the money puts is different and and good way to reduce your cost basis when entering a position."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think the points been kind of made but think of it like agreeing to purchase a Ferrari. You really want the Ferrari but it cost $750k and you can only spend $500k 

So your rich friend with a $750k Ferrari says “I’ll make you a deal if my Ferrari is suddenly worth less than 750k I’ll sell it to you for that 500k you’ve been offering, hell I’ll even throw you 5k on top to get an oil change when you get the car”

Sounds all fine and dandy until he crashes the car into a telephone pole drops it’s value to $50k and then tell you to come pick it up whenever you’re ready."
03/21/2021,stocks,"A lot of wrong answers here. 

The first risk is share price drops below your strike price and you don’t buy at the bottom. However, if you want to sell the puts, you are willing to pay the strike price minus premiums, the risk is even lower comparing to buy the shares outright.

The second risk is share price recovers before expiry and you just receive your premiums and miss potential profits if holding the shares.

If you really want to get the shares, sell ITM puts instead, since the intrinsic values are included in the premiums, so you are not missing anything.

Retail investors use limit orders more because a lot of them simply don’t understand how options work or think they are too risky. In addition, not everyone can take assignment on 100 shares so people are using limit orders to 10-20 or even fraction shares"
03/21/2021,stocks,When you sell the put your money (in the amount of the put) becomes unusable until the contract expires or is exercised. Also you risk catching a falling knife. Good for people with long term plans on good companies with lots of capitol.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Looks like a lot of people on here are saying ""Because you could have made more if you bought at the bottom"" which is a really unhealthy and unrealistic way to do stocks. If you do your DD and know what price you're willing to buy at, then you're fine selling the put. Buy yes, to add on what everyone here is saying, you run the risk of not buying at the bottom, exactly if you sent the buy limit at that price, then it keeps going down.

03/21/2021,stocks,"If your decision to want to buy the stock at that price changes (perhaps it fell due to bad news with lasting impact), you're still stuck with the put. See anchoring fallacy"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think the other downside is you lock in the put strike price as your long position cost. If the stock gapped down over night to $8, your limit order would convert to a market order at prevailing prices. So your cost would be somewhere around $8. Your puts would be at $10. So that's q difference right there.

Now you might say how often do these gaps happen. Not that often, but they can happen - especially around earnings, M&a, ceo deaths, analyst downgrades, hf attack reports, or other major price moving news."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Because selling put has only 2 outcomes:  (1) you don't get the shares and (2) you get the shares at higher than the market price.  You make the call if the premium collected is worth it for you.

In general, CSP and CC under-perform a bull market especially when tax policy is taken into account.  CSP and CC are a solid part of a steady income strategy but they are not the best longer-term investment strategy."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I sell puts with the intention if you get assigned the shares you are now in a position to sell covered calls going the other way. The risks affiliated are limiting your upside gains if you see a big breakout on the cc or a big drop on the put. I had one put sale work out perfectly last week:

Got interested in stock AAB at $4.50 with an earnings call early March. The week after I realized I wanted to own the stock, it dropped to $3.00. So if I had bought 100 shares, I’m already -$150. I sell a put at $3.00 strike expiry 3-16 for $55 premium. I am fine owning the stock at $3.00, so if I get assigned I have the $300 ready to buy.

Over the next month, the stock trades sideways-ish from a low of $2.75 to a high of about $3.50, finishing around $3.25 on 3-16. I was not assigned the shares, but I keep the $55 premium. Unless I perfectly timed the dip, the $55 premium is more than I would have made holding the 100 shares for the same timeframe. If I want to do it again for 4-16, I just wait until the share price is close to $3.00 again to maximize premium.

I also like selling puts because it slows down my emotional buying. Just make sure you’re happy owning 100 shares of whatever stock at the strike of the put. Another strategy is to use the premium from sold puts to buy shares in the same stock, that way if it does breakout, you’ve got some exposure to that movement as well."
03/21/2021,stocks,"There are a lot of hypothetical answers given here, but I have to say I like selling naked puts on a stock that I am ok being assigned. As an example, I have been selling ITM puts and at the money puts on AT&T since August of 2020. It took a long time for me to get assigned because I kept letting them expire if the price was above strike, and rolling them forward if I was at risk of being assigned. Eventually I got assigned and then started selling covered calls on the lot I had, while still selling naked puts ITM, or close but OTM. At the end of February the covered calls executed, and I just kept rolling the naked puts. After the long story... I lost $550 on the stock after roughly 7 months, but made over $11K on the constant selling of naked puts and some covered calls. The tax man can take his cut on that, but this stock has been so boring over the last year, there is no way I could have done that just buying it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You risk missing the dip. Your limit order exercises any time. Your put exercises on friday at close, essentially. Stock dips on Wednesday and recovers? You have shares with a limit order. You have just premium with a put."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s possible that the stock drops to below the strike price, then goes back up before the expiration date and the option expires worthless. In this case, you would have kept the premium from the put as profit, but you never bought the shares. It’s possible that if you had bought the shares at that price, you would have made more money."
03/21/2021,stocks,You have to have the cash on hand to cover if you get assigned just happened to me with NIO paid 50 a share when it dipped to 32 at one point and is at 43.  Kinda sucks but sold a CC on it to try and make some back as it recovers.
03/21/2021,stocks,"this is the first part of the wheel. you take those 100 shares and sell a covered call. the risk is limited upside.

03/21/2021,stocks,"There may not be enough interest for your put to be bought.  Aside from that, you're describing exactly how puts should work, the only issue is that if you're selling, someone has to be buying."
03/21/2021,stocks,"F is trading at $11 and you want it at $10… so you write a put and collect premium. Option expires at the end of the week.

The next day Ford announces that they are changing their business model completely and will stop making cars to focus on retail VHS rentals.

Do you still want F at $10? Probably not."
03/21/2021,stocks,The better thing to do would be to BUY a put with a $10 strike so that if it drops to $7 you will make money and then can pick up the shares after.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think the other downside is you lock in the put strike price as your long position cost.

03/21/2021,stocks,I do that with every stocker I’m about to buy
03/21/2021,stocks,This is actually Warren Buffets favorite strategy for buying stock. Selling premium is a great way to reduce your cost basis if you plan on buying 100 shares of the stock.
03/21/2021,stocks,"The biggest downside between a limit order and a put is that you’re immediately on the hook to buy once you sell to open your put whereas you have no risk with a limit order unless the price hits your limit and you can always cancel your order or change the limit based on new information, where as your put destiny is immediately out of your hands once it’s sold unless you’re willing to buy it back."
03/21/2021,stocks,Absolutely nothing!! I did it for a long time and called it “getting paid waiting for an order to fill” very good strategy but not risk free
03/21/2021,stocks,"Cash-covered puts are a good strategy for buying a stock that you might want to own.

However, this is best in a stable or bullish market, as you want the stock price to remain at current level or even up slightly.

If the stock goes down substantially, below your strike and premium, then you may be forced into buying at a higher price than you might have otherwise.

Thus: choose stocks for cash covered puts that are generally stable, or on the rise, rather than volatile."
03/21/2021,stocks,No downside since you decided to buy at that price anyway but you will lose out on the upside.
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you didn't buy the put and Ford fell to $5, you could just buy it at bargain price of $5. 

If you had the put, you carry out your promise to buy exactly at $10. So the risk is that there's a very large downside movement that forces you to buy at a higher price than you could have. 

If you don't use margin, it also takes up capital equal to 100*strike price. So you need to leave that much in cash doing nothing. If you do have margin this isn't too much of an issue unless you get margin called."
03/21/2021,stocks,">Two, if the stock moves up significantly, you missed out on the gain, which could be more than your option premium.

03/21/2021,stocks,">Selling in the money puts is different and and good way to reduce your cost basis when entering a position. 

How is this true? You still get taxed on the premium. So whatever you save by raising you cost basis, you'll lose from the premium."
03/21/2021,stocks,This is my favorite one
03/21/2021,stocks,I don’t really follow this analogy — wouldn’t you have the same downside risk had you put a buy limit order on the books?
03/21/2021,stocks,"But if OP wanted a Ferrari in the first place, he would pay 750K for that.. The real opportunity cost if the stock takes off without you, and you only get a premium for the put."

03/21/2021,stocks,"What does it mean to sell in-the-money puts? What that sounds like to me is selling puts for $10 when the stock is already at $8 but the premium is $2/share to make up the difference, if that's the case, what's the benefit to doing that over just buying the stock outright?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"“If you really want to get the shares...” this seems like a risk that a lot of people on here are highlighting but I’m failing to see how it’s a risk.

I sell 10 3/26 13P for .43 If price stays under $13, I buy for $13, but cost basis is $12.57. Will I get taxed at short term rates for the options premium? Yes.  But that will be roughly $.14 on a $.43 trade. Even after tax considerations, you are looking at a cost basis of about $12.71. Yeah, maybe I could time it and do a little better, but if F pops this week, above my desired $13 entry, then at least I get the premium. 

Depending on how you look at it, I got a 2% weekly return on my money or I got a little bit of downside protection if the stock moves short term. Plus, I have $430 in my pocket now to do something else with."
03/21/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not quite.  It’s a similar risk, but a buy order costs you nothing. To buy a put back on a falling stock will cost some money- either in lost profit or in realized loss. Plus, a limit order is only in effect for the time you leave it up, a put has an expiration date- not better or worse either way, but when you’re considering the liklihood of a catastrophic drop, it’s better to be flexible than stuck to a date."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I mean yes but a buy limit order that is placed for the length of the contract that can’t be cancelled.

In the same logic I would never advise someone take $10,000 and place a limit buy order to just forget about for say 2 months"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I completely agree on the stock taking off in fact I was coming back to add that there should be more than “it’s a nice number” going into said puts strike price or the target buy in number. For example if it’s at $11 and you want it at $10 because you really believe it’s worth $20 why not just buy at $11 ?  

But I think in most cases the reason people look at plays like this is they CAN’T pay the full 750k so to speak. Not always that someone can’t afford it but simply that price might not fit their criteria for entering the trade. 

For example a Ferrari at a 0% discount couldn’t possibly meet my criteria to purchase a Ferrari if it ever drops 1% from MSRP. It’s not that I can’t spend the extra % it’s that my purchase was set based on a factor so without the factor my purchase simply won’t happen.


The danger with these types of plays is that your essentially saying “I think it’s worth more so I want it to go down in value so that it can go up” 

I know stocks move up and down as the build but still there’s no telling what factor will give you the false positive to say it’s go time.

Like with the Ferrari I want it because it’s a dope car but if the only factor I’m validating my purchase against is MSRP I could get majorly fucked by a external factors like for example Ferrari 100xing its production making my care worth less"
03/21/2021,stocks,Yea but the assumption from OPs statement is that he’s not willing to buy at 750k so making a stop loss plan against the total number doesn’t help if you spent all available funds with a CSP and now can’t afford to back out when the price tanks and you sit their waiting to be assigned a stock worth 1/10th what you paid for it. I’m just saying if you’re looking for stocks at a discount and think getting involved with options in the answer you’re likely going to fuck yourself. If you want a stock at a discount watch the charts / set price alerts / be ready with liquid
03/21/2021,stocks,"Because options always have extrinsic values so you are always better off to sell options instead of buying the shares.
So using your example, assume $F is currently $8 per share, if you sell $10 puts, you may receive $2.05 in premiums.

Edit: I just check the option chain for $F. The share price closed at $12.83, assuming you don’t mind buying at $12.83, you can sell a ITM $16P expiring on March 26, the premiums are $3.25. So your cost basis is actually 16 - 3.25 = 12.75 lower than 12.83"

Then it drop to 50K.

Limit order cost: 700K

Sold put (on 500k): little less than 450K

So he saved 250k (lost 250k less). Point is if stock dropped buying now or selling put doesnt matter, since they are both bullish strategies... Opportunity cost is if the stock takes off without u, with limit order u reap the reward, with sold put u only keep the premium. But basic math seems to be lost on this sub, i ll delete the comment."

In all reality this COULD work out but for example he could collect $500 in premiums over the course of a month and then the stock drops to $9 he gets assigned and he could actually saved another $500 just buying at market. So like with everything it’s a gamble"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Woah, you need to go back to school: covered calls are *not* bullish. The ideal situation is that the stock actually doesn’t move up at all.

For a covered call to have maximum value, you want the underlying stock price to stay at or below its strike price. You definitely do not want it to go up beyond the premium!

Why? Because if it rises sharply, the option gets executed, you lose the stock and the potential profit.

Using OP’s Ford as an example:

If you have 100 shares of F (which closed at 12.83) and sell a covered call for $13 for expiration this upcoming Friday, the current premium is .26 — which means that you will get $26, so long as Ford’s price stays below 13.01 through Friday, and won’t lose the stock.

But what if Ford rises to $14? You lose $74 in profit as you are forced to sell the stock.

See why a covered call is not bullish?

Conversely, F goes down to $12: you keep the stock, plus the premium of $26, reducing your paper profit loss.

That’s what makes it a short hedge strategy."

Oh hey look, max profit requires you ei collect the strike price. Imagine that. Shocker. Do you hate max profit?

You said:
>They are not equivalent.

That's incorrect. They are [equivalent](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/optioninvestor/09/equivalent-positions.asp). That's in every textbook, every [website](https://www.forbes.com/sites/baldwin/2012/07/18/options-explained-why-is-a-covered-call-equivalent-to-a-short-put/). It's 101. It's literally put call parity. But you don't know what that is. That's why you don't know you're wrong but we all do.

Are you ever going to acknowledge you are wrong about this? A short put is a covered call?

You also said: 
>covered calls are for stocks going down (short).

Which is incorrect, as your link says and shows. The p&l graph goes up and to the right, of course, showing max profit at and beyond the strike. Stock goes up, profit. Stock goes down, loss. Yet here in your very quote, you say it's for stocks going down. I guess you want to lose money?

Just say ""oops, I screwed up."" It's easy."

03/21/2021,stocks,">Im not arguing with a guy that 1, doesn't understand put-call parity, 2, thinks losing money from a stock dip is a good thing and making money from a rise is a bad thing. Good day.

You're not ""arguing"" because you have a misunderstanding of market dynamics, much less options.

It is better to be in covered call on a long term underlying position when a stock price moderately dips, then when it rises beyond the strike price. You retain the stock, gain the premium and have the ability to dollar cost average down. 

If it swings wildly either way, however, it is better to be in no CC position at all.

For example, my own recent real-world mistake with a CC: In January, wrote two $20 calls on Canon ($CAJ), when it was ~$18, for a Feb 19 expiration. I expected it was growing slowly and wouldn't hit that target. Instead, it went to $22.30 and the options executed. 

With a premium of .55, those covered calls alone ended up costing me $350 in potential profits. CAJ hasn't dropped enough to allow me to rebuy in profitably; currently holding right at $22.

This is why CCs aren't bullish, no matter that there is a modicum of ""profit"" involved. They are a short hedge (literally are called a ""*short call*"") -- and risky in stocks that go up more than anticipated.

If one is bullish on a stock, and expect it to go up, a cash covered  put is the better play. Which was how I slightly ""fixed"" my Canon position, when it rose faster than expected: by creating a short straddle, at near the strike price. I gained the premium for the short put, to offset the short call ""loss."""
03/21/2021,stocks,">No, sorry, you have no idea what you're talking about, which is why you didn't post the actual part of the article proving you're wrong.

Of course I didn't repost the entire article, that would be copyright infringement; I exercepted the part for commentary that supported what I had already said: that writing calls is *not* a ""bullish"" position -- contrary to your erroneous claim.

Let's re-read the part you quote, since you seem to be missing the important part:
>The maximum profit of a covered call is equivalent to the strike price of the short call option, less the purchase price of the underlying stock, plus the premium received.

That maximum profit is **only** reached when the underlying price of the stock is at exactly the strike price -- when it moves above the strike, guess what? Lost profit. That's not what you want.

>They are equivalent.

You seemingly misunderstand (or misconstrue) the meaning of the term. As stated in the link you helpfully point to,
>For clarification, ""equivalent"" refers to the fact that the positions will earn/lose the same amount at any price (when expiration arrives) for the underlying stock. **It does not mean the positions are identical.**

You see, the ""equivalence"" part works if you purchase the underlying stock at the same time as writing a covered call (a *buy-write* position) -- but that rarely happens. Usually, one is writing a covered call on a stock one has purchased at a *different* time, and thus with a different profit potential. That's not the same as a short put, in which one has selected a specific price point for a potential entry.

Thus the claim ""A short put is a covered call"" is wrong. You might correct it by saying: ""A short put is a covered call, when one does a buy-write at the same time.""

> ""covered calls are for stocks going down (short).""

Returning to Investopedia: ""[When Should I Sell A Put Option Vs A Call Option?](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/sellingoptions.asp)"":

>An investor would choose to sell a naked call option if their **outlook on a specific asset was that it was going to fall**, as opposed to the bullish outlook of a call buyer.

A naked call, of course (for those following along at home) is the riskier version of a covered call.

You literally can't read a pl graph. You literally gave an example of you losing money and prefering that.

>It is better to be in covered call on a long term underlying position when a stock price moderately dips, then when it rises beyond the strike price. 

No. It's not. That's worse. You have less money. Most people like having more money. You'd have less. That's bad. Get that through your head. Losing money is bad.

>If it swings wildly either way, however, it is better to be in no CC position at all.

Which isn't the topic. The topic is how wrong you are to say a CC is bearish.

>For example, my own recent real-world mistake with a CC: In January, wrote two $20 calls on Canon ($CAJ), when it was ~$18, for a Feb 19 expiration. I expected it was growing slowly and wouldn't hit that target. Instead, it went to $22.30 and the options executed.

 >and risky in stocks that go up more than anticipated.

Yeah, the risk is I sell my shares for maximum profit. No wonder you don't like it. 

>They are a short hedge (literally are called a ""*short call*"")

A covered call is not the same thing as a short call. Those are two different things. No wonder you dont get this basic fact. You don't even know what a covered call is. You think it's a naked call. Jesus Christ.

03/21/2021,stocks,">A covered call is not the same thing as a short call.

Wow, you must be a true WSBtard: while some sites conflate the two, a short call isn't equivalent to a naked call. A short call is the act of selling (or writing) a call, and can take the flavor of either a naked call (aka ""unhedged short call"")... *or* (drumroll please) a covered calls. Yes, amazing that: they are both short calls!

>Oh no! You made $200 plus premium! That must've been hard!

Uh, yeah, because I didn't want to sell at that price. Duh. You do understand opportunity costs? Had I not held the covered calls, I would be up significantly more. And now that I've been force sold out of my position, I can't buy back in at or below the strike+premium.

>Please everyone, for your own sanity and bank account, ignore this guy. He doesn't have a clue about the words he's using and can't do basic math.

Personally I see Apple and Amazon with the highest upside at the moment. Microsoft and google coming close. 

For me, Apple having a 2t market cap where half their revenue is from a single product (iPhone) means they have a lot of potential to increase revenue from other streams. For years people have been saying people will stop buying iPhones and apple continuously proves them wrong. I believe they will substantially increase their revenues in 2021/2022 with their new Mac chips. They have a very loyal customer base and it’s very tempting to buy another apple product once you’ve become accustomed to one of them. Product line up is still relatively small so plenty of room to grow there too. IMO we could see 3t market cap easily this year assuming no catastrophic macro economic events. 

Amazon and Microsoft arguably have a better business model than apple. Plenty of revenue streams and margins are great.

Microsoft. They have an enormous moat. Their current price is reasonable. Azure is well positioned for growth.

Sony. because it's still one of the most undervalued large cap stocks out there. If you're looking for value this one should grab your attention. They have very diviersified revenue streams and a great management team. It's kind of like buying a micro ETF.

Dell. Market leader in multi-cloud solutions. So they also have a big moat. Good value stock & great management. Like with Sony, until recently the market was significantly undervaluing them imho (has been somewhat corrected in the past 2 months).

Not a fan of Netflix and Amazon at all **at their current prices**. For Amazon first of all their stock is very expensive right now (as in high P/E, P/FCF and EV/EBITDA). Their business prospects have to extremely good to be worth it imho which is just not the case: competition is extremely heated in ecommerce and they're failing to get marketshare everywhere outside the USA. They're very dependent on the saturated US market. That said, I like their other business ventures though (notably AWS, Audible, Twitch \[getting Twitch for $1B was such a huge bargain for them\]), though their attempt at video game development & publishing has been a big failure so far. Netflix also very expensive right now and the competition is heating up.

03/21/2021,stocks,"It's easy to say who the current leader is.

But today's leaders are not tomorrow's leaders.

Can you, or anyone else, be 100 or even 95% certain that Intel won't make a comeback or that another company won't become a major player?

The weakness I see in TSM is that their business is entirely arms-race based which means business can be easily taken away if they lose their lead.

Whereas the FANG companies are entrenched.

Make a better spreadsheet program? Doesn't matter people aren't going to learn it, they will still use Excel.

A phone with amazing hardware capabilities? Doesn't matter, it's not as cool as iPhone, doesn't have iOS.

A search engine or user-content video site? Doesn't matter, as long as youtube and google does it's job, no one is switching.

Whereas for TSM, they don't have a product that people stick to. It's contingent on them being the best manufacturer.

That's why for semiconductor companies, I don't think betting on one company is a good idea. The semiconductor industry is promising overall. Instead of betting on one player, I invest in both all the major players to remove the risk of one company falling  behind (like Intel today, or last decade AMD) while benefitting from semiconductor growth

SMH (semiconductor ETF) did 127% in the past year and SOXL (3x leverage semi ETF) did 645%"

03/21/2021,stocks,I know you are just joking but game pass is actually a really big deal for their sales in the gaming industry. There are so many great games you can play for free for only $5 more per month than a standard xbox live membership (which includes EA play and getting discounts on EA games and early access) and I think if more people catch on to this it could sway people to buy an xbox over a playstation. (I think both consoles are great please do not start a pointless console war argument).

03/21/2021,stocks,"Why $QCOM is the best: 

-	consistently green (great price action) 

-	low P/E and very undervalued right now (read: not as susceptible to yield-related pullbacks and attractive to “value investors” as well as “growth investors”) 

-	a super bright outlook for the remainder of 2021 and beyond (ton of 5G patents, sky is the limit)

-	plenty of room to run on the technicals (no resistance for a while and all signs point to more bull more often coming up)

-	trading for a discount due to a temporary chip shortage along with the other semis but best poised for recovery for the reasons stated above ($170 by EOY, easy)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’ve been holding and watching daily for a few weeks (for what that’s worth) and I haven’t spotted any resistance in price action so far (just regular ebb and flow in an exceptionally volatile semis space right now). I’m not a chart guy, so you would need confirm that if you are a chart person, but i’ve been very happy with it’s price movements and recovery resiliency during this weird time for tech and semis. I would be less comfortable holding NXPI, for example, once it’s index addition stabilizes out and the insane P/E becomes more of a factor with the ongoing yield increases. 

Full disclosure - I’m long shares of TSM, long shares and options for QCOM, long options with NVDA, and have bear puts on NXPI right now. So, needless to say, I’ve been watching them all pretty closely."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Still feel highly confident in TSM being an industry leader for at least a decade. Semiconductor manufacturing is prohibitively expensive industry for others to enter, and as technology improves, it keeps rising in cost. This is why in the 90s, it started becoming a standard for companies to outsource production to focus on design. Intel is losing market share because of difficulties with producing smaller chips, and they’re going to outsource more production in the coming years. They’re limping and they know it; they’ll mend, but the only edge I think they would have is that they’re there if everyone else stumbles. 

If you don’t want to put all your eggs in one basket, that’s understandable. The only other guy who stands next to TSM is Samsung."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'd argue that the very reason you brought up why TSM is risky, is in fact the reason why TSM is great. Semis are all about yields and performance. Intel can't just pull a comeback out of their hat, there's a reason why they're falling behind. It's getting significantly more expensive to manufacture cutting edge nodes.

There's no way Intel can invest in R&D for cpu design, gpu design, manufacturing, and all while upgrading their manufacturing equipment, all at once. TSM and Samsung are spending deep into the billions on manufacturing alone.

TSM has been prided on its yield consistency because they do incremental upgrades, they haven't missed the mark in a long time, this is why Apple goes to them. 

I agree with your derisking approach, just pointing out that context is important. Intel vs AMD is completely different from Intel vs TSM. TSM and Samsung are leagues beyond everyone else."
03/21/2021,stocks,yeah this does concern me deeply. China wants Taiwan all for themselves badly. Luckily TSM is starting to build plants outside Taiwan (Arizona for example.)
03/21/2021,stocks,"They’re opening a massive factory in Arizona, expected to be high volume by 2024. Additionally China needs them just as much as USA does for chip supply.

Most of the times no matter what you search the cheapest product end up having the best reviews. This is not Amazon's fault in my opinion because good reviews are biased towards cheaper products. More people review cheap products, they are more likely to give 5 stars because they paid so little. Meanwhile, expensive choices tend to be scrutinized more (rightfully) and also bought less. So as a result you get 5$ product with 6000+ reviews with 5 star rating whereas the 25$ version has 100 reviews and is sitting at 4.2 rating"

Nowadays if you search ""backpacking tent"" the first results you see dirt cheap, poorly made stuff with terrible knock-off names like ""Hyke'nTrail"" or something. Like I'm not opposed to them carrying the cheap stuff, but show the reliable brands first, that's what used to set them apart from Wish or Aliexpress"

I’m surprised to not hear about more people starting a position at this price"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Chargepoint market cap is £6bn.
blnk market cap is £1.5bn.
Price is irrelevant. Based on market cap, chargepoint is already worth 4x as much as blnk."
03/21/2021,stocks,Why must they be undervalued?
03/21/2021,stocks,No
03/21/2021,stocks,"Last fall, when Chargepoint sought to go public via reverse merger, [they were after a SPAC that would buy them at a valuation of $2.4 billion](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/ev-charging-stalwart-chargepoint-seeks-2.4b-valuation-in-reverse-merger). In the basics of sales, when the owner is shopping a product out to potential buyers, you know s/he is asking for top dollar and working from there.

After dropping in value by more than 50% from its ATH around Christmas, the company is still valued nearly three times higher than the original asking price, without any material changes to its performance outlook.

Still largely overvalued.

EDIT - I've been long in this company for a while with a speculative position. I may have just talked myself out of it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"$6B market cap for a company doing ~50M a quarter in revenue is pretty rich. I'm really bullish for CHPT but not looking for entry until we find a floor. SPAC team valued at ~2.4-2.9B and what's changed since then? Nothing material. SPACs in the 30-90 days following merger often see a lot of sell-offs from the PIPE investors, so there easily could be some more selling ahead, finally, look at the chart on finviz and we can clearly see a downward channel that this thing is moving through, ~$19.90 to me looks like a pretty important baseline if CHPT can bounce and hold low 20s I will buy in, if not I would imagine we could see low teens again, at which point I would say I would agree with you in saying that it is substantially undervalued. Today? somewhere around fair valuation / a bit overvalued. EV hype has been mellowing down a bit and coming back to earth."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I can't speak much on the fundamentals, but I own an EV and have  Blink charger at home. I hate it. It's a piece of shit.

Also, all of the chargers I use around town are Chargepoint. I plan on buying some shares, but I'll wait for it to drop some more. Long-term, I think this company will do well. Their products beat the pants off of Blink's."
03/21/2021,stocks,These are basics !!
03/21/2021,stocks,"I meant to put this as well.

Edit: but overall this just adds to my point."
03/21/2021,stocks,They already own the largest part of this market. Based on projected revenue they will be far ahead of BLNK. BLNK continues to trend up as CHPT trends down
03/21/2021,stocks,Care to elaborate?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t the drop in valuation due to underwhelming sales. Which was due to a pandemic going on much longer than the original valuation projected?  I’m not saying it’s going to shoot up overnight but their footprint is 76% of the industry. You need to account for the increase in EV buying. It’s set to be 30% of vehicle sales in 8 years. This is where these valuations come from. 

CHPT is a minimum of 10x the size of blink, just based on revenue, charging footprint etc. blink market cap is 1.65B, Chargepoint is 6.72B.  Blink is clearly the overvalued one. Not to say CHPT may drop to 20 or 21 (at which point I’ll double my position because my current average is 25 per share).  But to not think they have the potential to double that share price in the near future I honestly do. It understand.

Edit: typo"
03/21/2021,stocks,"So then what do you make of blink, with a market cap of 1.6B doing 4m a quarter? Surely they must be vastly overpriced right now. Not to mention the have 10% of the footprint chargepoint has. 

EV hype in these other companies has not mellowed down much at all. Only in chargepoint. I don’t see how chargepoint is not a solid buy right now.  It’s possible it goes down a bit more but will ultimately hit 40 in the near future. I’ll check back in when that happens."
03/21/2021,stocks,Yea they clearly have a better product and better tech. I agree it’s a buy and hold stock but I don’t think it will be this low for long.
03/21/2021,stocks,How does it add to your point? It literally means that charge point is bigger and contributes nothing to your point that it's undervalued
03/21/2021,stocks,Whatever confirms your biases
03/21/2021,stocks,"> Surely they must be vastly overpriced right now.

pretty overpriced, yeah. they did less than $1M in rev in Q3 2020 and rose ~3000% when they topped in Feb. they're on their way back to earth and still should be headed down a bit unless something else fundamentally changes their business. Obviously I like CHPT way more than BLNK for a number of reasons.

> EV hype in these other companies has not mellowed down much at all. Only in chargepoint.

This just simply isn't true, see WKHS, Lucid (CC1V), XPEV, NIO, XL just to name a few, all emerging EV plays that have dropped from Feb highs. It's a long play, if you like CHPT long term than just buy and DCA or buy and forget about it. It's a good long hold I just believe there's a few more bucks to milk out of it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Chargepoint, being the much bigger company stands to own a much larger part of this market. Based on the recent weeks it seems like blink  and other companies are being pumped up while chargepoint continues to drop."
03/21/2021,stocks,Makes sense. Thanks for the advice
03/21/2021,stocks,Okay so the larger mkt cap means it should have more market share which means larger market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap which means more market share which means more market cap
03/21/2021,stocks,Explanation on the severe drop to 24 then? The point is it’s a company that’s in the best position for fast growth.  Why is the market not reflecting CHPT clearly being the better buy?
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm just pointing out that using market cap to justify a higher share price in the future is circular logic. You haven't provided any evidence that it's in the best position for fast growth. 

And maybe the market is reflecting that it's not ""clearly"" the better buy. It still could be and if you believe it is in the best position then it's discounted share price is good for you."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm not using the market cap to explain a higher share price in the future.  Im explaining why chargepoint seems set up to dominate this industry.  This is according to their own investor presentation, projected earnings, business model and analysts of the industry.  Also their app and the tech they are implementing is far superior.  The simple question is: Why is Blink continuing to climb and chargepoint drop?  I merely pointed out that a large market cap adds to my point that its the bigger company, not my point that its undervalued.  I am making that point separately.  It takes only a little DD to see this.  BLNK objectively should not be trading this high based on facts of this industry.  It is inevitable chargepoint becomes the more valuable stock in my opinion."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You haven't explained shit. Watch this I'll ""explain"" how charge point is going bankrupt.

Charge point's price has been falling while the entire sector has been going up. Charge point is going bankrupt just do your own research. It's obvious."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Your a hostile dude, I’m not saying you need to start a position just tell me where I’m wrong here...

Chargepoint is 10x the size of BLINK, minimum 

Chargepoint footprint is 76% of the industry 

Blink market cap is 1.6B trading at 37.75

Chargepoint market cap is 6.8B trading at 23.60

Either blink is severely over valued or CHPT is severely undervalued

03/21/2021,stocks,"The general consensus for the absurd height limits of the share price during the short squeeze boils down to two mechanics: Margin calling shorts and supply. Over the past 3 months there have been numerous predictions of GME %float shorted ranging from 40% to well over 900% due to Naked Shorting and illegal options activity. If somehow the hedgefunds Citadel, Melvin, Blackrock, etc managed to illegally short GME past 100%, they literally have to buy back *all* of the shares *multiple* times. Retail investors such as the millions on r/WallStreetBets and r/GME can be speculated to hold anywhere from 1M to 20M of the available float, with brokers like Fidelity owning large portions of shares. The plan since December is buy and hold, no matter the share price, to both spike the price and pressure the shorts to cover way out of the money, or to margin call them so they are forced to do so. Holding the supply with over 100% demand will cause the share price to skyrocket to *unfathomable* levels, and thinking a certain price is unreachable due to factors like GME's market cap being sent past even some first world countries isn't logical. GME's share price currently does not represent the company, but rather the supply/demand as well as all the blatant manipulation going on between whales. 

Also, the DTCC and overall insurers of the stock market are well worth 40-60 *trillion* dollars. If GME were to squeeze and retail holds, they sure can cash out at anywhere from 100k to *2 million dollars* per share. Of course, there is no way every share will be sold for that price, and [this](https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9td6w/estimations_for_the_total_payout_of_gme_based_on/) post is somewhat accurate, but the price itself  can get there based on the crude dynamics of this situation. 

This writeup is very basic, and there are many aspects to what is going on. A huge PDF rundown and DD of the situation was presented recently, being a matter of discussion in [this](https://iamnotafinancialadvisor.com/discord/DD/GMEv10.pdf) post. I recommend everybody read it prior to buying into the lottery ticket that is GME."
03/21/2021,stocks,Check out /r/investing and /r/eurostock on a investing using wsb terms will get you kicked off the standards are much higher fair warning.
03/21/2021,stocks,Agreed. Much smarter seasoned investors here. Just a bunch of lunatics in wsb.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not financial advice, I am a moron.

I concur.

Everyone in the stock market are out to make a buck or 10 Billion.  lets get that out in the open.

So this mentality, (and some actually believe it) that gme can hit $100k a share, I think was put out there as 1) a simulation best case scenario of possibilities and 2) maybe some promote it so others will hold their position long enough to be also holding the bag while others exit for maximum profit.

I think the squeeze already happened, or tried to.  When it hit $340, a previously thought plan was executed with great effectiveness stopping it from taking off.  Lets be real here, wall street and Chicago aren't going to let gme take off a second time, they strategize.

Also, it isn't legal to conspire.  But the pack mentality doesn't work after the peak has been reached, and everyone starts to sell their position to profit.   Does it make it profitable to be a diamond handed trader holding the bag?

If someone on reddit says HOLD!  they forgot to add: the bag. 

Just play the stock and the market as you see fit.  It's your money. That gme is super volatile its a bloody casino - throw in tweets from influential people that spike the price from time to time, and its anyone gambit.  Day trade if you want to, ride it up and sell, maybe miss, maybe hit. do whatever you want.  sell your position, or dont enter at all if that suits your fancy.

Personally?  If the mass sell at $340 (it was market manipulation of this stock, but nothing will come of it, lets be real here) did not occur, I thought the best gme was going to achieve was $500 maybe $600 a share.  Shenanigans would then ensue, and every dirty trick possible to drive the price back down would occur.  $1000?  I would expect the SEC or someone to step in to freeze it.  If hedge funds and the like started bankrupting?  Id expect a legal investigation, law suits, etc into reddit users and so on."

03/21/2021,stocks,$15 is laughable. Maybe if they were to just continue selling used games at retail locations. Which they are not. So much opportunity. IMO $200 is not a risky bet for the company regardless of the short squeeze.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Remaining hype and Cohen's changes might justify a price around 45-55 for a while.

Add the hype that GME might moon a third time (it did a second time so why not?) and the price might settle at around 60ish."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Are you sure? Reality has to hit at some point. The same with TSLA and all the other crazy stocks out there. They can only defy gravity for so long. They have been impressive for sure. But when the CEO of GME says the stock is worth $16, you might want to listen. The same with TSLA. Musk said it was worth $400. Cathy can say 3k all she wants. I would listen to Elon Musk. 
BUT, if history has any lessons for GME, it will probably go up on earnings due to irrational enthusiasm from WSB."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The borrowers are the hedgefunds, and Melvin Capital was granted $3B from Citadel to cover ""liquidity issues"" back in January when GME first started to soar. They sure can try fucky stuff and they have been for the past 3 months. Robinhood and other brokers literally stopping people from buying in, trading low volume between each other to manipulate the price, buying out the media (seriously look at the censorship from CNBC regarding the hearing), etc. 

But the stock is still at $200/share. Retail and whales are still here, and bottom line is shorts must cover. Also yeah all that shit listed above is supposedly illegal, but when you're worth billions there's not much to that.

If you're wondering if the DTCC or the Feds will step in early or screw retail entirely again, take a stroll through r/GME's DD Compilation megathread and read up on the new DTCC rules being considered, as well as perspectives on how, if a squeeze happened, 40% of the profits will go right to the government in capital gains taxes for that year."

03/21/2021,stocks,I would get out while you are up then. I am pretty risk adverse though. If I was up 2% on any risky stock like that I would collect gains immediately stick them in something safe and put what was left on my next risky play. At least set a stoploss.
03/21/2021,stocks,Sell. Buy gme. Hold
03/21/2021,stocks,It’s a hugely risky bet. The company has to change drastically to justify being traded at 50x what it was last year. It’s not impossible but you are delusional if you ignore the scale of the task ahead of them and the likelihood that it could potentially fail.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I could see $60 for GME, seems like a reasonable target inflated by hype for a 3rd pump"
03/21/2021,stocks,"That's where the fun of over 100% shares shorted comes in 😉 

There will be a point where the supply literally cannot uphold the demand as the shorts have to rebuy the whole float over again. The shorting infinite risk principle actually became feasbile. I hate to be loud, but in my opinion the shorters are *fucked* and the government will have to step in at some point to either save this fragile and fraudulent stock market (which was referenced as a *literal house of cards* by a senator in last week's hearing) or actually enforce responsibility and liability by throwing out the trash for once in their life."
03/21/2021,stocks,Not everything is a conspiracy. I held 25 shares and sold them all last week. I was happy with my small profit.
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm probably going to stop loss it in case it tanks. Thanks.
03/21/2021,stocks,When was the last time you visited a gamestop store?
03/21/2021,stocks,"There is less than 15% of float shorted right now (according to S3 data). Many short positions are new at higher prices. 
In January this was a squeeze, right now this is a pump and dump."
03/21/2021,stocks,"But as the other guy said, the short% isn't that high anymore....."
03/21/2021,stocks,This is about you it’s about bot accounts giving out bad advice to fuck over everyone
03/21/2021,stocks,stop loss don't always work in pre/post market. It depends on your broker.
03/21/2021,stocks,"First off, Melvin Capital's shorting was first speculated around December of last year. They were banking hard on the price to drastically decrease from around $20 to $15 to $0 because they were sure this stock was overvalued. Since then, those original shorts have never been ITM. When the January run up happened, more and more shorts were thrown into the equation and the price kept going up. Covering these millions of short positions would have been suicide, and there's little evidence of them covering on the dip to $40 for a month either due to lower volume and of course no significant price rises. Citadel and Blackrock also most likely shared similar sentiment. 

The pdf in the start of [this](https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m6x3w5/synopsis_for_03172021_what_we_need_to_know_before/) post and similar reactions in r/GME dubbed down a large portion of reasoning behind short positions and their failure to cover, as well as how naked shorting and other shady techniques like using ETFs can hide the actual numbers. 

[This](https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m19oh7/true_short_interest_could_be_anywhere_from_250_to/ ) post highlights the absurd possibility of a 900% short interest. 

[This] (https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m9bfp0/naked_short_selling_the_truth_is_much_worse_than/)post goes into a little detail of naked shorting as well. 

Lastly, the most recent bit of some fun confirmation bias, [this fun post](https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/m8wvdo/todays_short_volume_on_gme_319_is_64_of_total/) highlighting just how massive the short volumes have been compared to other occasions.

2021-03-21 12:51:13,stocks,"What’s your opinion on selling long calls on SENS? I haven’t tried it yet and I have a relatively small position with 2000 shares. I bought when it was 1.5$ dollars, but I’m planning on holding for a few years. If anyone else here planning on or is already selling long calls what is the verdict on it. I know it because my mother uses their product so it grew on me and as they say buy what you know.

I’m planning on selling 1 1/20/23 option weekly or monthly."
03/21/2021,stocks,"i did, it's a 2 dollar per share premium. I'm in at 3.05, i rolled the premium into more shares turned 600 shares into 1300"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Selling covered leaps is a double edged sword. Because it’s expiration is so far out and the stock is particularly volatile atm, the premium is nice and juicy. Issue is that theta decay is going to take a while to kick in having such a far out expiration, so you won’t be able to buy to close at a decent price for a while (unless the stock sees a drop in volatility or stock price presumably). Good thing though is that you’re not forced to potentially pick less appealing strike prices to be exercised at if the stock price drops and you’re flipping short expiration covered calls.

Additionally, if an attractive price point rolls around and you need/want to close your position before the expiration date, you’ll have to buy to close that leap before selling the underlying no matter what the cost is or you’re stuck with a naked call.

IMO, if you want to ride out the volatility gain train sell covered calls 30-45 days out, buy to close when you’ve secured ~75% of the premium through the theta decay ramping up, rinse and repeat until you’re done. This’ll keep you closer to strong theta decay and give you greater flexibility rather than being locked in a covered leap (but remember that if the underlying drops in price, premiums will be lower in the higher strike price ranges forcing you to pick strike prices that are less appealing to be exercised at)."
03/21/2021,stocks,Not a bad option. Worst case you have to sell your shares if they are exercised and you miss some appreciation.
03/21/2021,stocks,It's been kind of volatile lately.  Aren't covered calls more indicated when a share price is stable?
03/21/2021,stocks,Probably a horrible idea
03/21/2021,stocks,What are the particulars of strike and date and premium?
03/21/2021,stocks,"You get more premium with higher volatility because options become more valuable... and hence more risky to the seller. But if you are invested in the stock anyway, risk should be minimal because you can just sell the underlying."
03/21/2021,stocks,Definitely ideal to sell CC’s during high IV. Make sure their OTM enough that if you get assigned you are happy with your profits.
03/21/2021,stocks,Suprisingly with rise in bond yields it’s had a pretty solid week and it even rallied 10% on Friday.
03/21/2021,stocks,5.5 call 1/20/23. 2 dollar premium
03/21/2021,stocks,"I suppose but it's basically following the trend of dipping when the 10 year spikes and retracing when the 10 year fades.  

Still, net-net it has gotten back to where it was a week or two ago, but with 10 yr higher.  

I think the diseases they aim to serve are recession proof."
03/21/2021,stocks,....2023?
03/21/2021,stocks,yeah
03/21/2021,stocks,Arent you now agreeing to sell your sens shares for 5.5 dollars? Like if sens is above 5.5 dollars by 2023 those calls gonna get exercised or no?
03/21/2021,stocks,"yes. i want to try buying them back after some theta decay, but if they get called away i still double my money in less than 2 years"
03/21/2021,stocks,Thats very true but theres also the chance SENS is like.. way way higher by 2023. It's not completely unrealistic for the share price to quadruple by 2023 imo.
03/21/2021,stocks,"i thought about that, but by going so far out, i was able to get enough premium to buy more shares. 1800 dollars bought 1200 shares @ 5.50 strike price"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Spot on. That’s why it’s usually more favorable to sell covered calls that expire 30-45 days out, a good combo of theta decay and premium. This takes more managing and it’ll take a few sells before you get an equivalent premium to the leap, but you can ride the volatility and stock price increase that may or may not generate higher premiums rather than being locked in for two years. 

All depends on your trading strategy tbh, you want flexibility and don’t mind actively managing your covered calls? Sell with a shorter expiration. Want to lock in a juicy premium and forget about it until it expires or is cheap enough to buy to close? Sell a covered leap."
03/21/2021,stocks,Are you selling calls weekly? I was thinking about doing that given my investment already doubled and I could get more out of it.
03/21/2021,stocks,no i think it's called leaps
03/21/2021,stocks,Oh sorry I meant are you selling those leaps to rake in cash every week.

03/21/2021,stocks,"I bought it as one of those stocks you buy and forget about. One day you will be up 5% and the next down 6%. 
I believe in SQ in the long run, but way to volatile for something short run."
03/21/2021,stocks,I was debating that as well but ending up just putting it into ARKF as square and PayPal are it’s top holdings. Not as volatile plus blockchain technology
03/21/2021,stocks,"I mean whats with paypal? Do you guys think SQ can be successfull in a market, where Paypal is a bigplayer? In Germany Paypal is very well used. Some opinion would be nice.."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I bought on Thursday after seeing it dropped almost 10%, I plan to add more if it drop close to $200."
03/21/2021,stocks,I saw a article about hacking some accounts.  You may want to check it out first.
03/21/2021,stocks,"You should invest in companies you believe in. The market is plenty big enough for both of them. As to value question, value is so subjective is not really possible to get a consensus (even analyst price targets vary wildly). They do own btc so btc will be a risk. In theory as more of their customers own the btc and less in squares name the risk decreases. Btc could also appreciate relative to devalued world currencies. In my opinion Square is a much larger market than PayPal. They will compete for online and p2p but Square is positioning itself to be a full virtual bank as well. So by that regard in theory they could be much bigger. However they will face regional political headwinds as both offering crypto (or any alternative to local currency) isn't welcomed in some places and being a foreign owned/operated bank can make them unwelcome in some places as well."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you guys don’t see Square buying Tidal as the largest bull flag ever, you need to learn to anticipate trends. Square just signaled to the music industry how serious they are about disrupting their revenue model.

Imagine a world, if you will, where content creators use their social media to promote and Tidal to distribute their product in a direct-to-consumer model cutting out the record companies through the use of NFTs and blockchain technologies. It will fundamentally change the music industry and they will write books about this one day.

Buy it and forget about it.

Positions: long Square and long blockchain."
03/21/2021,stocks,For what it’s worth I bought about tech stocks Friday. I remain skeptical of the CNBC storyline that the end is coming for tech. Everyone uses the example of amazon a proof one can be down for a number of years. Ok—what happened last year?
03/21/2021,stocks,"20% below YTD high - Yes, I would buy it right now. It's a post-pandemic/re-open stock."
03/21/2021,stocks,I bought 10 shares when if dropped down to 200.  I will buy more if there's a larger drop....would love to double up at 180....but not sure it will drop that far.
03/21/2021,stocks,"SQ is trading at a high multiple today but as a company they have much more room to grow. 

The stock does have risk with Bitcoin but won’t fundamentally crash company. Bad Bitcoin news and good Bitcoin news will affect stock in short term movements. 

I’ve used both Paypall and Cash App and Cash App is king. 

Instant transfers and deposits, brokerage and Bitcoin exchange. Paypall is older and has a better name recognition but it seems like they stopped innovating the product when the company was bought out by eBay."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Nobody knows a concrete answer to your question. It is just different shades of opinion in light of certain selective facts and numbers. Pick your own, form your thesis, invest on that.  Personally, I have Square for its crypto exposure and likely future positioning in this space."
03/21/2021,stocks,If you are looking to get in long I'd say square is a good buy.  I picked up several at 220 on Friday.  They've got some big idea for growth in the years to come.  Got approved to operate banks a while back so when the world picks itself up I see this one going big.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not a great idea from a risk management perspective.

High growth stocks don't have momentum because no one knows where yields / yield curve will end up. I don't think it's over.

There's a good chance high growth stocks will provide a bigger bargain opportunity some weeks or months later."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It's pretty overpriced right now and could correct back down alot overtime (25-50%). As others are pointing out it's largely a small business POS (Point of Sale) company which has expanded into other sectors (crypto, p2p etc). Look at pre-covid, square was negative EPS and only started turning a profit last year."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Just my opinion don’t own any 1) it’s insanely expensive maybe it can grow into it but it would take a ton of growth. Not much cushion there.

2) idk about crash but it will drop significantly when Bitcoin goes into a bear market

3) the problem compared to pypl is just how much sq is valued at compared to its competition  and there’s more on the way."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Personally, I just sold all my SQ. It's very overvalued with a 500+ P/E ratio, and I don't want to deal with the short-term volatility connected with bond yields, which still haven't settled yet and continue to go up.

I mean, all the tech growth companies just got a 30% correction because they're too expensive, and they're just going back up again. What's to keep it from just being corrected again if it reaches too high in the market's eyes? If there is another correction, I imagine it will be fast and harsh just like the last one.

All that being said, these stocks can be irrational, and, who knows, they might just continue to go up. I think investing in the tech growth stocks right now are high-risk/high-reward."
03/21/2021,stocks,RemindMe! 2 days
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm short on sq long on qs
03/21/2021,stocks,"Consider TSLA, they have alot in the pipeline. Own BTc, model s refresh, Cyber truck coming, tons of cash on hand, power pack sales in Texas and California, solar."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I can say I used square as a way to take payments [run credit cards] on my phone and I found it very convenient.  I also receive checks and PayPal, not every one has a PayPal account."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I've had square for a while. They have been a good buy for me. Since their recent acquisition of 19 companies, they have done well."
03/21/2021,stocks,Personally I'm not touching it until I see some competitive advantage because there are too many of these companies.
03/21/2021,stocks,They are still overvalued and have not yet hit bottom
03/21/2021,stocks,Can somebody tell me why a p/e of 511 doesn't mean insanely overvalued?
03/21/2021,stocks,Good for trading daily but dangerous. I can’t get behind it long term big banks are developing more cost effective and better technology plus they are not distracted with trying to build out a banking option because it already exists. I say BAC or MS. Square still very interesting as a trade if you can stomach the volatile movement which how you make that $$$$$ anyway. Success to you all!
03/21/2021,stocks,"Square has been a beast for the last several years. It probably got overvalued recently. Personally, if it gets to $200, I would probably buy back in."
03/21/2021,stocks,I been doing stocks for 2 months and it was my first stock I ever got but sold due to paper hands. (Learned my lesson)  Ark likes the stock so it must be a good one.
03/21/2021,stocks,SQ has nothing to do with Bitcoin. SQ is an awesome investment.
03/21/2021,stocks,"A lot of tech companies connected to gme have also been shorted, so idk. market corrections may also mess us tech companies up as well"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I would not be buying SQ at the current price. Way too overvalued and it has shown to be volatile. Honestly if you have 1000, you should buy an etf that tracks the SP500 or full market. Picking individual companies is fun to see if you can beat the market. But the success rate is stupid low. Most the people here would make more money in the long run if they just continually contributed to a market index. It’s not sexy but it works. I would wait till you had more money and use a small amount as “play money” to see if you can beat the market. Use that small percent to pick your speculative companies like SQ."
03/21/2021,stocks,Buy when it crashes
03/21/2021,stocks,"“...prophet huge grows” Wow, this might be a new low."
03/21/2021,stocks,It had a little correction but still at a 5 year high.  Ive used  it for years  nothing special about it  I also use other systems  and can replace it at anytime.   In my field Venmo and cashapp  are some of its bigger competitors .   When I think of bitcoin I think a great temporary investment  if you time it right.. but at some point you have to sell because it will do what it always does.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Just stay on top of recent news for things like this: 
https://finance.yahoo.com/news/squares-cash-app-vulnerable-to-hackers-customers-claim-113556593.html"
03/21/2021,stocks,I love volatile. That means It will go up and down fast. It just dipped and it will bounce back just as fast.  SQ has a huge upside.
03/21/2021,stocks,You can trade it short term though but yeah I agree
03/21/2021,stocks,"Same here. I believe in FinTech over the looong term and wanted to buy SQ and PYPL. Once I found ARKF, I was set. Bout in at $60 and feel fine even though it dropped immediately."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Same, ARKF is the one ARK I have the most faith going forward."
03/21/2021,stocks,Hmm that could also be interesting since I really believe in PayPal. But I think my european Smart Broker does not offer it anyways.
03/21/2021,stocks,IPAY is another good ETF option with SQ being its second largest holding.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm on the ARKF train too. Really strong companies overall that have huge marketing potential into the foreseeable future.

I'm also invested in ARKG too. Both are great and no TSLA exposure."
03/21/2021,stocks,YOOOOO. Thank you for this. Was debating on Square or PayPal. I can do both now haha.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Correct me if I'm wrong but Square and Paypal function quite differently. Square functions as a Point of Service/Sale (POS) for businesses and offers both software on the cloud as well as hardware for said businesses like card swipers, smart tills, and screens - physical check out terminals at shops. Many small businesses choose Square as their POS as it is scalable and easy to use. There are percentage as well as usage fees for credit card payments, none for cash - so long as your business stays under a certain amount of income. Paypal I believe is specifically a digital checkout terminal that is more readily utilized for digital/online check out - card or account transactions only, an always a fee. Venmo is the 'free' person-to-person version of PayPal but even now it's becoming restrictive and monetized as many people have embraced it as a payment platform for their small businesses and side hustles during the pandemic. I'm sure I'm missing something important that defines these services further. I'm also new to investing. I'm a small business owner and have been using Square since 2019. Square and Shopify were the first companies that caught my eye at the beginning of the year where I thought 'if I only had the foresight to invest in these at the start of the pandemic' - as someone who uses and understands the value of these companies and why they're hot. But they're burnin a little too hot and with very high P/Es. If the market tanks again I expect there's a lot more room for them to drop. I currently own four shares of Square with an avg of 237.16. Do I wish I got in at 20? Sure. Do I think it will go up 10x between now and next year? No, not at all. Still, time in the market is better than timing the market. If you have some $ to put in, I'd consider it as your entry point would still be lower than my average but maybe invest a little at a time and aim for dollar cost averaging over time. No idea what your budget and goals are. I know I am going to continue to use Square as I scale my business and believe they're worth investing in long term. And if I had more money, I'd be eyeing it for more shares. Not a financial advisor/not financial advice."
03/21/2021,stocks,Do you have a link?
03/21/2021,stocks,"From personal experience and that of many on /r/smallbusiness, Square seems like a great option until they inevitably screw you over. I’ll be actively dissuading anyone I know from using them after they allowed a customer to steal $550 from our business. Granted we’re going to court for it, but they still approved the removal of funds.

This won’t move the needle on their stock, but more an insight to how they’re perceived by their customers (and former customers)."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thank you, very interesting perspectives! Yeah I also believe they can both grow. Having 2 big companys in one field should not be a problem and the market for online money transfers is going to get bigger. I think even after corona many people will remember new things they discovered because of the lockdown situation and continue their usage since they have proven to be so practical."
03/21/2021,stocks,"But... Tidal isn’t a popular service...

I’m not sure why you interpret this as a positive acquisition. I’m more worried they’re floundering and trying to find some industry to make serious gains in.

I own SQ but have serious doubts about its longevity in a crowded, ever changing market."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Simply comparing it to its ATH is not good DD, imo. The market determined that was too high, and the stock got a 30% correction after hitting it."
03/21/2021,stocks,SQ went as low as 189 during the dip. I managed to get a few at 195 and waited to get some more at a lower price unfortunately that hasn’t happened.... Yet 😎
03/21/2021,stocks,This guy gets it.
03/21/2021,stocks,">SQ is trading at a high multiple today

With smaller profit margins, P/E starts to get distorted and lose its value as a metric in a hurry. Taking its annualized topline revenue from its most recent quarter against the current share price, SQ is trading at a very reasonable 8.1 P/S ratio."
03/21/2021,stocks,SHOP was expensive at $150-$200 per share a a while back and sitting with a stack of them at $1100+ now. Same with TTF when buying the dip last March at $175... sitting at $700+ now. “Expensive” is a relative term so caution to new investors on not buying something you believe will hit multiples after doing your DD just because the per share price is higher than $5 stocks you are hoping to get lucky on
03/21/2021,stocks,"Agreed. I'm not sure how much reward there is right now either if it plummets 10% every time the yield goes up 0.01%. Personally, I'm long on Square s a company, but the risk reward was worth it last year. It's currently overvalued and is prone to any corrections due to yields over the next few months at least."

03/21/2021,stocks,I too like lighting my money on fire
03/21/2021,stocks,I would not feel safe with tesla even if i see possibilities for them to go up. I feel like Musks style of leading and the sympathy for him as a person who can move stock prices by using twitter creates huges possibilities but also risks. I personally would not want to out my money into his companies although I am very interested in what they are doing.
03/21/2021,stocks,Literally 80% of their 2020 revenue came from Bitcoin/crypto. How does that equal nothing?
03/21/2021,stocks,Which tech stocks are connected to gme?
03/21/2021,stocks,Square owns cashapp...
03/21/2021,stocks,it can keep going down though. be careful out there kiddo
03/21/2021,stocks,"Oh, is that what volatile means?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Also, PayPal bought iZettle, which offers POS as Square."
03/21/2021,stocks,Most small business owners I know agree that Square is better for brick and mortar businesses and Paypal is better for online businesses.
03/21/2021,stocks,I just want to buy one share to be honest. I am a student and invested 1000 Euros in my depot which is a third of the money i got overall. I just got out of Novavax and am thinking about putting this money into a share of Square. I am dealing with a low budget but for me it is a lot of money.
03/21/2021,stocks,">I know I am going to continue to use Square as I scale my business

As a word of advice, as your business scales you can save significantly on processing fees by switching to interchange processing over fixed price like Square.

I hate First Data with a passion. However, when switching to Clover from Square we saved a significant percentage on our volume of processing that Square couldn't come close to matching. 

Anyone with high volume and low average dollar sales can save significantly by shopping around. The only complaint with switching is Square's backend reporting is the best."
03/21/2021,stocks,"This is true but the main reason Square is up so big this year (aside from tech bubble, if you believe in such things), is the fact that their consumer business is growing rapidly. Right now it is basically Venmo with some light stock and crypto trading functionality. They just announced they got a bank charge which will allow them to offer more services, but that also puts them into an incredibly crowded market. Their core business is doing fine but limited opportunity to increase margins and growth heavily tied to small brick and mortar shops (read: struggling during covid), so they are getting a very friendly P/S multiple on a combo of steady b2b revenue and consumer hype. 

TL; DR: definitely a good company to invest in but not until after whatever big correction comes this year. I’d buy back in personally around $120/$150 but not financial advice"
03/21/2021,stocks,"i didn't read it well. 

[https://finance.yahoo.com/news/squares-cash-app-vulnerable-to-hackers-customers-claim-113556593.html](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/squares-cash-app-vulnerable-to-hackers-customers-claim-113556593.html)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Why do you think they bought tidal?

To generate new streams of revenue. They also put jay-z on the board. All it takes is a Chance the Rapper or Taylor Swift to be exclusively Tidal and that’s a wrap.

If you don’t understand the implications and potential there, go ahead and sell. I’ll buy from you. Literally - I buy 1-2 shares of square a week and am building my position!"
03/21/2021,stocks,This guy gets it too. Price dips and other people run away from a great opportunity.
03/21/2021,stocks,"More times than not trading stocks with a pe in hundreds or thousands well end poorly. You SHOULD be extremely cautious. Are there exceptions sure, but there are countless examples of it not working out. Could Shopify continue to be a solid company for years to come and the shares actually lose value? Absolutely it’s possible and I have a small position in Shopify. I’m not saying not to invest but the risk/reward is not great as most here would leave you to believe. Particularly the risk aspect since the last few years have been 🔥."
03/21/2021,stocks,Isn’t that why were all here... or is it just me (oh and you apparently)
03/21/2021,stocks,"Explain?  Because as of February 28th, this holds true:

>Square’s gross profit on bitcoin trading rose 13 times in the fourth quarter, but it was still just 2% of its revenue from the cryptocurrency. Its bitcoin holdings are now worth about 5% of its $4.4 billion cash pile."
03/21/2021,stocks,That's a plus  . I was just naming the 3 that I use I have 10 other choices  I  haven't tried   I still wouldn't  buy the stock at its current price.  Its a great company though.
03/21/2021,stocks,I sold with some gains already. It's not at my target buy price anymore. But it's on my watchlist. I'd buy closer to $200
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well yeah, specifically:

>liable to change rapidly and unpredictably, especially for the worse.

But if you know what you are doing it is usually a rapid change for the upside."
03/21/2021,stocks,It is a lot of money to a lot of people don't feel bad.
03/21/2021,stocks,No fee brokers changed investing. You can be in a large number of stocks.
03/21/2021,stocks,Why did you get outta Novavax before they even got approved??
03/21/2021,stocks,"i appreciate your insight and definitely value the backend of square. i'll look into my options, thanks for the nudge"
03/21/2021,stocks,Hmm the article seems to be quite emotionally loaded but yeah it shows a comparison of PayPal and Square in terms of hacking and errors. I don't think that this weights in heavily though. If you look at the fast growth of Square i guess they must be overwhelmed by the fast growing number and so their customer support might not be sufficient yet.
03/21/2021,stocks,"yea i saw that article and didnt really kno what to make of it. i own SQ myself and have always compared it to Paypal, not knowing which one was a better investment. chose SQ because it seems more versatile and they just bought out jay z's company Tidal. but i also like venmo so was conflicted. went w SQ since its $20 cheaper and got it at a bargain. i stil pay attention to paypal here n there just to compare the prices"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Those numbers are their direct btc holdings. The main function of the Cash app atm, and the source of [80% of its 2020 revenue](https://www.investopedia.com/square-sq-reports-mixed-results-as-it-boosts-bitcoin-holdings-5114031), came through its service as a btc exchange.  I like SQ, but to say [they arent currently reliant on BTC is just false](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/03/17/1-thing-you-should-know-before-you-buy-square/)"
03/21/2021,stocks,What does sarcasm mean?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah for me it is a way to learn now. I am down about 10 percent because i bougt into BlackBerry at 14 dollars, sold lile 60 percent of my shares when it went up to 12 and diversified my money a bit more.

My goal is now to cross the 1000 Euros i have invested again before that happens i will not put more money in my portfolio or only invest into the msci world or emerging markets etf."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yea the article is very biased at looking only at SQ. You can find similar articles about Venmo, PayPal, etc. That’s not to let these companies off the hook, they need better defenses and better customer support and protection/guarantees. But it happens to all of them."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You don't think shitty customer seveice affects their bottom line?

SQ isn't the only one having these hacking issues. It's prevalent across multiple platforms and has gone up exponentially since covid and the lock downs across all major and minor platforms. People are waking up to money being drained from their accounts and not getting prompt service. That's going to be detrimental to SQ but again they aren't the only ones so it may be a wash overall."
03/21/2021,stocks,"CashApp is being advertised quit aggressively in social media (with influencer and content creators) that looks scummy to me, and the report of hacking/losing money is happening way too regularly (heard about complains from users way before the yahoo articles) if I was you I would not take it lightly but its your money and I am not a financial advisor"
03/21/2021,stocks,Somebody else told me that I should not look at the share prize of the two but rather compare their market cap which is about 3 times higher than the cap of PayPal. I am not really sure what to make of that to be honest though. Does that mean that a share of Square should be compared to one third of the stock price of a PayPal share because the percentage of the part of the company in Square is higher since they have a lower market cap? Maybe somebody can help me out in this question.
03/21/2021,stocks,Ok.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sarcasm:

> A cutting, often ironic remark intended to express contempt or ridicule."
03/21/2021,stocks,That sounds like a very good plan. Things are going to be volatile over the next few months. Don't get discouraged if you things drop.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Bottom line, millennials all use cash app. It’s all they know. Fintech is the future. I just go with ARKF."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You are right to pay attention to the market cap and not the price. Market cap is the number of shares times the price. The company can decide how many shares they want to divide themselves into. So using small simple numbers, whether they are 10 shares at $50 each or 100 shares at $5 each it’s the same company value. In this case the market values Square at 3X PayPal meaning they would expect either the current or potential future income to FAR exceed PayPal. For that reason I’m not sure whether SQ is really at a good price. And I agree with your thoughts too that SQ will probably follow the value of BTC because they invested so heavily in it. I do think SQ will bounce back really well short term, and they are the future of digital payments so their long term value should be good, but expect lots of waves and long flat times. While not as overvalued as Tesla I think we have seen what can happen quickly to an overvalued company. 

Personally I have SQ, PayPal, and Citibank in my portfolio. PayPal was the slowest to grow last year but between their online presence and Venmo payment system I believe them to be a solid company."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Don’t feel like explaining it but you are right, he is wrong. Price of a stock does not matter in the way he is saying. Company’s are worth different amounts which dictates how much their stock price should be"
03/21/2021,stocks,I'm a millennial. I've never even heard of cashapp. It's all Venmo these days.
03/21/2021,stocks,"But I think I messed up on thr 3X thing. The market cap of PayPal is more than 3 times higher than the one of Square, right?

Also one more question. How common is it for companys to enlarge their amount of shares? Does that only happen if they fear to go bancrupt or can it also happen if the company is doing really well?
Also would an action like this lower the value of call options since it would make the price of a single share fall or would that change in the number of shares be representet somehow in the value of already bought options?"
03/21/2021,stocks,CashApp has about 30m users and Venmo has about 60m. CashApp has more features and ultimately generates more money per user. So if you believe their growth will hold then it will be more profitable than Venmo.
03/21/2021,stocks,Lol. It’s not all Venmo these days. It depends where you live as to what’s more heavily used. Venmo bigger in northeast. Cashapp bigger in southeast. Some areas even use other apps I haven’t even used or know much about.
03/21/2021,stocks,I live in the Northeast. Venmo is definitely the thing.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I bartend events occasionally for fun and extra cash (not now obviously) in Florida, Tampa Bay area. It's all Venmo. I don't even have cashapp, everyone has Venmo"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Maybe because Miami and Tampa are more like the Northeast? Not sure. It’s data I saw in an article some months back. I don’t recall where Florida fell, but guessing that’s more in the Venmo arena. I’m in in the Northeast and agree almost everyone uses Venmo or PayPal, but I don’t deny that Cashapp is bigger elsewhere (and see the use of Square in many small businesses and restaurants. Went to a brewery a couple nights ago, was using Square for contactless service).

Edit: best I could do so far. An ark investments DD comparing Venmo, cashapp, and others. Definitely Venmo used more, but cashapp growing and catching Venmo while Venmo showing stagnation.

2021-03-21 10:03:20,stocks,"Should I sell MSFT for a newer growth stock? I don't have many shares of MSFT at the moment, but I was wondering if I should keep them in the long term or sell it for a cheaper growth stock. I'm curious what others think because even if Microsoft doubles its value, I don't see it becoming a 5 or 10 bagger compared to where it's at right now. I know they also have dividends, but I don't own enough shares for that to matter much. So for people who have once owned MSFT, what was your reason for selling it? Likewise, for people who own a couple shares, why do you continue to hold it? Thanks in advance for the input."

Only if you can predict things that will surely happen.

Best if you sell it then buy a company with zero profits. Can't lose since charity is a moral mandate. 

At any rate growth stocks are very relative. I think it is a bit silly people are still calling mega cap companies growth stocks but it's also silly people would choose to buy some bullshit instead. If you want to sell Microsoft just buy a more diversified growth fund--I'd caution against a ""growth stock."" These are already individually priced to grow too fast or are spam bullshit. Growth without risk mitigation is silly to me personally in this climate.

You can grow your account with dividends by the way. Plenty of rather boring investments that doubled in the last 5 years in terms of total return."

03/21/2021,stocks,I sold all of mine and rolled it into PSTH when PSTH just dropped to 24.00. MSFT had been trading sideways for too long and it was my only ok option for getting quick money for the PSTH dip. The analysts are saying MSFT is going to move up and there are recent insiders buying. Oh well. Hopefully in the long run I made a wise move - but I wish I could have held it (but I needed the money).

03/21/2021,stocks,"Well sir you should know people who can buy AAPL shares in multiples of 100 don’t take their advice from reddit. 

Regardless thanks for the advice. Much appreciated!!"
03/21/2021,stocks,You didn’t
03/21/2021,stocks,"Suppose you bought 100 shares @230 and you are comfortable selling them for 235. You will get a premium of $104 (according to option price right now)  expiring next Friday. And if the share prices go down, it will act as a hedge. $104 per week is free money :)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I took this advice from Reddit, and it’s working for me pretty good so far 🙂"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sure its $104 in ""free money"" but it costs you $23k to get that free money.  Annualized premium is 23% which is not a very good return on capital.

I like MSFT as a buy/hold forever, but if your seeking premiums, its not the best in the game. For instance, the same Delta CC on AAPL nets 39% return on capital."
03/21/2021,stocks,"23% seems pretty amazing to me, especially when you consider how low risk this is.


Unless you expect 2020 returns every year from now on..."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Wait... 39% return in a year with very little risk?  So if AAPL is trading at $120 and you buy 100 shares, you are in for $12,000

39% of $12000 is $4,680

$4,680/52 = $90

So roughly speaking $125 AAPL call option expiring next Friday will get you $90?  

Is my math roughly correct?  

Also, if yes... isn’t it too good to be true?  Where is the catch here?  Is there a catch? 🧐"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Do you consider AAPL to be any higher risk than MSFT?  The point I was making is that if premium is your goal, there are better stocks for it."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Its the same catch as always when comparing premiums for two underlyings: AAPL has a higher IV and all the characteristics that come along with that elevated IV.  AAPL is at 35.87%, MSFT is at 24.79% (on close dated weeklies)."
03/21/2021,stocks,The ‘catch’ is that if you had just put your money into 100 apple shares and not sold CCs on it a year ago you would have made more than 100% returns.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yes, you make a good point, but AAPL is a bit higher risk, (not by much). If my priority was safety I'd get MSFT."
2021-03-21 09:07:04,stocks,"Advice on Switching Investing Platforms Hey all! Like many people I'm looking to get my money and business away from Robinhood and into another, more trustworthy and reliable trading platform. I'm looking for thoughts on what platforms others have switched to and found success/enjoy. Ideally I'd still like to capitalize on commission free trading and a mobile friendly app interface, web works too though. I already have bank accounts with Ally Bank and any reviews on Ally's Self-Directed platform would be appreciated as well. Thanks and good fortune."
03/21/2021,stocks,I’d recommend TD Ameritrade or Charles Schwab
03/21/2021,stocks,"I use Fidelity and love it TBH. I started to use Robinhood to do options only but then ended up staying with Fidelity. 

Their platforms are easy to use but mobile could definitely use some help Easy as heck though to view company data and make trades needed. I mainly use Active Trader Pro on my computer because most of my trades are done before or after market close."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’ve tried fidelity, M1 finance, TD Ameritrade 
,SoFi, Robinhood, and webull. Fidelity is overall the best since it has fractional shares and no fees on penny stocks. I use RH for crypto still but looking to possibly move to Voyager."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I use Webull and it's OK, but just know a lot of stock types are restricted and you can't buy them.  Pennystocks, for example.  Any stock selling for under $1 is not able to be purchased on Webull, as far as I can tell.  Some equities that have a ""management fee"" (small fee per year) are not available to buy either.

Selling options is very annoying because Webull will lock your options abilities the moment your account goes negative, and it can go negative quite often because it takes 5-7 days for funds to be transfered in and Webull gives you ""buying power"" during they time.  So if you have 0 cash in your account and you transfer $1k into it, then buy $5 worth of stock with the $1k ""buying power"" Webull has given you until your funds settle, you will be locked out of Options because your account is technically -$5."
03/21/2021,stocks,TD Ameritrade for the Think or Swim software. If anybody recommends anything else they are just noobs.
03/21/2021,stocks,I couldn’t say about the transfer process but I use TD Ameritrade. Simple and clean UI on the app and the web interface is great too. It also has the thinkorswim app which I believe is for more advanced stuff if you do that. I downloaded it but I don’t use it. It looks pretty cool though.
03/21/2021,stocks,Merrill Edge or Morgan Stanley (Etrade)
03/21/2021,stocks,"Any suggestions for Europeans? I currently use DeGiro but I only have access to options on the AMS Exchange, their app and service is nice, transaction fees aren’t too bad in my opinion.  
I know binck and a few banks over here offer trading as well but they charge 4-10 euro per transaction which is absurd for an account like I have."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I have both Ally & Fidelity. Ally's interface is cleaner and a lot easier to look at, but I like Fidelity more because it has more features. Fidelity has fractional shares,  which Ally doesn't have. Fidelity also has longer extended hours trading."
03/21/2021,stocks,I just moved my brokerage from RH to TD. The transfer was quick and they refunded $75 transfer fee hours after requesting it. The opening of account might take long (a week) but I'm loving it so far
03/21/2021,stocks,"I also like Fidelity.  Zero problems.  Their desktop site is a bit cluttered and it can be a bit difficult to find some things but it does the job. The app is kind of bare bones but it also works for me.  

On the more positive side, I never ran into any of the broker specific  buying halts that screwed thousands over during the GME thing. 

Basically, the positives out weigh any negatives for me. Also, customer service has been good despite long hold times. The important thing is I was connected with a friendly and competent rep."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I have had TD Ameritrade since long before Robinhood was a thing. I recommend it but can't review any of the other platforms because I've been so happy with TD, that it's the only one I've ever used. I known its GUI is more complex (from looking at friends' RH accounts) but you have to consider what you loose at the cost of ""user friendly"". Same goes for ""free"" trades. These guys are making tons of money somewhere ... hint? It's usually by selling your personal information.

I know when you are new a lot of the terms and features are very confusing so that ""user friendly"" veneer is very attractive. But I recomend taking the dive and learning what those terms and features are/do. They are offered for a reason and I doubt that reason is to keep customers away. This is where programs like TDs Think or Swim come in. They give you a chunk of paper money (I believe it's $500,000) and let you play with it until you learn the ropes.

I've heard investopedia has a similar program and I'm sure there are others but again, I've been so happy with TD that I've never had to try anything else.

TL;DR

User friendly features are like training wheels. They might give a new trader a (false) sense of confidence but you really limit your potential by removing the features that professionals use. Sure you might scrape your knees a few times learning the hard way but once you figure it out you'll be cruising so fast that you'll forget you were ever afraid to take the training wheles off."
03/21/2021,stocks,Check out Interactive Brokers. The fees and commissions are reasonable.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Can you elaborate a bit more? I'm just so baffled over the abundance of positive reviews on Fidelity. Especially compared to RH. I have both...and Fidelity doesn't even come close. It looks like something out of 1884. It has a button that I have to **manually press** in order to refresh my positions. It's clunky, cluttered, ugly, and difficult to parse.

Maybe they provide good research on stocks, but I do not use brokerage sites for analysis. 

So...how do people like this? How do they think it's even comparable? Am I just using it wrong? It's a genuine question.

I understand RH screwed some folks who put their life savings into GME at 300+ and they're now salty, but this RH-hate/Fidelity-lovefest is just so bizarre."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think TDA is great as well. Lots of resources, the regular app is user friendly and TOS will allow you to dive deep into as much information as you want."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sure. A nice paint job and a detail make things look nice. I prefer a company that doesn’t answer to another clearing house, has great customer service, and that I trust will allow access to funds when I want them. The app design isn’t the selling point here, the good company with an ok app are (I think the desktop app is decent too). I would say TDA and Webull also have better app designs."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Fidelity may have an archaic GUI compared to others out there.  I havent tried them all. Having to refresh a page is hardly enough of a reason to switch, personally."
2021-03-21 08:21:35,stocks,"Do you think AVLR (AVALARA INC) (NYSE) will really be the “Amazon Killer tollbooth?” Stephen McBride claims it will be. It’s AI will automate tax compliance, and according to Stephen McBride, shareholders will basically get a piece of EVERY INTERNET TRANSACTION, and with online shopping only growing, this will mean more and more flowing in!

Now, I’m not sure how true that may actually be, but the software definitely sounds very promising, and something virtually all companies will probably end up needing to keep themselves from getting audited.

I was going to sell a few of my GME shares to take a little less from my savings, but I’m holding those 12 shares!

AVLR is currently $135.12, and I’ve already taken another $1,000 from my savings (I still have over 7K, but it’s not growing sitting in a savings account!) to add to my stimulus and tax return.

The maximum I can afford (without digging even more into the savings, in which case I have 7K, and would probably stop myself from going under 5K, if not 6K) is 17 shares of AVLR.

That may or may not make me rich within 5-10 years (probably not, but perhaps 20-50K, more or less).

The thing is, I’m 25, and already having a life crisis. I haven’t enjoyed my youth, I’ve just been existing and now panicking more and more as I grow closer to 26 (both because I’ll have to pay for my own health insurance, and it’s just the beginning of the second half of my 20s).

I never got to have a real social life. I’ve never had a girlfriend. I’ve never even, been intimate.

At this point in my life, I feel I need extraordinary circumstances to make up for all the life I lost, and just be able to enjoy life now. I don’t even look forward to a life of working anymore. All I see around me is not only everyone else my age being broke and living with their parents, but even MUCH OLDER PEOPLE being janitors and cashiers, even working 70 HOUR WORK WEEKS, just to survive.

I don’t want to have to struggle so much just to survive! That’s pointless! 

I’m not getting any younger. I feel more and more rejected by society everyday, and I’m becoming more painfully aware of my own, being so behind for my age.

People say age doesn’t matter, BUT IT DOES. One, our lives are finite, our bodies age and decay, we die.

Two, the older we get, like, 26, the more financial and social consequences there are for still not being moderately successful and independent.

I figured if I throw in another few thousand, worst case scenario, it’s not like AVLR will plummet severely anytime soon, right? This isn’t a volatile stock like GME, right?

This is a MASSIVE GAME CHANGER, RIGHT?"

I am also close to the same age as you, having wasted many years of my life, having to play catch up.
If I may quote Buffet, ""Unless you can watch your stock holding decline by 50% without becoming panic-stricken, you should not be in the stock market.""
Take the time to assess yourself. The stock market is not a get rich quick scheme, can it happen? Sure.
Is it likely, especially when playing in desperation and jumping at the first chance out of FOMO? No.

Ultimately, you may have scored on GME, but it should be seen as a rare and unprecedented event. Not everything is a Purple Mattresses, GameStop, or spy puts in March 2020. Take the chance to learn, educate yourself, and you may one day be the next DFV (he was a nobody who put his face to the books and absorbed everything he could, and when he saw the golden ticket that his years of educating himself allowed him to realize, he had the knowledge to jump on it with confidence).

That’s where you see the time decay. SPXL is only a little over 7% above it’s pre-COVID ATH for another example while SPX is a little over 15% above it.

These are good swing trades (that can last for as long as you feel the market trend is up which could last months), long term holds on the other hand, nope because time decay will likely get you unless you’ve found the alternate universe where there are no corrections."

But ideally, 3x etf are amazing at the bottom of a crash."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Oh they will continue to come out with HYPOTHETICAL explanations of ""if this happens or that happens"" it will go to zero.

Just look at the returns.  Judge for yourself.
Take a look at what happened to the first leveraged ETF.  SSO came out 15 years ago.  It has been around so long it was here during 2008.  Total return since incepton through Friday was 566% versus S&P at 215%."
03/21/2021,stocks,"They are awesome in a bull market and absolutely terrible in a bear market. Sideways markets are no good either. If you’re backtesting, then you have to be very careful what time periods you use. Keep in mind we have had some pretty historic bull markets recently. If you bought a 3x levered ETF in February 2020 then you would have suffered incredible losses quickly and who knows what that would’ve done to you emotionally and what you would have done in response. Would you have panic sold?  Would you have held on?  If you did hold, would you have sold once it bounced and you broke even?  

In the case of last year, the rally we saw after the crash was unlike anything I’ve seen in my 25 years of investing. It worked out great for levered ETFs but with the tremendous uncertainty in the market it could have gone the other way. It’s all about your risk tolerance."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s not a theory, it’s math. The decay you’re referring to is the fact that if the underlying moves down 5% and then rises 5%, it would be down 0.25% overall, but a 3x leveraged ETF tracking it would be down not 0.75% but actually 2.25%. 
So while it’s debatable whether it’s advisable to hold 3x ETFs long term, you won’t get unrecoverable losses unless the underlying drops 33% in one session, which won’t happen due to circuit breakers."

Any real downturn not supported by various direct interferences (which only really existed within the last let's say 12 years) could wipe you out. Generally that's bad. And many such bull funds have imploded/liquidated.

If the government apparatus said fuck the markets we should worry about the population this wouldn't be a question.

At any rate most investments involve leverage--companies are usually already leveraged. Isn't that enough?"
03/21/2021,stocks,Did before some calculations with 2x and saw myself that this not risky at all unless it's 2000 crash or something and you are highly invested in tech - it would take some more time to match unleveraged index but in the long term it beats unleveraged. Only the downside is fees
03/21/2021,stocks,"Uhh the ones that are still around did go to essentially zero, they just reverse split and start over... GUSH is a great example.. go look as the 2Y chart of any 3x leveraged it’s obvious they get hit extremely hard during downturns.."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well, they did get crushed. SPXL drew down 75%. Had it not been a straight line recovery, SPXL probably would not have recovered to highs as fast as SPX.  

Also, SPXL is up about 17.5 or so since Jan 2020. You’d think a 3X product would simply multiply returns/losses by 3X over a given time period. The decay plus the affects that large drawdowns have on leveraged products is why SPXL isn’t up 3x SPX which would be about 60% or so since Jan 2020.

Most people sell once they draw down, hence irrevocable losses. If you’re cool with Vol, leverage isn’t bad. In a perfect world you buy these at a bottom and sell once they reach their ATH again."

If you can handle the volatility that is."
03/21/2021,stocks,"SSO is actually a good example of the risk.  Following the 2008 crash it lost 80% of its value and didn't catch back up to SPY until 2017, and that's only a 2x ETF, a 3x would take even longer.

So it's only good to hold these if you know you won't need the money for decades, and can stomach losing most of it.  Best for young investors making regular contributions due to the diversification across time effect (see Nalebuff and Ayres' ""Lifecycle Investing"" book)."
03/21/2021,stocks,With leveraged ETFs I think they are absolutely best if you wait for a big market correction. Far too much drawdown to hold long term for my liking.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Rhetorical questions: why did you stop computing after only one down and one up? What happens if it rises again by 5%? In your argument, the non leveraged ETF is down by 0.25%, however the ETF prices increase over time.

Historically, the market indexes move up more frequently than down. So assuming that one down is followed by 2 ups, then the non leveraged ETF would be only 4.7% up from the beginning, while the leveraged ETF would be 12.4% up."

Most of those are ETNs that... well, pretty much died because ETNs are horrible... but there are some ETFs there as well. 

Now I think it's unlikely something like TQQQ would actually go to zero, but even then it's easy to lose a lot of money even in a flat market. NASDAQ has flat periods more often than not, contrary to recent history, so it sounds like a strategy with zero ways to mitigate risk (besides not buying, or selling before decay hits). I wouldn't average down into something like this whereas I'd be fine with doing that with QQQ.

Actual investing houses say don't hold these things for very long. If it was a reliable way to make money they'd just hold it for months at a time instead of like a day."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I dunno.  I think you can.  

I personally have long positions in both WFC and KHC from last year.  Both are up +10% in the past few months alone.  Those are both 'Buffet style investments'.  I think Buffet actually owns KHC.

And it's pretty easy to buy the shares compared to something like AMZN.  So, you don't need a ton of capital to get into them.

I wouldn't say stuff like this is restricted to only hedge funds.

It just depends on what kind of portfolio you want.

These kind of companies are definitely not the hot and sexy EV stocks where investors are predicting spectacular growth.  They are boring companies; one is bank and one makes ketchup and mustard.

However, they do generate money.  In addition, they both have had problems in past few years.  So, their stock price has taken a beating.  And, currently, they are trying to fix things and get back on track.

I think Buffet also owns SNOW.  So, if you want a hot new growth company, you can look at SNOW.  It's been taking a beating too with the NASDAQ sell off.  You might be able to get in <200 if the sell off continues.  If Buffet is right and SNOW becomes a Google over the next 25 years and you are 18, you'll be retiring early.

Again, not investment advice and you'll have to make your own decisions.  However, I think it is totally possible to have a Buffet style portfolio as a retail investor."
03/21/2021,stocks,A correction from this imo will be like another Great Depression. It’ll be bad. The fed has to let it happen at some point we can’t go on forever like this. Inflation will catch up and interest rates will rise. The housing market is also scary because of the foreclosures that are likely going to come from all of the people who haven’t been able to pay their mortgages due to COVID. We can only buy so much time before we have to face the inevitable crash. Also don’t forget about citadel MM who could cause the entire crash if they go under because of the GameStop fiasco

When I first began, weed stocks were rising with insane valuations. At the time, everyone agreed marijuana was going to become legalized, it was just a matter of when. I planned on buying $MJ at a price of around $33, but never did. Had I bought, I still would’ve not made my money back, even though legalization is closer than ever before. Does no one see the resemblance of this to EV companies now? So many of them are insanely overvalued, and even though we can all agree EV’s are the future, is that future really now?

03/21/2021,stocks,"There's a lot of instability in the market as a whole, and with rising treasury yields and expanding inflation both being hot topics right now, we're seeing this shift from tech and innovation to bonds, consumer cyclical and defensive buying, which is going to be a hard hurdle for these social stocks to really take off. 

The fundamental model for bond valuation is the inverse relationship it has to long-term treasury yields. TY going up means bond prices go down, and TY going down means bond prices go up. The obvious time to get in on a long-term bond for any investor is when the treasury yields start increasing. 

I expect we'll see a continued market sell-off if the Yields continue to rise. Increased treasury yields almost always signal a large shift from steady growth in stocks to volatility, and typically the best place for long-term investing is somewhere that has low volatility and steady growth. Bonds are becoming more and more attractive for this reason.

The reason why consumer cyclical and consumer defensive usually perform well despite market volatility is because people will always need consumer discretionary products like food and clothing. The continuous need for these products keeps demand high and valuation steady, regardless of what happens in the rest of the market."

2021-03-21 02:42:56,stocks,"DD on Poshmark (POSH). Why I think it is undervalued and why there is room for a lot of growth. Founded in 2011, the company's online marketplace for secondhand clothes, shoes and accessories is akin to eBay and Etsy. Poshmark connects buyers with sellers, who often list items from their own closet. And it makes money by taking a cut of every transaction.
 
Poshmark (POSH) went public on January 14, 2021, at a price of $42, but when shares opened for trading the stock reached $104.98. Since then the stock price has fallen to more reasonable prices and is currently trading at about $46. 

The company owns and operates a social marketplace. This platform is used to buy and sell lifestyle products in the U.S. and Canada (and it is currently expanding to Australia). POSH sells apparel, footwear, beauty, and home products as well as accessories and jewelry.

As POSH is a social marketplace the company encourages repeat purchases ensuring a high customer engagement rate. It ended the September quarter with more than 31.7 million active users, 6.2 million active buyers, and 4.5 million active sellers.

POSH claims active users spent 27 minutes on average each day on its platform in 2019 which resulted in 20.5 billion social interactions. While the company’s sales rose 38% year over year in 2019 to $205 million, its net loss widened by 236% to $49 million.

In the first three quarters of 2020, sales were up 28% at $193 million. Further, the company was also able to turn profitable and reported $21 million in net income. For the last quarter ended Dec. 31, Poshmark's loss narrowed to $4.06 million, or 31 cents per share, from a loss of $14.75 million, or $1.20 per share, a year earlier. After adjusting for one-time items, the company earned 5 cents a share during the quarter.

Revenue climbed 27% to $69.32 million from $54.74 million a year earlier. That was higher than the average revenue estimate of $68 million, reported by Refinitiv.

For the first quarter of 2021, Poshmark is calling for revenue to fall within a range of $75.5 million to $77.5 million. Analysts had been calling for $79.2 million on average.

Consumers, especially younger ones, are increasingly turning to these types of internet marketplaces for secondhand goods. A number of players are looking to gain market share, including luxury consignment site TheRealReal, sneaker reseller StockX and virtual thrift store ThredUp. The latter filed for its IPO earlier this month.

Poshmark said its count of active buyers reached 6.5 million in the fourth quarter, up 20% year over year. The company defines active buyers as unique users who have purchased at least one item on the platform in the trailing 12 months, regardless of returns and cancellations.

Cowen & Co. has previously estimated that the resale market in the U.S. is valued at $30 billion to $35 billion.

TL;DR After DD, I feel that the stock is undervalued.

03/21/2021,stocks,Thanks for the DD. Definitely have my eye on this company.
03/21/2021,stocks,I think this stock can be 20-30.
03/21/2021,stocks,Wife used to sell on there for a bit..they recently raised their prices to sell..I think she also said you have to pay for shipping items through them which is more expensive than using paypal shipping. She stopped using it.
03/21/2021,stocks,"They actually deal with fraud really well, packages over 500$ of worth get shipped through an extra safety control to make sure everything us legit.
For people trying to scam sellers (for example pretending their item is broken and such) there is a very high requirement for proof."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You're probably not the target demographic. Most of the Millennial-aged women I know have used Poshmark, either as sellers or buyers. My fiancee has sold a ton of stuff on there that she'd bought and either barely wore or didn't wear at all and forgot to return, which is the majority of what's sold there. It was also very helpful for her to rotate her wardrobe when she lost about 50 pounds a few years ago.

One thing that's key to understanding the future of the resale market is the sustainability aspect. A lot of people buy, sell, and swap used goods not to save money necessarily, but to cut down on waste. I believe the CEO of Poshmark has even stated that this was one of the major reasons she started the company."

If the CEO or a high executive of a company is involved in a scandal/fraud etc. why would the shares of that company go down?

I mainly want to be able to understand how to read a company's financials/earnings reports to tell what the fair value share price of a company is. Does anyone have a good resource for this? What am I looking for? I've only been in stocks for a bit over a year, and I have a little bit of an understanding, but there is alot that I don't know. I know the very basics like how market cap works.

For example, Is there any relation between a company's revenue and their market cap? What kind of EPS are you supposed to look for to see if a company is undervalued? What P/E ratio is considered fair value for tech stocks? How does a company benefit from their share price going up without diluting? I assume they own shares of their own, and that's how they benefit from it when they sell? How do you tell if a company's quarterly revenue is good with respect to it's market cap? Again, I'm trying to understand how to determine the ""fair value"" market cap based on their revenue currently, but I know most tech stocks are more expensive because they project into the future."
03/21/2021,stocks,https://www.khanacademy.org/economics-finance-domain/core-finance/accounting-and-financial-stateme
03/21/2021,stocks,"""relation between a company's revenue and their market cap"" - it's called P/S ratio. 

What you're asking for is basically trying to understand the nuance of how the market works. That's a forever ambiguous and changing answer. 

What's the way to determine the fair value of a house? Market comps. Price per square foot is a baseline way to compare houses of different sizes. Lot size, school district, age of the roof/HVAC system all matter as well, and it will always vary from house to house, neighborhood neighborhood to neighborhood, state to state. 

Same for companies. Compare within industries. For larger profitable companies, EPS and P/E ratios can be good comparisons, but to compare companies of varying size, use P/S or P/B ratio. Don't use KO as your example to show that PG or UNH is undervalued."

2021-03-21 02:10:21,stocks,"Downpayment Fetcher - Individual Stock Pick to Invest $50k. Hi,
I’m invested mostly in index fund etfs and they’ve done ok for me. However I’m looking into buying a house in a years time in a VHCOL city. I’d like to invest $50k in some individual stocks that can potentially give me a 200% return in this time frame. I have never been a proponent of YOLO investing (hence a mostly etf portfolio) . But without a fancy job , stock gains seem to be one of the few realistic options I have to make this sum . I’ve been thinking of spreading this over ABNB ,DIS and SQ. It is my opinion that these are quality stocks and even if they fall short of my expected appreciation rate , they will still not be terrible. I’d love to her from someone who’s thinking on similar lines and hear their opinions about this."
03/21/2021,stocks,"You sound like me 5 years ago and it only sort of worked out for me. I invested about 160k in feb 2016 to see if I could grow it for a downpayment in 2017. (I live in an area where normal homes are 700-800k, and they need renovations). I was really lucky in that feb 2016 was a dip. I forget the catalyst but all stocks were trading red and I felt like they could only grow from there in a year. They did, and by December, my portfolio had grown 50% and I was feeling really happy. We house shopped the following spring/summer and put in our offer in July 2017. I kept waiting to sell my stocks because ya know, waiting for more growth. Low and behold 2 weeks before I needed the money, my portfolio tanked to only about 30% gain (60% was the peak of the gain within my time period) I still grew my money and it kind of worked out, but you can’t time the market and had it been something like March 2020, I would have lost money and lost the bid on our home in a really competitive housing market. 2020 was a really anomalous growth year and 2021 is shaping up to seeing headwinds with rising bond yields, etc... This is not financial advice and you need to ultimately make your own decision on this one."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I mean I'm not going to tell you not to gamble your money because I'm not a fucking soy like the rest of the commenters. If I had 50k and I wanted a 200% return in a year I wouldn't buy stock I would buy options. And right now my options picks would be UAL and DRI. These companies both stand to grow quite rapidly from reflation even though they're pretty close to pre-covid levels.

 I would trade ITM debit spreads each for an expiry of about 5 months out. I would leave 20% unleveraged in a cash balance on the account to roll the trades if they didn't go in your favor (that's why the DTE is only gonna be 5 months so you have an extra month for each play if you need to roll out while still giving you the maximum amount of time possible to be profitable). You could in theory put that 10k into stocks but if you were going to you would buy something high liquidity, low volatility so you could easily sell them for a small profit when needing to buy back your option to roll out but probably better to just leave it in cash.

For debit spreads to be profitable they both need to expire in the money and you don't have time to lose money to learn that. Basically the stock can go up or down all it wants but because the value of the spread is made up by the difference of a sold option and a bought option it's not going to effect it a whole lot because they will both gain and lose value in tandem. So you would be buying fairly deep in the money spreads to make sure that it is most likely for you to win. Look for the deepest ITM option spread that is 5 strikes apart that you can buy for ~$2.50/share (that would be 100% profit at expiry). Since it's already in the money, it has intrinsic value and you don't even need the underlying asset to go up to win it just needs to stay above those two strike prices. I would buy 20k of each because ""diversification"" and what not.

Right so you have 10k in cash balance, you have 80 debit spreads of UAL expiring in August, and then another 80 debit spreads of DRI expiring in August. I would probably set a calendar event for july 1st and then delete the app so I couldn't watch it like a hawk waiting for it to print and likely sell before it did. You want to check back up on it around 30 DTE because that's when theta starts to really kick in and the price of the stock starts to matter. 

And then if it prints you made 40k with a total balance of 90k and then rinse and repeat. 18k cash balance 36k in one stocks options (you will need to revaluate what stocks are good picks at that time obviously) and then 36k in another. If it prints you made 72k with a total balance of 162k.

No one knows what the market is going to do tomorrow. Is this smart? Maybe. Will this work? Again maybe. What I will tell you is I think this is the lowest risk way to make 100% in 6 months. And just to be clear you can do this with any stock it doesn't have to be a risky stock that you don't know much about. You could do this strategy with apple, or Google, or Amazon, or tesla, or Walmart, literally anything and it still works. And it's the same payout and risk/reward.

Disclaimer: not financial advice this is just what I would do, options are very risky and you can lose everything."

I understand that you’re ok (theoretically - I bet you won’t feel ok then!) with a small loss, but realistically you could maybe turn you $50k into $54-60k... maybe. Not $150k or $100k (depending on how you calculate 200%.) You could also turn it into $40k. Given the time sensitiveness and the importance of something like a house purchase I personally wouldn’t risk it. Returns like that are a gamble. And gambles go both ways (and usually the house wins... like their house, not your house.)

Position: my house down payment is in my savings account right now. Most of it was there in March 2020 also and could be almost enough to buy the whole house had I invested it then. But I 100% have no regrets about not taking that risk."

I have a simple question, but realize that the answer may very well be ""depends"".

Regardless, I would love to hear options on how much weight/stock people pay towards company reviews on job sites (Glassdoor/Dice/Indeed/etc.)

I feel like the number of jobs/positions open and the nature of the positions (leadership, worker bees, etc.) are definitely reliant.

Also, for those who do feel there is some good insights from these reviews... are there any key indicators that signal towards buyer beware or load up???

Thanks in advance for all responses."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I used Glassdoor recently to evaluate a small company called Farmers Edge. I took all the reviews with a grain of salt. I was encouraged to see the company reviewed pretty good. Looking at the negative reviews though I saw a theme of disconnected management and products that don't work quite as advertised.


While I think every good company will have negative reviews, it was enough for me to not invest. I was trying to determine if the company was marketing focused or engineering focused and judging from their job ads (all sales) and common complaints in the reviews, I decided not to invest.


I wouldn't call it DD, but it was useful research."

2021-03-21 01:41:45,stocks,"Favorite stock pick If you had to choose, which stock do you want to own/buy for the next few decades, and why? 

Mine is T-mobile USA. I expect them to make a lot of money with their 5g network in the future. I think 5g is going to be key in the next wave of innovative technologies. Like self driving cars, robots, smart cities and such. 

Disclaimer: This is only my opinion. Not advice. Please do your own research."
03/21/2021,stocks,APPS.  They have a virtual monopoly and solid contracts giving them guaranteed future growth.  And that's not even mentioning their growth into newer markets.
03/21/2021,stocks,Square or Sea Limited. Both are innovative growth stocks that have services and products which span across multiple sectors. I also like Draftkings.
03/21/2021,stocks,Sony

03/21/2021,stocks,"Privacy is not on the list of reasons why you buy one of these companies. You buy for future growth potential not what they do already. 

Apple is a buy not bc of privacy but bc they are almost certain to get into the vr and ev markets

Google is a buy not just bc of google but bc of waymo, deep mind etc....

Same with Microsoft and amazon you buy for future potential not just for what they currently got. 

Unless you just like apple bc of this one thing they do (privacy) but it’s not something great to consider tbh."
03/21/2021,stocks,"PLTR isn’t remotely similar to being a consulting company using software. There is a leaked video showing some examples of what their software can do. I’ll put it like this: 

Imagine a system being able to keep 100% of your business data *in focus* at the same time, such that it immediately recognizes problems or opportunities when you suggest possible moves, and is able to reveal breaks and offer multiple specific suggestions for each scenario. 

This is a difficult concept for many to grasp because of the sheer magnitude of possible data streams for large scale operations. As a leadership exec in supply chain and distribution working for a large U.S. retailer, I work with a lot of data. When I saw the walkthrough, I was floored. It took zero effort to understand how we could apply it to many aspects of our business. My conviction is through the roof. 

I think their window for growth is likely a bit ahead of us, so I’m holding for 2-5 years."
03/21/2021,stocks,I think you're wrong. Privacy will be a huge selling point in the coming decade when people realize what is done with their data. It's also a huge liability on the balance sheets of companies like Google that is not yet priced in. It's like tobacco in the 80s and people are slowly waking up realizing how unhealthy their behavior has been.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Sorry but as someone involved in computer science I really doubt that possible.

You probably saw a nice demo, but I really doubt it's that effective in practice. If something exists that really could

>immediately recognizes problems or opportunities when you suggest possible moves, and is able to reveal breaks and offer multiple specific suggestions for each scenario

this would be significantly ahead of the state of the art of machine learning / AI. It's probably good, but there's no way it's as good as you describe. You are essentially describing a human-level general purpose AI, we are nowhere close to that.

Can you link the video? I strongly suspect its just a nice demo, but would love to be proven wrong."
03/21/2021,stocks,So it’s just like SAP Enterprise?
03/21/2021,stocks,"But you can just as easily say companies like google are necessary to keep the internet as it is rn, free for anyone to use. No one ever think of the consequences of losing a company like google (tbh i doubt we’ll ever lose them) but it would be massive implications that I don’t think people are willing to live with. 

You’ll most likely have to pay a subscription fee for all the websites you visit (including reddit), youtube will completely fall apart leaving millions of content creators without a job and you can’t expect them continue making content without the source of money stream (only a massive company like google can keep youtube going operating on its own is a death sentence) . 

You can argue another big company will come in a save youtube and replace the void search left but then you just end up with the same exact situation as now probably only accomplishing the consolidation of current monopoly powers (ie: you won’t see “new competition” you’ll most likely see bing as the new google and youtube will be bought by either Microsoft or apple bc realistically they’re the only ones who can afford to keep their lights on).

Not disagreeing with you that their could be a culture shift but imo google is most likely to navigate it as opposed to either being split up or straight up failing."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If these companies were really so powerful don't you think there'd be a stronger liberal presence in government? The big tech companies sway hard towards liberals/democrats, so if they really were pulling strings in the government we would see the government more strongly democrat. It's pretty even split right now, so that seems to indicate to me they are not really that powerful.

Or maybe they are powerful, but not powerful in the way the employees wish it was. Meaning big tech is extremely politically powerful but it's mostly an uncontrolled spiral rather than intentionally manipulative."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think you’re misunderstanding the mechanisms I’m describing. I’m not talking about AGI. The video is up on multiple channels for people who want to find it, and the way it accomplishes what I described is evident in the layout."

So why haven’t they gained complete control yet (in my completely amateur opinion)? These companies and technologies used are so new to the human landscape that nobody realized what unbelievable power they had initially.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Not a huge fan of JMIA tbh. I feel like the African markets, like Nigeria, Ghana, and Uganda, are still a little too underdeveloped economically, and the varying economic situations and subsequent socioeconomic cultures within the countries (like how South Africa would differ from Nigeria, or Morocco and Tanzania) make an universal African appeal hard for me to see. 

The good thing is that African economies are growing at a rapid rate, and it looks like this next age for Africa will be prosperous, albeit with a couple of bumps. But it's too early imo, and I personally feel like Jumia is going to get overtaken by some other African e-commerce companies in the future."

03/21/2021,stocks,Just buy 25% of the full position you want to own and if the stocks drops average in until you have 100% no one can time the market and if the stock takes off after your first buy at least you have some skin in the game.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not sure it’s seen as solely growth tech in market. It’s honestly done well maintaining price during the turbulence. I think the gambling component (along with rolling legalizations in the different states) is helping protect it from heavy offloading. Not to mention there’s a lot of hope the stock will continue to perform with March Madness and sports seasons reopening and starting soon. Buying in now you’d be close to ATH though. 

I’m very bullish on DKNG, I have shares"
03/21/2021,stocks,Don’t listen to this dude he does nothing but try and pump DKNG. Once March madness ends the stock will tumble
03/21/2021,stocks,And they are beating th pants off of other low cost dollar stores like dollar tree! This is a seriously good company for sustainable growth attached to intrinsic value.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Its gaining against its competitors dollar tree and wmt and really aggressively growing! Really taking over the world especially in places where it's hard to get a walmart nearby. 

Dollar tree just isnt as good of a company, they arent really growing their cash flows, and had a costly merger a few years back that didnt go well they are still suffering from."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I like TDOC too. I think we'll see more and more larger Insurers pushing more teledoc type services, versus wanting people to go into a doctors office. Much better margins for the insurer. BCBS is actively partnered with TDOC btw, and I'm pretty sure Aetna is too."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think it’s something to monitor, but that’s about it for now.  TDOC holistic view on whole care is likely different from what Amazon is doing with their employees."
03/21/2021,stocks,I also just bought into AFRM. I think it’s dropped far enough from its IPO. I think these guys can compete with PayPal and Square.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’ve been going back and forth on PINS but ultimately I don’t understand, outside of advertisements, what their future looks like. It’s a side where people collect different things into a space. Is there value in the data here or are so they have specific tech around that that can be scaled?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I don't think anyone knows what to think about them atm. Cathy dropped them from ARKK, but they have very strong fundamentals. I think they've officially graduated from speculation, and the market will pick up on it after next earnings"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah I think they may have the best product (I've used google cloud and aws).
I am just a bit hesitant buying google after big runup and in the middle of tech correction. I think there are better investing opportunities right now (apple)"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your input.  I am not familiar with the market in that area, thus have chosen to not put money there.  I have only heard about OZON in passing.  I don't invest in any of them, but if I did, it would only be AMZN and MELI."
03/21/2021,stocks,"If you keep wondering youll never get in, it will hit a bottom and youll think ‘’maybe itll go lower” then itll raise and youll think “maybe it’ll come back down”"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Their debt to equity is like 0.6, and their capital structure is pretty much always levered up to this level as it probably gives them what they consider optimal WACC. What are they doing with that low interest debt? They are aggressively growing and their discounted cash flows are going way up yoy.

They also pay a nice dividend and weren't touched by the pandemic."
03/21/2021,stocks,The ceo worked for PayPal. I believe he was In Charge of fraud detection and a couple other functions but max levchin has the experience to make this big. They neeeed to get away from peleton a bit though in my opinion.

03/21/2021,stocks,"They are also going to start banking, just like Shopify did. Meaning: they will offer businesses loans and then take a percentage of monthly sales that automatically pays the loan.

&#x200B;

>AGT has initiated a new position in Nintendo, the Japanese listed video-game company. The investment thesis for Nintendo is predicated on its high-quality and unique IP (e.g. Super Mario, Pokémon), net cash and investments covering approximately a  quarter  of  market  cap,  as  well  as  a  digital  transformation  of  its  business  that  reminds  us  strongly  of  Sony  during  the PlayStation  4  cycle.  The  insights  garnered  from  our  deep-dive  research  into  Sony’s  gaming  division  allowed  us  to  spot similarities between it and Nintendo’s business, highlighting how insights in one area can be leveraged or ported over to another.   
>  
>As a reminder, the video game business has historically been characterised by earnings cyclicality, with revenues and profits driven  by  the  periodic  release  of  new  consoles.  Sony  transformed  its  own  gaming  business  by  introducing  a  subscription service, microtransactions, platform fees and streaming services, reducing reliance on hardware sales, and introducing higher-margin, recurring (sticky) revenue streams which are prized by the market for being stable and highly visible.  
>  
>In our view, Nintendo is at the beginning of a similar process. In 2020, management took large strides in shifting its videogame business towards an attractive, digitally focused model by introducing both subscription revenues and downloadable content onto the Switch platform. The pandemic served as a catalyst to move consumers online, making the digital subsegment the fastest growing part of Nintendo, now accounting for 42% of software sales and helping drive operating margins to 37% (+11% over last year). In addition to the digital transformation, Nintendo has the option to further monetise its world-class IP by expanding  into  new  areas –for  example,  through  opening  its  first-ever  theme  park  and  the  release  of  a  new  Super  Mario movie, slated for 2022.   
>  
>Despite the deep moat given by IP and the ongoing transformation of the business, Nintendo trades at c. 10x operating profits, which we believe reflects fears that management will attempt to re-invent the wheel with each hardware cycle, meaning that profits will continue to be cyclical and the business will always be exposed to the risk of an unsuccessful console launch –for example, the introduction of the Wii (highly successful) and the Wii U (less successful). In our view, this risk is overstated,and we believe there is strong evidence to suggest that Nintendo is moving away from unpredictable hardware cycles, towards the Switch becoming the sole platform, upgraded each cycle, similar to the PlayStation. The release of the Switch Lite in 2019 and the upcoming release of the Switch Pro, with upgraded hardware, highlights Nintendo’s desire to extend the Switch lifecycle, offering consumers  a better experience on refreshed versions of the platform. Furthermore, the introduction of microtransactions,  subscription  services,  and  different  price  point  consoles  suggests  that  Nintendo  is  starting  to  build  an ecosystem  where  consumers  will  store  their  Switch  game  data  on  the  cloud  and  in  turn,  upgrade  their  console  every  few years.

>We are excited about Nintendo as an investment opportunity and believe that it holds out the prospect of both significant earnings growth and valuation upside as the market comes to appreciate the new and improved business model.

03/21/2021,stocks,"I feel like Nintendo is the video game company that is best positioned to expand outside the box of consoles and exclusives.  They can feasibly take their exclusives, and market them as seperate real world entities.  There can be a Super Mario Land, there can be a Pokemon World, and those would have a high chance of success because there's a family friendly and almost timeless vibe.  Sony and Microsoft have either not yet attempted to capitialize on that niche, or have not found the same success.

I feel like in the long run, it would be more attainable for Nintendo to clean their house in terms of upgrading hardware/closing the gap in system capabilities, improve their online features/functions, and through this court additional developers to round out current weak points in their library, than it would for Sony/Microsoft to build the brands neccesary to compete with Nintendo outside of the box.

TLDR; I think Nintendo has the best chance of cross success.  They may be a slow burner, and there's things to improve upon, but the upside is there."

It seems like most of the current major US players are heavily vertically-integrated, which is the intelligent play. They own the grow all the way to sale. They’ve invested pretty heavily in themselves and taken on debt to accomplish this, but there are several high-population states that still aren’t legal and among the ones that are, they remain high in sales and continuing to expand operations.

I’m not sure that the tobacco players will be able to easily penetrate the market, at least not in the short term outside of any mechanism other than via acquisition. Acquisition isn’t a bad thing for shareholders either for a well-run company. I think tobacco will pay big money to buy established brands and their operating models.

Short-term (1-3 years or so out) I think we’ll see some consolidations and some failures, along with a lot of expansion into higher-pop new markets (VA, AZ, NY, PA).

There are some limiting factors that will depress growth, like these companies having to continually take on debt in order to expand. Given that they have to keep prices low to compete with the black market, they can’t capture enough margin to really boom and expand operations organically."

2021-03-20 22:53:58,stocks,"Uranium, the cycle has turned and the next phase is on the horizon I wanted to bring you all another post on the uranium sector after the massive run up we have seen in equity prices over the past few weeks. A lot of people have been worried about this run being unsustainable, because of a lack of movement in spot price. Others have pointed to it being blind speculation that will come to an end soon. Neither of those things are necessarily true in my view and these will be addressed in this post, together with a host of other things.

Recently an interview came out by Smithweekly on YT where he spoke to perhaps the two brightest minds in the uranium investing space, Mike Alkin and Timothy Chilleri, in a two hour long gem of information on the uranium sector. After watching the video and talking about it with a lot of different investors, several of them found it to be relatively hard to follow and take in because of the duration of the video and technical terms in it. Because of this, I have written a summary of this interview that is found below, which is a lot less than 2 hours and hopefully it can help people pick out the most important aspects of it. I would most definitely advise you to watch the entire video even after reading this though, as it can be a great help in such an opaque market. Without further ado, here is the summary:

**First and foremost, fears of the financial markets today:**

It’s a very interesting time. The view on the market is the case for a potentially weaker dollar, which would square with where we are in terms of commodity prices. The prices are moving up, but the valuation between the two asset classes is stretched, with equities being extremely high. Play in the things you are comfortable with, the markets might feel ‘toppy’ right now due to all the tech fueled growth, it might continue but no one knows. Sometimes it is better to be in the parts of the market with less eyeballs on it and where things are less priced in. Timothy, who likes his coffee the same as Mike (and Andrew, important detail), focuses on cyclical industries/commodities currently. Things like gold miners who are now paying back debt and have a lot of free cash flow, again, with less eyeballs on it. If you go to plays where others won’t be, it is easier to have an informational edge and gain value, because the moment other retail investors and especially institutions come in, a lot of the potential upside won’t be there anymore.

**The view of a long runway in the bulk of the commodities:**

This is certainly the case. Uranium doesn’t have real price discovery on a regular basis. There is a terrible futures market that is out there, which is so small it is insignificant. You have a cohort of buyers, which is the electric utilities, and there are \~60 of them around the world. Lastly you have a few traders who trade some pounds back and forth, which don’t really influence the market. Right now, nuclear is catching an ESG feel to it, the fact that we are more focused on fighting climate change and we need nuclear power for that. Uranium mining gets swept up in that as well. Some people also look back and watch the commodities, especially with a weaker dollar. Once they have their eyes on the market, those people will likely see the opportunity so many of the people already investing into uranium have. Although this is all attractive, it doesn’t play a part in the base thesis of Mike and Tim. In their view, in terms of the best performance profile, there is nothing that comes close to uranium. Should we see a March like crash? It will be a like a gift. Having said that, the commodities market as a whole is very interesting. We need all the basic resources and after years of underinvestment, these cyclical commodities are coming back into favor. Markets will prove to be cyclical, as they have always been.

**Let’s talk uranium:**

First off, the supply side risk. Certainly one year ago, late January 2020, all focus was on the spreading of the COVID-19 virus. Because of that we saw several C&M decisions to go down, both from Cameco as well as closures in other jurisdictions and the pause of wellfield development in Kazakhstan. Very few people expected it to ‘drag on and drag on’, but today with Cigar Lake on care and maintenance, the risks remain out there. This has been highlighted for a few years now. It might not be fires and floods that take a mine offline this time, but who knows what might happen tomorrow. There are also mines closing permanently, like Ranger and COMINAK this year after some 50 years of mining (taking approximately 7 million pounds off of the market). This is already factored into the market, but those are still real pounds coming off of the market that will need to be replaced and with Olympic Dam not expanding for now, it is not clear where those might come from.

These pounds will need to be replaced. Why? Because demand is inelastic and there is no substitute. These utilities need uranium. In the last bull market these utilities had drawn down their inventories and if you look back to that period of time, you had much higher supplier and producer inventories, with lower utility inventories. These are, when all put together, lower today than they were back then. You can’t exclusively look at utility inventories and come to a conclusion purely based on that. The prevailing sentiment at that time, was that buyers didn’t believe there was a need to buy, they had been burned before and wouldn’t move based on merely the promise of the market improving. The ingredients for a massive bull run were in place: low inventories and underinvestment by suppliers. Exactly what we see today, but the difference is that we have a better demand story now and no new mine supply coming online.

This supply deficit can be seen when one would try to buy pounds off of the spot market in any given month several years ago. You would probably be able to find 15 million pounds, but today if you want to find more than 1 million free flowing pounds, you would drive the price up. Traders know this as well, the fact they can’t secure a large amount of pounds. Talks for security of supply are happening right now. The stage is set for a tug of war. Producers are not blinking and it is all part of the cat and mouse game, but this can’t go on. If utilities don’t start contracting like yesterday, they are hosed. They are going to be paying prices significantly higher than they need to be paying. It doesn’t matter how long it takes, supply is low, demand has improved and no new mine supply is coming online. Since 2013, on average 35% of supply was contracted and they are sitting there with enormous uncovered needs over the next couple of years. Don’t pay attention to day-to-day fluctuations, do the math, the opportunity is there and the horse has left the barn because utilities overplayed their hand. Some are playing it smart, like the smaller more nimble utilities, but the bigger ones are taking their time and will need to wake up soon. When one or two do so, it will likely be a stampede.

You know what is not going to make a difference? US producers tagging an extra million on maximum production capacity or Brazil opening a 4 million pounds a year uranium mine is not going to make a difference. We need more price discovery and if we don’t go to 50-60 dollars a pound, those mines won’t come and those pounds won’t be available.

**View from inside the industry:**

What does one see after 20,000 hours of research? Consensus is inconsistent. Most buy and sell side models are not up to date, causing inconsistencies in the views of the market. What also doesn’t help utilities get ‘ahead of the curve’, is that the fuel buyers in question don’t have any financial incentive to go ahead and lock in supply at certain prices. They don’t get anything extra for timing the bottom perfectly, nor do they participate in the financial upside. With no rewards for saving a fortune, you often see that most fuel buyers follow a herd like mentality. They won’t get penalized if they pay more than what they could have, as long as the peers are doing it. They won’t get fired for paying more to secure pounds, they might just get fired if they fail to secure any security of pounds for the utilities.

One of the big mistakes people make in this sector. Is being so focused on ‘uranium’, U3O8, without really understanding conversion, enrichment and the broad fuel cycle. There are bottlenecks in this fuel cycle and we are finally coming to a point where we can move into the U3O8 market, because all this stuff further down the fuel cycle has been sucked out. Activity is going to pick up and this will result in a reaction in the prices of U3O8. Being well passed peak underfeeding, the next stage is coming over the next 6/12/18 months.

What about mobile inventory? Something so many are worried about? At the moment, bottlenecks in the conversion market are still being solved. Questions like: Is there available UF6 stock? Can I convert my U3O8?, are common and these bottlenecks will need to be worked through. U3O8 is the last place they will go, but underneath the surface a lot of things are happening. Don’t keep staring at the price, the fundamentals are there, stop worrying about day to day noises in a broken, dysfunctional and inefficient physical uranium market and trying to make sense of it. If we really had all this excess supply, prices would be dropping like a rock.

**China’s role in the thesis:**

They do not have a lot of indigenous uranium production, which is why they search for it elsewhere and make investments to secure supply for all the reactors they need to construct in order to meet the carbon neutral goals by 2060. They think in terms of decades and all these inventories that they have will never see the light of day. They are strategic and necessary for them. They are playing the long game and want security for every single reactor and a 400 million pounds stockpile, over the long term, is not a lot for them in the grand scheme of things. They are buying up all sorts of commodities and this should not be underestimated, so don’t stand on the sidelines looking in while the commodities macro thesis is playing out in front of everyone.

**Mistakes and unexpected events:**

It is hard to realize how reliant the sector is on third party consultants. Having to spend so much time analyzing other people’s work, is an area that wasn’t really forecast. As facts change, consensus numbers change as well. But this doesn’t necessarily happen in this sector and it wasn’t until a deep dive into the sector, that a ‘wow’ moment came. The math is extremely compelling and it cannot be outrun. When will this happen? Could be tomorrow, but it also could be the end of this year. Point is that the math is in place and human nature doesn’t change in these cyclical industries, they will chase the price when it starts moving.

When Converdyn went down back in 2017/2018 and they were out securing conversion, to do that they would go and buy UF6. Converdyn would have U3O8 laying around and the amount of U3O8 equivalent in that UF6 is returned to the seller. Some of the people that took this U3O8 back in, don’t need it, so they blow it into the market. In this period there was more supply and it was just a ‘ricochet event’ in the form of people getting U3O8 to lock in conversion and blowing it back into the market, which brought some supply. It was never forecasted, but we have worked through those inventories and now we are on the other side of this. Headwinds are turning into tailwinds.

Don’t make the mistake holding on to your shares too long. It’s part math and part art. You will see a lot of things happen, including crazy multiples and FOMO. Keep your eyes on the goal and keep evaluating and re-evaluating your investment thesis and put the puzzle together when situations change that might alter the outlook. There will be a time to sell, as you will always see with cyclical industries.

**Proper analysis and projections:**

Let’s talk about the difference sort of companies in the sector, the exploration, development and production companies. Exploration is hard, the success rate is not great, but there are possibilities to be had there. There can be monster returns to be made here, but it is a lot more risky, so keep that in mind as it can be a tricky part of the market. This is however not what has priority, the priority is in finding the mismatch in the macro. This is where you can look at some of the producers who can get back into production and will have cash flow, which can attract new investors to these companies. Then there are some development companies with world class assets where the market will probably just pay a premium when the cycle turns, because the asset is just too good.

For projects to come online, a lot of things have to go very well in the macro market. When this happens, the stocks of the underlying equities will probably have already re-rated and the current opportunities that are available today, are likely not going to be the same risk/reward proposition at that point. It pays to be early.

\--------------------------------------------------------

That marks the end of the summary of this great interview. I wholeheartedly agree with Mike, Tim and Andrew on this one. The math is in place and the thesis looks to be playing out just like it was expected. It is still relatively early in this bull run so for those worried about missing the entire run up, we have not been anywhere near a top in this market in my view. Can we see a correction after such a massive run up? Of course, but in my opinion these corrections and dips are useful buying opportunities. Make sure to do your own research and build conviction.

03/21/2021,stocks,"What do you think about the idea/prediction/mentality that Nuclear is going to start replacing Coal as the ""stable"" energy source?

One of the main benefits of coal is that it's very good at producing consistent energy output.  Solar can only be produced during the day and depends on the weather.  Wind is fairly consistent, but still somewhat weather-dependant and storms and high winds can force turbines to park to avoid damage, cutting power.  Hydro is consistent, but the locations hydro can be built are limited.

So I've heard a lot of people say that Nuclear is going to replace coal as the stable, consistent energy supplier with reliability other renewables can't reach.

Only problem I have with this idea is that nuclear fuel is expensive.  With coal, if demand is low because of cheap renewables they can just burn less coal and save on costs.  But nuclear fuel is kind of *always* ""burning"".  Even when the control rods are inserted to reduce power, the fuel rods are being expended at the same rate.  Meaning nuclear becomes *super* expensive to run if it has to compete with cheaper renewables.

Thoughts?"

03/21/2021,stocks,"The counter to your thesis is improving battery technologies. People still find nuclear very distasteful even though it is technically the safest and cleanest.

Improving battery technology especially with electric vehicles will offer storage capability to energy generation. The largest bottleneck being unable to store vast amounts of electricity for use when sun or wind is unavailable. Most of our current electricity is from natural gas and coal plants that generate on the fly.

While I think nuclear does have a future I don't see it in the next 50 or even 100 years. Now if you were able to develop fission technology that would change the entire industry."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Uranium bugs are worse than gold bugs. “Uranium about to ZOOM!” has been a thing since the late 80s. It hasn’t zoomed. There are barely any new plants. Super simple and safe plants are not coming (as they have been just around the corner since the 80s). 

If you want in on a Ponzi scheme because they are fun, get into uranium. But don’t get suckered by the hype. Uranium isn’t going to get big for fundamental reasons."

Seems like a solid company.  It was recently included in TSX Canadian index.   To my understanding is they are not yet live and as someone said,  this will be the biggest boomer hold of your lifetime.   I think there will be a short term pop in near future and the bad boys who are pumping this stock will leave you bagholding.

I have 100 shares for fun and will probably add more.  I plan to hold this for 10 years +.

Im reading a book about it now and its super interesting field.   The media due to last negative events has put a bad reputation to this field.  Bill gates is a big proponent and probably still a viable player in world of energy.   Sorry if Im rambling but these are the points I have collected so far.  I also used to work in nuclear power plant.  They put so much emphasis on safety and it was their number 1 priority."
03/21/2021,stocks,I will jump onto this comment and warn there are a lot of newly created Uranium investing subreddits that are INFESTED with accounts that were created about mid Feb when someone dropped millions in option calls for Dennison. I encourage you to look at the accounts that are posting information it is very very likely that they were just created a month ago. One of the subs recently banned me because I was mentioning this in basically every thread. There is something going on and I just want to warn you not to tryst the hype

Promises of better battery technology are not going to change that fact. Not to mention that this all won't have the slightest effect on the investment thesis, nuclear power demand is growing globally and supply is constrained.

So it looks like a really safe bet to me, but I‘ve still to find out more about the geochemistry. xD 

Ah well, also I can‘t say how the composition looks like... can‘t say if we are screwed if it‘s x percentage base metal y. So uhm, but I‘ve to ask more.  

I don‘t spend too much time on the macro thesis or stock since it‘s only getting better, so I‘m only focusing to pick my big winners. LOL. Ofc there are several factors, not just if there is uranium down there... since success is largely dependent on the management and workers ;p 

I think CanAlaska is the next big winner with its style of investments and strategy. 

Just my opinion. I have no formal education in geology, I have no formal education in the financial sector. In reality, I‘ve found out how clueless I am and complex it is, but well, the halo of alteration is what makes me bet big and many more factors, particularly the strong indicators. 

So to me it‘s far more than a usual exploration lottery, but actually I should ask the CEO what consequences I/we/shareholders have in the worst case scenario of failure. 

So as you can see... I can‘t study 5 years geology in 3 days, lol."

Well, while I‘m very hopeful for them, I‘m not certain about it anymore... since now I do know the difficulties and can imagine them much better (it has to do with the uranium formation, small pods are hard to hit) 

While I do know there is a major uranium deposit waiting for us, I can‘t evaluate the skill, interpretation of the geologists... but they have proved themselves, also they know how to take care of their financials 

Well, the success rate will be substantially higher if they have more chances to drill ;p 

I think the timing of CanAlaska is perfectly fine xD 

Conclusion: Can‘t calculate the odds of success, but there is a deposit waiting for us. 

Edit: So I don‘t agree with 60:40 bc it lacks too many variables, also I don‘t agree with my previous odds I‘ve suggested bc I didn‘t know the real difficulties

edit2: maybe Im wrong again lolz (but well I‘ll now start to evaluate drilling results from the past and hope to find out something)

2021-03-20 22:35:24,stocks,"What do you do with “losers” that have promise. Hi. Bulk of my investments are in boring long-term ETFs. 

I do however play with individual, speculative stocks here and there (in my Roth so no tax implications). 

I have about $20k that I am ok to use on these stock plays. I am up about $5k on these “picks” so far in about 2 months. Some of my stocks did great and I am up way more than $10k on them. But others tanked and I am down about $5k on these “losers”. 

Now the question is - do I hold them or do I sell them?  I know - DD and conviction and ll that... but I did all that and I was wrong on these companies. 

I have one stock, for example, where I was convinced it had promise, did my DD, target price is at $80. Everything looks great. Ton of positive news and strong earnings. I bought it at $38 and it is down about 30% now. 

I put in about $2k in it and I am down $600k so not a tragedy or anything... but what do you guys do in these cases?  Hold because of your conviction and original DD and research?  Or acknowledge that you might have made a mistake?

2021-03-20 22:11:28,stocks,"An argument as to why having a P/E close to 1 right now might not be good for the long run I'm making this post to put forward a possible argument as to why a lower P/E right now may not necessarily mean the long term prospects of that company are good. Right now, we're in the middle of a pandemic. Yes, businesses are starting to open up, but a lot of people have had more cash on hand thanks to being able to work from home. Those who have lost their jobs do not have the cash to buy non-essential goods. If a company is sitting on a low P/E ratio ratio, they're probably profitting big-time off the pandemic. It's only a matter of time before they lose a lot of their revenue. 
Additionally, we're in a new era for the stock market. It's more accessible, arguably now more than ever. People can trade on no/low commissions, margin, and many have found options. This means there's a lot of potential for more cash inflow into the market, especially long term ETFs like QQQ, VOO, and I'm sure ICLN will be one that many throw some cash at with the prospects of a big move to clean energy over the next 10 years. 
When more money is on the stock market, unsurprisingly, stock prices go up, and I find it very hard to believe we'll see low P/E ratios (i.e: under 10) on the majority of popular stocks, and if we do, the market has probably crashed.

2021-03-20 21:58:35,stocks,"Why invest in bonds at all? I got burned years ago with a corporate bond investment.  Why invest in bonds at all?

1) Bonds and *growth* stocks tend to move in tandem.

2) Bonds and *value* stocks are supposed to move in opposite directions.

3) One alternative to bonds in terms of less volatility are dividend ETFs.

4) Another alternative to bonds in terms of less volatility are alternative asset funds, including hedge funds open to retail.  Contrary to what Warren Buffett stated, these funds are *supposed* to underperform index funds.  Their main purpose is to smooth out gains and losses over time, with regular distributions in between."
03/21/2021,stocks,"The biggest role of bonds, besides conservative pension/annuity/life insurance stuff/target year retirement stuff, is to function as a tool in portfolio construction. If you're a high net worth the firm you have your money with will adapt to your risk tolerance - however, how? An active fund manager can't make a new specialized portfolio for every single individual investor, that would be impossible.

So if you have investors with varying degrees of max risk tolerance, you can use the same 'active portfolio' and incorporate different weights in bonds as the risk-free asset to fit all your investors. One guy has 70% in active portfolio and 30% in bonds, another has 85% in active and 15% in bonds etc. So you're focused on the same research and the same companies."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Pension funds have liabilities they have to meet; payments to annuity holders and those fortunate enough to have guaranteed income rights based on, say, final salary. 

While the returns from coupon payments are historically miserly due to rock-bottom (even negative) central bank interest rates, since even higher-yield debt securities issued by corporates whose financials and business prospects present a noteworthy risk of default have been able to snaffle up rates as low as 2-3% on debt issuance they’ve gone to the market for (which, personally, I find troublesome), collective pools like pensions need the regular income from the coupons so they can manage the satisfaction of ongoing obligations they have to pay pensionholders to whom they have such responsibilities. 

Also, if you have a million you need to put somewhere safe-ish, a bank will happily relieve you of it, with a pretty decent chance it won’t fold and you’ll get it back again. But, if you have a billion, or ten, or hundred, banks can’t / won’t help you - no way would they take that kind of money, hold it on their balance sheet, so whatever with it, while offering you the right to have however much income/capital back whenever you might need it. So what do you do with it? Lend it to the governments of the world. Accept the peanuts in compensation you get in coupons (since governments *never* default), and if you need a lump of capital, sell through the capital markets."

If this is something you're going to hold on to for 5 years plus and just leave alone, buy one of the ARK ETF's. An ETF has essentially broken up your investment into a bunch of different stocks already.

Putting all your money into one stock means your money will be more volatile, so your swings up and down will be more intense. That could be a wild wonderful ride or a soulcrushing experience, although less pronounced since the most you can lose is a hundie.

If I were you, I'd pick 2-3 companies, and pick something you're interested in reading about. There's business in everything. If you're actually a butcher, Tyson hasn't come back to its precovid levels. That's a relatively safe 10-15 dollar profit over the course of six months with a company that will outlive all of us. 

Want to be more risky? Check out Lordstown motors. They don't have a product yet, and one of their recent brake tests set the truck on fire! The hedgies are betting against it, but they also bet against Tesla and lost big. Could your entire investment go up in smoke? Absolutely.

Companies that I've bought into, because I like them:

CMG-- seriously I have no idea why Chipotle's numbers/charts have looked so good or why their share price is so high
DE-- Everyone needs to eat, which means farms and farms need equipment so Deere seemed like a safe bet.
THO-- Thor industries makes Airstream and a bunch of RVs, with the trend toward working from home during the pandemic their orders are over a year wait list. Also a fairly local company.
RKT -- Rocket morgage and Quicken loans. Also the only publicly traded arm of Rock ventures, which has been pretty Great for Detroit and Cleveland (making it also semi-local)

Then there are what I consider my ""sin"" stocks...which I think will take off as the pandemic ends.
VICI -- Now owns the property for Cleveland casino & racetrack, Ceasars, and some undeveloped Vegas strip property. The Cleveland property is leased to Jack entertainment (which was part of the aforementioned Rock ventures until late last year)
RICK -- RCI holdings, owns and operates a bunch of strip clubs, night clubs, and a military theme restaurant. One of the few adult oriented companies thats publicly traded. And well I think tits are always a good investment.

then there is a little in some of the meme stocks bought when low, my cellular provider (that I got for free) and some ETFs...

03/21/2021,stocks,"Certificates are ETPs (exchange traded products) that are based on an underlying tool. There are certificates based on gold, silver, Dow Jones... and so on. If the value of the underlying tool rises then the value of the certificate goes up a related amount.

Some brokers offer a Bear/Bull pair of Certificates for the underlying tool. I'm gonna use Nasdaq 100 as an example here. 
If Nasdaq goes on a bull pattern rise and rises by 1%. Then a baseline Nasdaq Bull certificate is going to rise by a similar, but not identical, percentage. The Bear certificate will however drop by a similar amount since it is based on shorts. The certificates are simply put kind of a mirrored pair. So if Nasdaq rises by 1% then the bear certificate will drop about 1% and if Nasdaq drops 1% the bear certificate rises by about 1%.

Never invest in these for more than a day since the direction of bear/bull will ofte swap over night and there's a good chance you'll be stuck with garbage the next morning.

Here comes the fun/ somewhat risky part. Leverage. Some certificates are offered with leverage. This means that the effect of the value fluctuations are amplified by a set amount. If you have a certificate with a x5 leverage level then 1% increase on Nasdaq means 5% increase on the bull certificate. A x20 leverage level yields quite a hefty increase in value here.

So when the markets opens, check which one of the pairs is rising. If Bull x20 is -7% and Bear x20 is +8% then it's time to buy the bear cert.

These will _usually_ grow through out the day and value gains around 20-45% are kind of the norm on a regular day. Don't be greedy and sell after 10-15% increments. 

If none of the certificates are ""trending"" then don't invest. The market is uncertain and there's a similar chance for any of them to go plummeting.

Reinvest every gained cent and you will get a neat percentage on percentage effect. With a steady 10% increament will day after day yield: $100-&gt;$110-&gt;$121-&gt;$133-&gt;$147-&gt;$162...

Anyone who is starting with $100 won’t lose their shirt playing options. That’s just under 14 hours of federal minimum wage. If someone can get approved for margin and level 2 options with $100, that could be considered predatory behavior on behalf of the broker.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah. I analyzed the numbers a while ago. The economics don't really make sense. All of the power is at the studio and theater level. And now several circuits have their own programs from which to compete.

03/21/2021,stocks,Anything is possible.
03/21/2021,stocks,"No. You really have to run the numbers.

Planet Fitness does well on essentially a $10 per month membership with few extras (if any) while 24 hour fitness needs a $30 per month membership to manage their business.

Movie Pass' premise was using the gym membership model for movie tickets. It was a reasonable idea for a b-school entrepreneurship class to test. Lots of people thought the concept had potential in theory. But the average person doesn't understand the theatrical film business; which is critical in understanding how it could potentially work. Netflix was able to utilize the gym membership model for its business. But again, context matters and is required to even begin to atempt what HMNY was claiming that they were trying to achieve."
03/21/2021,stocks,"But gyms are fixed expenses right? Every time someone went to the movie, it cost moviepass. Gyms would be fixed whatever percentage revenue deal they work.  Maybe I’m wrong and didn’t understand moviepass but  i thought it was a free pass to movies and the theatres charge moviepass a lower rate each time you went, but still a cost per visit. Isn’t that it?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"If it were true that gyms are fixed expenses, then Planet Fitness and 24 Hour Fitness could offer their memberships at the same prices and still operate at a profit. 

The biggest difference between gyms and the movie theatres is that there are several intermediaries between them. The film distributor (say Disney) and the theatrical distributor (say AMC). Both parties will influence the economics and have a vested interest. 

During the DVD days, Netflix shifted from a fixed price per DVD unit to a revenue sharing deal with most Studios. This shift to a ""variable pricing structure"" helped Netflix grow quickly while maintaining a reasonable cashflow. The situation was that if Netflix wanted to increase customer satisfaction they would have to increase the number of units available earlier in the window. However, if they did that then their 'profits' would fall and they would have to raise prices. So they decided to keep the copy depth low and just pay full price until the studios relented and gave them rev share deals. So in this instance a variable cost structure where costs increased the number of times a film was rented actually benefited them. When they went to streaming they shifted from a revenue sharing agreement to a fixed fee licensing agreement (similar to what HBO does).

You cannot really understand the economics until you research things at a deeper level and model it out. You have to understand the fundementals within the business and tease out what could and will actually happen. The rules are not the same for all industries and all businesses.

Most people just assume things and paint braid strokes when analyzing businesses. The problem is that they never are the same. They each are different in their own way, so it requires some fundemental analysis (like I did [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m4fb1a/dd_fnko_launching_nfts_in_2021/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share))."
2021-03-20 20:00:48,stocks,"Treasury Bonds, why should we care? I’m going to start with a very brief overview of Bonds and how they in turn affect stocks. Then I will pose some questions for discussion as I do not fully understand how this will affect the market. 

When you buy Bonds you are buying US Government debt. The Yield is how much interest the Bond pays. Yield is determined by supply and demand of the Bonds. When the Pandemic hit people apparently flocked to Bonds because they are a safe investment and this buying drove down the Bond Yield. The Bond Yield causes other interest rates (mortgages, loans, credit cards) to follow its rise or fall. Since the Yield went down so did interest rates, this caused a boom in the stock market (along with stimulus) because business could borrow money for less. 

Currently, Bonds have been selling off which increases the Yield. This increases interest rates making businesses dependent on cheap lending, like Tech, to fall in price. Bonds are selling off because people are expecting inflation to increase with a hotter economy and it doesn’t make sense to have money tied to low yield bonds when inflation is greater than the Bond Yield. 

So now the stock market is going through a period of volatility because of the Bond sell off and uncertainty about inflation. To ease this uncertainty investors have wanted the Fed to announce Yield Curve Control (YCC). Basically, the Fed buys Bonds to keep the Yield at a desired rate. So far it looks like the Fed isn’t worried about the rates right now and want to see more sustainable economic growth before doing anything with rates. 

Questions for discussion:
Why would the markets react poorly to rising Yield? I get that it’s more expensive to finance debt but won’t the Bond sellers most likely move money into the stock market?

The Fed wants inflation, and inflation fears have driven a Bond sell off. If the Fed gets their inflation target and it doesn’t go out of control than shouldn’t markets calm down? I see no reason the Fed would loose control, they have so many more tools than they ever have before. 

If the market is doomed to be stifled because of all this where is a good place to move money? Obviously all stocks won’t suck and many have already started the rotation into value and emerging markets."
03/21/2021,stocks,The question becomes what happens when all the bonds a company issued at 3% now have to be refinanced at 5. Also when interest rates and bonds are extremely low people have to go elsewhere to find the returns they are looking for as 1% risk free just won’t cut it so they go to owning equity. If someone truly fears inflation however one must own equity as cash and bonds will get you behind. All in all theory is great but the two smartest economists could agree on everything except a conclusion. Invest long term in companies you believe in their products and can’t live without and I suspect you’ll do well. People lose a lot of money being right on macro and just missing the timing by a little.
03/21/2021,stocks,"When talking macro, forget about pensions and investors and think only of banks. UST do get some movement from speculators, but first and foremost they are financial instruments used in Eurodollar markets as highly liquid (read: desirable) collateral.

With this in mind, what does a rising yield tell us about these markets? Banks are liquidating their collateral treasuries as debtors are unable to pay their debt obligations. Another way put: they’re unable to procure enough USD. A great example of this is China recently unloading UST, not because they think they are trying to save money in the face of rising yields, but because they need dollars to pay the USD denominated debts.

But wait, this flies right in the face of the inflation narrative: the idea that people are unwilling to purchase UST at low yields because inflation is going to eat up the real yield. How can there be inflation if dollar demand is going up?

I think this is the biggest call you have to make as an investor this decade; are we going to get eaten up by inflation and the elevated PE in the stock market finally gets realized, or are we going to fall into another liquidity trap where interest rates snap back to 0 across the board?

A few questions to ask yourself: Was the recovery from the March crash really that strong? Is QE actually inflationary? We’re the issues that led us to GFC 1&2 ever solved in 2008/2012? Does the Fed *ACTUALLY* have that much control over interest rates at the long end of the curve?"

So negative interest rates will eventually be the norm is my prediction."

it would simply be based on all of the profits they made over that time period on those shares (so if they bought something for $50 now, and sold for $300 a few decades from now, they'd pay tax on $250), and the rate will be determined by how much money they earned in the year that they cashed out (assuming that the tax code doesn't change in the next 40 years, which isn't something that should be taken for granted).

you have lots of politicans that want to ""tax capitals gains as normal income"", which basically doubles the tax someone would pay in most cases in a situation like what you're describing.

03/21/2021,stocks,"let me try to answer in the shortest way possible. 

1. CNBC shills for Citadel and will always make them look good/less evil

2. theory is theres a whale/institution on the long side that pinned the price at $200 since the shorts had a lot on 250c and 300c as well as 200p expiring that week (not sure how they know those belong to the shorts)

3.volume is  a lot lower compared to a month ago,  could be that the dips are being bought and that no one is selling

4. not knowledgeable enough about AMC

5. its the internet, people say and do weird shit

6. Media and hedgies portrayed DFV in a negative way. I would be pissed if they did that to me and I absolutely would try to stick it to them even if I lost millions. DFV from the last ive seen has 11M in cash, 100k shares and and his april way ITM 12c. Either way this it is more than a 100 bagger gain  from a 160k investment, with a potential to be much more.

7. no organic reasons, a long whale/institution is bleeding the shorts of capital

so their attacks would be less effective in the future. if this stock gets past 500 the shorts will be margin called

8. yes its possible retail hold most of the float. Though let me say the shilling,downvoting has increased. Theyre even having people who write DDs suspended. Seems like a desperate move of a cornered animal."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I agree,the logic of “why would a whale sell instead of letting it continue to explode due to options?”. makes zero sense, but typically when stocks are being shorted, it’s done slowly. Maybe the shorts were attempting to scare people by throwing everything they had, but it bouncing right back to $260 doesn’t give credence to that theory, and I doubt retail could pull of a $90 increase within minutes by just buying the dip.. Nobody knows for sure, I just felt the “whale selling and buying back at the dip” theory checked the most boxes. 

Something else to ponder on, would whales even want GME to blow its top? It’s changed the market enough as is, but what would the fallout be if $1k became “not a meme”? Maybe they don’t want to fuck with the system too much considering they can play it like a fiddle as is."

03/21/2021,stocks,"it was mentioned in one of the DD in the /GME subreddit. Surely improbable, but not impossible"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Ryan Cohen founded Chewy with a partner and took on Amazon, PetCo and PetSmart with pet supplies and was able to carve out a big piece of the pie. By 2017 Chewy was taking in 2 billion in revenue and claiming 51% of online pet food sales. Its revenue now sits around 6.5 billion. Collective pet stores in the USA have a market share of 20 or so billion. Cohen started with a blank slate and was able to construct a powerhouse within its industry.

People bullish on GME see Cohen with the nation's largest video game and entertainment software specialty retailer with a ""current"" market cap of 14 billion.
Perhaps he can parley his e-commerce prowess to sell game disks and collectibles instead of tennis balls and leeshes. 

Maybe he's young enough to ""get it"" in regards to gamer sentiment and desires. He will take an outdated brick and mortar retailer and do as he's done before, carve out a big piece of the pie. 

Digital entertainment certainly has a larger market share then pet supplies, video game sales alone are about $60 billion annually in the USA, and GameStop has a global footprint."

03/21/2021,stocks,"I wrote a whole god-damned letter in response to your comment and it didn't post. Oof.

My mom initially wanted to invest only in Treasure Island Casino/Resort because they once had a Cirque du Soleil show she liked, and also Gabriel Iglesias has a show there, and she wanted to specifically invest in Fluffy and the Cirque. Like, for serious, our conversation started with ""You do investing right? Is it possible to just invest in the Fluffy comedian? Or the show he does at the casinos back home?""

I told her to look up ETFs and see what she likes, she came back with BJK - a total international gambling ETF - and CARZ, which is a car ETF.

Her decision was that once COVID ends, people will be tourism-focused, hit Vegas up hard, and rent cars and shit for road trips. Both CARZ and BJK have gone from roughly $20 to $60 per share since last March when COVID restrictions landed, so I think they'll continue to take off towards the moon when restrictions are lifted.

She has like 10 years until official retirement age, so a swingy pair of ETFs like them make sense to her rather than VOO, SPY or FXAIX.

I don't have, or plan to, hold my own positions in CARZ or BJK so her stonks will be just hers, but in my account, whenever she wants to reclaim them - so when I do snapshots of my account we can easily identify what's hers and mine.

03/21/2021,stocks,"I have positions in both companies.  (Shares & calls in AMZN, calls in KO).   

Amazon is definitely going to grow into its PE multiple.  It has never been managed to make profits, but to allocate capital for future growth.  Now that they own whatever business lines they choose to play in, the profits are coming, and will come for the near future at an increasing rate.  As such, it's as good as any to assume it will be a blue chip like KO was well into the future.

KO, however, is still well below its pre-crash high.  They have higher margin in fountain sales than they do in bottled/canned products, which they've been selling in record numbers since the pandemic began.  It hasn't been enough to offset fountain sales, however, and KO has held back future guidance because no one knew when we're going to re-open.

Spoiler alert:  The adult US population is already almost half vaccinated and if you look at places like Vegas and Miami this weekend, we're reopening rapidly, even if some government agencies are slow to call it.  Live events, even in NY and CA, are being scheduled.  KO is going to run back to $60 sooner rather than later.

03/21/2021,stocks,"The majority of carbon emissions comes from electricity generation, next from manufacturing, then from transportation. Automobile use is something like ~20% of the overall total. So to me, the biggest impact would be to convert power grids to non-fossil fuel sources. Wind and solar are great, but very low density. Nuclear can be scaled to replace any given power station.

The odds of a modern plant having a chernobyl-like incident is extraordinarily rare. Fukushima was hit with a massive earthquake and tsunami, had a very low direct death toll and resulted in the evacuation of one town.

The waste from all the plants in the world in the could be placed in one hollowed out mountain in the Nevada desert 100s of miles away from where anyone lives. Or at the bottom of abandoned mines. Or on the moon. The point is, while the waste is dangerous, it is not created in unmanageable quantities.

We need to stop destroying earth's atmosphere asap, and wind/solar aren't going to get us there alone, nor will driving electric cars."

03/21/2021,stocks,"Radiation. Simply put Radiation. 

Still, haven’t addressed where the electricity is going to come from.

All it takes is one plant to fail in spectacular fashion to have nearly the entire population of the US to demand they not be used.

Fukushima happened and Germans demanded their entire nuke industry to shut down. The accident was in an entirely different country."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It can come from anywhere.  It's not like we can't make new power plants.  It can come from nuclear, wind, solar, natural gas.  Lots of options.  Still haven't told anyone why you think depleted uranium is such a hazard.  It isn't only used in weapons, so once again you show your ignorance on the subject by actually calling it a Sabot round.  Sabot rounds can be made of depleted uranium.  Depleted uranium is a material not a bullet.

You said nuclear power wasn't clean and then went on a rant about depleted uranium.  

The USA already has nuclear weapons and it doesn't/didn't come from power plants.  It is very expensive and inefficient to get plutonium from fuel rods in a power plant unless your power plant was specifically designed for it which is the case in NK."
03/21/2021,stocks,"What radiation?  How many people in Japan died from the radiation?  Once again you are ignorant on the topic.  Is Germany's nuclear industry shut down right now?  Nope.  Will it actually shut down on the timeline they put out.  Maybe, but without reliable replacement power they won't be shutting it down.  Interesting that Eastern Europe is going to build new nuclear.  The Middle East is building new nuclear.  The USA is currently building new nuclear and will slowly build more, but not at the same level as other areas."
03/21/2021,stocks,"How many nuke plants have been built in the 35 years? 

Natural gas? Where does it come from?

Ignorance over depleted uranium, it come from centrifuge waste, it’s used in multiple things, but weapons is where most people who understand it, now it is used there. DU is contains 60% more radiation that standard Uranium. It’s a devastating se of nuclear waste. 

Depleted uranium is used in armor piercing rounds 100%. Not all, but a lot of rounds used as 50caliber guns.

I said if you think nuclear is clean, look Into DU, it proves it’s not clean, it proves how nuclear waste can be very dangerous, there is a world of proof that shows how devastating DU can be on a population. Do the research Dr. Doug Rocky had done many studies for the military prior to his death.

The nuclear plants use 20% + centrifuge spun uranium, those same centrifuges can be used for 90% weapons grade uranium.

Your taking to someone who has done a lot of reading on nuclear. What happens to the water that is used to keep the rods clean (correction: cool not clean, autocorrect)? Why, if nuke plants are so “safe” are there alarms? What are those alarms there, because it’s clean? What about emergency shut off, if it was so clean and safe, these things would not be needed. 

You seem to be just picking a fight rather than addressing the mining of nuclear material, or the oil industry that fracks for very large amounts of the LNG needed to operate those LNG plants. 

Solar or wind power will never be able to power this country, so how do you address the extreme costs to produce, or the extreme cut backs as a nation needed to make solar and wind to fill the void? 

I’m very educated on how the electricity is created. So I can do this all day long. 

Uranium is used in nukes, I understand that plutonium is also, but Uranium is used for a lot of nuclear applications."

03/21/2021,stocks,">Do any of you realize Tesla CURRENTLY has a market cap larger than all other car producers in the USA combined?

Three points:

- ""Market Cap"" is a very misleading metric for automakers, who have significant long term debt that reduces market cap. For example Ford's market cap is only $80b - while true Enterprise Value (the value of their business) is $160b. It's not valid to compare Ford market cap to Tesla market cap - Enterprise Value is the right metric.
- Tesla has more than half their sales globally, while Ford/GM are very US focused. I.e. Tesla has a **much** larger Total Addressable Market, and this reflects in their valuation, which is the market's estimate of Tesla's future cash flows.
- The former ""Big Three"" US carmakers botched the EV transition and Tesla dominates ~80% of the US EV market.

They are Blackberry and Nokia, while Tesla is Apple. Surely the growth potential of Tesla - and the lack of growth potential of legacy auto - should be reflected in their valuation? 🤔"

•did you know GM sold more cars to China (a country Tesla is currently not allowed in) in 2020 than they sold domestically? And Ford is not far behind. 

•yes they “screwed up” on EV, but EV’s are not our soul fuel source for the future. Until you can fully charge in 3 minutes and not have a run off of power as your battery gets lower, there will always be another alternative fuels. Take Toyota for example. The worlds largest automaker and pioneer of hybrid tech hasn’t even been concerned with battery tech cuz they are developing hydrogen fuel cells. Which is an electricity generator that can be filled up the exact same way you fill your car using the same fuel station. 

•you wanna compare Tesla to Apple then get to big boys right. GM is Xiaomi, VW is LG, and Toyota is Samsung."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It does matter because her price targets are based on her published cash flow estimations, if they are wrong (which they have been until now) why would you give her the credit? 

If I said: I have a PT of 0 on tesla because the cars are bad, but then a meteor hits all tesla factories and it goes to zero, why would I deserve any credit for my  forecast."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I outperformed ARK last year, any good with a brokerage account should have... but does your 5-year compare to them? Mine sure as hell doesn't. Last year was an anomaly. Track your all time record  against ARK in the same time frame, and show a screenshot proving you beat them over 3-5 years. That would actually mean something."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’d be more like, you say tsla is going to get hit with a giant meteor, and then a few months later everyone agrees with you and sells it down to 0. The factory is still there, just mostly everyone now agrees it’s going to get smashed. 

That’s a much more apt comparison than trying to claim it’s pure luck, because that’s just ignorant honestly. You realize how much money has flown into Tesla right? That’s not luck. It’s not a lucky pump. What happened is big players with money now see what Cathy has been sayin all along and now agree and hold the opinion that it’s going to happen."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I guess we are on the same page, I said that it wasn't a big deal to be 111% over 1 year. Before 2020, I wasn't actively managing my account, just had money in various etfs (Ark K was one of them) and some stocks (DPZ, APPL, AMZN, CMG, AC, F, GE.) Ark is most likely outperforming me, also I just had a rougher month than the one they just had. (Down 25.67%) 

Mostly in unrealized gains but still suck. I used a big portion of my account to buy lucid at 14.90$, which turned out to be a great move until it wasn't haha."

03/21/2021,stocks,No.  Teslas self drive.  All you’re doing is sending a car to an address for pickup and dropping off.  Would Uber have to use the Tesla taxi service?
03/21/2021,stocks,"Good question. I’ve made some complaints above and I wouldn’t consider myself a fanboy, but overall I’m happy with the car and would consider to get another Tesla in the future. 

Ultimately I think like most others, it depends on what else is out there when I’m looking again and the price point. My first choice was actually to get an Audi e-tron but it was a bit more expensive and the financing wasn’t as good. 

Fair points on autonomous. One day I can definitely see it being like in Westworld. But it also seems so far off to me that I question why it’s included in every valuation of Tesla and why people are willing to pay for it now - but as you mention, they have already been good at monetizing it despite the lack of product."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I honestly buy pretty much just shares, I haven't been really great with options so far and it is stressing me way too much  I use maybe 1-4% of my account for options, but it is mostly just a lottery ticket for me.

How can Uber use Tesla's self drive without buying their cars and paying for the FSD package?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Yeah I totally understand. I decided to give this a go full time -wouldnt even consider it if I had a job to pay attention to. Either until I succeed or lose enough that I need money to continue living life. The thing is I was doing about the same passively investing QoQ.

03/21/2021,stocks,"Okay, but then the situation is as I described in my comment above. Tesla would be making massive profits from Uber buying all those cars and paying for the FSD package, while still being able to undercut Uber's prices since they don't need to pay for any of that themselves."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Give it a go if you're ever comfortable with your savings. For me it was just something I've wanted to do for years, and wanted to give it an honest try, so I'm not regretting passing up an opportunity when I'm older. It's literally the dream to be self-sufficient.

The trick now, I believe, will he learning the play both ends in a mostly sideways market. Or things go full bull again and it's easy street. I know what you mean though about elevated heart rate. I made 8k on TSLA calls (almost 3x on purchase price) on the 9th I think it was, only to end up kicking myself in the ass for not closing my position at opening bell bc it was down hill from there with theta gobbling up most of those gains... After years in the market I made a rookie mistake of getting greedy, and losing most of what was my single biggest gain. Lol sometimes we need reminders"

03/21/2021,stocks,"Maybe elaborate on why that is the case before being condescending.

How old are you? Because you apparently haven't learned that just saying something doesn't make it true. Unless you can explain why you think it will happen, no one has any reason to believe you.

inb4 ""Google it bruh""."
03/21/2021,stocks,Lol you will not make 20-30% annually. Apple is still trading super high (it’s a good investment imo) but 8-12% is more realistic even that is being pretty optimistic.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Fair enough don't buy it then? 

Also being realistic and optimistic in the same sentence makes no sense...."
03/21/2021,stocks,You can own a good company like apple(I do) but have a realistic mindset of what it is. Apple is a mature 2 billion dollar company if you think your getting annualized 20% return idk what to tell you 🤷‍♂️.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Good on you for owning it... I dont think anything that is the companies average annual return... 

It is the same with microsoft if you can't read basic charts I don't know what to tell you... 

I can't promise the future will be the same but the data supports what I'm saying...there is no reason to think that is going to change with a stronger moat and brand presents then ever before..."
03/21/2021,stocks,Just look for the dividend etf
03/21/2021,stocks,"how many shares you have is relevant. if you have a multiple of 100, you can sell covered calls and milk some return while you wait.

you can either go with moderately aggressive calls that might hit but will have a high premium, or you can go with way out of the money stuff that won't hit unless the stock absolutely explodes (like when RKT went up 100% in 2-3 days a few weeks ago)

outside of that, selling doesn't have to be an ""all or nothing"" proposition. you can sell half and keep the rest so that way you've locked in some gains, and then wait and see what the other half does. when you're already up 100% this is an easy strategy because selling half covers 100% of your initial investment."
03/21/2021,stocks,"> I have never understood price targets. I also dont understand why you would reduce a winnong position.

remember when nikola was shooting through the roof? just because something is currently a ""winning position"" doesn't mean it will stay that way.

you can find plenty of stocks that hit various highs that they are unlikely to touch anytime soon."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Exactly.. I have no issue with a short report if done well, but Wolfpack’s report was very biased and conveniently left out facts that could easily refute their claims..  As a long term investor of a company, like what TrottingGelato said, I would rather know what a short report has to say and do my research based on the claims - I will either build even more conviction if I disagree with the report, or the report actually does me a favor if it turns out to be right... In this case, the short report actually gave me a chance to buy the dip. It stings to see the price drop though I get it.. I’m personally not affected but I can imagine there r lots of retail investors hurting out there .."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm saying they're not pumping-and-dumpin like most HFs do (in reverse of course for shorting) with their positions. And it make sense, since they have to show profits on a short-term horizon right? That's their business.

So what I'm saying is that's not a long-term horizon ETF does as business, and they're not comparable to that degree either."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Why the second reply. anyhow.

I'm definitely not an arbiter but the shorts aren't serving any public interest as we're being spoon-fed with examples about enron etc. 

They're just predators that smell weakness and attack to destroy companies. But even companies that lack the strongest fundamentals at some point, who's to say they can't turn the ship right if given some time?

Shorts just smell the kill opportunity and go in to destroy and at the same time they hurt the public by fleecing goodwill investors.
It's common knowledge they infiltrate companies not just to get inside information but also sabotage them in order to bring them down.

If you want to benefit the public you have an investigative authority doing real investigative work and if a scam is found they can intervene to protect employees and investors.
Overall this ""benefitting the public"" argument about shorts is BS."
03/21/2021,stocks,OP hasn't indicated the trouble is with the bank.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Because I had my own shares to sell, that's all. A lot of people think of buyers and buying action as the sole force that drives prices up. This is definitely true when buyers absorb all of the limit orders in a short amount of time, but sellers have an equal or maybe even more important role in this. If the highest bid is 50 cents below the lowest offer, but none of the sellers budge on their price, then that is the price. It doesn't take a lot of volume to start a short trend, because sellers start to freak out when they see their offer travel far away from the market price. This domino effect is frustrating to watch when you had a target sale price you wanted to reach. In my case I was selling the stock to completely cover the price of a put option, because it will most likely drop in price next week. It happens every week lol.

It's just unfortunate that a few market orders broke the steady climb that someone looking to sell obviously wants."

03/21/2021,stocks,Because that's literally buying at the top of a crash that happens once every couple years. Buying an index like sp500 to dca is stupid because  if you have 10k and decide to buy only 100 every week then ur just increasing your cost average every week. Dca only makes sense on individual or volatile stocks
03/21/2021,stocks,Yes that is correct. Universal/Commercial banks are the ones lending
03/21/2021,stocks,"I’m saying they’re not lending, which is why we’re not going to have inflation, and GFC#3 in 21/22."
03/21/2021,stocks,That's perfectly normal...since 2020.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Lmao, yeah so stocks have been around for 200 years plus, and now you're trying to tell me this behavior is normal because it's been here for a year? That's like people in the great depression saying their stock market was normal, it's not.   


In 50 years, people will most likely look back on how weird this market state was.   


There's a reason why there's all these articles and press talking about GME or AMC whenever they go through similarly huge booms and falls because it's weird and is also possible now because of internet communication.   


I just really don't get the logic of saying how it's normal when it's objectively not."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Things changed buddy. You can't go by 200 year history. This is the age of retail investors, hyperspeed news and rumors."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I disagree with that, because you're being selectively biased in only focusing on the customers that were already gonna be a gas-powered car, but you're ignoring the customers that were only looking for an electric and would've gone to Tesla instead.   


In 20 or 30 years, at least maybe sooner, EV will be the norm so if they don't switch then they'd be losing market share, but being an early company to switch over (I haven't heard of another car company going electric) they won't just be protecting their market share, it'll probably be growing as they're expanding to a new demographic and are one of the first mainstream Tesla alternatives. It's a really good play and clearly the right choice"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I think you might be misunderstanding my comment. EV and gas powered are part of a larger market of car sales in general. The total number of cars being sold isn't going to increase much even if EV sales increase a ton. Why would everyone start buying tons of extra cars? Tesla doesn't care about ICE sales because they don't sell any. VW sells millions. The market is just shifting from gas to EV.
EDIT- let me put it another way. If next year VW sells zero ICE cars they would need to sell roughly 9 million EVs to stay the same size"
03/21/2021,stocks,Haha yup they do for sure.
03/21/2021,stocks,Thats the idea. Don’t use your customer as a product. Build it on your own time.
03/21/2021,stocks,Oof you don't get it

03/21/2021,stocks,I'm Hapa Chinese...
03/21/2021,stocks,"Doesn’t change the fact the comment is hateful and inappropriate. If a white person or black person makes the same comment and is offensive, the comment is racist no matter what race you are. Also, Chinese people can be racist against other Chinese too; some Chinese-American women “don’t date” Chinese and other Asian American men just because, some HKers feel they are superior to mainland Chinese, some Hapas feel like they are better than because they are half white. You’re entitled to your opinion and free to express it but pls do it without the racist and hateful remarks, bc if you really are Hapa, non-Asian people will see the way you treat your people and feel like it’s okay to do the same."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Well if that the case any rap song using the ""nigga"" in the lyrics is rasict then. Go complain to them."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I am responding to your comment about Louisiana chicken and fried rice on a stocks subreddit. You go complain to black people about their use of the n-word if you want but your comment is racist to and offensive towards Asians regardless. Especially if you’re half Asian, have some self-respect. Also, the comparison doesn’t make sense bc one is a racial slur (n-word:ch*ing-chong) and the other is an racially insensitive and offensive remark (Louisiana chicken and fried rice:watermelon and fried chicken).

Some even kept hitting all time highs during december 2018 while many large caps are dropping close to 20% and this time is probably the worst performing cycle for these massive growth stocks compared to large caps for awhile.

Amazon since mid-February: -6.19%

Netflix since mid-February: -8%

Facebook since mid-February: +7.25% (!!!)

Microsoft since mid-February: -6%

None of these numbers were really that bad either before that 2nd week rally considering how badly the Nasdaq can get beaten before they had recovered some. Which suggests that it is not these names that have been the main contributors, they've been more on the line of role players.

So what has been the biggest contributors to the beatdown that has been served to the Nasdaq-100 as far as I can tell?

Tesla, AMD, ISRG, MRVL, MELI, JD.com, OKTA, PDD, PTON, PYPL, ZM, SNPS, SGEN, SPLK, etc...

If I wanted to pick through it by the way I'm going, I might be able to find 20 Nasdaq-100 names that are in worse shape than most of FAANG+M. Some chip names are fine, and I am pretty sure that FAANG got hit harder than this in the September sell off."

penny stocks ( less than $), I like Endra life sciences, catalyst pharmaceuticals and I’m considering ADX. BDSI looks promising but it has a history of being pumped and dumped.
I hope that helps. I do like square, I think it has a bright future. But I’m not invested in it because I’m not sure if it is overvalued.
But I do think Square will grow as a business."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Not sure which specific stocks you're speaking of, but tech in general has been on an absolute overpriced valuation freight train. This pull back is healthy overall."
03/21/2021,stocks,"That has been my strategy too. I’m about 50% tech and 50% everything else. But the more I see the more pessimistic I get about tech this year. 10-year yield going up with no signs of slowing. Semiconductor shortage plaguing everything. I just look at the 1-year chart of Nasdaq and see “bubble”. Everyone’s convinced that tech can repeat what it did last year. I think that’s a dangerous assumption to make.

Anyway my plan is to slowly trim my tech positions until it’s like 25%, which is probably what it should have been at the start. If I’m wrong I’m wrong, but I don’t think I’m crazy. Am I?"
03/21/2021,stocks,Still a ways to go IMO. But to each their own. If the future was easy to predict we wouldn’t be here spitballing on Reddit. :)

Like in politics, most people barely know their candidate’s policies and instead just vote based on what the news says and what party they’re in. Same with investing. A lot of people just invest in whatever the news says.

I also understand that the numbers discussed could be concerning to the general population. I for one was ignorant to how large of a role Citadel played, and if I was Citadel I would want to limit that exposure. 

Of all the theories that may support a conformation bias, I think the massive price drop on March 10th is the most interesting. I mean, if an individual dumped a massive amount of shares, it would be in their best interest to do so over time to avoid crashing the price. Im guilty of putting on my tin foil hat when I saw the same pattern in other stocks like AMC."

03/21/2021,stocks,"My thoughts as well. I mean they also had almost a month there at $40. Easily could have tracked buy/sell orders especially now that we know they had access to RH data. Could have been as simple as buying a share to cover for every few shares sold. Like you said, they don't need to completely cover all of their shorts."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Rkt is a real good company. Huge in the industry and very profitable. No reason for it to be going so low other than the large amount of shorts. And, yes, there was a tiny short squeeze but the shorts are getting better at protecting due to the GME situation and the squeezers didn't have the same commitment. But it may happen again. The situation is just too ripe for it not to happen."

In your spreadsheet you're including the winners of 1,437...1,343...1,365...1,398% picks over the s&p? Plus all the others very close to 4 digit increases? I'm really not understanding what you're looking at."

The rich get richer during Fed cash influx, and b. subsidies had artificially driven down the standard inflation measures and the ""fat"" was hidden. They showed some p/e ratio averages for index and sectors across multiple years, as well as avg cost of homes, college.  The inflation rate was calculated in the 20% year range for last 10 years.

03/21/2021,stocks,"don't focus on what the company is doing, ask yourself what's likely to happen within the rare earths market over the next several years and how that's going to affect MP"
03/21/2021,stocks,"mining is teh main issue. it wasn't economically feasible in prior years but tons of government and market focus is on rare earths because demand is expected to boom with the green tech revolution. demand is expected to outstrip supply in a few years, and with it the price should go up considerably. 

china could process them at a lower cost because the government had a tough time controlling the mining operations, as many (upwards of 30%) were illegal. and the gov is genuinely trying to stop that because it costs them considerably more to repair the environmental damage than they gain from letting it happen. and they've obtained considerable success in the past few years by consolidating teh industry under gov control. 

for starters, MP is already profitable. MC saw the price surge, invested in a billion+ dollar rare earths facility, then the price dropped and making the facility became economically infeasible. on top of that, the market for rare earths was fundamentally different back then. what propels the industry now is the green and EV boom - neither of which were present back then. Demand for rare earths is expected to outstrip supply in teh coming years - that's how different the market is. 

https://www.adamasintel.com/unfathomable-rare-earth-demand-growth/

don't ask why is this company different; ask how the market is different."
03/21/2021,stocks,value is relative. it's admittedly hard to determine their value right now because there are no comparable companies on the NYSE but I firmly believe it will go up even more by considerable margins because this market is guaranteed to explode. supply is expected to outstrip demand in the coming years. the value of teh global rare earth trade is expected to something like 5x in value by 2030. I bought in at $14 and I'd buy in again at $40. Fuck I'd buy in at $60.
03/21/2021,stocks,this stock as grown so much since I've bought in that it's like 30% of my portfolio. but I have so much confidence in it that I'm not selling.
03/21/2021,stocks,definitely. seems like you're already concentrated too much in EV
03/21/2021,stocks,Well I bought when it was a SPAC and absolutely raked it in.
03/21/2021,stocks,"Just looked into that. interesting. Energy Fuels doesn't produce, but just takes someone else's raw mining product and processes it. and just from their press release they're going to get a minimum of 2500 tons/yr to process. but after reading the press release i don't know that it's as huge as it initially sounds. they're going to receive 2500 tons of someone else's unprocessed mining materials to process themselves, which means that, unless they're going like 100x above that minimum, they aren't going to be producing very much (as processing necessarily entails separating the ore from the other shit). compare that to MP's nearly 40k tons of output in 2020."
03/21/2021,stocks,Doesn't China own a ton of rare earth materials? What prevents them from dumping just like how they dump steel? That would drive down the prices.
03/21/2021,stocks,this SPAC was formed specifically to merge with MP. and it was made clear that they would be merging well in advance of the merger. it wasn't the mystery box that others were.
03/21/2021,stocks,I don't think it'll be a risky play at all. china is actually an importer of rare earths now. they're already outstripping their supply and global demand is expected to skyrocket.
03/21/2021,stocks,"the US isn't a net exporter of rare earth concentrate. we export it because we currently lack the facilities to process it, so we have to send it to china for that. but MP, in going public, gained the funds to make the processing site here and they expect that to be done by 2022, which will just save them even more. that's what I mean by moving downstream.

I've read about USA Rare Earths. And they are only expecting to be able to produce 20% of US demand for permanent magnets. and that's before demand for the magnets skyrockets."
03/21/2021,stocks,"because they need more rare earths than they produce. they're an importer now. rare earths are a very strategic commodity.

03/21/2021,stocks,"So in short, you consider intrinsic value to be the expected discounted cash-flow of holding a stock without selling it. This implies that you believe that the market value of a company is generally completely disconnected from its intrinsic value. It also implies that you reject the idea that DCF models and RIMs would be able to calculate the intrinsic value of a company. 

You are of course free to hold these beliefs. But to me, these things together with calling people who invest in non dividend paying stocks sentimental fools engaging in a pyramid scheme, makes me feel like you’re just proving my points."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I'm saying that the definition of intrinsic value precisely is the DCF of an investment:

> Discounted cash flow (DCF) is a valuation method used to estimate the value of an investment based on its expected future cash flows.

The definition is well agreed upon even though the model used for forecasting future cash flows and the time value of money is subjective. I personally chose to illustrate my point using dividends over free cash flow because I feel that it is a bit more tangible since company owners are concrete and a corporation is more abstract, but the two are one and the same so you can choose either.

I don't think there's anything wrong with investing in non-dividend paying stocks as long as the company has some path to rewarding its owners in the future.

I don't agree that the market value is always going to track the intrinsic value though. If it weren't possible for stocks to be overvalued or undervalued, then long-short hedge funds wouldn't be able to convince clients to invest money in them (though I personally don't believe that hedge funds actually have enough alpha to warrant the assets they manage)."
03/21/2021,stocks,"I agree that you as an investor can see a DDM as a kind of crude DCF for yourself. But we are talking about measuring the intrinsic value of a stock, then DDM and DCF are not the same thing. When you say only the dividend can decide the intrinsic value of a stock, you are by definition saying DCF cannot except in specific circumstances or using very strong assumptions. 

Which definition is well agreed upon? Because based on what you’re saying, not even you fully agree with your previous definition of intrinsic value. 

You said only the dividend decides the intrinsic value of a stock and that non dividend paying stocks lack intrinsic value. Now you’re saying that a DCF analysis is the same thing and that you can choose either. These two statements are mutually exclusive. A company distributing all of its free cash in dividends vs accumulating everything will have the same intrinsic value according to the DCF in both cases, but based on the dividends it will be worthless in one of the cases according to your initial statements. So how is it the same?

I still fail to see how anything you have written would be anything other than a confirmation of there being several different ways to calculate the intrinsic value and that a single definition is either too fluffy or too limiting to be used to avoid pedantic discussions about the definition of intrinsic value of a stock."

03/21/2021,stocks,Yeah well it’s the shortest it’s ever been in history buddy.... watch. Doesn’t mean it doubles but it can still “squeeze”
03/21/2021,stocks,"There's 3 simple facts that you're missing:

1. Rising inflation
2. Rising yields
3. SLR

All 3 of these work against the price of bonds, they're three fundamental facts unless addressed by macroeconomics, will keep driving the price of mature bonds like TLT.

Before you say jpow will fix all that, he simply does not care he has said.

1. He wants inflation to be at least 2% and he doesn't care too much in the short term if it runs hotter

2. He thinks rising yields are proof that the economy is healthy (and he is correct) so he is not going to use yield curve control to bring the yields in line 

3. You've chosen to ignore this in light of 1 and 2 but that's your choice, but the fact is banks don't want to bag hold bonds that will lose them money in an inflationary environment"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Hi, I am confused, but let me see if I understand this the correctly.

SLR end in March 31, no extension. Bank are also (in addition to any other treasury bond holders) selling treasury bonds, so this lead to the increase in 10 year yield. The increase in yield is because due to the large selling pressure, treasury bond are being sold at a lower price, and therefore the yield seemed higher.

Banks are selling treasures bond because they need cash, to back up the incoming 1400 dollars, banks expect most people to cash it, and pay bill or use on stuff. Also, with the removal of SLR, bank need more cash-on-hand from Mar 31 onward?"
03/21/2021,stocks,"The bond has a face value, it's not like a stock, squeezing would mean yields and inflation will go back to zero, good luck"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Close. Banks need to hold a certain amount of what is considered *capital* (cash from investors, cash reserves, etc) relative to *assets* that they hold (customer deposits, corporate bonds, treasuries) because of banking regulations (SLR). For the last year, treasuries and customer deposits have been exempted from this regulation. In addition, during unstable times or financial crashes, banks will generally try to buy as many treasuries as possible as they have no risk of default, as opposed to a corporate bond or a personal loan. Likely, this is what happened last year.

Now that the SLR exemption is expiring and customers are getting a huge wave of deposits, these have to be taken in consideration to make sure the banks are complying with regulation. Which means they can only have so many holdings in treasuries and customer deposits relative to the capital they have. Likely, they are dumping treasuries to come into compliance with these regulations. Of course, I can't be 100% sure this is what is happening but it seems the most likely explanation.

Will they continue to dump now that SLR has officially expired? It's possible, but its also possible they already knew this would happen and have dumped all the treasuries they needed to. I have a small put on TLT at this point but I'm not confident enough in what's going to happen to YOLO on this one."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Did they do it again?  I think I got another one.  S-P-A-C's are a method for going public.  How stupid we can't discuss them.  That's like telling people they can't talk about Apple 30-40 years ago because it was speculative.   Or Tsla or Cisco or an airline.  These are businesses and they aren't that speculative.  The one I said I bought when I listed out IPO's I bought was C-C-I V.  Another I have is C-i-i-c and it's going public this coming week - it's the electric bus company Arrival. Cool story.  I love the business model especially if you consider them working in emerging markets.  It will change their way of life as well as their standard of living.  Just like transportation has done for centuries.  Read the book Factfulness.  It zero's in on a few things and transportation is one of them.  Going from foot to bike to scooter to mass transit to car ownership.  That's what differentiates standard of living, how we get around and how quickly coupled with distance to work."
03/21/2021,stocks,Um... no. Bonds go above and below par value just like anything else you can trade.
03/21/2021,stocks,"I won't yolo on tlt. I am trying to understand the bigger picture. Personally I don't get involved with bonds, because I lack any indept understanding. I am slowly learning about bonds.

These companies skyrocketed after investors moved out of standard value/commodities/whatever when Covid struck, and plowed into tech/green energy. You're ignoring that, and i dont know why. I work in the energy industry, hydrogen didn't  undergo some fundamental change last March. eCommerce is at least massively profitable.

03/21/2021,stocks,"It usually trades at ~$350 a share though. It's a steal at the current price. I've had success with short-term calls. It's on the Nasdaq for some reason, so I took a beating last week, but the company has great fundamentals overall. Definitely a stock I would hold for 5 yrs if it wasn't so damn expensive."
03/21/2021,stocks,"Wow! Excellent! I also suffered from sudden hearing loss and now suffer from Tinnitus and Hyperacusis.  We are probably acquainted with one another in one of the Facebook forums for our condition!  Anyhow, thank you my Hyperacusis & Tinnitus (H&T) brother or sister.  In fact, i just heard about this company for the first time from someone on that forum.  I need to closely follow this for both physical and financial reasons!"
03/21/2021,stocks,"I really try to tell my self this shit makes me stronger. I do think my tolerance for bullshit it higher now.

Whenever my coworkers ask me why I don’t get frustrated in the kitchen, I tell them I just think about my t and h and it puts everything in perspective and I calm down realizing there’s worse things to life than a late ticket lol"
03/21/2021,stocks,"Weird analysis. I don’t have any interests in any EV stocks, but I will tell you if I ever buy an EV it isn’t going to be a Chevy. That is just not cool."
03/21/2021,stocks,Not sure where I read that. It was a statement from Chen.
03/21/2021,stocks,Uber is on a good path to be profitable this year and is definitely a buy and hold.
03/21/2021,stocks,That is what I was thinking. Surprise by all the negative  towards the stock
03/21/2021,stocks,"There is a lot of bias against uber because of the company image in the US as is not so good, so you take that and also add that the company is still not profitable and you will have people turning against the stock as you see here...but they forget that uber is in 70 countries and they own those markets shares and is a loved brand across the globe. Besides that people here forget that even though they sold they autonomous car unit they will have all the autonomous cars using their marketplace...tesla doesn’t have a marketplace and you don’t create one that easily...so they will have to join Uber. So uber is the amazon of transportation. Also im not event talking about Uber Eats which is already the biggest global player and Cornershop acquisition that is bringing groceries on a global scale. Im very comfortable on keeping this stock for the next 10 years."
03/21/2021,stocks,"It’s way more difficult to do then just throwing money at. Europe’s attempt will most certainly fail
with 99% certainty. The EU can’t agree on practically anything much less building a semiconductor fabrication industry from scratch. Also TSMC is investing massive amounts of capital in U.S production which I see as acceptable to the U.S gov in terms of short my up it’s security and supply base."
03/21/2021,stocks,Did you get a refund?
03/21/2021,stocks,"No. They claim it's been more than 30 days even though I contacted them numerous times about it not being delivered and got the same canned response about slower than normal delivery times.

Only a couple of dollars - wouldn't spend any real money there. Much better merchandise and fraud protection on eBay."
03/21/2021,stocks,Hahaha    I can never get to the article    Just the come on
