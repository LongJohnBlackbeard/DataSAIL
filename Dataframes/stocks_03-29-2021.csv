03/29/2021,stocks,"$BA has been a really popular one but I like $SPR. Makes parts for Boeing and airbus, I think there is a ton of upside left even after a recent move."
03/29/2021,stocks,ABNB
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think the exact opposite, I think residential real estate is where it’s at - not retail. Apartments, storage, rv parks and mobile homes..

However since you asked about recovery stocks, I like WGO (Winnebago), the industry is booming and their balance sheet looks good. They have good products with a low valuation."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I rode RUTH (steakhouse), PK (luxury hotel REIT), and MAC (mall REIT) from July 2020 into January 2021.

At this point, I still like ATRO (small cap airplane tech company) and WFC."
03/29/2021,stocks,I like SABR. Airline booking.
03/29/2021,stocks,"COTY.  People gotta look good when going out.  Plus, they ditched their bad assets and have a stake in the Kardashian line."
03/29/2021,stocks,Love these small niches that get overlooked
03/29/2021,stocks,Tempting but I find it fraught with risk. Far from tried and tested and lots of potential pitfalls. I would say high risk but high reward
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’ve heard a bunch about Winnebago. It’s not personally in my radar but interesting to hear you mention it. I do have a bunch of friends with campers and I see that as a social distance vacation outlet.

I respect your opinion about residential real estate but I see that as having greater risk. To me a real estate owner like SPG with excellent properties and a balance sheet to continuously develop and maintain them feels much safer"
03/29/2021,stocks,"MAC is interesting to me. Said this before in another comment but WFC would not be my pick of banks, personally"
03/29/2021,stocks,I am all in it. I am not sure what you are referring to but the potential is huge and brand is well known.
03/29/2021,stocks,You measure by how close it came to expectations.  That is why it doesn't matter as much how much EPS goes up or down as much as whether it beat the estimate.  A lot of people will say look ABC is doing well the stock should be doing well but if the stock already went up 3 months ago it is likely priced in.  Usually the only time things are not priced in is when some unlikely event happens that wasn't expected.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well, a fairly basic way:
- DCF1 based on previously available info
- DCF2 based on the new info available
- Subtract, and here you go"
03/29/2021,stocks,"In general you can't measure it because normally a stock doesn't trade with perfect correlation to some variable with a known outcome. There are cases though where the outcome is pretty binary, like an acquisition at a specified price with some probability of completion, where you can use option prices to back out the market's estimation of the probability that the deal will be completed at a certain price where the option will end up in the money."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Humans,  they really are unpredictable.   In your example,  before the final earnings announcement,  it could be trading at $14 because of the uncertainty,  like you said,  or it could be trading at $16 because people like the company and may believe they were sand bagging expectations and were going to announce improvements by 60%.  

In reality,  as it gets closer to the announcement,  it should trade very near $15.  Why, well,  one answer is that the uncertainty discount and hope/hype will cancel each other out.  Another big reason is that there are professional traders whose job is to know.   I'll bet you're good at your job,  if your full time job was to analyze this particular company, you'd know.  They look at things like how many trucks full of materials to build the stuff arrived and calculate how much production from that,  or perhaps how many hours the management car spends in the lot (normal hours means things are going well).  These are the people who use satellite images to look at how many open parking spaces there are to get an idea of the change in same stone sales so important to retail metrics.   

Yes, most things are fully priced in as you get closer to the announcement day.  Some things can't be,  are the regulators going to allow KSC and CP merger?  Humans,  who knows."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Unfortunately,  most year over year metrics are garbage right now because of the pandemic.   I have to keep reminding myself to compare everything to 2019 and pay attention to market cap,  since a lot of companies sold stock (I believe VIAC did, so don't just look at price).  

Does it have a reason to be more than say 7% higher than 2019 market cap?   Did they make more subscriptions,  or raise prices to make more per subscriptions?   Ignore the price,  is it making five times as much EPS than in 2019? If not,  sell and buy back when it's on sale from its actual value."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I just opened a position in viacom, my research tells me that it is on sale. I plan to hold for months, maybe others will join the party.

Of course, i only invest in stocks that go down"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Selling is up to you.

Holding is up to you.

My opinion is that it still has legs."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There's some specific weirdness going on with Viacom in the recent week--a big hedge fund\* made some giant risky bets, lost on them, and as a result was forced to sell a huge amount of Viacom stock. I know the drop from $100 to $45 looks scary, but it does not at all herald Viacom dropping further. It's also not something you could have anticipated happening.

Unless your aunt needs the money right now, I would hold. The price might not recover to $100, but it should go up from here in the long run.  


\*technically not a hedge fund but in effect it was. Look up Archegos Capital for more info."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not advice. Just what I would do.

Depends on what you bought VIAC at and your current situation. If you need the money, and you bought in at a much lower price than the current one, selling would be ok. 

If you bought higher than the current price or you're not hurting for money,  leave it."
03/29/2021,stocks,You could just size your shares down and see where it goes.  Definitely not advice.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why would you do that?   There are charities that actually help needy people,  and hedge funds selling you junk aren't nice people and definitely aren't needy."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m with you on that. Slowly buying in in case it keeps dipping. But if it goes back around the 30’s that will be a huge value play. 

Just don’t understand why people are gobbling up options at 102% IV."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Except for tax implications, I disagree. I see this thinking too often and at the end of the day you have X dollars in Viacom and your question should be will Viacom appreciate more than another investment you could move to. Opportunity cost is real"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I see your point, but I can't bear to sell at a loss, even if I could write some of it off."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes, price and iv are basically synonymous in option pricing (sometimes iv is quoted instead of the dollar price for convenience). Plug in the market price into the option pricing formula and you can solve for iv."
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks What are the reasons iv spikes like this?
03/29/2021,stocks,"this comment is completely wrong, theyre up because theyre illiquid and the width is wide 

if you actually tried to sell any of these calls, their value would've gone down compared to yesterday"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Even if what you said about liquidity is correct, my comment is still correct, both in this case and in general."
03/29/2021,stocks,That makes sense thanks
03/29/2021,stocks,WM
03/29/2021,stocks,CRSR
03/29/2021,stocks,CWSFF. I like this one I like what they are doing and their business model but I don’t know how high their ceiling is. They repurpose waste into renewable energy.
03/29/2021,stocks,Tgt
03/29/2021,stocks,Howmet aerospace and asimilar group
03/29/2021,stocks,"MURGY, LAND, and MO"
03/29/2021,stocks,Panasonic and Toyota. Research everything and come back with thoughts.
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm a fan of the electric SUV company Fisker (FSR). Someone on here mentioned back in February and I bought a few shares. Did a little research and it looks like they could takeoff next year. It's no guarantee and I'm also a new investor in the market
03/29/2021,stocks,SNDR

03/29/2021,stocks,Inverse ETFs. Market is crashing.

03/29/2021,stocks,BIGG
03/29/2021,stocks,Literally 1% down from all time highs...
03/29/2021,stocks,I though the crash was only in my pf
03/29/2021,stocks,MMs shaking out paper hands for the April upswing
03/29/2021,stocks,It will happen in 30 days or I’ll drink another beer!
03/29/2021,stocks,"absolutely bullish on SQ. Read some german analysts I trust predicting it may be the next tesla regarding growth in the next year, 200$ seems to be a great support, I see only uptrend from here."
03/29/2021,stocks,What are your thoughts on UUUU?
03/29/2021,stocks,"You'll find Value at Risk and diversification in the market risk section of the MD&A. As for the bank's own investment portfolio - that would be for the purpose of things like liquidity and structural interest rate risk management, so the alpha should be zero, no? I would have thought that generating alpha from an investment portfolio would attract unwanted regulatory scrutiny, since that isn't their purpose."
03/29/2021,stocks,This is by far the most obnoxious holding in my portfolio. Literally ANY sign of life would be a win.
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm in the same boat as you.  I was never a fan of PLUG but had exposure to it via ICLN.  I hope the rebalancing helps the ETF out a little bit.
03/29/2021,stocks,"ICLN seems to be a case of buy on the rumor,sell on the news. Huge run up with Biden becoming president...quite disappointing ever since."
03/29/2021,stocks,Stop the bleeding already.  Hoping the Biden’s infra play breaths some life into this dead cat.
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm looking forward to them doing anything with this damn thing
03/29/2021,stocks,Yes I am looking forward to not being deep in the red on this one.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’ve been pretty disappointed in ICLN - I’d like to see more diversity, which will hopefully lead to more growth in the ETF. It’s still a long-term hold for me, but I’m hoping for better performance than I have seen."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know I will get downvoted to oblivion and I know things change in the market, but... isn't it ironic how this subreddit was legit worshiping ICLN just a few months ago for the whole year and now everyone is depressed because of it?
Good luck to holders, wishing the best, I just initially find this to be a bit ironic 🤷‍♂️"
03/29/2021,stocks,Can only imagine this will mean good things for the ETF as a whole. I’ve been averaging down a little bit over the last couple weeks as well and hoping it pays off in the end.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Would it be better to rebalance after the red downturn is over? 
I don't really know but I think rebalancing when plug is (probably) around its lowest is like ""selling at a loss"". Hopefully there's a little rebound before the rebalance."
03/29/2021,stocks,I’ve been in the negative with ICLN for 4 months
03/29/2021,stocks,When are they rebalancing?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Don’t worry Clark. That’s exactly what this post is explaining, they are diversifying soon"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Same for ARK funds. If you go back and read old posts, there were people commenting stuff like ""Can't go wrong with ARK""."
03/29/2021,stocks,What is ironic about it? Everyone liked when it went up and is sad when it went down. That's not irony.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I believe it was half because of people pumping it up since it got hyped along with the election. Voting Dem was good news for clean energy which hyped up stocks/ETFs like ICLN. Now that the election magic has calmed down, so has some of these hyped sectors. Also a lot of the market has been red. I still believe in ICLN and other clean energy/green stocks long term"
03/29/2021,stocks,I held plug since 4 and icln since about 12 but I sold them about 2 months ago. Unfortunately I bought arkk and arkg with the money.
03/29/2021,stocks,Its been in the negative since 2009.
03/29/2021,stocks,April
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol
03/29/2021,stocks,It's been negative since it's creation in 2008. Opened at $52.75
03/29/2021,stocks,Their ipo lockup period also expires on 3/31 so insiders can take profit if they want
03/29/2021,stocks,I’ve posted about it in my history but the straight answer is that they are not efficient with their revenue and logistics and they truly deserve to be shorted.
03/29/2021,stocks,Not efficient with their revenue? Their quarterly revenue is more than half of their market cap. That’s hard to find in this market.
03/29/2021,stocks,I’d expect it to take several business days.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Once the transfer is initiated, it usually takes about 5 business days."
03/29/2021,stocks,I did a transfer from RH to fidelity and it took 5 days. All my RH assets were locked for the duration.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just curious, I have both and feel like td has much better interface, usability, tools etc. fidelity feels like it’s in the dinosaur ages. Why are you switching?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Went from td to fidelity very recently. Took 5 days for positions to move over and another 3 or 4 days before cost basis did. You can check status on fidelity. Tge process closes your td account so you can't check there.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I started one* on fidelity’s site they had it done in 3 days

Edit: typo"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It took 4 business days for me to do a partial transfer (full shouldn't take any longer).

What takes long is the margin approval process.  It's 2 weeks."
03/29/2021,stocks,I feel more secure with Fidelity (in the case of a sort squeeze with GME) along with their limiting and restricting with certain call options and acquiring stocks during certain periods. I’ll miss TD’s TOS but it’s something I can live without and deal with tbh
03/29/2021,stocks,How long ago did you do the transfer?
03/29/2021,stocks,"I did my transfer a long time ago, start of February as another said it took another week or so for cost basis to update .  also came with the 75$ transfer fee 🤬"
03/29/2021,stocks,"What broker did you transfer from, Robinhood? And why does the cost basis take longer?"
03/29/2021,stocks,I also believe users of RH experience longer transfer times compared to others because of their shenanigans
03/29/2021,stocks,etrade->FideIity  and I think it’s just data entry lag but could be something more to it
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel for anyone that had/has a Robinhood account cause their fuckery is really grounds for massive lawsuits, hopefully they get shut down soon smh"
03/29/2021,stocks,"seems kind of dumb to pay the trading fee for every time a day is red. seems smarter to observe the market, try (!) to anticipate the lowest point of the stock and buy the dip and more than just one or a few then. with all the red weeks we had I would always prefer to have bought the dip 5 times paying fees 5 times instead of having to do 30 trades on every stock (6 times more fees)."
03/29/2021,stocks,Fees? What fees? And im a genuine believe of time in the market beats timing the market. But if you can do it more power to you.
03/29/2021,stocks,"with my broker I pay 1€ trading fee for every trade I do, which is not much at all I know, but its money still, and when it comes to money I believe in accumulating as much of it for yourself, your family, friends and people who have less but sure as hell not for my broker."
03/29/2021,stocks,Got you! Well I do most of my trading with Ameritrade. No upfront fees
03/29/2021,stocks,"Depends on the broker, Wealthsimple is 100% free for Canadian stocks, Questrade is free until you sell (on ETFs) etc.

So there isn't really a good argument to make that it's too much from fees to DCA."
03/29/2021,stocks,"yeah Im sorry, I was referring to my personal situation too much I guess. With my broker (trade republic) I do pay fees and I think for me it makes more sense to buy packs of shares, not single ones or a few."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Wait, wait, wait, wait just a minute! Are you telling me you can bet on WWE wrestling?!"
03/29/2021,stocks,This is the kind of daily after market post we need instead of some typical faux guru inspirational bullshit. Thank you!
03/29/2021,stocks,Nice write up thanks op
03/29/2021,stocks,Good job on the recap especially highlights!!
03/29/2021,stocks,Wonder why GS is long on PENN? Market clearly wasn't a fan today
03/29/2021,stocks,Awesome recap. Thank you
03/29/2021,stocks,PENN target of $156? The stock was $4 a year ago. Really?
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah hahaha WWE is a publicly traded company
03/29/2021,stocks,Appreciate you saying that! Im really glad you enjoyed the recap
03/29/2021,stocks,Thank you! Glad you enjoyed it!
03/29/2021,stocks,Agreed. Did a really great job. Nice not to have posts entirely dedicated to one stock like another reddit community.
03/29/2021,stocks,Thank you! I'm really glad you enjoyed the recap
03/29/2021,stocks,Price target raises by analysts usually imply a 12-month window for the stock to reach that price
03/29/2021,stocks,Thank you!
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that is what analysts at Goldman Sachs think, stock really has been on a crazy run"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Wasn't the stock also recently at 150? lol

Penn/Barstool is definitely big with the young sports crowd I know"
03/29/2021,stocks,Casinos are really busy now.
03/29/2021,stocks,"No I meant you can gamble on WWE wrestling on Draftkings now? But I'm actually surprised WWE is a publicly traded company. 

So I've had my head under a rock. Or should I say"" UNDERTAKER, The Rock.""  Haha. OK ill see myself out."
03/29/2021,stocks,Thank you! Very happy to hear you enjoyed the recap
03/29/2021,stocks,Agreed!
03/29/2021,stocks,"Definitely, stock has a lot of momentum with retail traders, Dave Portnoy is a huge influence in that regard"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Oh hahaha my bad I misunderstood you. From what I see the deal gives DKNG an exclusive licensing agreement to use the WWE trademarks in their products, particularly in free-to-play pool products like fantasy leagues and the like."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yea, but that basically means people can gamble on WWE right?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"They allow you to enter a free pool where you can win money, but you can’t bet on matches. They give you like 10 questions about 3 matches. Like who will win? Will there be interference? 

I think the last PPV I got 9/10 correct and won 80 cents."
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm not exactly sure people will be able to bet on the winner of a match (given they are fixed) but it is a big deal that DKNG has exclusive licensing agreements to make products using WWE's trademarks and wrestlers and the like
03/29/2021,stocks,"Def quarterly. If you don’t want to follow individual companies, buy indexes. There’s nothing wrong with buying an index, I have really slimmed down my individual picks into a few high conviction positions that I follow closely."
03/29/2021,stocks,I would suggest to remove Price and Book value since it is no longer relevant.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Quarterly in order to check the seasonality of the sales, if there is some, as well :)"
03/29/2021,stocks,"thx for reply:)

it is not the matter if i don't want to follow the individual companies it is what is recommended

if it is Quarterly than i will do it :)"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why is thath? How do find undervalued stocks without it 

Is the P/E ratio enough?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah definitely want to keep a close eye so you can notice if anything in your underlying thesis has changed.
03/29/2021,stocks," [Warren Buffett Explains Why Book Value Is No Longer Relevant (yahoo.com)](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/warren-buffett-explains-why-book-161449202.html) 

Look at the basic average shares they have to be in decreasing order year over year.

Avoid dividend stocks and anything related to dividend growth. Dividends are taxed therefore it shows that the management is not efficient with business. Look for companies who are doing stock buybacks."
03/29/2021,stocks,"ok thx for reply  


now i need to find a good template to make a good excel spreadsheet :p"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thx for the info

In my country I can earn 800 euro tax free dividend 
I always thought dividend where a good thing"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, listen to quarterly calls and write some notes in a journal too, this will help you see the change overtime in your decisions, alongside the numbers of course."
03/29/2021,stocks,"No, no the companies have to pay taxes on dividends. Once the company pays them to the shareholders they are taxed, second tax is when you are paying ""income tax"" on dividends as you stated over 800€."
03/29/2021,stocks,do you know a good place to find a good template?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Make your own tbh, nothing complex, just the things that are important to why you bought the company, no need to track everything."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Inside the industry that creates the most profit for these companies, a sea  change is happening to AMD that will probably only accelerate over the next two years.  That's entirely because the total cost of ownership on the price/performance curve right now is hugely in AMD's favor.

No one wants these super power hungry Intel parts for large buildouts."
03/29/2021,stocks,One day in this sub INTC is buy the other day its AMD.
03/29/2021,stocks,"AMD is a superior product performance for price.

INTC probably right now is better value.

Both have very good growth potential.

Most likely INTC will benefit off the shortage. The two new plants in AZ means less dependency on China and the chance for more government/big business contracts. However, it's not like AMD will stop producing, so they are both likely to benefit.

I don't know how you can be bearish on either of these companies. 

Buy both + toss in some NVIDIA. Call it a day."
03/29/2021,stocks,"INTC has the momentum back. They’re a value play and value is in vogue right now, they announced a 20b investment in new plants and capacity - and that they would begin wholesaling. 

I think INTC can double"
03/29/2021,stocks,I bought like 6 shares of intel recently. Lots of good reasons to.
03/29/2021,stocks,INTC for the win     I hope. Since they are building two new plants in AZ. 🙏🏼
03/29/2021,stocks,Smh etf
03/29/2021,stocks,"Intel got more cash, more market share, more cash flows, better profitability, better interest coverage and a lower wacc. I’m confident that Intel is going to be doing everything better than AMD in 5 years. 

I got 16% in Intel. I think my cost basis is 46-47 I see them going to 150-200 over the next 10 years +-50 on each side. Including the dividends  (reinvented)"
03/29/2021,stocks,I love INTC more and think its better but this sub disagrees with me lol
03/29/2021,stocks,I agree AMDs product is better but does that translate into better bottom line? I agree both are good and will probably get a little of each and a few MU just for good measure.
03/29/2021,stocks,I saw the new plants. But how lung until they are up and running enough to turn a profit and make 20b a worthy investment? I'm not bearish I just like playing devils advocate.
03/29/2021,stocks,So then where do you see AMD?
03/29/2021,stocks,I agree but also think AMD has such a good moat with the intellectual property that they will also do well.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I mean, go look at AMD five years ago."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They’re at a PE of 13, compared to a PE of 37 for AMD. They spelled out a growth strategy from here. They’re already trading at a discount without their new revenue, growth. To directly answer your question, they’re planning to be a player in the 100B foundry business by 2025."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel like I've seen a ""Don't worry about red days...put down your phone and take a walk"" post nearly every day now the past few months."
03/29/2021,stocks,Red days are fine it’s been like 6 weeks almost straight red tho ... phew
03/29/2021,stocks,">	My advice is this: during red periods take a look at your investments and see if anything about the company has changed since you started investing. If there is no significant change why would you sell now?

The problem with this is that lots of stocks will rally with no change in fundamentals also."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Several of my individual picks are affected the last 1-2 months, still positive since I mostly got into them last year, but I am fairly undeterred by the current downturn. 

80% of my portfolio is in a global ETF, therefore 20% of play money into some individual stocks made it easier to hold through knowing that my portfolio is in good hands of Vanguard.

I think it takes a lot of courage and honesty to know that most people (me) cannot beat the market’s average return when you compare it to a long period. It’s not just because our DD is flawed, it’s because in downturns like this, many would choose to sell instead of holding their picks. I like individual stock picking, but if you know your limits, I think putting most of your money into index funds is still the way to go. At least for me, I know I can’t beat the market."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Part of the problem is the way brokers display the data. Your daily gain or loss is usually front and center in a big green or red number.  For most people the daily fluctuations literally don't matter at all. If I were cynical I would say apps focusing on daily swings is a strategy to increase user engagement. 

A better way is to just look at overall gain or loss on a position. Yesterday my gain was 50%, but today I'm only up 48% - keeps things in perspective."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I totally agree, you are always better off being a long term investor than trying to day trade and chase the next win.  You might get lucky, but most of the time you will be the late one to the party.  

Better off find some good solid stocks, or even dividend paying ones and invest for the long haul.   Always a good bet as they tend to withstand the market turbulence."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Great advice, it’s probably better/healthier not to check stock price everyday. If you don’t want to miss out, set a limit sell with your target price.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Which is why you should always be cautious even in a bull-run period. If you feel uneasy with the amount a stock has gained theres no shame in cashing out or what I consider as a really good alternative, setting trailing stoplosses so you still have a large part of the current gain and potential for more if the rally continues."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Upvote for being the most sensible person on this thread. 

What is it like 87% of traders don’t beat the market? Literally 99/100 people on this sub would be better off throwing money into 2-3 etfs every month and letting it be because they know waaaay less about investing than they think they do. Instead, I have to read about how all these whiny babies are 20% down YTD even though the S&P is up."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You may not be able to beat the market easily, but you can beat the potential downside pretty easily.  When the S+P 500 is trading at nearly an ATH Shiller P/E ratio, I think it's OK to opt for a more defensive play with individual stocks."

03/29/2021,stocks,I don't see how you could even want to think of that as a possible scenario. It would mean that all the current NASDAQ companies failed in their strive of success through innovation and no other better companies would've overtaken them in doing exactly what they strived for. As for me I'd like to be somewhat optimistic for the future.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well, specifically im down about 3.5 percent on my tech portfolio which consists of a lot of biotech companies and holds quite somewhat speculative stocks such as $bfly, $kbnt & $rkt.

It's just that if you have been lurking on the daily discussions and have been taking a look at alot of the recent posts it's been people panicking because we are seeing a lot of red days. I know a lot of you are more experienced investors, but there is also a lot of new investors who started investing at current ATHs who haven't been following the stock market for that long.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Alright, I think I can respond to this in twofold:

First: in this case tech stocks are all taking a harder hit than the rest of the market so its not isolated to a single company or stock. Im talking about what we are seeing right now which is a big downturn in a lot of companies. Theres always the option to set stoplosses as well to mitigate losses to avoid this I guess.

Second: in the case of feeling uneasy with gains on a stock. I meant it as it significantly beating the market on no news, or maybe just what was the case with a lot of tech stocks lately (Fubotv, stratasys etc). If you feel like this is a temporary upswing in price selling might be good idea. If you however see the downturn as a temporary downturn and you think it will recover, why sell? Theres a big difference between taking profits and taking a loss imo."
03/29/2021,stocks,187% of all statistics are made up.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Lol I thought it was that anytime a percentage is falsified, 87% is always the amount used."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I was up $10k, then average down and kept buying dip. Now I’m down 5k of initial 20k and the dip kept dipping. Even added 5k more to initial 20k starting investment. Everyday my portfolio is bleeding 1500 to 2k. I don’t know how my 20k can withstand this bleed. 🤦🏻‍♂️"
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol That’s actually not that bad given the stocks that you invested in
03/29/2021,stocks,"That doesn’t answer the question, are you unable to?

03/29/2021,stocks,Same. I’m up 30% from a year ago and I’ll I did was keep contributing when I could.
03/29/2021,stocks,I just started blocking people. If they have rockets in their title or are pumping a stock in a similar way then I don't even read it. They just get added onto my list. I do this with a few different things I look for in the hopes that one day I'll only see good DD and posts from smart people.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Exactly,  most of the stocks that are going down now had those large unexplained gains already, and may just be heading down to a reasonable 8% year over year gain, meaning a lot more to fall. 

Also right, your trailing stop loss would have had you sell a while ago if you were sitting on gains,  and the idea is to minimize how much you lose,  so I hard stop loss when you first buy in protects you the same way.   I personally don't set a stop loss, but I'm not afraid to sell if I'm wrong about a company (but your right,  sometimes you should hold).

I don't use any momentum strategy, I try to hunt value,  but there are a lot of momentum traders out there with a battle cry of ""the trend is your friend "".  When your stock moves up quick a lot of them pile in amplifying the move up, after the top when the trend heads down they stop buying and at some level (when one SMA goes below the other SMA or something), they start shorting the stock.   Again amplifying the trend.   At the end,  your stock sits lower because they all exit entirely. Holding these stocks will hurt,  after a 50% loss,  you need 100% gain just to get back to even."

Also you still haven’t answered the question of what fundamental changes the Biden administration has made to the market."
03/29/2021,stocks,"No, that's not how it works.   If you buy a stock for $100 and it goes to fifty,  even if you buy another at $50, (doubling the number of stocks you hold) . And then sell them both,  you still lost the same $50 , adding more doesn't change that.   If instead you buy at $100, sell at $95 , then you can buy almost three at $50 instead of the two you have in the first scenario."

03/29/2021,stocks,"That’s fine if you want to disregard the article for whatever reasons you feel necessary, even if nonsensical, but I’ve asked you this question three times and you’re still unable to come up with an answer. 


For the fourth time, what fundamental changes the Biden administration has made to the market?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Sure,  it comes out the same, if you lose $50 one one purchase and break even on another,  you have lost a total of $50, doing the math to average ($75) then say you lost $25 each on two shares is still the same $50 loss."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I've been doing puts and calla on sqqq to stay afloat, it trades sideways so often, it's so predictable.
Just free money. Put one day, call the next and so on."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Right but now, don't I ""only"" (just shoot me lol) need the stock to gain 50% in order to break even? 
50 + (0.5*50) = 75"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well, good luck, I hope you're successful, I'm not on the other side of any of your trades.  I'm buying slow and steady dividend payers for the most part,  I've only had one jump way up (QCOM), but I knew that was going to happen eventually,  just not exactly when.   Yes,  on That I bought more as it slowly fell,  but they were paying me 5% dividend to wait.   I sold a little after the first jump,  then most of the rest after earnings when they didn't raise the dividend.   I still have 100 shares that have gone down a bit from the high,  but I wanted to keep a little exposure to tech because of diversity."

Only thing that is kinda shit is prime video but hey it's free sorta kinda."
03/29/2021,stocks,"With Amazon not giving out dividends or talks of splits, i can’t justify going in on Amazon.

I’m with your assessment on Amazon - they are going to take whatever market they want to. They’re a boulder rolling down hill - there isn’t much stopping it.

Now - whether in the short term their earnings will continue to grow is to be seen - but undoubtedly they will have ever increasing revenues from their myriad of revenue streams. And I’d venture to say - long term - those streams will become profitable, or grow in their profitability.

I don’t have any point to say “buy it here because of X, Y, S” - but if you’re investing - Amazon has all the markings of a long term winner."
03/29/2021,stocks,"there's not really any logic in that.. splits or dividends aren't indicators if a stock is a good long term value play or not

also op didn't ask for comparisons of past performances with some other random company. he asked if anyone sees the current price to be a good entry for a long hold. 

i for one am buying more at under 3k"

03/29/2021,stocks,"With one mistake, your stock is going to zero. Amazon is going no where."
03/29/2021,stocks,There is fractional shares yes but I wish they would do a split as well. Maybe now that Bezos is out it will happen? It will attract a lot more retail investors. And with the Robinhood boom retail has a considerable contribution to the market.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah I think webull allows that but at this point I felt like I missed  the meteoric ride up.  It's so expensive now.  Just hope to put my money on smaller companies and hope it moons.  Your Amazon stocks should do you sell if your long.  Good luck.

03/29/2021,stocks,"100% not saying that Amazon won’t dominate the world one day. 

I’m just saying personally i feel better going from 7-13$ on volume than i do 3000-3500. I was in Tesla at 400 and rode the wave to their split and sold after. I say this thinking Amazon will continue to grow and either way it’s better than a savings account. 

I’m not riding stocks for long term. Just for returns and shifting. Amazon will outlast all long term"
03/29/2021,stocks,"That’s flawed logic. 

10% of 1 share is worth the same as 1 share that’s worth 10% of what it used to be worth after a split.

But I certainly understand the human nature to think a $300 share is better than having 1/10th of a $3,000 share.

I don’t know if it holds true anymore - but I heard (on Mad Money I think) that large fund managers pay commissions per share - so they don’t want splits. And I’m guessing the majority of Amazon shares are held by institutions (and Jeff Bezos)"
03/29/2021,stocks,Not much chance of a split. Andy Jassy is one of Bezos's old guard. It will be business as usual at Amazon.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Bond yield rising means bonds are selling off. Low price + coupon rate = high yield.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Part of what you're seeing here in early 2020 is that the Fed was aggressively cutting the benchmark rate in response to the economic slowdown. So that's an example of the Fed manipulating the yield curve, rather than a demonstration of the natural market forces between stocks and government bonds."
03/29/2021,stocks,"First of all, this is only a recent snapshot.  Try running it over a longer period of time.  Also, does it look the same when you run it against the Nasdaq?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It isn't an inverse correlation to SPX.

What spooked the market a few weeks ago is when the yield ramped from 1.00% to 1.5%. It was trending up before that but the rate at which it was going up accelerated. Market does not like dislocations and uncertainty."
03/29/2021,stocks,Bonds have a correlation of -0.06 to stocks. So yes they tend to move in opposite directions but this is close to zero. This means it is more likely they move independently from one another than having a strong relationship in either direction.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The 10 yr bond yield is just short term noise.

What people need to understand is stocks exploded last year primarily because of the federal interest rates. These were cut to near-zero and are not changing as they are controlled by the federal reserve.

The improving economy equals inflation, and people think the 10 yr yield starting to rise quickly is a sign of inflation, and means that Powell would raise the federal interest rates ahead of schedule, even though he has kept great consistency with the plan so far and continues to say time and time again they are sticking with the plan and not raising the federal interest rates early."
03/29/2021,stocks,You are using line graph for one and candle sticks for the other. That way you can’t see what’s happening. Line graphs flatten out movements. So use the same metrics
03/29/2021,stocks,"No you won't see this effect consistently because 

1) Not all equity sell-offs are treasury yield induced, many are geopolitical, valuation retreat or just a fat-finger. In these scenarios bond yield should actually go down as investors shift money out of stock and bid up Treasury in a flight to quality rotation, 

2) You are looking at the two levels in the same time frame, usually when yields start to creep-up equity market does nothing until it reaches a certain level, and then all of a sudden market take notice, de-risking begains. Maybe lag the yield graph by a fixed time period, or even better look at the forward rate implied level. 

3) You need to filter for the most highly valued stocks (by whatever metrics you prefer) to see the effect in full motion. SPX has a bunch of stocks that are beneficiaries of higher yield, say banks, insurance, and other spread-driven business. Some of these names will off-set the effect of higher yield on high valuation names."
03/29/2021,stocks,"When bond yields start dipping, people sell stocks to buy the bonds, then bond yields will start to go up"

03/29/2021,stocks,How do NFT’s help them long term?  I mean they are a fad that has been pumped when they are basically a pyramid scheme.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Like I said, don’t dump your bank account into it. 

This isn’t a long term play. Even you can recognize that buying a stock at $5 and selling at $10 is profitable."
03/29/2021,stocks,Better off taking your profits and moving on imo. The underlying company is crap. NFTs are likely a short-term fad and not something sustainable.

03/29/2021,stocks,"They want to close my account because I asked them where my money was. On a red day, I had funds transferred from my bank to my broker. I called my bank and they said the funds had been transferred, meaning I could no longer get it from them.

When I called the broker, the robots told me there was a physical location in my city, so I went. When I got there, the 3 men said they were no longer a branch of that broker, but a different broker. Then they documented this interaction on my account, even though they supposedly don't work for my broker, and are trying to force me into selling my positions in the next 2 weeks.

From what I have read, they cannot force me to sell. I need to find a broker that I can trust to answer my questions when I have them. This is the 2nd really poor interaction I have had with my broker where it has costed me a lot. All I need is to be told the truth when I ask where and when I will have access to my money. That shouldn't be too much to ask from our financial institutions."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They are trying to do something like that, but I have a cash account.

Edit: Which is what I tried to tell the humans when I saw them. THey want to use my time and resources, instead of just buying what I want with my own money."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Do you realize how ridiculous that is though. It is my hard earned money. I can do whatever I want with it and if my broker says I can't buy when I have the resources, I don't trust them anymore. It isn't too much to ask for trust in our financial institutions."
03/29/2021,stocks,So far from the truth
03/29/2021,stocks,"But, kind of like that once I got to the humans. More just, ""Here is the receipt from my bank stating they transferred the money to you, can you please tell me where it is and when I can use it""."

03/29/2021,stocks,"None of that really matters. I had my own hard earned money to buy, and I wanted to buy. I work off of a cash account.

03/29/2021,stocks,Why aren’t they allowing you to buy ?
03/29/2021,stocks,Did you transfer money from your bank to your brokerage account because of a margin call?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Looking at his post history, it appears he doesn't grasp the concept of settled vs incoming funds."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They aren't letting me buy, becasue I asked them where my money was. My bank confirmed in person they transferred the funds to my broker, I have the receipts. My broker though was unable to say when or where my money was and when I could use it. Now the money is sitting in my accoutn and they will not let me buy anything, only sell. They are claiming I ahve 2 weeks to liquidate my account or they will close it. 

Id on't think any of this is legal"
03/29/2021,stocks,Allright. So the broker is probably protecting him from future failures
03/29/2021,stocks,Please don't make assumptions about me.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I do get it. You don't seem to understand the difference between cash and margin accounts. My bank had no problem telliing me they succesffully transferred my hard earned money to the broker, so why couldn't they say when and where my money was?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"You seem demanding and unreasonable to me, maybe that’s why they’re not telling you where your money is. And if they’ve decided to terminate your account because of your behavior, there’s nothing you can do about it, they are not obligated to serve you in anyway whatsoever."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It’s all legal, but you’re not telling us something so we don’t even have the basic information. For example, who is this broker you’re having such trouble with?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"No, the broker is protecting themselves. This broker is currently in a transitional period and they are closing locations. You do not usually do that in good times."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm doing well, do not worry about me. I do need to find another broker though, so if you can help with that I would appreciate it."
03/29/2021,stocks,I do get the difference between cash and margin accounts. Cash averages 3 days to settle. To avoid this I use a limited margin account to be able to trade instantly. Taking a few days to settle isn't a conspiracy by your broker it's industry standard.
03/29/2021,stocks,Maybe due to COVID they saw the opportunity to do it now as it is not as busy as normally

03/29/2021,stocks,Either iv crush or theta. If iv was high when you bought and dropped lower as the week went on it will drop the cost of contract even though the stock has went down. Also theta.
03/29/2021,stocks,"strike and expiration?

if i had to guess just by reading this post, im gonna guess they're at like a 24 or lower strike and expire on 4/2 and were bought on 3/26 when mx skyrocketed"
03/29/2021,stocks,It's a 1 delta option. Odds are it goes to 0. Was there some catalyst you had in mind for a huge swing down?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Im in the same boat as you, ive noticed some of my calls or puts are heading in the right direction but price isnt. I am totally guessing but what I think is happening is that even tho the price is heading in the right direction it may not be moving as much or as fast as originally anticipated therefore the contract will lose value. For instance. Ive purchased calls abd the stock is moving up and the price is increasing but as soon as it slows down or dips but continues to rise i start losing money. Again, i dont know, just guessing. Hopfully someone who know more will tell us."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is probably IV crush. The only reason to hold puts rn is assuming that the deal won’t go through, since a private company has said they will buy every share on the public market for $29 a share. So everyone is comfortable holding shares below $25, since they can realize a ~15% guaranteed gain in a few months."
03/29/2021,stocks," You haven't seen much price action since the gap up.  You're pretty far otm, you might as well ride it out and hope it retraces to fill the gap some....can't lose much more on the ride :/

03/29/2021,stocks,"yeah, first off I thought that there would be decent volatility both ways because of the buyout, as well as having one of its main distribution channels hindered with the Suez canal."
03/29/2021,stocks,That's basically it. Higher volatility makes both puts and calls more expensive because it translates to a greater probability of an extreme payout.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think right now is a horrible time to sell...imo. Personally, I am just holding what I’ve got, and if something in my watch list hits a price that I can’t pass up, then I’ll buy. But I’m not selling anything right now. I’ll wait until the market fully recovers for all that."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Genuine question, what lesson have you learned?

I found myself in a similar situation about two years ago. Initially I thought the lesson was that speculation simply involved more risk than I thought and that I should be in lower risk investments. But really that wasn't the lesson I should have learned. What I should have learned, and now have, is that I really had no idea how to manage risk and how to weigh one investment against another. In truth, I'm still learning how to do both of those things. But while I learn I've parked my assets in index funds. Why? Because Buffet and Bogle are right. I'm not going to beat the market. But I can partake in the markets success. 


As for selling ARKK for VOO. I would say no. Let it sit, maybe even recover. But more importantly take the time to really learn from your experience and develop an investment thesis that realistically fits your capabilities and goals. Impulsive or reactionary trades, even to a lower risk/volitility instrument are rarely a good idea. The first investment you should make is in your own education and understanding. Everything else follows from that."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I bought (admittedly a tiny amount) at ATH too, but why are you buying a fund founded on market disruption if you're not willing to wait for the underlying companies to disrupt the market? Did you think these companies would completely turn their respective industries on their heads in a couple of months?

I keep seeing your sentiment echoed on here a lot and, no offense, but it kind of baffles me."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Maybe hold your position in ARKK but don't add more, and start a position in VOO? You could also alternatively DCA your position in ARKK while simultaneously buying VOO."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you still believe in it long term, you should probably hold it. ARKK has taken a beatdown as big money is moving to reopening plays. ARKK consists of quite volatile tech stocks that are in the tech sector, so there’s been alot of selling recently. It might get back up long term, but short term there isn’t any joy."
03/29/2021,stocks,"So sell something that’s down to buy something up, yep. Your initial research in ARKK was fine, you just bought at the wrong time. ARKK will outperform over the next few years, but the hype in it was bound to end. It just got too ahead of itself."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The fact that everyone on this sub has turned super bearish on ARK is to me a bullish flag. Every time there is a popular opinion on here the opposite has come true in a short time. 

Cathie has a bunch of turds right now but a few of them will moon at some point in the next few years."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I believe in it for the long run, so I'm holding. I've also been buying more ARKK to lower my cost average. There's a lot going on right now and ARK appears to be taking full advantage of the dip (or cliff now) by rebalancing their portfolio (selling off cash stocks to buy PLTR as an example).

March is traditionally a very challening month for the market and tech has been particially hammered. The upside is that April is traditionally one of the best months for the stock market. You only lose money when you sell at a loss. VOO, or in my case VTI, is a great investment and should probably be part of anyone's portfolio. However, we're in ARK for explosive growth over the next 10 years. There will be ups and downs along the way."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't think so. All these people finally asking how to hedge against Tech are likely going to be asking how to hedge against the DOW and reopening stocks and oil in two weeks.

My strategy is riding this out, buying the dips I believe in, and converting more to safer positions after the next bull run."
03/29/2021,stocks,The fund is managed for you why would you sell it? You cant expect constant growth. Think long term.
03/29/2021,stocks,buy high sell low? no

03/29/2021,stocks,hold
03/29/2021,stocks,"ARKK will recover eventually and selling at a low is never a great idea. Personally I made a tax loss harvest move out of it. Sold ARKK for BTEK, similar portfolios but less exposed to TSLA and I have a loss realized so I can make a few short plays with inviting taxes."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It depends. I sold my ARK funds a few weeks ago to guarantee I could deduct those losses in the case that it comes back strong later this year. I made huge profits early this year and really don't want to be taxed on all of those at one time, so my strategy was to sell ARK, wait 30 days expecting this correction to last a while, and then consider buying back in. There are a few possible outcomes to this strategy:

1) ARK rockets back in the next 30 days. This would suck for me, but there is so much down right now there are other things I can find on sale.

2) ARK stays where it is. In this case, I don't profit on the trade but I do get to deduct the loss this year, which means I don't have to hold nearly as much cash.

3) ARK continues to fall. This is ideal because I get to deduct my loss and buy back in for bigger long-term profits.

Other than tax reasons, I would only sell if you think you have a better opportunity in the near term."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I believe it will go back up, the question is how long it will take. Also selling at a loss is usually not a good idea"

03/29/2021,stocks,No need to sell for a loss. But let this be a lesson. Managed funds almost NEVER beat the market in the long run. Hold 50% VOO at all times.
03/29/2021,stocks,"What changed fundamentally when you bought ARKK at the ATH and now? And do you still believe in the fund, just like you did when you bought it?

a) you didn't do your research to begin with and didn't understand what you bought when you bought it

b) are letting fear drive your decisions (pull back/correction)"

03/29/2021,stocks,"In my humble opinion, those who were piling into ARKK are falling victim to recency bias and performance chasing.  Whenever you hear an investment manager talking about “this time is different” or “value traps” I would run for the exit.  
As a novice investor I would recommend spending some time learning about cognitive biases and how they impact investor behavior.  In the heat of the moment they can be easy to ignore but you can train yourself to recognize when you are about to fall victim to one and react accordingly."

If you believe that you will be able to sip a double soy latte in your TSLA car on auto pilot while Siri drives by the year 2025, hold ARKK.

If on the other hand you are having thoughts like maybe Cathy was right place right time (epic bull market, plenty of IPO's and infinite liquidity) and your starting to think maybe Elon Musk might be a little ahead of his time (same as being wrong), sell ARKK and buy VOO on the next 10% down dip in SPX."

what I would do: montly savings into both. 

and do a third ETF to be even more diversified than VOO and ARKK. 

depending on age and timeframe you could go for emerging markets, small cap etfs or a more specialized ETF for certain industries. who knows.

just keep investing monthly, and do not look at the current market. simply ignore it. 

if you want to play with the stock market, dedicate a small sum and use just that.

03/29/2021,stocks,Buy more if you can. Average your cost down
03/29/2021,stocks,"ARK might go up again, but you need to consider, where it’s at now:
Will the market go up, or down, in a given timeframe (say, end of year)?
Will the S&P outperform ARKK based on the current value of ARKK moving forward, and in a given timeframe?

My answer to the first one is that it will go down at some point in the near future. Even if it doesn’t, I think Cathie Wood is little better than someone selling snake oil (the difference is that she believes in the product she is selling).

But the important thing for you to consider is not your previous losses, but whether, given the current price, what can the expected performance be for either alternative (which is difficult to assess with a fund, and under normal circumstances even an imprecise metric). ARKK may go up, but a lot of that rides on whether something like Tesla should be trading at a remarkably higher P/E ratio than the average for the S&P."

1. Sell and take the loss.
2. Buy the dip and average down.
3. Just hold and watch.

Honestly I think holding would be a great learning experience for you. You can watch how volatile stocks can be. I think the biggest mistakes for new investors is FOMO and panic selling. When you own a tech ETF like ARKK its going to be volatile af. If you trust ARKK and Cathie Wood you would want to hold on. If you can't handle the volatility of stocks might as well just buy VOO and forget about it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just think, if you’re down now with ARKK having 11% of Tesla it’ll be awesome when it has 30% now that they’ve changed the rules. I’m out of Q as soon as I can.

03/29/2021,stocks,"If you bought ARKK for a good reason, then no don’t sell. Just because the price went down doesn’t mean you should sell. 

Despite this, get out of ARKK (and really other stock, ETF, etc.) and get into something like VOO. 40 years from now I guarantee you will not regret it. 

If you still need some motivation to get out of individual stocks, ETFs, etc. pick up a book called Elements of Investing. It’s a quick read. I read the entire thing in less than an hour. It probably won’t teach you much but it did finally convince me to get into index funds. I actually had to buy and read it for a class. The price was well worth it."

I would not sell, however. Me personally.

I have a lot, rather mostly, income based holdings so even if my ARKF goes negative I won't really care much. I did the sensible thing and kept it a small percentage because it is a speculative holding."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm in the exact same boat, and I asked myself the exact same question this morning. I got into investing 2 months ago, and bought in to both ROKU and ARKK near the top, when there was no sign of retracement. And then the big tech sell-off came. 

Here's the conclusion I came to: I look at the chart and pretend I don't have a position in it. Is it a good time to buy? If the answer is yes, I buy more. If I'm not sure, I hold. And if the answer is no, I sell. But I don't invest it in something else. I set the money aside and get back in when it's lower, when the answer to the question becomes yes. It's the same thing as having 💎🤚, but you're saving however the difference is between where it's at now and where it is when you buy back in. 

More importantly, if I'm not sure I look at that as a red flag that maybe I don't know enough about the company to have a position in it in the first place. 

Lastly, Chamath had a very interesting tweet about this this morning: https://twitter.com/chamath/status/1376567529754095616?s=20

If you're asking this question, the right answer is that you should sell ARKK (and maybe a few other things) and not buy anything with it. Always be holding 10-40% of your assets as cash until we see a substantial to massive correction/crash."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah but OP is specifically talking about ARKK, a hyper growth ETF. Hyper growth tends not to do well if interest rates climb and inflation becomes a problem. Many of the companies within the fund benefitted greatly from the pandemic, so switching to more cyclical/value ETFs might be better off right now. It could take awhile for ARKK to recover depending what happens over the next few months, VOO should be a primary holding not ARKK."
03/29/2021,stocks,Was it a horrible time to sell when hyper growth etfs were only off 30% during the dot com bubble?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Excellent post sir.

Many people initially try their hand at investing by purchasing individual stocks. I feel that learning to invest should be done in the following order:

(1) Buying a global all cap stock index i.e. maximum diversification.

(2) Progressively augmenting this base position by overweighting certain sectors (e.g. value vs growth) via more specialized index funds/ETFs.

(1) and (2) are index investing in which you invest in baskets of stocks not individual stocks and progressively specialize by market cap size, geography and market sector. Index investing can also be thought of as top down investing.

(3) When you are ready, start investing in individual stocks but no more than 5% of your portfolio initially. Allow this % to grow progressively at no more than 5-15% per year. For every individual stock investment you make you MUST have a thesis about why it will **beat its relevant index**. If you don't have this DO NOT buy the stock.

(3) is basically bottom up investing. Ultimately a good portfolio should be a good balance between index (top down) and individual stock investing (bottom up).

So many people jump straight into (3) and end up getting hurt. Or actually worse, start with (3) in a bull market, make some money and then think they are the next Warren Buffet only to lose big when the bull run ends."
03/29/2021,stocks,IMO the lesson is that you shouldn't buy stocks or ETFs like ARKK after they've already had a massive run-up.  That doesn't mean that one should totally question all of their judgment about how to invest.  It was just a very rookie mistake.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I like this advice. Your lesson is EXACTLY the same lesson I've learned in the past 3 months. Since January, I thought I understood what volatility was and what speculation/risk was. I was 100% wrong. I also learned that spreading risk to different companies or sectors isn't managing risk if all those companies are high beta.

This is what ARKK did, but they still got blown up because even though their stocks were across manufacturing, telecom, CPaaS, SaaS, automotive, fintech, they were all high beta stocks. That makes the good times really good and the bad times really bad.

Also, long term, ALWAYS buy indexes. I like having an 80/20 portfolio of 80% indexes and 20% high volatility growth stocks. I ended up getting caught in exuberance and my portfolio shifted more towards 70/30, and I'm feeling undue pain right now because of that."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Its also about invested capital and returns. If OP doesn't have faith that the active managed portfolio can gain back the 30% its lost in the past 5 weeks in the next 3 years, then where's the conviction on buying and holding?"

03/29/2021,stocks,"See big gains -> cool I want big gains -> buy -> stock goes down -> stocks can lose value?

03/29/2021,stocks,"This is good advice. Don't buy more ARKK if you feel like its still overvalued. Use extra money coming in via salary/wages to buy into VOO which you believe is undervalued. Or maybe branch out even more to VTV, which is much more stable.

Selling into red locks in losses. If your ARKK is down 20% right now (which it robably is), it'll take at least 2 years of VOO to get get those gains back (using long term averages). So be careful about a knee jerk reaction to selling.

But then again, ARKK could face liquidity problems and blow up, forcing Cathie to liquidate her position to pay outflows. If that happens, who the fuck knows. Maybe you lose all your money and it would have been better preserving capital."

I think a lot of people here don't think that ""in a short time"" is the same as ""in the next few years""."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ark's downturn is a product of it's own success. They made a bunch of risky bets last year and basically shot the moon, a ton of them quadrupled in value, this is just a portfolio-wide correction after a portfolio-wide surge. You could argue they made a mistake not taking more of those profits and moving them into companies that hadn't made a leap yet, obviously. 

Or to an extent it might just be right place right time last year with Ark, like a winning NCAA tourney bracket... a lot of luck goes into it, and obviously DD, but sometimes the luck is more important. Covid changed the market completely and steered a lot of cheap money into emerging tech companies as no play was too risky."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Why do you believe this?

Interest rates are going up, there are secular tail winds on reopening, and the valuations of tech are clearly higher than they've ever been with Q4 and annual numbers not delivering on the majority of these overvalued stocks.

So with downward pressure from future revenues due to the increased risk free rate, along with transitions of funds towards traditional economic activities, what is your thesis for why things will recover so quickly (ie. 2 weeks)?"
03/29/2021,stocks,That how I roll :)
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well your choice with arkk currently is either ""buy high sell low"" or ""boy high and sell much lower""."
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah just buy high and then lose value and hold that bag indefinitely so you can eventually sell for a “gain”

03/29/2021,stocks,"> Managed funds almost NEVER beat the market in the long run. Hold 50% VOO at all times.


This. Isn’t it like 97% of actively managed funds don’t beat the market in a given year? And over time that number increases to 99%. 


Isn’t it also true that if a fund does beat the market in a given year, it’s more likely to produce lower returns in the next 5 years?"

03/29/2021,stocks,Better of the two in what way? It's slower and more gradual so if that's what you want but the upside on arkk is its way way up comparatively and has a higher return possibility.

03/29/2021,stocks,Not really great advice. It is already 35% of their portfolio and potentially trying to catch a falling knife to ‘average down’ is just going to make that holding a larger % of their portfolio with potentially bigger losses.

There are winners and losers and I can guarantee you that at least 90% of the stocks that have seen massive.growth in the last year will never live up to the expectations that some people have of them.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I wrote most of it below to the other poster, but now the other part is how overrated the 10 yr yield is, go look at the all time chart. The problem has been how quickly the 10 yr yield rose, spooking investors to think that Powell would interfere and change from the plan *on the federal interest rates*. People have been pricing in the raising of the federal interest rates back to more normal levels as early as 2022 due to the pandemic being ahead of schedule, but Powell has said over and over again what the plan is and that he's not changing it, and I side with him.

Frankly, the bears sound like propagandists the way they have gotten so many people to conflate the 10 yr bonds with the federal interest rates. That's not what the bond yields are, the bond yields are meant to be self-correcting with entities. This is not abnormal, and Powell has said he's not raising federal rates, so cheap debt is still here...

We knew (the royal we following investors who are smarter than us) that the 10 yr bond yield was going to settle into the 1.75-2 range. This was being theorized over the past few weeks, and that it would settle around March/April, and last week Powell even cited the 2 mark. Again, take a look at the all time chart, this is far from a problem unless you have a 3 month exit period. I do fully expect a return to tech bull from FAANG to growth this year -- do I actually know when, no, sorry that I threw out a random two week comment.

So, I believe all logic and legitimate investor reporting or opinions show that we are still a few years off from debt not being historically cheap, and the mountains of cash reserves for FAANG companies and value companies being a major advantage again. But we are already pricing in the rising federal rates *just in case Powell suddenly raises it before he has said he would for the entire past year every time he talked.*

I certainly don't see any logic for stocks falling much further from their November prices, where it seems most stocks are starting to settle into, let alone going lower and not coming back up sooner or later. My two week guess was very arbitrary, but from watching the cyclical stocks start to reach ATHs and start to dip, with Apple and Amazon bottoming out (imo) and starting to beat the market again, I indeed believe the cycle is already turning again."
03/29/2021,stocks,Interest rates literally AREN'T going up
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah two weeks seems very arbitrary to me. It will no doubt cycle back, as it always does, but 2 weeks seems hiiighly optimistic in the current financial climate with bond yields nearing 2% on the 10 year today and rising inflation concerns.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Of course!

1. Interest rates are gonna climb in next couple years.   The market will price-in the rate hike way before it happens.  High rates are bad for innovation ... Earnings way out in the future are discounted more heavily

2. GDP growth will be tremendous next year or so.  This will increases earnings for value, small cap and cyclicals ... Not so much for innovation (their earnings are far out in the future not now).  High earnings will spark flows into cyclicals and away from innovation (this has actually been happening over last several months)

Almost all of ARK stocks are momentum stocks and have been inflated by trend traders ... If momentum dies so may the sky-high prices.

That said, there is more room on the upside ... We're not in crazy bubble territory yet ... Its possible that post-covid euphoria could drive all prices higher ... Hence ARK and the market as a whole will likely be volatile ... Especially important to manage risk well in the coming year"

1. The 10yr T-bond rate is totally over blown. Back in 2019, when we had a HUGE run up, the T-bond rate was over 2: https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/pages/TextView.aspx?data=yieldYear&year=2019

Take a look, the 10year rate was over 2% and the market grew from 230 to 300 over 12 months. Only in the second half of the year did the 10year fall below 2. And mixed in with all that mess we had the recovery from the potential trade war with China and a flash crash because ""things were overvalued"" in April. But despite all that, the market just kept drumming along!

2. I will never understand bears. Do they want a crash? Do they want unemployment to swell? Do they want economic growth to slow? I will never get their mindset. Sure we're printing money at a crazy rate. And sure we haven't solved COVID. And sure we have issues with with employment. But the fundamentals of the economy are sound, we're on the road to recovery, and there's a lot of pent up demand for reopening. Why wouldn't we want all stocks to rise instead of blowing out one sector for another?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Two weeks was very arbitrary, however I can explain why I think the cycle is turning.

Apple and Amazon, despite being elite stocks and elite companies, started dipping off good news before the rest of Nasdaq and Growth. Did anyone realize this at the time? Well, certainly not the vast majority of people, but now we can look back and see it was an indicator.

Now tell me what stocks have actually been doing pretty well, finally, in the last week, despite the rest of Nasdaq continuing trying to drag them down? Apple and Amazon.

Now pick your favorite cyclical and reopening stocks. Mine is Disney. Go back to Disney's last earnings reports and news reports and look at how it stopped helping Disney a couple weeks ago.  Good news has stopped having any effect on Disney's stocks. I'm guessing your favorite reopening stock either is no longer at its ATH either.

The last week of March and first week of April is historically rough. I do think there has been a lot of profit taking, but the time to get positions in Disney and other reopening stocks was well before Cramer starts telling you ""Now is the time for reopening stocks."" Now the new positions are going to be on the quality stocks that have been affected by all this. I'm not talking about PLTR and BFLY, I'm talking about the companies that have cemented their position and are prime to dominate their fields for the future, so I'm talking Roku, PayPal, Zoom, the stocks that are back around their November prices and getting closer to the points where Apple and Amazon have started turning around.

I realize this was an Ark topic though, and they have exposure to both the stocks I like and the stocks I don't like, but the point stands that I'm not going to advocate selling them when they're this far off their ATH, because I think after FAANG, and then after the Rokus and PayPals, then comes the rest of the growth companies. I'll respond to the other poster about why the 10 yr bond is overrated."
03/29/2021,stocks,A juicy dip on a fund filled with overvalued junk?
03/29/2021,stocks,Duh?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Nope, I didn't say that.  

I'd sell ARKK because I sell very rough roads ahead for next several years.  Many more downsides than upsides.  

Moreover ARK's own analysis is untethering from reality ... They're also buying SPACs .... Interesting their allocation maximums ... Their increasing risk at the exact wrong time ... Chasing those returns with no regard for risk.

But I've always been an ARK bear ... Been trading call credit spreads on them since beginning of the year to much success!"
03/29/2021,stocks,Did you somehow know you wouldn’t get hit with a wash sale before buying a similar security or did you just roll the dice and figure they were different enough to not count as a wash sale
03/29/2021,stocks,"Question: I sold all my ark funds for a loss on the 5th of March, with plans to buy back in on the 6th of April. However, I forgot that I had recurring investments turned on for them, so it ended up automatically adding like one share the next week. Do I still get my tax benefit from the loss even though it bought one share back? I sold like 50 shares, so will it just “wash” one share or the whole damn thing?"
03/29/2021,stocks,10% MSFT 35% ARKK
03/29/2021,stocks,"His fund is private and limited to $10 Billion in assets, so that shows his strategy doesn’t scale."
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah me too. I think VTI gives more exposure to small and mid caps which seem to be the theme of this year. Just waiting for cash to settle to go more into VTI. Older I get the smarter it seems. I had been holding onto hopes that apple would rise again. I think it will but I don’t think it’ll beat the index. Not this year at least. Maybe once Facebook joins the 2 trillion club.
03/29/2021,stocks,well she's off to a terrible start if she wants to return 15%
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah they stated that in a comment. Half is VOO and 10 is MSFT. I understand reducing CB if there’s a dip on a good security, but I’m not sure you wanna make half your portfolio Ark, especially since it sounds like they don’t have much of any cash to spare."
03/29/2021,stocks,That was 2020. Doubt having that much cash will help you this year. At least it won’t every year.
03/29/2021,stocks,Buffet is famous/infamous for not seeing value on tech. Both in the industry and in personal gadgets

I don't care about opinions, just about strategies.  
But i mean, that's ok if you make money off your bearish strategy on ARKK."
03/29/2021,stocks,"[https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/substantiallyidenticalsecurity.asp)

* Substantially identical security is a phrase that comes from the tax explanation of the wash-sale rule.
* Traders cannot expect to use tax-loss harvesting strategies if they  have sold and then reacquired substantially identical securities within  30 days.
* **Generally, this can be avoided by purchasing similar stock or securities issued by a different corporation**.

In this case taking ARK fund to a Blackrock fund will avoid it. When there talking about substantially identical securities they are talking about like selling a Class A share and buying a Class B share of the same stock."
03/29/2021,stocks,you should be able to check you realized gains/losses inside what ever brokerage you are using it will reflect whether its a wash or not. It sounds like you might end up washing a small amount from your recurring investment. i would count how ever many shares you bought back as washed but possible/probably not a full wash. Just remember it dosnt matter if its a wash if it starts turning a profit again.
03/29/2021,stocks,35% ARKK is aggressive and I am a fan of it. But it’s volatile.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Way too high ARKK imo. You have overexposed yourself to unnecessary risk. 70% VTI, 20% QQQM, 10% ARKK. You can thank me in 10 years."
03/29/2021,stocks,there you go. Cathie bout to get wrecked relative to market over next 5 years most likely
03/29/2021,stocks,"I actually prefer VTI as well for the increased diversification. But again, VOO makes up 80% of VTI, so they are very similar."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah. I got arkk in my portfolio..like 1%... but I follow them kinda close.  They don't keep cash on purpose.  They treat speculative assets as cash... and increase their speculitive plays(cash like securities) the more they expect a bear market... e.g. now.   When bull market rears its head, they liquidate those speculitive plays and buy back into their conviction plays.  The idea being the speculative plays will be less effected by overall market movements, and also have interesting upside.  Interesting to watch their moves, but like you said, I don't want it dominating my portfolio."
03/29/2021,stocks,And his largest holding is in Apple which is a tech company?
03/29/2021,stocks,"The telephone has existed for much longer than Warren Buffett has been alive. He would have been phoning his orders to his broker, not “trading stocks at the bank” (Wtf)"
03/29/2021,stocks,Ok goodluck with all that lmao
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's funny you will use that video to support your opinion because when the dotcom bubble popped the Amazon stock crashed so hard it did not reach that price point again until 2010. More than a decade later. So yea, it was very overvalued. For every company like Amazon and Google that succeeded there were thousands that went bust. So yea, ARKK is filled with overvalued junk."
03/29/2021,stocks,Ahhh ok I didn’t know that was the distinction. Thanks
03/29/2021,stocks,Didn't he get into apple* recently? Not exactly genius moves. He sold IBM and bought apple.
03/29/2021,stocks,He delegated that decision.
03/29/2021,stocks,“Oh yes operator id like to buy some apple stock” VS me buying apple stock on my Apple Watch driving my apple car eating apple slices.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ok, but after that it become one of the FAANG and 30x its value, so when exactly is *the future*? 2 weeks later? 2 years later? 2 decades later?  
Ark is filled with *junk*, and still it performed 5 times the SPX from march '20.  
Is it going to correct? Definitely, it can do even a -25% more from now in a bearish scenario.Is it going to 0? Big nope."
03/29/2021,stocks,5 year ago isn’t really recent?

03/29/2021,stocks,"Try all three bucko, REEIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII"
03/29/2021,stocks,"So you're implying that the entire US tech stock market is about to crash.  
Maybe, maybe not.  
Are you shorting arkk? Are you at least taking advantage of your opinions?  
I'm not that skeptic, i didn't invest in the tech stocks during the pump and i'm not investing now, but i wouldn't say that fintech, EV, cloud computing and other stuff have no future..."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There’s nothing to really be said here man.. even people that have been trading for 20 years are still learning everyday. The key is the fact that you’ve started, now commit to your choice and learn your way. Good luck friend"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Okay, it seems like you need a little primer. 

The S&P 500 is not an investment product. it is not an index fund, it is not a mutual fund, or a stock or anything like that. It is simply a way of measuring the stock market. Just like the NASDAQ, just like the Dow Jones Industrial Average (or the Dow).

The S&P (Standard and Poor's 500) is a list of 500 large companies. the S&P tracks the performance of these 500 companies to measure market performance. 

there is a mountain of products based off this index and these companies, and even in Europe you should have access to most of them. There are index funds, mutual funds and ETFs that are all, in some way, linked to the companies the S&P 500 tracks. when people say ""invest in the S&P"" this is what they mean... invest in products based on what the S&P 500 tracks. 

You need to find one of those products to your liking. 

I would back the train up a little bit, and read up on what index funds are, what mutual funds are, and what ETFs are. All three of these have dozens of S&P based products available for purchase. 

Unfortunately being here in the US, I can't help you navigate a brokerage operating in Europe."
03/29/2021,stocks,Where lambo? 🦍
03/29/2021,stocks,"where in europe do you live ?   
german here: open a brokerage account . I would say DeGiro is good because transaction fees for US stocks is stupid low and it should be available for several european countries.   
its based in the netherlands. 

there you can look for US ticker names. 

the S&P 500 you probably want might be this:   
 **Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (VOO)**   
 EAM | VUSA | IE00B3XXRP09

US documentation does not comply to that. Not that US documentation is worse by any means. It's something like different kind of power sockets. In future EU may agree in some trade political deal that US documentation is again OK. Or maybe some US ETF operator finds EU an important market and provides PRIIPS docs as well."

The prices are set by people making offers and accepting them.

*Why* they choose those prices is entirely up to them, but in the end boils down to ""I think I can make money buying/selling at this price, then selling/buying later."" Why they think that is a combination of gambling, comparative valuation, economic prospects, mob psychology, and a sense of self-entitlement and manifest destiny. They auction their chances against each other without any regulated intervention (mostly; the regulation comes in when cards start flying off the table). In the end one guessed right and the other guessed wrong.

At least in poker you can turn over all the cards and calculate exactly how right or wrong everyone is. In the market, you could have every piece of information knowable and still not arrive at a solution."

The short term don't matter when investing it does when trading. Also there is a reason not just anyone can play real poker"
03/29/2021,stocks,I'd guess its because they're easy to pump and dump.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The reason they are not allowed in this sub is because they have extremely low market caps making them easy to pump and dump and that is illegal, we on redfit can't pump and dump apple and its debatable whether gme was mostly retail, but a stock with a market cap of 20m is super easy to pump and therefore get a visit from the sec."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you are willing to do the research, penny stocks are fine.  But if you aren’t willing to go to otcmarkets and read every document and disclosure you can get burned.  Have of the penny stocks I see DD on that are about to explode have documents that state we never expect to be profitable.  They just slowly filoute the stock every time it is pumped and pay themselves from the company.  It’s just a legal kind of fraud.  Except their documents tell you it’s fraud.  If they are paying high rent to an accountant for their HQ address, never expect to turn a profit, etc it’s never a long term play.  

With everything, especially pennies it’s important to do your DD and know what red flags to look for.  I do own several pennies.  And also have made money on some that we’re getting pumped that I knew were frauds.  But you have to either really believe in them because of price fluctuations or have be willing to take modest gains before they get sold off which they do 99% of the time."

Honestly it's either the greatest penny stock or the greatest scam. Time will tell and idc about the 1k I have invested. So to me it doesn't matter, if the fundamentals are there and it all looks legit and I believe in the company, I'll invest. Could be a penny stock could be a hundred dollar stock it's all the same."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I invest in many penny stocks but they carry high risk in general. I think the company's fundamentals make all the difference.  At the very minimum, it's good to check the OTC website to see if they're current with no red flags. The importance of doing DD is especially important with penny stocks because there are so many scammers out there with little accountability on the OTC."
03/29/2021,stocks,Doesn’t matter really. But it is true that most stocks that are in that penny amount tend to be crap companies and/or very volatile. Thats just because companies don’t typically split their stocks down to small dollar amounts. But any company could split it down and become a ‘penny’ stock that would be a good investment.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Often penny stocks have huge share dilution, meaning they have millions and millions of shares floating out there. So after a while, it becomes a major uphill battle for the share price to gain traction without intervention such as share buy backs. Because to start hitting double digits on the share price, you suddenly are going from a small cap, $150 million company to a multi-billion one on share price alone. 

This is not always the case, but one often cited as a concern. It just means you need to analyze the stock you are interested to see if the share float and market cap poses a problem, relative to it's revenue and growth prospects. 

This is the case with the popular borderline meme penny stock in Rolls Royce... they have so many shares out there (something like 8 billion shares, literally), that to even get to $3, they'd have a $25 billion market cap, which seems like a lot for a company that lost $5.6billion in 2020."

03/29/2021,stocks,most successful companies don't start as penny stocks.
03/29/2021,stocks,"You've got it backwards.  Market cap = Share Price x Share Quantity.   You can split price and quantity any which way you want.  You can split quantity 10000:1 and not touch market cap.  No matter what you do to price or quantity, any growth affects market cap equally, whether there are 100,000 shares or 100,000,000."
03/29/2021,stocks,"what do I have backwards? I literally said market cap is share price x shares (inferring number of shares). 

Number of shares is more static than price. to affect number of shares a company must either issue more, or buy back. neither are trivial acts. 

This means, a company that has already issued millions or billions of shares, and is a small company, comes to an inevitable crossroads of a growth ceiling because the market cap will be detached from the reality of the company. To keep growing the share price, the company either needs to actually have grown that much to justify the market cap, or they need to buy back shares.  

Investors routinely compare market cap to book value. Price to book, or book to price (people use either, they are just reciprocal's) is a fundamental way of assessing value. A company with billions of shares out there as a penny stock that then grew to a couple bucks has a big fundamentals problem when the market value is way, way, way out over the book value. 

That is the bias people view former penny stocks with. Okay you grew a little bit, but now what are you doing with those 5 billion shares you issued? is your company really a $25 billion company?

that is the challenge. Nobody is saying it is certain the company can't keep growing, but it is the inherent roadblock many smaller companies face. It is why if you see a growing company start sinking money into share buybacks, it is probably a good sign to pay attention to that company."
03/29/2021,stocks,"
You are describing a stock split or reverse split not a dilution. When you dilute a stock, stock is created out of thin air. For example a stock have 100 shares worth $1 each. After dilution it have 200 shares but if you own 1 share you don't get an additional share you just lost half of your money."
03/29/2021,stocks,You've completely missed (or avoided?) my point. I take responsibility for the breakdown in communication and end this conversation amicably.  Fare thee well.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know what a split is, thank you very much. My point is that a company with a lot of shares in circulation means nothing in and of itself.  A company with 100,000,000 shares @$4 is worth the same as a company with 100,000 @$4000.   Either way, a growth of 10% is a growth of 10%.  If you're looking at the number of shares and thinking ""oh that'll never move bigly"" because there are too many shares, then you're a dolt.  You bought  1000 at $4 and it went to $4.40?  Same gains as buying 1 @ $4000 and it moves to $4400.   Percent is percent, ALWAYS.

Now, if you look at a company and see they have a history of repeatedly issuing new shares as a method of raising capital, THEN you can start actually being concerned about share dilution. The mere fact that there are a lot in circulation means NOTHING."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Lol, I know it wasn’t meant to be funny, but this response for some reason is so funny to me.

I think you are both correct. But context is important here. 

What you’re saying is essentially 1+4 and 2+3 is the same with regards to market cap. And it is.

But in the context of Penny stocks (which is the topic at hand) and it’s dangers, the float/ number of shares are really important when assessing a company and its prospects. Often times these companies don’t have much assets or revenue on the P&L and rely on equities as a form of raising capital to sustain business operations and reinvest to grow. In that sense, you really wanna watch for dilutions as an investor. Also, if you go deeper, not all dilutions are equal as a private offering at pre-agreed price to an institutional investor is a bullish sign, while a public offering at whatever market price is can be bearish.

Real world example, This past week I lost money on A V E O, not necessarily a penny stock, but a pharma company that had an FDA approved drug that claimed in investor presentation they won’t be issuing shares and capitalized to take the newly approved drug to market. They turnaround cancelled their financing and issued a public offering and the stock tanked over 30%.

Falling 50% from a short squeezed price doesn't make it a bargain.

Keep in mind, VIAC always had a streaming service. It was called CBS All Access.... with ho hum results.

the initial boom you talk about was supposed to happen in 2019, and it didn't.

They were at 10m subs in q3 2019.

as of q3 2020, they were at 18m.

They've added some shows to the Paramount+, but at the same time, they're losing the cable TV revenue as people cut the cord. So it's kind of a wash."

/r/bogleheads

FSSNX is small cap where as FZROX is total market from what I saw. FZROX includes a blend of small, middle and large companies so by itself it's properly diversified if you are only looking at the US market. Adding more small cap on ur end isn't needed for diversification and that's more of a you decision if u think it's worth it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Fidelity has a nice search function for mutual funds. I'm unsure if you used that to find the 2 that you already found, but that's pretty much all you need to use to find a good mutual fund

Other than that, there are really only a handful of index funds that anyone will ever suggest. VTI, VOO, SPY"
03/29/2021,stocks,"FZROX is a great “total market” index fund because it has zero fees. If you want the lowest maintenance investing strategy that has lots of diversification with great growth potential, FZROX would be hard to beat"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Fidelity has some great index fund search/filter features, so you can find almost anything you are looking for.  If you are risk averse and want low fees, you can search/filter by those criteria.  I have been a Fidelity customer for about 20 years, and have almost exclusively used Fidelity Growth Fund (FDGRX) for my investment accounts.  They closed the fund to new investors about 10 years ago, but there are other comparable funds.  Just start poking around on the site and read what each funds' goals are, and what companies make up the fund portfolio.  Some people just blindly throw money into funds to ""diversify"" without reading what's in them, and they end up with 4-5 funds that all invest heavily in tech/growth stocks, which is redundant."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If they have ""target retirement 20xx"" type funds, you could just pick one of those. It will be something like 60% US total market, 30% international, and 10% bonds. Then you can just have 1 fund which makes incrementally investing small amounts really easy. And its diversified enough for super long term holds.

But if you want small cap just go 100% FSSNX, you really can't go wrong since you don't have a lot of money yet, its more important to build up savings than maximum returns. And with a fund like that you probably aren't going to get completely wiped out, and have a chance to out perform the S&P. Once you have a few hundred thousand then pick a better portfolio."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Hi.  First of all congrats on being a doctor and thank you!   We all appreciate the sacrifice that doctors, nurses and all other health care workers make, not just during covid but always

Per your questions on index funds to invest in.  Your right at the start of your career so frankly this is when your supposed to be taking more risk than less.  

What people ignore is that lower risk and more diversified = lower returns.   So, given you have an excellent stable job in front of you, i would be looking at index etfs that give you very long term upside.  Traditionally this has been growth etfs.  However there are many types of growth etfs.  

Personally i would stay away from the Ark etfs given your risk scenario and frankly i think that Cathy Wood is hallucinating when she says that Tesla is going to be work 3.6 trillion dollars in a couple of years

One idea if you want to be more risk adverse would be vanguards “dividend appreciation etf ($VIG).  It’s boring compared to Ark but sometimes slow and steady wins the race"
03/29/2021,stocks,"
It’s true more stock means more diversified however diversification is more than just number of stock. When you think about risk with diversification:


Go through these steps:
1. Equity or bonds - you’re young so you can afford to take on risk. Standard recommendation is you can go 90/10 or 95/5
2. Country/region: most people are in US only because that’s what they see and what they have information access to. International exposure provides that diversification or even outperformance. 
3. Small or large cap: small caps are more volatile than large caps because they tend to have more risks associated with them also less access to capital like larger companies 
4. Industry breakdown: you already saw it where large cap tend to be tech heavy just because that sector gained so much. 

Most of funds or etfs can help you control 1 and 2 really well, somewhat on 3 and less on 4. But that’s ok 1 2 and 3 drives a lot of the returns. 

FSSNX - https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/316146182
FZROX - https://fundresearch.fidelity.com/mutual-funds/composition/31635T708

Ok looks like you got a EQUITY US SMALL CAP, EQUITY US LARGE CAP

You can own both like a 70/30 split FZROX/FSSNX....large cap provides a more steady return while small cap provides an enhanced return. 
However you’re still only in US Equities


Final note on fidelity. I don’t like them after so many accounts (401K and brokerages). I find them expensive, and their exp ratios is always higher than comparable vanguard index funds. Of course $6000 doesn’t matter right now about  extra 0.5%. Hey you’re a med student...it’s good to know some of the basics of this stuff. I’m sure as your asset grows exponentially, you’ll find that it’s easier to outsource all of this. Because by then time is the most expensive commodity.

https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/me84d3/z/gse9gpx

I'm no expert myself and it is really unfortunate financial education is truly lacking and not really taught irl. I'd really recommend mainly knowing ur countries tax advantaged accounts / personal finance basics (ira/roth ira/401k) -> index investing like in bogleheads and then individual stocks if u have the extra time to look over all the basics first (not for everyone and frankly a major time sink, if you don't learn the fundamentals you will essentially be gambling imo , not to say u can't make money that way either)."
03/29/2021,stocks,Total market is recommended for ur long term investments since it basically contains small cap stocks along with mid cap and large cap. That being said if u wanna add more small cap that's upto u and it isn't that big of a deal. Small caps usually have more growth potential but also more risk so it's good to have exposure to them but maybe not 100%.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The problem with small cap is that they are higher risk than total market. Over the long term this should give you a slight premium, but not a lot. What you would really want to do to ""optimize"" is do 1/3 in small cap value index, 1/3 in large cap value index, and 1/3 in large cap like SP500. But you dont have to do this, the returns would be better than a total market index over the very long term but not astronomically so, and you take on a good bit more risk.

I do this with 1/3 FNILX, 1/3 FISVX, and 1/3 FLCOX.

Here's a video with more info.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Both are very good, especially with the 0.03% expense ratios."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If I had to guess, probably because QQQ follows the NASDAQ and that market is extremely volatile right now. I think QQQ is great in the long term, but there are still a lot of questions about whether the NASDAQ is going to crash or significantly correct after its exponential growth over the last year. 

If you're not averse to that kind of risk, QQQ is more than suitable. However, most people invest in ETFs to *minimize* their risk (to a certain extent), so those two things are kind of at odds. 

I'd personally wait a couple months to see what the NASDAQ is going to do before investing too heavily in something like QQQ, putting the funds into something like VTI or SPY in the meantime."
03/29/2021,stocks,"No reason, I just didn't include it in my list. It's also a solid pick"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It is NOT free, NOTHING is free:

they pay divident once a year, which means they use the divident the companies pay to them quaterly to reinvest for themselfes for 9months of the year and keeping the proffits..

so if you consider 8% anual return on the stock market, and 1.8% SP500 ETF divident on average you are loosing 3/4 of the divident return if you were to get it quaterly and reinvest it yourself.. 

lets say you had invested $10,000 in the Fidelity ZERO SP500 fund that would be $180 in dividents you would get ONCE a year instead quaterly so you are missing 3/4s of divident reivestment returns and that is 3/4 of 8% * $180  = $10.8

so basicly you have 0.108% expese ratio actualy more than 3x the money Vanguard S&P500 fund VOO charges 0.03%

also dont forget that is not a ETF, and is ONLY traded on Fidelity, so liquidity will be much lover"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Btw an ""index fund"" can be either a mutual fund or ETF (an ETF trades like a stock, while a mutual fund you can only buy at the end of the day). The term ""index fund"" just means it is passively tracks an index, rather than actively managed."

According to [this article](https://www.personalfinanceclub.com/fzrox-vs-vtsax-the-hidden-cost-of-fidelitys-zero-fee-index-funds/) while they don't pay the dividend until the end of the year, they do automatically reinvest it when it is received throughout the year, which means the difference between it and VTSAX is negligible. No idea how reliable the article is though. 

The relevant snippet:

""UPDATE: While FZROX does only pay dividends annually, the conclusion below is largely incorrect. FZROX actually reinvests those dividends internally to the fund throughout the year, and the growth is reflected in the share price. (You can see this because on the day the dividends are paid in December the share price takes a hit equal to the dividend payment) The difference between the two funds performance will likely be negligible going forward."""

03/29/2021,stocks,"VTV is at ATH, but look at historical VTV performance and compare it to VUG or QQQ. Tech has destroyed VTV for the past 10 years. Sure VTV is at ATH, but relative performance is way lower than tech.

This has been due to historically amazing interest rates that gave driven growth stock future value.

The finance industry as a whole has been waiting for value to catch up with tech forever. Value benefits from high interest rates because current revenues are worth more than future revenues.

I wouldn't be worried about VTV being at ATH unless you genuinely believe that that the entire market is overvalued. Thats your own judgement to make based on whatever metrics you personally use."
03/29/2021,stocks,"No, I personally think the rise in WM is completely disconnected from its TA. It has everything to do with rotation out of tech stocks, fears of rising inflation, interest rates, etc. Until we get a massive rotation back into equities in QQQ and their P/E goes back to normal, I think people will be pumping money into WM for a long time."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Dividend aristocrat fund like NOBL is great.

The main reason I prefer OUSA is because its rules system has a thorough screening of balance sheet quality, which most dividend indexes lack. The expense ratio is higher, but I am willing to pay that expense ratio to get the best balance sheets (highly-levered dividend payers are incredibly risky, even ones which have paid/raised dividends for a long time)."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thanks for your detailed response. I'm new, and it helped me understand looking at ETFs in a bigger context!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thank you for the detailed response. I'll keep an eye on it and see if I wanna jump on it. I'm new to the div play tbh cause I didn't see its value at first. 

I wanted to ask what would be the best strat(in your opinion) for dividends. The strat I was thinking of doing was using my div to invest in other stocks/etf I like as it accumulated in my IRA. Do you think it's better to just put it right back into the etf or better served going back into individual stocks."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That’s a tough question, and I’m probably not qualified to answer.

That said, I personally reinvest my dividends in the ETF or stock that paid the dividend, as I have enough cash flowing into my portfolio to invest in stocks/ETFs as I see fit.

That said, there are investors who successfully invest their dividends in other stocks, but I think it makes more sense for folks who have very large holdings in dividend-payers, but aren’t necessarily adding a lot of new funds to their portfolio."
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks again. I appreciate your candor. I was planning on just putting it back into nobl on I'll prolly stick with that since I am actively contributing

03/29/2021,stocks,It's more fun to talk about OVERVALUED stocks.
03/29/2021,stocks,MAC is very undervalued at these levels. Down near 7% today. My dumbass loaded up at $20 a few weeks ago.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel like BHP and RIO are about fair value--which could imply undervaluation in this market.

I think that both offer a substantial dividend and, if we do see an economic expansion across the globe, think that they make a decent longer-term play.

They're not the most exciting stocks and they do carry some risks, but in the world we live in with valuations where they're at, definitely think they're worth a look.

03/29/2021,stocks,"$BDLP.  

It’s been trading lower for a while now due to Q4 misses (-0.05 vs. expected EPS of -0.04..), trade issues with China, EBIT is complete trash.  Trusted resources basically say this is probably not a great investment.

On the other hand, it’s been fairly steady, except for a sustained jump this winter.  
 * Lots of reasons to invest in hydrogen (and lots of reasons to argue the reverse)
 * Partnership with $CP Canadian Pacific rail
 * they’ve got their hands in a lot of automotive projects (Toyota partnership & busses in Australia)
 * 2020 sales down 2.3% -not awful for a “growth” stock that had a terrible Q4-
 * New CFO & Senior VP Paul Dobson worth investing in alone, even if you think fuel cell stocks are bullsh*t.  

Thoughts on BDLP?"

03/29/2021,stocks,"Nothing looks good right now, spx wants to break 4000 and probably will, nothing structurally sound undergirding any of this rally, i think it just shits itself after it breaks and everyone blows their load and the post nut clarity hits everyone how fucked the market is. Be wary of the liquidation stocks, a lot of them are losing already inflated value and aren't actually good buys even if they are at 20% discounts this week."
03/29/2021,stocks,Bought some VUZI when it was at -6% and thinking it was a deal not knowing it would be one of those days the whole market tanks all day. FFS.  I do have good hopes as it's very volatile so should bounce up but I really wanted it to be a cheeky day trade.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I still think kroger is a solid buy even at 37. I would wait until it goes below $35 to enter, but they are doing some really great things. Big fan of LUMN as they are turing things around. Would get closer to $11 if possible."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Agree. One thing is clear to me. I am not likely to pick EV winners. Too many companies, too little time to research and even then, it's a lottery. Like picking Internet winners in 2000. However, we will need a lot of copper and other metals. Can't argue agains that. With miners too, I don't have time and knowledge to pick the next 100x junior miner so went with BHP and RIO. Safe bets. Been good so far."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeesh I’m down ~12% on it so take this with a grain of salt.  I bought in early, felt a little crazy post-Texas storm and bought more when it was, in hindsight, totally overvalued.

$143 is a great entry price.  Still risky, because you’re trading the news.  I believe in it.  

I think residential solar is inevitable.  To the best of my knowledge, Enphase and Tesla are the only manufacturers of home power storage batteries that can be used with different types of power.  Enphase is respected within the solar community, but is, and this is how it was explained to me: Many current solar users use alternative energy because they want to be “off the grid.”  ENPH doesn’t really market to these buyers beyond some of their niche products that are above my understanding.  ENPH residential services are like a Nest thermostat- you’re able to to control and monitor from your phone, it’s an expensive investment, installers have to do everything, but they have an excellent support network.  They integrate with tons of solar companies as well.

It’s also a decent company to work for, it’s US-based and occupies that weird area of tech vs. energy.  

As a stock... kinda volatile.  But I appreciate their mission and products and apparent clout with securing big contracts."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Kroger looks like a nice buy with the dividend, but I don’t believe it will be great in the long term because of Amazon’s plan to open up grocery stores. 

Also, I live in Texas, and HEB (owns Central Market) is opening two stores by 2022-2023 I believe. More competition.

Kroger will survive from customer loyalty and remodels, but I’m not too certain on further growth. 

Just my local thoughts on Kroger. 2-5 years looks good. 5+ meh."

2021-03-29 19:36:02,stocks,"Stock Scraper Update as of 03/29/21 **LINKS:**

* [Original post with answers to most of the questions I was asked](https://www.reddit.com/r/stocks/comments/m71xi8/a_month_of_tracking_stock_scrapers_for/)
* [Google Sheets published form](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vQP-XmPrtuUtuMYWWDJKnmyBsr-MMZfLn96XrbmhPawSmnOpxDk9H3v2bgCEKHJIripij3KZJd9diBQ/pubhtml)
* [Google Sheet as of 03/29/21](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1oc4NJvr0daMWjIouKYSnvsnJgKPs8OKaauYrqZyJhHg/edit?usp=sharing) (this is sometimes tough to get into if too many people are accessing it)
* Worst case scenario you can't see the data: [Imgur links to the data tables](https://imgur.com/gallery/oNd1VOO)

&#x200B;

**Background:** Using the [Unbias Stocks](https://unbiastock.com/reddit.php) website I enter all the stocks with a sentiment score above 0 into a spreadsheet and track it. I delete duplicate tickers so that it only tracks the data from the first time it pops up. So you may see Apple 4 times, but it'll only be once per social media platform (Google, Reddit, StockTwits, Twitter).

&#x200B;

**Updates to the data:**

* I stopped tracking ATH data. (This wasn't sentiment data, just ATH data) The data showed that this isn't a great strategy. It's basically no better than a coin flip. At its best it was only profitable like 56% of the time
* I stopped tracking Google and will likely stop tracking Twitter soon. They just aren't as successful at picking winning stocks as often as Reddit and StockTwits
* I am now deleting anything over 30 days old. I don't want old data to influence new, emerging trends
* I started a new sheet that doesn't delete duplicate tickers. Deleting duplicate tickers ensures that the counts and values are correct, but has the weakness of not monitoring a stock as it gains more sentiment and moves to a new category grouping. So by creating another sheet that tracks duplicates I can see how it reflects in the score groupings as a stock gets talked about more and more. This data is still relatively new so I wouldn't pay attention to any trends in it for a few more weeks

&#x200B;

**Current trends and analysis:**

* Reddit is still the go-to social media platform for good picks
* StockTwits *can* be useful, but they're really only good after it hits a score grouping of 5000+. This means that they don't catch stocks early, but they're great at knowing which bandwagons to jump on. And it's not a bad strategy. In the 5000+ category they have a really good success rates, but they're crappy everywhere else
* Average days to max price stayed the same
* Average % returns dropped from approx 15% to about 8%. There must have been some big winners in February that were bringing the numbers up

&#x200B;

**So what are the current best strategies?:** This really depends on you, but here are the most successful criteria based on the data:

* **Platform**: Reddit picks with a sentiment score under 250 in the last 24 hours
* **Average days until it hits max value:** 3.29 (for 500 it's 5.35)
* **Average % return:** 8%

&#x200B;

Now, for the questions I get asked most often and that flood my inbox constantly:

**What stock should I pick?** I don't know, you do you. What *I* do is go to

1. Unbias stock and run the report for Reddit
2. Take anything under 500 and paste it into a blank Excel sheet, then use that list of tickers to start searching in Reddit.
3. Enter each ticker into the search bar and filter by new. From there I delete anything that isn't a real ticker, is the scraper picking up something bad, or looks like a bot or someone spamming
4. For the real possibilities I just pay attention to how many different subs it is mentioned in and make a note of that next to each ticker. I only care about tickers that are mentioned in at least 4 different subs. We're looking for SENTIMENT data, so how often it is mentioned across all of Reddit
5. This gives me a list of like 10 - 15 tickers that are real possibilities. From there I don't do any DD other than to read through Reddit threads to see if the general sentiment is bullish. If it is, it goes on my short list to buy
6. With that short list I look for tickers **that haven't gone up yet**. This is because if the average % increase I can expect is 8% and the stock has already gone up 5% then I don't want to bother buying in

&#x200B;

**Why don't you have this automated? I keep getting locked out and I can't see anything. Can you just send me the data with your picks?**

1. Because I'm not an online programmer. If you want to do it for me I'm more than happy to give you the data, but I'm not getting paid for any of this, I just am offering up my personal data tracking in case it helps anyone
2. I know, tons of people are in the sheets and Google doesn't seem to like that. But since I see people in it all day it IS possible to get in, you just have to get lucky. You don't need my data sheets though, you can use Unbias and make your own picks
3. No, that's a lot of work and I'm not pushing any particular stock, so you pick yours. I don't want to be responsible for someone else's losses

&#x200B;

Good luck and have fun all! Hope this helps someone!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Wow, thanks! This was really interesting and was definitely worth the read."
2021-03-29 19:13:02,stocks,"If a CFO sells a few million worth of stock a few months into their job, is that a bad sign? Noticed one of the companies I own has a CFO who sold around a few million dollars worth of shares just a few months into their job. Is that normal behavior? I thought shares vested over a few years? Seems worrisome. This was NOT part of an automated selling program from his financial advisors."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Maybe...maybe not. If he is new and the only one selling my first guess would be that his blackout period ended and he wanted to get some cash. It also depends how many shares he sold vs how many he had. 
IMO it’s a red flag worth diving into but not enough of a red flag on its own"
03/29/2021,stocks,It could be a share transfer to family and shows as a sale - happens alot
03/29/2021,stocks,"Possible he just wanted the cash for something, maybe a new car or a house or he just wanted to diversify his assets/stock holdings. 

It’s not necessarily a bad thing, but it doesn’t come off as a good thing. If it was a large amount of his position then maybe it’s a bit more worrisome."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If the CFO just moved to that city, it could be for a new house. Some areas are so competitive, you need to make all cash offers.  Seattle, Austin, Denver, California."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Being a few months into their job and selling is more of a red flag than selling overall, which happens and is legit nothing to worry about a lot of the time.  If part of your salary is stock...well you will eventually sell it.  Some weird opinions in this thread.  Stocks do not always go up, and many C-levels who are 50+ years in age are aware of this and know that claiming profits is the name of the game at the end of the day."
03/29/2021,stocks,cocaïne addiction is an expensive hobby
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’ve always said, there’s many reasons people sell, but only one reason they buy. 

The others posters are right, it’s not really any sign if it’s a one off sale by a single employee. Company could be going to shit, or maybe they needed some money for that new boat they want, who knows."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Can't ALWAYS be bad...

Our CEO sold shares in our company at ~$30 and it's now sitting in the $50 range so maybe he just wanted the money."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If one board member does it, I do not worry - maybe ze bought a house or had a costly divorce - so the reasons would be purely personal.

I would start to worry, if more boardmembers would sell significantly, if there is no logical explanation, like the PLTR lockup situation - it is expected to have some selloff over some time which has an impact on the price, which leads to opportunities in the short term, but no significant waves in the long term.

Edit: corrected wrongly assumed gender. Sorry."
03/29/2021,stocks,They don't like the stock.
03/29/2021,stocks,A lot of insider sales are pre planned& dates are predetermined from months in advance.
03/29/2021,stocks,Would you want to invest in a company whose CFO was so dumb as to leave all his eggs in one basket?
03/29/2021,stocks,Not a bullish sign. Hard to make any conclusions based off a one time sale though.
03/29/2021,stocks,"My father is fairly high level at a major tech company.

He has always considered the stock given to him by the company as a bonus, and immediately cashes out. Could be a similar thing here"
03/29/2021,stocks,Stock options are how people get paid and often the selling is more related to vestment periods.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Is the company mature or is it a young growth stock?  
Generally in bigger mature companies c-suite management are remunerated via stocks. So if they want that holiday home they’re selling stocks (even if they think the company will be successful).  
If it’s a young company expecting huge growth it probably isn’t an amazing sign - just factor it into all the other DD you do.  
It does seem odd that the CFO could sell shares so early so I’m assuming it isn’t a mature company, as you mentioned companies commonly use share issues to incentivise talented c-suite employees to stick around for years.  
If it’s a penny stock then alarm bells should be ringing, as plenty of them these days seem to be designed to enrich management and disappear."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If the market has taught me anything



You won’t really know if it’s bad or good until you lose/gain money"
03/29/2021,stocks,"He/she could have just wanted the money to buy things. Sometimes people like splurge when they get a new job. Or maybe they  don’t  like the idea of being invested so much in one stock. Think about it this way, there are people who don’t believe in owning individual stocks because they don’t think they can “beat the market”. Even if that person knows a lot about the company, it doesn’t mean everything they know will actually be enough to help “beat the market”. The advice I see a lot to people give to people with RSUs that are vested is that they sell it right away and buy ETFs or whatever; unless they really believe it will go up and willing to take risk. 

And also there are people that think they can beat the market but want to control what they are invested in and how much. And not arbitrarily have millions in stock for one company just because someone gave it to them. If they weren’t going to buy it when they had the cash or at least that much of it, why keep so much of it just because it was awarded.

Could also just be they don’t think now is a good time to be invested in the stock market."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Seen quite a lot of companies where C-levels regularly sell shares. I think it completely makes sense when you get share options as part of your benefits. Same in my company, even though I completely believe in the company and strategy, I regularly sell my stocks (stocks don't always go up, you know). Be sure to check some other things, like is this regular in the company, how much he has left, and so on."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Historically, the people in charge of their companies, selling their stocks, is not a good sign."
03/29/2021,stocks,Did they report the sale to the SEC? A filing may give a little more insight. SEC Form 4...maybe? Check my work lol
03/29/2021,stocks,"A few million for a large corporation? probably not a big deal

for a smaller corp? yes"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Depends on how much of the bag they're selling. The new CFO may have had to buy a house, move, etc for the job. Maintaining the lifestyle is expensive. However, if they dump all their shares, run."

But not automatically a red flag"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Finance pro here 👋🏻.

People like CFOs has to have 10b41 plans that are filed with the SEC. someone who has worked with executive of tech IPOs want to lock in their wealth.

This one women in particular knows nothing about investing. She’s just lucky to be at the right company. She was poor growing up and now has something like $20mil worth of shares. As her advisor I tell her to lock in as much as she can now and once we get a comfortable nest egg ride out the remainder of shares.

These 10b41 plans have spelled out time frames and how many shares will be sold at a given time"
03/29/2021,stocks,It was probably part of his compensation plan. Maybe the Co. went heavy on stocks so they didn't have to pay the new CFO as much to get them in the door. If the company has been listed for a while (over a year) and a lot of higher-ups are selling it could be a sign.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Inside selling is mostly noise. People are paid in stocks and they need the money for their new yacht, nothing to do with the valuation of the company. Inside buying is also noise, probably people excercising their options."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If every executive is selling off shares... that's a reason to be concerned.  However, if one particular executive is selling off, it may have more to do with the rest of their portfolio than their hope for the company's future.  While generally executives have a sufficiently large and diversified portfolio to get away with holding more of the company they work for than the rest of us can, the conventional wisdom of not putting all your eggs in one basket still does apply.  Seeing large trades from the top is certainly reason to dig deeper, but often ends up being no reason for concern if there isn't a clear pattern."
03/29/2021,stocks,These execs get paid almost exclusively in stocks. They still have to eat. Don't overthink it.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Executives sell for all kind of reasons, I don't pay much attention to that very often tbh"
03/29/2021,stocks,"The few times I've seen it, yes. It has been a problem."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not generally, no. People need money for all sorts of reasons. Insider buying is much more interesting."
03/29/2021,stocks,"When someone sells his stocks it might be for multiple reasons. Maybe he thinks the stock is overvalued. Maybe he wants to diversify. Maybe he needs the money to get his kid through college. Maybe he just wants to buy a yacht. 

When they buy a stock, there's only one reason: they think the price will go up in time."
03/29/2021,stocks,the short answer is No. this happens at companies
03/29/2021,stocks,"Definitely requires a deeper dive, he could be selling because he sees the company prospects going lower, he thinks it's overpriced...or he wants to put another floor on his house. 

insiders sell for many reasons, they buy for one reason."
03/29/2021,stocks,There have been studies on executive buying and selling and the bottom line is that they are horrible indicators. Those guys are making decisions on any number of reasons. In fact the ceo/cfo buying shares is usually a negative indicator 😅
03/29/2021,stocks,"Sometimes the stock is given as a signing bonus

Edit: SHOW ME THE MONEY"
03/29/2021,stocks,"This happens all the time. Everybody wants to be diversified. Anything can happen. 

You especially don’t want to own too much of your own company’s stock, because if something happens to your company even totally outside your control, you could lose your job and the value of your stock all in one day. He’s probably just being a smart CFO IMHO."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It could be they just exercised options. They bought the stock at the option price, sold it at a profit to pay the taxes."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Nah, he’s just getting that good good insider trading info now and making millions more off his millions and making sure the company doesn’t have his money and HE has it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know who you're talking about.  His name is Mr. Arthur Pes and he led a Fortune 500 company to a string of successful years before landing in his new role.
  
He sold some shares for a simple reason:
  
So that he could buy more $GME and get more 🍌 🍌🍌🍌🍌🍌 when it rocket emojisssss.
  
Good ole' Arthur."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There could be other factors in play as well. Things to do with taxes etc. Also, and this is just me personally. But if I became a ceo I’d be inclined to sell some stock up front as I don’t have oodles of cash. I also don’t love the idea of having a ton of stock in the company I get my paycheck from. That said, a ceo should expect to have those eggs in one basket."
03/29/2021,stocks,"He’s a good CFO, thinking outside the box to sell his shares so that he can buy some in GME, AMC and BB, make a shed tonne then buy the shares back."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You should also view the sales as a percentage of how much they own.

If a few million dollars is only 2% of their total shares, it is probably alright.

However, in general, insider selling is bad."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Imo yes, otherwise, why would they?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Well it’s not ideal that’s for sure. I’d take it as a red flag.
03/29/2021,stocks,"If the person in charge of the finances is selling millions of dollars with of stock, that's insider trading. They know something we don't and they're using it to their advantage."
03/29/2021,stocks,"if the price went up 1000x 

you probably would too.

maybe they need capital for the company, who knows"
03/29/2021,stocks,Usually insider selling is bearish but nothing makes sense anymore in these markets
03/29/2021,stocks,"1 person selling could just be needing money - buying a house closer to the new location, for example.  But if I see more than 1 internal person selling shares, I bail ASAP."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not always, the whole boars of grow generation sold in the low 30's, so I dumped my options only to see it near 60 not long after.  Sometimes people sell on the date they can no matter what, it doesn't always spell disaster.👍🔥"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I mean, probably not if we’re going off of history but it’s impossible to ever know for sure until something happens. It’s not a good look though and would definitely worry people"

03/29/2021,stocks,"So generally insider selling is not something that is good when you are a shareholder. However, there can be many reasons why insiders will sell. Majority of the time it is so they can get cash for general needs. It also really depends on many things such as how many shares he/she owned. It’s a big difference if she/he sold half vs 5% of the total shares he held so really figure out what percentage of the holdings were sold."
03/29/2021,stocks,"investment strategy involves diversification

03/29/2021,stocks,"How many shares does the CFO still have? If he has a lot then it won't matter.

03/29/2021,stocks,No one would really be certain. Lots of top positions are awarded free stock as compensation so they sell their existing shares as well. CFO could have been offered shares and sold his existing ones as he is being offered additional options to exercise
03/29/2021,stocks,Not necessarily. Sometimes they get PAID in stock (to incentivize them to do a good job) so like... that's the only way they can get... money.

03/29/2021,stocks,"There’s no way to read into it. 

They could not like the stock. 

They could be on a stock sale schedule to avoid any insider trading accusations. 

They could be practicing financial wisdom by not double dipping - relying on the company for salary AND relying on the company for his investments. 

They could be utilizing financial management which tells them to divest and invest more broadly. 

They could be selling the stock to optimize taxes. 

They could be selling the stock to pay for living expenses and/or other personal things.

03/29/2021,stocks,"What percentage?

5%  ?   50%?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"From a very naive viewpoint...you have to look to see if the insider is selling positions they got at a discount.   I used a similar strategy to see to buy...if an insider is buying at street price, you know they have confidence the stock will rise. My local paper use to publish insider trades every day."
03/29/2021,stocks,They might need the money.
03/29/2021,stocks,I think it depends on how much. Like selling 1% on their holdings is just being like hey I'm tryna buy this house and wipe out credit card debt. Selling 10% is like hey I'm trying to hoard a little cash just in case. Selling 90% is like I want to gtfo of this dumpster fire but if I sell 100% then I have no incentive whatsoever to do good at my job.

03/29/2021,stocks,"It's a sign when multiple C-suite individuals start selling.

I worked at a startup that merged with another company, Jawbone if curious.  Jawbone had products on the market, but their algorithms were garbage.  We didn't have products in the market, but good algorithms, so it seemed like a good fit.  Turns out in the event of an IPO the c-suite at Jawbone could sell their shares than our c-suite individuals, and that is exactly what happened.  Jawbone went public, cooked the books on their validation numbers, refused to integrate our algorithms which seemed very fishy at the time, sold their shares for a killing very early on, then filed for bankruptcy right before any of us could sell our shares, and then took us to court probably to tie everything up so we couldn't take them to court, but I'm not a lawyer so only a guess on that one.

You gotta watch out, but a single individual selling, as far as I know, isn't an issue."

It would be strange for a company to let someone join, get all of their stock up front, and then sell it off. That’s like paying someone in advance before you know if they’re doing a good job.

It’s possible that the CFO received this as some sort of signing bonus, but a multi-million stock grant with no vesting cliff would be somewhat extraordinary."

You achieve this by selling of some of the equities that have already performed well and have generated alphas (Rate or return above an indexed benchmark).

• Dynamic asset allocation 
• Tactical Asset Allocation 
• Integrated Asset Allocation (combination of the three above)

Why do you have any upvotes, this isn't true at all.  

Selling is never anything without context, and we don't get context for insider transactions.  If all C levels are selling, then sure you can maybe treat it as a warning sign, but a single one?  It's nothing, he wants cash, he wants to buy a house/boat/elephant, or 100 other reasons.

Selling is not inherently bad, but buying is inherently good."
03/29/2021,stocks,">However, in general, insider selling is bad.

That's silly. C-level peeps are primarily paid in equity. If they want to buy stuff, they need to sell. This guy was just hired so probably had a grant as a sign on bonus, and now he wants to go shopping."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They need money? It's possible they want to pull out a big chunk of money to buy a house or something, or simply to diversify.  The stock may have been granted as a signing bonus, with the expectation that they'd sell it. Offering the stock could have been a cheaper way for the company to grant the bonus than paying cash.

Just because you believe in the success of your company, that doesn't mean that 90% of your net worth should be tied up in it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Uhh, cause they want to buy something?  Tons of reasons to sell."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Nope, usually insider selling is nothing, because there's almost never context to the selling.  If the CFO wants to buy a new house, he might liquidate some shares, which could be neutral or bullish.  If he wants to diversify his money, that's fine too, probably means he's not an idiot."
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,"Insider selling is routine and uninteresting.  Stock is part of any c-suite exec's compensation, it's idiotic to think they're going to just hold forever like a poor person.  One of the first financial lessons you should learn is to diversify and if you get a position that puts 20% of your net worth in your own company you want to knock that down as much as possible and diversify into a healthy portfolio the same as if you were buying stock in any company.  

If a C-level sells ALL of their company stock, that's a time to wonder what's going on, especially if they own a large portion of the company.  Any new CFO is not going to own a significant portion of the company.  If they get paid 75% in stock (not entirely uncommon) and they vest quarterly then it's pretty normal.  They're not necessarily any more important than a rank and file employee who gets a yearly stock bonus (option or RSU) and cashes out immediately after the shares vest.  I've done it with my company for a while, despite the stock not being worth millions. Otherwise i'd have upwards of 75% of my net worth in one basket and that ain't good.  It's already stressful enough watching my company stock dive 20% in a week, it'd be worse if my entire portfolio did it."

 There's nothing wrong with the first part of what you said.  The percentage of their holdings that they're selling matters. 

The issue is that your last statement is unequivocally false.

These examples are not similar to what OP is asking about.  Your examples have multiple C levels selling, which I stated can potentially be a bad sign.  However, anybody with a brain knows these are all disgustingly overvalued stocks, so the selling in this case is expected.  It's potentially bearish in the short term, but not necessarily an indicative of the exec's long term opinions."

If you're truly a long-term investor, there are only two reasons to ever sell a stock:

1) The reasons you thought it was a good investment originally no longer apply.  Maybe the company has lost its competitive moat.  Or maybe there is a major leadership change and people aren't confident in the new CEO.  Or maybe the company has lost its innovative edge (e.g. Intel).

Personally I believe inflation is going to hit from the supply chain disruption from covid. Also, I believe commodities, will boom. Lumber is showing that currently and I believe with covid lightening, oil will be behind it. It will be short lived (meaning it won’t be the new norm even though I think it would be depicted that way) but will be present long enough for the fed to completely lose control of the long term yield levels (that has begun showing slightly as of late) causing the market to freak and a sell off to occur. Now saying that if inflation stays under control, I believe the fed may slow burn it and let things level out over the longest period they can extend it so have another lost ten years.

Homes are going for 400k here in the Midwest for 3/4 bedrooms and average salary out here for most peeps is 35 - 45k yearly.  No doubt lending easing is occurring again for people to be able to afford homes (also why interest is so low to TRY to encourage buying, but if people still cant buy or are priced out even with low interest, what comes next? Inflation.

So how do you hedge against it? Diversified Real Assets. I have moved a chunk of my parents 401k to this type of fund.

They charge storage for hard copy even of the customer requests their boxes sent back to them. Their hard copy facilities can be above capacity and still collect fees at 100-120 percent of capacity.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Just stay away from investment banks, also banks are not a hedge against a bear market they are great ways to take advantage of a bull market with very little risk but you do not want to hold a bank during a bear market."
03/29/2021,stocks,CIX
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks for the video link - this guy simplifies things nicely. I have a lot to learn and am planning to view his other videos.
03/29/2021,stocks,Agreed. Do you have a favorite?
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’ve been monitoring GS, and some financial companies COF and DFC as well. Though currently I feel like all three are still too expensive."
03/29/2021,stocks,I agree this can’t be described as a sale but I will say I think financials are a great investment right now. With restrictions on buybacks and dividend hikes being lifted in June and eventual rate increases I think good banks have a lot of room to run
03/29/2021,stocks,What sectors would you recommend for a bear market ?
03/29/2021,stocks,CIX or CIXX?
03/29/2021,stocks,"looking for sub 35$ entry in Wells Fargo. Good previous Q numbers and OK guidance, will be following closer."
03/29/2021,stocks,"WFC, the asset cap will be lifted at some point (before June maybe? ), dividend hikes will also happen at some point,  they will easily pass the stress test for June.   All those should make for a good catalyst to move the stock higher when they happen."
03/29/2021,stocks,JPM and BAC are the best options available. Wells Fargo has too many issues. I'm long JPM and will get into sofi once spac has fully merged.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Any value stocks with the exception of Financials because well the bear market affects their earnings immensely. But stocks like at&t and berkshire hathaway, IBM, Walmart, pepsi, coco cola. Basically very boring stocks though it should be noted that no stock is really safe in a market crash, just some fall more than others."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Noob here but in always thought large cap value - companies that have something to see that people need. Like PG. Or that are needed to keep things moving - like UNP. 
I’m interested to hear what others think!

Edit: large cap value (good price), PLUS I also look for stocks that have the potential to continue making money regardless of conditions (like things consumers have to have and ways that are needed to get those things where the consumers are)"
03/29/2021,stocks,undervalued or at least well priced blue chips.
03/29/2021,stocks,Big fan of WFC myself
03/29/2021,stocks,PE is around 92 - do you think that’s a problem or just a result of getting (asset) knee-capped? Huge moat.
03/29/2021,stocks,Agreed. I would go best in class or significantly smaller. Smaller banks have lots of room to grow (I like ISBC) and best in class are safe havens with healthy dividends. Not really sure what the hype around WFC is
03/29/2021,stocks,"So I already own DIS, KO, TGT, AAPL and some bank ETFs.

Was thinking about adding ADBE and MSFT they just haven’t hit my target price range yet. Are there any other “boring” stocks you can suggest?

Obviously all stocks have inherent risk. Years ago when I was new to investing I parked some money in GE thinking it was safe. This was prior to their accounting scandals. Learned my lesson, so now I play the diversity game, no single bet too large to blow up my entire portfolio. Plus all of my brokerage account is long money for retirement, and I’m no where near retirement age so I have a high risk tolerance."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Value is usually defined as a company which has a low share price relative to earnings or book value, that's all."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm not entirely sure, I think it was the remediation cost and the severance packages and Covid write downs that they all dumped into the same quarter.   The forward PE is just a little over 12 if you believe the projected numbers.   

I'm confused though because I don't see the huge jump in the other banks, and the asset cap isn't new.  I'm thinking it was just dump all the bad news in one quarter and be done."
03/29/2021,stocks,"My stock picking lady just got me into PG, I'll let you know in 9 months if it was worth it"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Out of the four stocks listed, ko is the oplnly one that is really ""safe"" the others are trading higher than their historical valg5uations but I wouldn't worry about those holding those stocks because they are very solid but are slightly pricey. Those aren't exactly boring stocks tbh, boring stocks are like berkshire, coco cola, p&g, exxon, IBM, kellog, PSA and many more. Stocks like apple and Microsoft are more growth value, they kinda flip between value and growth."
03/29/2021,stocks,True! Thank you for the clarification.
2021-03-29 17:59:11,stocks,"GWPH acquisition Can someone explain what will happen to my GWPH shares when the Jazz acquisition is completed? I'm lost on all the numbers. I have 12 shares @ a cost basis of $110 per share, current price per share is ~$215. Do they disappear and I get paid for them, do they stay as GWPH? Do they change to JAZZ?

Thanks in advance"
03/29/2021,stocks,"The $JAZZ offer, if memory serves, is for each share of $GWPH you will get $220 cash and $20 in $JAZZ shares.

You should ask your broker what happens with fractional shares because looks like you’re going to have around 1.5 shares of $JAZZ.

TL;DR: You will see your $GWPH shares vanish and $2,640 in cash and 1.5 $JAZZ will appear."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The ticker symbol changes, your money stays put in the new ticker."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thanks. Does the valuation change? I read something about 1/6th of a jazz share, not sure where/what I read."
2021-03-29 17:58:30,stocks,"Question about different exchanges Im  new to investing and I dont really know how to formulate this question  in google so I was hoping this community could help me.

If  I own a particular stock in the australian exchange (ASX) and the price  of that stock increases on the US exchange does that mean the value of  the stock in ASX will increase with it the next day? Or are those two  prices different from each other even though they are the same stock?

03/29/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily, because the exchange rate might move in the other direction resulting in opposing moves (price increases on one index, decreases on another). But generally, if you remove the effect of the foreign exchange movement, the two prices should have similar prices (more or less the same); if there is a difference then it is an arbitrage opportunity."
03/29/2021,stocks,Gotta account for bid/ask spread as well. In general the more illiquid one of the exchanges is the more dislocation there can be without necessarily being an arbitrage opportunity.
03/29/2021,stocks,Indeed you are right. Forgot about the liquidity side of it

03/29/2021,stocks,excellent company
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not trying to split hairs but unless I am mistaken, Benjamin Moore is a brand owned by Sherwin Williams.  

I think you make a greater point however.  Is this an industry thing?  When's it gonna hit wall street because it sure hasn't so far."
03/29/2021,stocks,BM is wholly owned by Berkshire Hathaway

2021-03-29 17:35:18,stocks,"Does E*TRADE offer a ticker? Or is there a website where I can enter what I purchased at to see live gains? Hi, title says it all. I've been using E*TRADE for a while and I might just be a super-noob but I don't think it has real-time tracking - or at least none that I can find - and I have to keep refreshing the page.

I also use Google Finance but it obviously doesn't show my gains/losses.

Am I just missing something on the E*TRADE site or is there another website I can use?

Thanks!"
03/29/2021,stocks,You also need to turn on “real time streaming” in your settings to get the tickets to update.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yahoo finance is perfect for this. I have multiple accounts and I use yahoo finance app to track them all simultaneously
03/29/2021,stocks,Where can I find Fidelity live streamer?
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]

Literally just click on your portfolio and look at your holdings. If you don’t see a column for $ and % changes, then click on the gear icon and customize your view.

Also, if you’re any good at excel/sheets, you can just calculate your gains/losses with the google finance functions by imputing your purchase price."

03/29/2021,stocks,Agreed the desktop app in TD is much better than it's mobile apps.  The mobile apps are ok at best
03/29/2021,stocks,I've done this and it's still somewhat static. Like it's an img... that seems to update occasionally. Not a live chart
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is perfect, thank you!"
03/29/2021,stocks,Came to say this. Have E*TRADE but use yahoo finance to track my stocks and days gain. I can input my shares owned and what I paid for them and yahoo finance will give me the daily gain and total gain.
03/29/2021,stocks,This please.
03/29/2021,stocks,I guess I haven't. I'll do some searching to see if I can find it.
03/29/2021,stocks,TD's mobile apps are not good.

03/29/2021,stocks,"The only thing I dislike about ETrade is that when you’re not on margin deposits take several days. Other than that I think it is pretty solid, it’s not as engaging as all of the colors and stuff but I think that feeling of engagement goes hand in hand with dumb moves for me. Once I have to look through the details of mark/cost basis I’ve usually calmed down enough to make smarter moves."

# [5 things to know before the stock market opens Monday](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/5-things-to-know-before-the-stock-market-opens-monday-march-29.html)

*****

> # 1. U.S. futures drop after Friday’s records for Dow, S&P 500

> * U.S. stock futures dropped Monday after a late-session rally Friday sent the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 up over 1.4% and nearly 1.7%, respectively, as stocks benefiting from a successful Covid reopening outperformed, again. The Dow and S&P 500, which both closed at record highs, saw weekly gains about equal to Friday’s advances. Dow stock Boeing rose 3% in Monday’s premarket after a huge aircraft order from Southwest Airlines. Southwest shares were up modestly.

> * The Nasdaq on Friday erased an almost 1% loss and closed up 1.2%. However, the tech-heavy index still declined about 0.6% for the week, with just three days left in March. The Nasdaq was tracking for a slight monthly loss, while the Dow and S&P 500 were poised to turn in solid gains for the month.

> * The 10-year Treasury yield was steady Monday, trading below its recent 14-month high. The rapid rise in yields this year has been troublesome for growth stocks, many of them tech names, as higher interest rates erode the value of future profits and squeeze market valuations.

*****

> # 2. Credit Suisse, Nomura take hit from U.S. hedge fund fallout

> * Credit Suisse warned Monday of a “highly significant” hit to its first-quarter results, after the Swiss-based bank began exiting positions with a large U.S. hedge fund that melted down on margin calls last week. Japanese firm Nomura said it’s evaluating a potential loss estimated at $2 billion. Shares of Nomura and Credit Suisse were getting slammed in Monday’s premarket.

> * The hedge fund at the center of the fallout is Archegos Capital Management, which was forced to liquidate positions at the end of last week. The moves by the multibillion dollar U.S. family office, founded by former Tiger equity analyst Bill Hwang, caused a wave of selling pressure Friday in U.S. media stocks and Chinese internet ADRs.

*****

> # 3. Ever Given cargo ship blocking Suez Canal is partially floated

> * The giant Ever Given container ship blocking the Suez Canal was partially refloated early Monday, days after the vessel got stuck and brought a vital global trade route to a standstill. The Suez Canal Authority said the ship’s course has been corrected by 80% and further maneuvers will resume when the water level rises later in the day. It remains unclear when waterway will reopen to traffic as hundreds of ships are backed up and waiting to enter the Suez. Maritime data showed at least ten tankers and container ships changed course to avoid the logjam, including U.S. ships carrying natural gas for Cheniere and Shell/BG Group.

*****

> # 4. Biden to push infrastructure before health and family care

> * President Joe Biden will separate his sprawling plan to upgrade the nation’s infrastructure into two separate pieces. Biden on Wednesday will unveil the first part of his plan, focusing on items like rebuilding roads and railways. The second part of the president’s plan — including child-care and health-care reforms, aspects of what’s sometimes called social infrastructure — will be released in “in just a couple of weeks,” White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Sunday in an interview. Taken as a whole, the legislation is expected to cost more than $3 trillion.

*****

> # 5. Fauci warns U.S. only ‘at the corner’ of Covid pandemic

> * With the possibility of safer summer barbeques just a few months away, along with the promise of widespread Covid vaccine supply in the U.S. by the end of May, many Americans may be feeling as though the nation has finally turned the corner on the pandemic. However, White House Chief Medical Advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned that America is really only “at the corner.”

> * New daily U.S. cases, while sharply lower than January’s high, increased 12% in the past seven days compared to a week ago, according to a CNBC analysis of Johns Hopkins University data. Nearly half of people ages 65 and older have completed all of their necessary shots, according to CDC data. However, just 20% of the adult population is considered fully vaccinated.

03/29/2021,stocks,"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/u-food-drug-administration-approves-025900954.html

Yay, $BLUE"
03/29/2021,stocks,Only Monday in a while we’re it’s not green
03/29/2021,stocks,Cheers! Anyone's thoughts on PAVE?
2021-03-29 16:40:54,stocks,"$RMO is uniquely positioned to turn EV upside down  What is the biggest thing holding EV adoption back? Batteries. The company that solves this could be responsible for shifting everything to EV.

Jim Cramer and BorgWarner CEO Fred Lissalde discuss how 45% of Borg Warner revenue will be tied to EV tech by 2030. Lissalde is specifically bullish on $RMO who Borg Warner has a 20% stake in. Who do you think will be supplying the battery tech??? :)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html)

[https://eepower.com/news/borgwarner-and-romeo-power-technology-form-ev-battery-module-joint-venture/#](https://eepower.com/news/borgwarner-and-romeo-power-technology-form-ev-battery-module-joint-venture/#)

Additionally, $RMO and Ecellix have signed an MOU.

[https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html)

Have people read the description of Ecellix's eCell technology? Ecellix is Romeo's strategic partner. My gut feeling is that Ecellix can do what QS is claiming, and they are way ahead of QS considering they are working with Romeo to get their cells tested and moving forward with packing. They must be working on packing their cells already if they went ahead with partnering with Romeo. Ecellix just does not call it ""Solid state battery"". In fact, QS is not completely solid state. They use liquid to some extent. If Romeo/Excellix can move trucks, then it would be a cake to move passenger cars. With BorgWarner backing up Romeo, it will turn VW's vision upside down. GM, Ford, etc will come to BorgWarner/Romeo/Ecellix. Guess who would want it the most even if it has to pay high price. FISKER

Right now $RMO is a joke under $12. With an earnings call this week and a potential announcement from the company to get those warrants exercised, $20 is a very reasonable starting point. Either way, Romeo is perfectly positioned to be a major distruptor in a disruptive industry."
03/29/2021,stocks,"What puts them in position better than someone, like say, Samsung, Panasonic, or LG? 

Samsung makes some of the best lithium ion cells for consumers currently, imo. Seems risky to bet that someone like Romeo has some technology advantage over a large company who has a large budget for product research. Although, whoever makes a big breakthrough will make a large profit. Batteries/energy storage is a large barrier for green energy."
03/29/2021,stocks,God I hope so I'm getting shredded being bullish on rmo
03/29/2021,stocks,Imo u have better battery plays like Microvast outthere...
03/29/2021,stocks,You lost me at Cramer
03/29/2021,stocks,🚀 🚀 🚀
03/29/2021,stocks,This is literally what you just posted in the daily thread.
03/29/2021,stocks,"So how exactly will Romeo ""turn VW's vision upside town""?

The latter isn't a chump.  It is nothing less than the Next Tesla, Volkswagen, Das Auto."
2021-03-29 16:27:47,stocks,"EGO electric powered lawn equipment owned by Chevron Corp. CVX My retired father in law keeps talking about how he wants all electric equipment from now on. I was curious on if they were publicly traded. Turns out they're owned by Chevron. I'm sure it's a small part of they're bussiness, but I figure my father in law is a good indicator of the general public. Curious what others thought."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just to be clear: EGO equipment is owned by Chervon, not Chevron.

No, a major global energy producer and supplier does not operate a division that makes battery-powered leaf blowers and hedge trimmers."
03/29/2021,stocks,"$TTC has electric consumer grade mowers and alternative fuel/energy products for their commercial stuff if he’s looking for green that isn’t big oil. Plus, they are in the business of turf management so I’d imagine their stuff works better than a tiny sub of an energy/oil Corp."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I love my EGO. I have the mower, weed Wacker and blower. They are great. I thought about investing in them one time. Didn't know who owned them."
2021-03-29 16:20:15,stocks,"Arht media (ART) - holograms, the future of meetings/conferences Anyone following this stock? They produce real life holograms for conferencing/meetings etc, recently used for EPITOME and highly regarded among the speakers. YOY quarterly revenue growth of 133% and currently very cheap share price. Seems it has lots of room to grow as holograms become more dominant in many venues. Small cap with decent daily volume. I picked up 1000 shares just for the hell of it but wanted to get others opinions.

03/29/2021,stocks,Looked into the stock after my company used them in a presentation. Very cool effect. It’s gimmicky but a real company. Thing is it’s a penny stock so very volatile. Don’t know a whole lot about the financials but back when I looked into it they were losing money.
03/29/2021,stocks,"It sounds cool but I can’t help but think it’s satellite radio 2.0, an innovation that doesn’t add enough substance and gets passed over quickly by the next development. Why wouldn’t similar effects be achieved with AR/VR? Is there an actual benefit to a company for spending money on this or would it mostly be to look cool?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Looks great but it is a penny stock with a huge dilution.
03/29/2021,stocks,"They currently hold 1m in debt over cash but I don’t find that too concerning as it’s quite new and upcoming feature, it’s a very cool concept!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think for right now it just looks cool, but in the future I can see it having endless applications where in person is required but not attainable"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I've been thinking of uses. One being medical field. Let's say having a 3d body infront of you which your able to peel away the layers. Bodies are crazy expensive to keep and are not reusable. Another areas of education would befit as well. Also advertising. Anyways, this product would have to work seamlessly with user input or its a bust."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Its fun, I just went to the website. I would like to know more before it seems like a good investment. The hologram box itself is big and expensive looking. No one will have that in there home. So its strictly for corporate use. I get the benefits of having a hologram vs a video. Although I'm not sure the difference warrants a change from video."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Wouldn’t AR be way more adaptable, realistic looking, cheaper, and easier to implement for the same purpose though? afaik they’re already using AR/VR for this exact purpose, and I can’t help but feel a hologram is a significantly more expensive and restrictive way of doing the same thing"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I agree, practical use isn’t there yet, I can see this being huge in a few years though"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I personally don't like wearing a VR headset and I'm sure I'm not alone. I much prefer being able to see my actual surroundings as well as what I'm supposed to be looking at, also it's uncomfortable and most of them say not to use them for too long. I think these holograms might have potential."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well ill be keeping an eye on it. Couple more uses came to me, advertising and education. I think a hologram would be great to get people to notice your product as they get a 3d look. Education would be great for  a number of reasons. Let's say medical. If its possible to get a 3d live action hologram cadaver. Or engineering studios getting a 3d hologram for a building be designed. Anyways. Thanks."
03/29/2021,stocks,cell phones used to be an entire suitcase. AR implemented into a device no larger than standard prescription glasses is not far off. I’m pretty sure it’s far in development actually
03/29/2021,stocks,Precisely my thoughts!
2021-03-29 16:02:30,stocks,"ARKX: Who is in? Hello all, I am just interested in general sentiments towards ARKX, which is set to IPO tomorrow. It will not let me do a poll on here so maybe just type if you are buying on IPO day tomorrow, waiting a bit, or will never touch it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Check out the holdings, PRNT is #2 by weight. PRNT is Ark's 3D printing etf.  
  
Yo dawg, I heard you liked our ETFs, so we put one of our ETFs in another one of our ETFs so you can buy our ETFs while buying another ETF."

03/29/2021,stocks," hell nah I don't need a ""space ETF"" with alibaba, john deere, workhorse, alphabet, amazon, garmin, JD, and tencent..."
03/29/2021,stocks,Half the tickers in this etf make no sense. WKHS? Really?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Pretty sure GILT and IRDN will be in it.   As well as SPCE and LMT ect.   Honestly I think we all know the big names.    I’m just curious about the more speculative stocks like the SPACS , ect"
03/29/2021,stocks,"A little bit on IPO and a lotta bit in the next few weeks

Edit: okay maybe a bit less now"
03/29/2021,stocks,Anyone know price point for opening ? I hope sub $50 a share. I read some where that $75 was a starting point.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I won’t get involved from day 1, but will keep close eye to the ETF. Exciting, nonetheless."
03/29/2021,stocks,Honestly this looks like a military etf
03/29/2021,stocks,I think it’s going to be a long time until putting stuff in space actually becomes profitable.
03/29/2021,stocks,"She putting her own shitty picks in it, to pump then in her other etfs, jd? Netflix? Wkhs? Seriously wtf"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well well, a few months ago Cathie was the Queen bee on reddit and look at it now. A few weeks of drawback on ARK funds and suddenly ""we don't know what she's been smoking."""
03/29/2021,stocks,"If it doesn't have private shares in SpaceX or Starlink, forget it.

99% space business is garbage right now. May as well just buy Boeing at this point if the etf only has public traded companies.

If this IPO in 2050 or 2100, that's a different story."
03/29/2021,stocks,This is a space ETF? it has Netflix but not MAXR? wtf..
03/29/2021,stocks,I was excited until they released their holdings. Not for me.
03/29/2021,stocks,Big fat no.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I got to say: I'm disappointed. A lot of these companies don't feel like they belong in the theme for this ETF.

I'll just continue to directly invest in Virgin Galactic and add Starlink whenever that IPOs."
03/29/2021,stocks,Not me.. I dont know much about it and that is enough for me to stay away from any space ventures. But I will keep an eye on it though.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Nope.  A lot of the shine has gone off ARK recently and so IMO this is even riskier than it might have been a couple of months ago.  Investor confidence in ARK Invest has been shaken with their recent struggles and rather dubious analysis of Tesla, and so interest in this fund could be a lot weaker than expected."
03/29/2021,stocks,Why is the us dollar one of the holdings? Sounds like a bad investment to me.
03/29/2021,stocks,nope
03/29/2021,stocks,"Kratos is the play. Went in on them quite a while ago. The things they do are remarkable and their  shares outstanding are quite limited for a company with such potential. 

Insider sell off was highly advertised but when you look into it they bought 3 shares for every 1 sold...minimum. Some of the leadership bought 5:1. 

Obviously I am in with shares. Not messing with calls RN. Chicks dig the LONGball."
03/29/2021,stocks,Netflix is my favorite space stonk. Mmmyes much better for a space etf than rocket lab.
03/29/2021,stocks,It’s ok guys. Jesus told her she needs to include Netflix in the ETF. Can you imagine the growth they will have when they reach the alien markets? Exponential growth!
03/29/2021,stocks,"John Deere,
Netflix,
Workhorse,
JD.com,

Cathie wood is fucking with us at this point"
03/29/2021,stocks,Will buy it after we have had the market crash in tech when the inflation numbers will cause sell offs.
03/29/2021,stocks,Not me. ARK funds are getting pummeled. I got enough problems
03/29/2021,stocks,"I avoid all fads, I'm not into buying the latest greatest popular thing.   Ever since the time I got  burned by buying a pair of parachute pants....I learned my lesson."
03/29/2021,stocks,"IMHO it will probably skyrocket for a while because it's an ARK ETF and nowadays it seems that their analysts cannot be wrong, ever.

TBH any space related industry *should* not be considered profitable investments at the moment. People keep saying ""yeah what about orbital factories"" and ""asteroid mining will be the eldorado"" but in 2019 we were *at least* a century away from that. Now we have COVID to factor in, and I seriously doubt that space will be the focus of the next 5 to 10 years. Medical tech, surely. Fintech, too. Manufacturing innovation, probably. But space? Not really sure about that.

But ARKX will be in the green for a while because it's Couric's project. And (too) many think she cannot be wrong purely on 2020 ARK results"
03/29/2021,stocks,nah i'm good with just tesla and square.  I think they are stretching now.......
03/29/2021,stocks,"God dammit i was gonna clean my fish bowl tomorrow, can’t be doing that on IPO day"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Im gonna pass on ARKX, the industry is too early for me right now."
03/29/2021,stocks,Sounds like you belong on a Dave Ramsey thread lol
03/29/2021,stocks,"I am, either on IPO or within a few days."
03/29/2021,stocks,I am buying a little bit on IPO and the next few weeks a lot more hopefully.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not a chance. Too much China and don’t kid yourself, as soon as possible she will bait and switch that fund to add 10% TSLA."
03/29/2021,stocks,Been holding calls and shares on LMT because I think it’s undervalued. Don’t think I’ll buy ARKX right away though because I know nothing about the other tickers
03/29/2021,stocks,"I would be cautious with this one. As there are not many spacestocks, it is kinda foreseeable what she will buy, I am afraid she will get frontrunned. And in general, I would not buy a space exploration stock/etf during a transition from growth to value."
03/29/2021,stocks,"For me IPOs scare me initially, my approach is to let the IPO roll out and let the hype happen. In some cases there is a sell off and often is oversold which then allows for a better buying opportunity. That is my general approach to an IPO. I may look into if I feel like this occurs which may take a while. If it doesn’t, then didn’t meet my investment approach and I move on. 

Side note: I do think this thing will soar due to the speculation and hype"
03/29/2021,stocks,Not me. Ever since Cathie said that thing about Jesus telling her how to invest I don't take anything she does or says serious
03/29/2021,stocks,In
03/29/2021,stocks,Cathie needs to get her shit sorted before I’m jumping in. All the ARK funds are down pretty hard in the short term. Unwilling to invest more in these until she shows prior performance was real and not just an artifact of a hot market and a couple outliers like TSLA with super strong performance.
03/29/2021,stocks,IMO ARK just rode the Tech bull wave. The admiration reddit had for someone who is picking stocks because God is really strange.
03/29/2021,stocks,I wouldn't invest in any company that has to compete against spacex.
03/29/2021,stocks,It’s got garbage legacy companies like Boeing and Lockheed...I’m starting to think Cathy might be a modern day snake oil fraud...
03/29/2021,stocks,"They have the fund in Japan, look at their holding and buy before pump."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m definitely not buying in until the holdings are completely changed, if that ever happens. This ETF is billed as a “Space” ETF and it’s filled with John Deere, Netflix, and defense contractors"
03/29/2021,stocks,Throwing my stimmy check at it and seeing what happens.
03/29/2021,stocks,"$UFO actually focused on space, not hype. Look at the YTD of any ARK fund and do some research."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think I'm waiting, my biggest fear is like with almost every overly hype IPO last couple months, we end up in a case everyone waits on line to buy, we get told a certain price, then it launches at some absurdly disappointing price, then everyone runs, and the interest fades. I actually really like ARK, so believe in it, but it's really from experiences, Snow and Airbnb seem to be the most perfect examples, people barely talk about Snow these days anymore. I think ARK will have a much better experience, but I still think it's worth waiting out a bit for it too settle, esp in this market."
03/29/2021,stocks,It's def going to be a pump tmorrow on that etf just bc cathie has the hype from a fanbase. I am gonna wait and see what plays out these coming days not to mention that all of their etfs are all down a lot.
03/29/2021,stocks,Flat broke from buying dips.     Looks like we paper trading it
03/29/2021,stocks,SPCE & HOL for sure
03/29/2021,stocks,"The name of the company, Aerotyne International. It is a cutting edge high-tech firm out of the Midwest awaiting imminent patent approval on the next generation of radar detectors that have both huge military and civilian applications now."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I am definitely in. But not right away. I think it may shoot up first day out, then drop again. I’ll wait and see where it levels out."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Other than TSLA back then, I don't touch anything that IPOs as a personal rule. It seems no matter how much DD I do, it goes the opposite direction, so I'll just sit back."
03/29/2021,stocks,Not interested. That holding list is not compelling to me for outsized returns.
03/29/2021,stocks,Are ETF'S like normal IPOs where the price is bloated before it opens for trading?
03/29/2021,stocks,"JD ? WTF NETFLIX WTF TESLA IS WHERE?

Serious BS this ETF"
03/29/2021,stocks,Sirius xm... why
03/29/2021,stocks,Trades tomorrow right
03/29/2021,stocks,Weird holdings. Anyone know what it’s expecting to open at?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Has anyone calculated, or heard, what the initial price will be?"
03/29/2021,stocks,I am incredibly unimpressed with the holdings choices. Probably not getting into this one which is disappointing because I had high hopes for it
03/29/2021,stocks,Bofa is in it
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm in
03/29/2021,stocks,"No, all my ARK investments are in the red. Never again."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm a dude, playin a dude, disguised as another dude!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's called fund of funds, a few ETFs is like this."
03/29/2021,stocks,"""The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or benefitting from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.""

Is there any company in QQQ/VTI/VT that doesn't benefit from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Its fishy af. Also netflix and workhorse?????

Cathie is high af"
03/29/2021,stocks,"so, double fees?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Yep
03/29/2021,stocks,~~dont forget John Deere is on there. Can't wait to drive my tractors in space~~
03/29/2021,stocks,Have you not looked at ARKK? They have bigger holdings of certain stocks that are actually the #1 holding in the other funds like ARKG. I'm pretty sure ARKG's top 5 holdings are in ARKK in even bigger quanities.
03/29/2021,stocks,You'd love GXTG
03/29/2021,stocks,I am surprised there is no TESLA lol
03/29/2021,stocks,John Deere creating space tractors to farm the moon confirmed
03/29/2021,stocks,thanks for sharing
03/29/2021,stocks,Cant wait for the Netflix spaceship with the U.S dollar taped to the side. While we create a sustainable habitat with our Deere & Co space tractors. Don’t forget to get your shitty space products through JD.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I see a god of war character, a bunch of names with numbers in them, and workhorse....

Looks about right."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Honeywell, John Deere, Lockheed, Boeing, Airbus: it's like some unholy mix of speculative tech and DJI. 

Kidding aside it makes sense there's a fair amount of industrial companies in a space etf, though I was a little surprised by Deere and Honeywell. Also she probably doesn't want to debut an ETF of all speculative things while so much of it is in freefall."
03/29/2021,stocks,Looks excellent though...
03/29/2021,stocks,"Netflix is the strangest one.

Don't they realize most internet traffic is ground/undersea cable based?"
03/29/2021,stocks,A fuckin joke mate
03/29/2021,stocks,Is WKHS the next car we are launching into space? Did I miss that press release
03/29/2021,stocks,SFTW and VACQ are the two I've been getting in
03/29/2021,stocks,"They have the fund in Japan, you can look at all their holdings. You can also just buy $UFO"
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,Doesn't stop other shares from rising due to expectations.
03/29/2021,stocks,It’ll take light years
03/29/2021,stocks,SpaceX but their still private
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think the idea is to fill the ETF with holdings that profit from other companies flying to space.

NASA, ESA, Spacex and Co. will buy their products."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Hard pass from me.

$UFO and $ROKT have more appropriate holdings if you want a real space-focused ETF."
03/29/2021,stocks,In 2050 itll be too late mate
03/29/2021,stocks,Buy Scottish Management Trust for SpaceX.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Because most people think it will relate to space exploration. According to my interpretation of ARKX objective, any company can be included in this ETF.

""The Adviser defines “Space Exploration” as leading, enabling, or ***benefitting*** from technologically enabled products and/or services that occur beyond the surface of the Earth.""

&#x200B;

Which company doesn't benefit from it? You have to be an all-cash, all-paperwork business with no virtual presence to not to benefit."
03/29/2021,stocks,Much safer to buy this one (after the initial spike) than it was to buy Ark in early Feb though. Personally I am not interested but I will watch.
03/29/2021,stocks,Hah thanks for the info
03/29/2021,stocks,Have my upvote before inflation makes it worth only 3/4 of an upvote
03/29/2021,stocks,Care to elaborate how does higher/lower inflation affect tech market?
03/29/2021,stocks,I think ARK is meant to be a long term hold. If you look at the 5 year on them you’ll see they have all doubled-quadrupled in the last 5 years.
03/29/2021,stocks,"> IMHO it will probably skyrocket

Oh I see what you did there"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I think there are so many technologies that slowly begin to become profitable in the next 10 years, but nothing in space."
03/29/2021,stocks,How much do you know about space companies?
03/29/2021,stocks,"spacex, nanosats are changing the game. We're not gonna be mining asteroids anytime soon, but things like starlink are absolutely revolutionary and are here today."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thats coz you dont know about the industry and cannot fathom how much of a paradigm shift is coming with the reusability of rockets, price to send a kilo in orbit are about to shrink ten-fold"
03/29/2021,stocks,ETF not IPO
03/29/2021,stocks,"tbh, the son of god has some fire picks"
03/29/2021,stocks,"the etfs are basically all in tech...

i wonder what sectors are having a big pull back, oh wait thats right, its tech"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Every ark fund has outperformed s&p every year since inception, and had an insane year last in 2020 almost doubling in value and you say cathie needs to get her shit together..."
03/29/2021,stocks,Look at the 5 year chart in any Ark fund and stop being so short term focused.
03/29/2021,stocks,What do you mean ETF’s? What DO you mean ETF?
03/29/2021,stocks,A man who dresses up as a drag king?
03/29/2021,stocks,A rooster illusion
03/29/2021,stocks,The only thing that's space related in this ETF is Cathie herself cause she must've been up in space when making this ETF
03/29/2021,stocks,It's hard to say what her strategy is. A lot of the FANG stocks and others could just be cash placeholders for the ETF.
03/29/2021,stocks,Workhorse is on there because of their drones
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just wait to see if she buys VACG, if she doesn’t, you have your answer..."
03/29/2021,stocks,">netflix

They're doing a Lost in Space reboot. Kathy Woods is a god-fearing christian she doesn't need to know more than that."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this one is a “Hell no” from me for now. Lost enough money with ARKK after she cleverly put 10% in Tesla on the premise that it just might go to $4000. No more Ark etfs until she comes down from whatever she’s been taking."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Double Fees aaallll theeee waaaayyyyyy

(RIP double rainbow guy, you were a treasure)"
03/29/2021,stocks,John deere does a lot of GPS tech research and development.  It's a smart pick.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Seems like they do autonomous driving for tractors with navigation from space.

https://www.nasa.gov/feature/directorates/spacetech/spinoff/john_deere"
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol
03/29/2021,stocks,John Deere is honestly a smart pick. They have a really impressive autonomy program
03/29/2021,stocks,There's a difference between having the same holdings across different funds and straight up having one of your own funds as a top holding lol
03/29/2021,stocks,"And unlike most of these, there is actually a Tesla in space :P"
03/29/2021,stocks,Honeywell makes Aerospace equipment - why is that a surprise they would be included?
03/29/2021,stocks,Why is Netflix in the fund? Lol!
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think it's a stretch, but if satellite broadband is available globally (i.e. like Starlink), that should be a boon for all streaming services. So that would significantly expand Netflix's potential market."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m no expert but consider this—House Democrats recently revealed a plan to “close the digital divide” in rural America by investing 94 billion dollars. All this spending is in addition to what has already been investing in internet infrastructure. Conversely, the entire starlink program was estimated in 2018 to cost 10 billion. Granted, this price disparity does not count non municipality internet infrastructure cost such as routers, tax credits for computers etc. In addition, starlink has advertised cheaper high speed rates than many broadband providers. So just off the dome it seems like satellite based internet infrastructure has a lower cost and therefore disruption potential at least in underdeveloped places (including US potentially) and potentially well developed areas like cities depending on cost of maintenance."
03/29/2021,stocks,ETFs are the new CDOs
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not true, ETFs don’t work like individual stock IPOs. Huge names in this ETF will not move by more than a percent."
03/29/2021,stocks,"ok, thats a bummer, but good to know, maybe worth putting some money else where and check back."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Please don't spread misinformation, this is not how etfs work. Etf's don't move like regular stock as dang pointed out"
03/29/2021,stocks,That kinda stopped a month or two ago when interest rates started spiking.
03/29/2021,stocks,Light year is actually a measurement of distance.
03/29/2021,stocks,"So basically they can add absolutely anything that they want to this ETF since you can find a way to make an excuse for any company benefiting from technology products that are beyond the Earth's surface in some way if you spin it hard enough.

Ok. It doesn't change that I'm disappointed in it. They might as well just call it the ""ARK: Random Stuff"" ETF if they are going to stretch the definition this hard to include absolutely anything with a digital presence."
03/29/2021,stocks,"My worry would be an initial burst by people with faith in ARK, but then demand will be soft and it wil be harder to find buyers.  So spike at offering, then decline.  We will see though."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think the concern is most emerging tech is funded by debt, so if inflation rises and the Fed raises interest rates, they might go bankrupt trying to pay back their debt or can’t get funding as easily."
03/29/2021,stocks,General principles. Not just applicable to tech but as we are seeing some heavy sell-offs in tech last month and prospect of parts like semiconductors that are hard to get and huge problems in others parts of the supply chain I think tech will be hit harder than other markets once people get scared of high inflation numbers.
03/29/2021,stocks,No doubt. I just picked my favorites from them and invested in individual names. Some of which I cannot speak of here because they’re “meme” stocks even though they’re not. Rhymes with gailantir
03/29/2021,stocks,"lol, they have tripled in the past year - it's not a slow and steady growth opportunity, it's just a meme stock fund."
03/29/2021,stocks,"As much as a moderately torough DD can let me know...and that means as much as an average investor without specific market related know-how and/or connections in the industry.

I'm always happy to be proven wrong, however, and it's not just a saying. But as long as the hype on ARKX is supported only by ""it's Couric' stuff!"" and ""asteroid mining is the future!"" I'll pass. I've alredy paid my dues to hype/meme investing this year"
03/29/2021,stocks,IPO of an ETF... correct?
03/29/2021,stocks,I am questioning the short term performance and whether the recent (2020) success your highlighting is real or due to disproportionate success of just a couple key holdings.  I suspect it’s those key holdings which is why we are seeing a disproportionally bad performance compared to the S&P in the short term.
03/29/2021,stocks,"""Whataboutism"" the 5year chart, the comment was YTD.

Past earnings do not = future gains"
03/29/2021,stocks,Are they space drones??
03/29/2021,stocks,lmfao
03/29/2021,stocks,Might as well put DISH network and comcast on there too then
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, people corrected me about their extensive satellite program. But something like space systems loral would make a lot more sense than this hodgepodge of space-adjacent companies in that ETF"
03/29/2021,stocks,Ohh I read your comment too fast. My mistake.
03/29/2021,stocks,I’d rather they build them that way.  Build components and then offer mixes.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't invest in Honeywell and don't follow them closely, I was under the impression they were moving more towards industrial software and stuff, with a few acquisitions in that vein."
03/29/2021,stocks,Ever watched Interstellar?
03/29/2021,stocks,Astronauts need to binge series in space ;)
03/29/2021,stocks,Every space explorer has the 24% loading symbol on their visor. Free advertising
03/29/2021,stocks,and no MAXR lol
03/29/2021,stocks,What will you do on your 100 year voyage to another star system? Exactly.
03/29/2021,stocks,"are you sure you want to watch NFLX in 360p in your giant 70"" TV?  


I mean satellite internet have so many ifs and buts that the sun, stars and cloud all needs to align to stream as you do with cable."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Lower cost, no.

Starlink is $100/month for service.

They wont steal from anyone already using a cheaper landline, but more rural coverage, sure."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not quite but i get you, if you are interested this is my take on the problematics with etfs and passive index investing

03/29/2021,stocks,Nothing will ever stop greed. It will only take short breaks. Average P/E is 25 these days. Used to be 16 was the norm. Everyone wants an edge so they are willing to jump in earlier.
03/29/2021,stocks,What is time but the distance between now and then
03/29/2021,stocks,It’ll take parsecs
03/29/2021,stocks,"I wasn't going to invest in the first place. So I am not disappointed. But the fund objectives follow a trend. Some people think ARKG is pure genomics based revolution. IMO, the fund objective (though less extensive than ARKX), has place for a lot of companies besides biotech companies.

""ARKG is an actively managed ETF that seeks long-term growth of capital by investing under normal circumstances primarily ***(at least 80% of its assets)*** in domestic and foreign equity securities of companies across multiple sectors, including ***health care, information technology, materials, energy and consumer discretionary***, that are relevant to the Fund’s investment theme of the genomics revolution.""

&#x200B;

Also, in the ARK funds, other 20% can go for anything I guess."
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah I absolutely wouldn’t touch it for a few weeks.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily bankruptcy.  These kinds of companies in their early stages typically need a lot of borrowed money to grow.  If borrowing is expensive then they'll probably borrow less (or else risk bankruptcy) and so also grow less and be less profitable.

Furthermore most of the value of these kinds of growth companies are *far future* profits, not near future profits.  When bond yields/interest rates are higher, those future profits have a lower current value, and so the stock price also drops."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Sort of correct but that’s probably the #2 reason. 

The biggest by far is how the current discount factor affects earnings in the future. I.e if you think a company has $1,000,000 in earnings in 2030, it looks entirely different in NPV if you use a 7% or 4% discount even if the company and its earnings remain the same(depending what you use, can move value 25-50% lower with a small increase. Ergo any company making the bulk of its earnings 5-20 years out is highly influenced).  

This discount factor is influenced by the Fed rate which is influenced by inflation."
03/29/2021,stocks,Why do you keep saying Couric?
03/29/2021,stocks,"I just looked at ARKX's holdings. Not very exciting from my perspective. There are some exciting space companies out there but it looks like ARKX is playing it safe and buying...Netflix? So you are probably correct to avoid ARKX, at least for now"
03/29/2021,stocks,etfs dont go up or down based on how many people buy the etf. its based on the preformance of the holdings of the etf. everyone in the world can buy the etf but that wont make it spike in price. though it gives them more money to invest which in tern should increase the price since they have more money to invest and more returns
03/29/2021,stocks,"Exactly, you're worrying about 3 months over what it's done since it's inception.  Rather short sited."
03/29/2021,stocks,“Past earnings do not = future gains” says the guy talking about the YTD chart 🤔
03/29/2021,stocks,Exactly so why did you day look at ytd?
03/29/2021,stocks,"The ETF covers companies that involve products/services above the surface of the earth (doesn't necessarily mean space). So no, they are not space drones , just normal delivery drones."
03/29/2021,stocks,Google made balloons once... Add them too
03/29/2021,stocks,No worries bb
03/29/2021,stocks,"You don't, but billions of people in Africa and Central Asia might.
Even some places in the US have shitty satellite internet and can't use streaming services."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm not an expert, but I think you're completely wrong.

ETFs are traded like stocks, of course their price goes up and down depending on how much people are buying and selling for. ETFs have a NAV (Net Asset Value) which is the price of its underlying shares. The NAV can differ from the ETF's own market price. Of course the NAV and the ETF market price will always be *around* the same value, because the market corrects any over and undervaluations. But they are not the same."
03/29/2021,stocks,Do understand but if billions of dollars funnels into this ETF quickly you can bet your bottom $$ that those underlying assets and the etf will soar. Then the same with a sell off. Market sentiment is going to be similar in the ETF and the underlying. Those names in ETF will be getting more hype than normal just due to the ETF and people finding out about these companies. It has already started with those just from the shear mention of the ETF.
03/29/2021,stocks,"This needs more upvotes, looks like most people here think etf's behave like actual stocks."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm not worried. I'm holding 1K+ of each ARKK, ARKW, ARKQ, IZRL since Q1 2020.

And I will not touch ARKX, the setup is garbage and feels like a panic move by the firm. Netflix, US dollar, Alphabet, Amazon, Deere, Autodesk, etc... Why does the fund need to be padded?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Then why not just throw Amazon in there?! Fuckers have drones and space ships too. 

Cathy is high as giraffe pussy."
03/29/2021,stocks,Not really. Lookup creation/redemption process for ETFs. ETFs do not have the same supply demand issue that a single stock or a CEF has which will significantly differ from NAV despite market corrections that you would expect to take place.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The amount of money that will go in the ark etf will be very small in comparison to the entire market cap the etf will cover. The underlying assets will probably benefit a bit from the ipo, but it won't be very significant to most of them, so don't expect to see +10% rise on IPO"
03/29/2021,stocks,"US dollar is standard lol, its in all their funds, they always have 1% or so laying around in cash ready to buy stuff.

And panic move? They announced this back in January when they were at all time highs, they had to wait 75 days to list it per SEC rules."
03/29/2021,stocks,Amazon may make sense: [https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/amazons-project-kuiper-is-more-than-the-companys-response-to-spacex](https://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/aerospace/satellites/amazons-project-kuiper-is-more-than-the-companys-response-to-spacex)
03/29/2021,stocks,10% over what time period?
03/29/2021,stocks,On the day of the IPO
03/29/2021,stocks,I am referring to a 1-3 month timeline.
2021-03-29 15:23:15,stocks,"Do institutions trade mostly long term or also short term / day trading? Do the big institutions enter positions with the expectation to sell in a few years time or so, or do they also enter short term trading or even day trading? Or does it vary between institutions and their own trading preferences"
03/29/2021,stocks,Everything.  There is a desk for everything.
03/29/2021,stocks,If you had billions how would you play it? Too much capital not to be playing every side
03/29/2021,stocks,Both
03/29/2021,stocks,"Institutions have to make money constantly, they do day trades, swing trades, forex, long term holds, everything. Competition for more capital is cut throat and they have to maximize profits at all times. They have traders and managers to pay along with needing to make profits for their investors along with the fact they are a business and are chasing revenues themselves."
03/29/2021,stocks,"both, if they don't trade daily then something is very wrong and will have effects to the liquidity in the markets."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It depends, in the old days, some banks would take a position to facilitate a client, now maybe not so much.  If you are a buy side firm, it depends on the discipline your from employs.  I think it depend on the firm as well as the situation.  A long term investor may take a short term position in something that has an immediate catalyst"
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,So they may play with stocks like GME short term too?
03/29/2021,stocks,cool
03/29/2021,stocks,Probably not
03/29/2021,stocks,"No.  Those departments are where you park idiot children of people with power so they can’t screw up.  It’s on par with being a corporate money manager / treasurer.  That’s not where institutions make money, it’s simply a base for collateral, like buying land and sending the village idiot to make sure the pigs don’t revolt."
03/29/2021,stocks,Read up on the backstory of how the whole GME stuff happened and you'll have your answer there. TL/DR answer is yes.
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,I know about that. I was referring to the situation if such institution would happen to venture to ride the bullish trend in the last months
03/29/2021,stocks,Use deductive reasoning. Institutions held over 100% of GME shorts does that seem like a safe investment? If you look at a profile on Webull you can see how much of it is owned by institutions. Even a company like NIO has 36% institutional ownage
03/29/2021,stocks,That’s as simple as it gets.
03/29/2021,stocks,I’m sure some have
03/29/2021,stocks,"In second read I understood it, thanks."
2021-03-29 15:19:09,stocks,"Is it worth investing in long term holds (S&P, VTI etc) if my employer offers a great pension scheme? Per title my employer offers a great pension scheme so I'm not sure if it's worth privately investing into long term holds.

I've got a big purchase coming up within the next 2 years (first home) but already have close to £50k saved for it. The more I can put towards it the better and I've been told before don't invest what you need within the next 2 years. So. I'm puzzled on if it's even worth investing in say the s&p with my leftover savings I have or just keep hold of the cash and let my employers pension scheme continue on the side?

For reference I put in 6% of my monthly income and they put in an additional 13%."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Personally, I would save it until you purchase a house. It never hurts to have a little cash for repairs or updates."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah I would avoid investing the money you're saving for a house. If you did invest it, and the markets go up by 10% or so, then congrats you save a couple months of saving. But if the markets tank 30% for some reason, it could take a couple extra years to save for the house.

Beyond that, the more you invest the faster you can retire (if you want to)"
03/29/2021,stocks,I would spend a bit of time on r/personalfinance but you’ve gotten good advice here on saving towards a goal.
03/29/2021,stocks,"My job has a pension, but I still have multiple personal investments. You can never prepare enough for the golden years, IMO. 

Having said that, if it’s for a down payment I’d put it in a money market or something like that. Ask your bank what they offer. My bank, Patelco, offers a MM account if you have a minimum amount."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I would not invest if you plan to access the money in 2 years, yes interest rates are crap, and you may look foolish if the market flies, but if it cracks, your nest egg can get cut in half real quick.since your employer has a retirement fund, I would wait and hold on, so you can make the home purchase"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I am a state government employee here in the US, that upon retirement will get a minimum of 45% of the average of my three highest annual salaries. Despite that, I have three other retirement accounts and an individual trading account. I encourage everybody to put as much as they can into retirement as early and often as they can. Even if it is just $25, or $50... Just do what you can, then add more as you can. 

BUT.... I wouldn't put in money I am depending on having within two years, even a ""safe"" investment can lose money. If you need that money, even in a 2 odd year time line, I would either hold it as cash, or put it into a CD until when you need it. (do they have CDs in the UK?) sure CDs only get you 1.5% or so, but you won't lose money!"
03/29/2021,stocks,I mean...sure. Depends on what your goals are
03/29/2021,stocks,Sometimes pensions disappear.  What will you do if your pension is reduced or removed?
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'd make sure I have all the money for house + furnishings (or enough to start off) + emergency fund before I put too much in the market.  The house should be a pretty good investment and improve your quality of life, so there's no shame in saving up for that."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m not a financial advisor and this is not advice. If it were me, since I would anticipate needing the money for a house soon, I would probably just hold on to the cash, particularly with some of the bearish possibilities coming up in the next few years In the stock market.

Additionally, you can think of home ownership sort of like owning a kickass, expensive asset, that is worth investing in and has a high probability of growing your net worth over time.

That said, you should also know that pensions that don’t alter their payouts to increase with inflation are very sensitive to inflation changes after you retire down the road. IE if you are on a fixed income as a retiree and the price of things keeps going up. 

Thus, while you can rely on pensions and government assistance when you retire, it will be smart to have some additional means to generate non-fixed retirement income, and longer term investments can provide that opportunity."
03/29/2021,stocks,I appreciate all the replies so far. Seems the generally idea is keep the cash for my first proper and get myself set up then think about additional investments.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ask yourself this.   


1. Could I be fired from my current job?  

2. Could I be hit by a bus on the way to work tomorrow?  


If the answer is Yes to either of these, then your pension is not a guarantee."
03/29/2021,stocks,The way you worded that has opened my eyes to the potential risk of my current capital. I think it's wise to keep it as cash at hand for now until the cash has been invested in my property then consider doing private investment from there.
03/29/2021,stocks,"PERS? Sounds a lot like mine. I do the same, it just seems crazy to rely on a pension. It should be icing on the cake, not the entire cake itself."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah its a great scheme. I'm more confused on if I should be privately investing into long term holds on top of my current scheme if that makes sense. I have the capital to do so but seems pointless when I'm getting, as you say free money, from my employer anyway."
03/29/2021,stocks,“Sometimes pensions disappear” - que?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thank you for the great response. I think you've hit the nail on the head with the advice I'm looking for. Get the property, then think about longer term investments.

I hadn't yet considered your point re inflation so it's a very good point!"
03/29/2021,stocks,PERS indeed.
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you have extra money and you’re just going to spend it on dumb things like shoes and a fancy car then I think it would be smart to invest. Always good to still have a savings account though, even after you put down your down payment. So is the question one of saving the money vs investment? It depends on when you think you’ll need that money and what your risk tolerance is. Maybe find a good financial advisor to ask."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Three scenarios here:

1. The company goes bankrupt. As a result the pension is reduced or removed.

2. Whatever investment company manages the pension fund makes huge mistakes and loses a lot of the money. Benefits are reduced because the money is simply not there.

3. The company stops offering a pension. Maybe you put in 10 years, then mid-career they phase out the pension plan. You'd still get a pension, but only based on those 10 years. The benefits would be much lower than you'd hoped because you assumed the pension payout would be based on a 30-year career.

It's always a good idea to save extra money for the future."
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm not one for buying anything for myself really. Don't really buy shoes and don't drive at the moment haha. I'm definitely the type what that rather invest. I may consider speaking to an advisor as you have suggested.

* Citadel is trying to spark [inflation panic](https://www.ft.com/content/6c613f92-cf35-4b2e-b2b0-2ac0a6afb1fb) again

* The [Suez Canal blockage](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/29/suez-canal-traffic-resumes-after-cargo-ship-ever-given-is-removed.html) has been cleared

Financials are definitely going down, but will investors rotate over to tech or cyclicals or just shy away from the market altogether?

I think we're going to see a bit of both today, but that, on the whole, we'll be down.

I'm forecasting a **red day** with a NASDAQ **high of** **13,134** and a **low of 12,977**.

currently building a portfolio of ETFs investing same amounts daily with the goal of being more heavily weighted to growth.my holding period is 25-40 years roughly, so i am okay with some volitility and short term risk in exchange for longer term growth potential.

ARKK seems very attractive to me for this as it seems like something that carries significant short term risk but should be fine over decades and out perform s&p, but something about cathie wood and a fund manager getting all this hype just scares me that maybe everything isn’t what it seems..

03/29/2021,stocks,"I own too much Dis not to pay attention. They have been falling off good news for 2+ weeks now, and I believe they are the ""Apple"" of cyclical/reopening stocks.

Apple started falling from its ATH a long time ago despite being a great stock and company. They were the indicator for what started with the rest of Tech in February.

The recovery fad is already over and at this point it's people trying to fool other people to pump up stocks that historically never were even that great and now are at ATHs (notice Disney got crushed as soon as it hit a new ATH when everyone was talking about how great reopening plays are).

(I'm not saying Disney is not a great stock, I'm saying they are premier but I would never touch oil/airplanes/cruise ships/etc at this point)

I'll buy the tech dip as long as it's major companies who have a great 5-10 years ahead of them. If Nasdaq's not bouncing relatively soon, aka April, then our market is screwed anyways. Goign back to Apple, however, they are hanging in there just fine today, so the cycle does appear to me to be coming around.

This is not advice, but I'm comfortable riding this out.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Portfolio advice 

Took me a while but i finally accepted i can not beat the market and that i do not want the burden or responsibility of buying countless stocks to do so and having to watch them. Its not a 3 fund boglehead but here is my 5 fund Portfolio.

28 years old. 15-20 year portfolio to pay for kids colleges not looking for high risk. 

VTI- 77%

SCHD- 5% 

SMH- 5%

QQQM- 5%

QQQJ- 5%

VB- 3% 



I know everyone's going to say add VXUS. I just am not convinced itll do well. However it if has a major correction (on the graph its had quite a hot run 2020 to 2021) then id buy. If i did it wouldn't be more than 5% weight MAYBE 10%. 

I have thought about increasing VB to 5% for a slightly bigger small cap tilt since all the other funds lack there. 

Ive also considered increasing SCHD to 10% since its dividend and in a way a reopening play with the holdings it have. 

I think there is a case for QQQM & QQQJ to both be 10% each but thats a heavy tech tilt which is why i chose 5% each.

https://procureetfs.com/etfs/ufo.html#holdings

> The Fund has licensed as its Underlying Index the S-Network Space Index which is designed to measure the performance of companies engaged in space-related industries. A company is considered to be in a space-related business if its product(s) either has as its essential purpose — or is dependent upon — space-based functions (the revenue produced by space related companies is referred to as “space revenues). In the case of companies that make products that go into space (such as launch vehicles), or companies that operate systems in space (such as satellites), the space-related nature of the business is clear. For companies whose products and services are solely used on the surface of the Earth, space must play an essential role in the business in order to be classified as “space-related”. For example, a GPS smartwatch is not a viable product without its GPS satellite connectivity, while a car with GPS navigation can still serve its basic function without that space-related perk."

March 2020: We are screwed, Covid is going to destroy the market as we know it and kill millions in the US. Peak FEAR.

Extrapolating that today: we have not reached peak fear.  Ergo, we still have a long ways to go on tech. tech will only bottom out when the majority of Robinhood users and WSB delete their accounts and move to cash and safer havens after they are down 75%+ on their positions for a 6+ month duration.

Exceptional buy in price as there very little reason for it to drop. All analysts rate it as a buy with a price target of $20-21. They should have a very nice pop back to the $25-40 range upon earnings assuming another +50% growth quarter (expected, and they confirmed at least 31% growth).

03/29/2021,stocks,"$RMO is uniquely positioned to turn EV upside down

What is the biggest thing holding EV adoption back? Batteries. The company that solves this could be responsible for shifting everything to EV.

Jim Cramer and BorgWarner CEO Fred Lissalde discuss how 45% of Borg Warner revenue will be tied to EV tech by 2030. Lissalde is specifically bullish on $RMO who Borg Warner has a 20% stake in. Who do you think will be supplying the battery tech??? :)

[https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/26/borgwarner-expects-evs-to-account-for-almost-50percent-of-revenue-by-2030.html)

Additionally, $RMO and Ecellix have signed an MOU.

[https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html](https://www.greencarcongress.com/2021/02/20210222-ecellix.html)

Have people read the description of Ecellix's eCell technology? Ecellix is Romeo's strategic partner. My gut feeling is that Ecellix can do what QS is claiming, and they are way ahead of QS considering they are working with Romeo to get their cells tested and moving forward with packing. They must be working on packing their cells already if they went ahead with partnering with Romeo. Ecellix just does not call it ""Solid state battery"". In fact, QS is not completely solid state. They use liquid to some extent. If Romeo/Excellix can move trucks, then it would be a cake to move passenger cars. With BorgWarner backing up Romeo, it will turn VW's vision upside down. GM, Ford, etc will come to BorgWarner/Romeo/Ecellix. Guess who would want it the most even if it has to pay high price. FISKER

Right now $RMO is a joke under $12. With an earnings call this week and a potential announcement from the company to get those warrants exercised, $20 is a very reasonable starting point. Either way, Romeo is perfectly positioned to be a major distruptor in a disruptive industry."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Not entirely sure, but my guess is that Draft Kings is literally the exact opposite of where institutional money is going to flow.  The narrative we're being told is that ""smart"" money is rotating towards value, ""real"" economy, and reopening plays.

Draft Kings is a highly speculative, tech/internet COVID play--the trifecta of what money is going to outflow."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m not sure about 25 to 40 years but I would think that aside from the short term volatility, a decade horizon should post good results. I think it all boils down to whether you agree with her vision of the “future” or not. I personally do, to an extent. I think she may be overly ambitious and optimistic and clearly certain stocks have got ahead of themselves- but the next decade will be about disruptors and innovation."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Seems like many underestimate crypto, thing is overdone stimulus lead to inflation at least in many building materials, then tax hike, international tensions, margin calls, overvalued small caps and speculative stocks, fear of dollar devaluation, chip shortage and the answer for many of these are crypto to diversify. Stocks are facing steep competition to justify people to put new money on them rather than get more crypto."
03/29/2021,stocks,What stocks did you buy? Maybe diversify a bit out of tech
03/29/2021,stocks,"Inflationary fear remains, we're not out of the tech correction yet, and we're at the end of a fiscal quarter, so there's a lot of rebalancing going on with the biggest portfolios. All of this is perfectly normal and healthy for the market. If anything, I'm surprised we haven't dumped off *more*. I wouldn't be shocked at all if we nosedived one more time before March was through."

03/29/2021,stocks,"There's a concept in economics called the ""rational choice theory"" or ""rational action theory"", which means that aggregate social behavior results from the behavior of individual actors, each of whom is making their individual decisions. The stock market starts to decline, most individuals will start selling off their positions to prevent losses, and the market declines further."
03/29/2021,stocks,"At this point, any additional stimulus bill is taken as a negative sign by the markets rather than a positive one, in aggregate. It just increases the fears of much higher interest rates/inflation/taxes in the near future"

03/29/2021,stocks,I expect energy to pick up again soon but it's really dependent on how things go with the reopening. Other than that industrials have been killing it and will probably continue to do so thanks to the infrastructure bill.
03/29/2021,stocks,DIS has been a meh hold for me and with their cruising business being closed for even longer now and their parks in California still hardly being open I don’t see any benefit to holding in the near term. I might buy back in if it slips down to 160 or 150 maybe

early afternoon was a bounce back, right now as we shift towards later in the afternoon, it's plunging again."
03/29/2021,stocks,"zoom out. if nothing about the fundamentals have changed for your holdings, then just hold. long term means at least 5 years. if in 5 years time, you can still see yourself being comfortable holding what you have, let it be.

your risk tolerance is much lower than you anticipated so any future $ you put in, put it in a broad market index etf and just contribute regularly. it's easy to say you have a high risk tolerance when the markets are doing well; now that they are not actually evaluate your risk. There is nothing wrong with an etf holding; most people are not cut out for the emotional part of investing and that is ok. That is why the etf's work."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Everyone is going through the same thing. Most people only started investing last year after the March 2020 lows. We were spoiled with the massive bull run where literally anyone could make money. 

This is known as a correction. Corrections takes weeks but they don't last. April we will start to see an upturn but it's anyone's guess really.

Best thing to do is shut off your app. Buy the dips if you got cash or you'll be kicking yourself. Like people did last March."
03/29/2021,stocks,Are you heavy in tech? Just keep holding. We're obviously in the low's at the moment with room to drop even further but these times will eventually pass. Forget about your unrealized p/l and use this opportunity to buy in more. If you can't just hold through it.
03/29/2021,stocks,">Losing 45% of my portfolio while the indexes are up.

This is a good reason to have a large portion of your portfolio in index funds. Sure, you might have smaller returns on the way up, but you also avoid what is happening now.

Generally, anytime I make a big profit on any stock, I sell a portion of it and move those profits into VTI, most likely permanently unless I have a very good reason to sell."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That’s why you don’t gamble. Always invest in stocks that you are 100% comfortable with. If you have any doubt in a stock, even just a little bit, don’t invest in it. Like if I see GOOG or AMZN doing bad, I’m not worried a bit. If the business does well, the stock price will eventually follow."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That’s why it’s almost impossible to beat the index. Yes, you can outperform on certain stocks but then you’ll underperform on others. And yes, you can get into a sector that strongly outperforms but then you’ll likely hold too long and get burned.

Just buy the index and set and forget. Maybe throw 10-20% into stocks but not more. Hopefully your stocks go back up so you can fix it."
03/29/2021,stocks,I am in the same boat. But I just keep reminding myself that 1-2 months is like a few weeks in the grand scheme of things if you are able to wait it out for a year or longer with the companies you believe in.

The more recent Reddit pump that took it to 90 or something was a GME level joke at that point. Imagine thinking Redditors are the ones controlling the market and not the ones being manipulated. Look into how powerful the Russian social media influence was on social media the past 5 years if you aren't aware, they even got people to believe DONALD TRUMP is God's chosen one to fight for the poor people... pretty sure they are fully capable of getting WSB to go along with anything they want if they can get Americans to attack to attack their own capital building."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm a fan, and bought into it about a month ago at slightly lower than where it is now. If you look at it as a big utility, it's definitely overvalued. If you look at it as an alternative energy resource play, it's not. The company is a hybrid. Lately it's been about as exciting as a grass-roots utility company (and it even pays a decent dividend), albeit one with an unusually high valuation. But over the long term, I think it has all the potential to grow like alternative energy. Meantime, I'm going to sit back, collect some dividends and see how bright the sun shines and the wind blows."

03/29/2021,stocks,Nasdaq is terrible in these days but Dow is doing really well. I guess it’s a good idea to have a balanced portfolio instead of relying on one sector such as tech.

03/29/2021,stocks,"I keep wondering if I've just made terrible choices but it seems it's this way for everyone right now. I've panicked and sold it all before only for it to rebound, but at the minute there doesn't even seem to be a sign of that!

I need the money within 6-12 months anyway!"
03/29/2021,stocks,">This market is killing me. For 2 months it's just been sideways. Bleeding options in both directions but if I do the sensible thing and play both sides a rando spike will wipe that out too. I wish it would just tank like it wants to so we could start moving to something instead of the artificial flotation devices keeping everyone up.

The S&P opened at 3,731 on 2/1 and it sitting at 3,971 today...that's like a 6% gain.

That's huge for an index."
03/29/2021,stocks,Why would you buy now. They’re still overvalued as fuck. March madness is about to end and after they’ll probably tank more
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yep, and yep"
03/29/2021,stocks,"not even close. zoom out the nasdaq. everything is hanging on wall. once that wall is broken on one tech stock, we all fall. 

If it breaks, expect tech to fall another 20-30%. mock me all you want, but its happening countless times before in other scenarios and this one is far worse (with the exception of the dot\_com and 2008 crash)"

03/29/2021,stocks,You can tell by the hourly knee jerk reactions that most prople here know fugg all about investing. Pretty entertaining to observe.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think the issue was that prior to this mini dip and tech crash (and even NOW), those tried and true rules don't really apply. there weren't any clear winners. only stocks that were less overvalued than others.

Ok so you did not want to invest in apple in January because it was projecting too much forward growth in an already saturated and dominated market (by apple). what is your alternative -  growth? (nope NIO/TSLA/ARKS/ too high). Even airlines and retail were starting to creep back up to levels that made me uncomfortable.

Would you of touched oil and brick and mortar banks in the fall when biden JUST got elected and unveiled his love for clean energy and countries all over the world announced transitions to no fossil fuel cars/etc and companies like square were making financing far easier than brick and mortar banks?

Honestly, at the time clean energy and EV, although overpriced did seem like the lesser of the evils. so then it becomes ""you better as hell diversify"""
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'd also add to not just buy what's popular on reddit. Stocks like NIO were extremely overvalued, and the ARK funds were meant to be held for 3-5 years, and Cathy herself said to expect a correction Q1 2021.

03/29/2021,stocks,"If you are investing for kids college fund why not just do a target date 529 for them? Auto invest monthly and forget about it.

In regards to your portfolio, a lot of people would suggest some international exposure just due to seemingly cyclical nature of US vs. the world of which markets perform better.  If you expect the US to continue to outperform the world for the next 15-20 years than sure stick with all US based ETF’s.  Personally I prefer INTL exposure but still tilt US based with some US small cap & tech"

03/29/2021,stocks,"I don’t think we will go back into lockdown mode. If anything there might be requirements tied to vaccination, like for travelling or work.

But also, if we were going back to lockdown why would that crash tech?"

that ship already sailed. the vast majority of america isn't locking down again. maybe california/new york will put up with that nonsense, but texas and florida won't, and there's going to be a lot more states like texas and florida."
03/29/2021,stocks,Even during the 2nd and third waves/closures stocks didn’t crash in 2020.
03/29/2021,stocks,"1. States are ignoring lockdown advice. Even states, like California, are not really enforcing them and people are ignoring them.
2. The US vaccination effort is way ahead of schedule and we should have the nation almost completely vaccinated in a couple of months. 

No, I don't think there will be a significant slowdown in reopening considering even progressive states like California are only half-heartedly following advice as is. With strong vaccination, we're almost guaranteed to reopen by summer, unless some raging mutation changes everything."

03/29/2021,stocks,"the 8% stock market average is real rate of return, so takes into account the estimated effects of inflation reducing purchasing power. So 12% per year, with 3% average inflation, would only be about 9.x% of ""real"" purchasing power return.

Where do you see stocks like VIAC and DISCA at the end of the day, assuming it will be a very volatile day for them?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Not yet. Down PM again. It’s still going down today.
03/29/2021,stocks,It isnt a dip.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not yet. On something like that, aiming for a bounce is more prudent. Lots of better sales right now."

03/29/2021,stocks,"> There will come a point where you will realize that breaking even will take way too long.

idk what you're in that you're down 50%, but given how quickly the market has recovered from dips in recent years this seems like a pretty bad take"
03/29/2021,stocks,I see posts like this and similar a lot these days. It might be time to load up on some shares soon 😊
03/29/2021,stocks,Yikes...Don't listen to this guy

03/29/2021,stocks,We have already been rotating out of financiels. I feel like this will confirm it. Personally i think the market will be relatively calm until the biden speech later this week. Unless earning guidance starts seeping through.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I believe it is because of how accessible crypto has become to the entire world. 

Not only that you have banks and businesses accepting crypto more and more every day. 

People like Elon have bought up huge sums of it. This leads to Elon fans doing the same. 

Obviously could crash to nothing with a single piece of legislation in the USA saying crypto can’t be a thing here but the opposite is true too.

Long story short I think it’s been within a certain range the last month or so because it’s not 98% controlled by hedges, banks or mega billionaires in the USA and has a much broader availability to the world"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Crypto has stablecoins. Many believe some of them are unbacked (USDT), meaning more liquidity could be injected to crypto any time.

03/29/2021,stocks,"You want to know how to do proper DD, go to university, study maths, get yourself an apprenticeship at a hedge fund and then you'll learn how to do a proper DD. If you think that reading a company report amounts to proper DD, people are dreaming. Nobody on Reddit does proper DD, everyone here simply makes bets."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Your goal is to understand the company at present, evaluate the prospects for growth, and determine how likely you see those opportunities panning out. Have you watched shark tank? That’s basically the concept. Take the materials the company puts forward, decide if they sound compelling, poke holes in their bullshit, and then negotiate a price. Remember that it’s the company’s job to convince you. Don’t treat it like you have decided to invest and want to back into enough sound bites that back you up.

Step 1: Go to their investor relations page and find their most recent 10-k. If the company is affected by covid you might also want to get last years 10-k and read them front to back (if they are several quarters old look at recent 10q as well). Read the business or overview section to learn about their total operations. Read their balance sheet to screen for high/low levels of cash and debt that concern you. The income statement is really important for understanding how much they make, how fast that has been increasing, and try to understand how those values compare to the discussion. It’s very important to look at their gross margins as well as their net margins after expenses. This is a measure of how hard it is to earn a dollar of profit.

Step 2: Look at their investor presentations and their conference calls. The 10ks are regulated and companies can’t be too loose in what they say. But in presentations they can be more optimistic. You need to marry what the company says they hope to achieve vs what they can concretely report. If there’s a big gap, you need to determine the discount you will apply for the probability of failure.

Step 3: Read the discussion and try to find the bear case. Find the Kevin in the shark tank. Maybe the company is doing everything right but their success hinges on some external factor (like Nvidias ARM acquisition getting approved). Or maybe the business arm that is well known to consumers is only 1/3 of the revenue base. Or maybe they have stopped buybacks and started diluting. There has to be a bear case and you need to hear it to decide.

Step 4: Determine your desired price entry and consider where you would sell or buy more. Keep reading reports after you invest and update your thesis as results pan out."
03/29/2021,stocks,Can they drop more? (Hopes not)
03/29/2021,stocks,I don't think green energy is going anywhere so I would wait until it looks like it has stabilized. I don't think energy should be as volatile as it is and I expect once the correction is 'over' it will probably be a slow grower for a while
03/29/2021,stocks,"I share the same opinion, but don't we only know peak fear or greed in hindsight? I doubt tech has bottomed yet, but it's possible that it has."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Hopefully you’re not serious about that. Someone smarter than me can provide a better explanation as to the slump we’re experiencing, but the market goes up and down. Things will turn back around and you will be able to make that money back—and then some. This is part of learning and of the stock market experience."
03/29/2021,stocks,The stock market is not for you brother. You’re way too concerned with getting fast money. Unless you’re 100% in meme stonks then literally the best thing you can do right now is delete your trading app and then check back in a year
03/29/2021,stocks,"Man best thing I can tell you is it always rebounds. You win some rounds and you lose some. Learn from what happened to you. I've learned there's nothing wrong with going full cash on shorter positions and taking small losses to buy lower.

Here's how it was explained to me. You have a watchlist of 5-10 stocks you've done research on, watch them for a couple week without buying. You will get acclimated to their prices similar to how house flippers do with their market. You buy when a stock is presenting a real value over the past month. Never buy on green days, it never stays all green.

I also recommend ETFs, you get to pick which sector you want and will see more stabilized growth.

For your mental health, Kong vs Godzilla comes out wednesday, get a plan to go see that (cus it will be epic) and give yourself something to look forward to besides stocks. Money isnt everything man, I know that regardless of what happens these couple months in the stock market wont change who you are in the next 5 years."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Inflation, bond yields, tech is over priced, suez canal backed up, EV bubble, spac bubble. Pick one."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ups and downs are normal, even crashed everyone once in awhile are normal.  If you can't handle how much you're down, going forward, try to diversify more or not invest money that you're not willing to lose."
03/29/2021,stocks,You haven't lost anything til you sell
03/29/2021,stocks,"We're in a period of decline, which happens. Just like back in February how you can have a deep red day and then spike up the next day, it can happen again where we have a period of months where it is like this, but then suddenly things turn around for the better. All you have to do is zoom out and you can see this has happened periodically throughout the years. It's just all about being patient and not reacting emotionally. The longer you stay in, the better things will be in time."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you seriously feel like harming yourself, please call 1-800-273-8255 and talk to someone.  

If you picked decent companies to invest in, it’ll go back up eventually. Don’t check your portfolio every day. That helps me when the stock gods are after my ass. Personally, I’m down double digits.

03/29/2021,stocks,What did you expect? all hyped up stock have been crashing lately.
03/29/2021,stocks,"maybe cause its up 2000% in a foocking year?
EDIT: it just seems you bought and the top and pull a surprised Pikachu face when it went down from ATH. Really?"
03/29/2021,stocks,It's truly mind boggling what's happening. It just got added to the S&P too. I honestly think it's getting shorted very hard so when the firms have to buy; they get it on a discount.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Now that you sold, that should change."
03/29/2021,stocks,Futures don't look bad though

03/29/2021,stocks,"Can the Tesla fan base explain to me why they are so confident? 

I am not invested in this industry at all, and have no informed opinion. But as I see it, as soon as the big players (Volkswagen etc.) start entering the game one by one (and they will), Tesla has no advantage anymore. What am I missing here? Are you simply counting on Tesla being hyped again, or is there more to it?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Bring it on i love a good pain.
03/29/2021,stocks,That's an extremely random list. I've made alot of money buying utilities and banks and insurance companies on dips. Why do you think those companies you listed are the stars of the stock market?
03/29/2021,stocks,Why would you only be holding tech?
03/29/2021,stocks,I'd buy puts.....

03/29/2021,stocks,"Nothing forces you to buy something thats overvalued.

Sometimes the best option is to not buy. I could have loaded up on PLTR when it was $40 a few months ago or I could drop 1k on it today. I wouldn't buy F at these prices but 7 months ago at $7.03 that was easy money. I wish I would have bought GE at $5 too but I just couldn't quite make myself pull that trigger. 

If you want it doing something but not locked in just get VTI and take it out when you find something of value."

Alternatively, discover is seemingly up by about 5% PM. Im thinking discover is better short term, but Viacom better long"

03/29/2021,stocks,I believe he was referring to the companies you invest in. The best approach is to buy a stock you want to own that long. You will break even much earlier if it’s a solid long term company. Just look at the S&P and Dow history after each drop.

03/29/2021,stocks,Well that really depends. If we have 15 years of uninterrupted bull market then probably not. But it's gonna hold the value better if a crash or a potential bear market happens.

Just just to clarify, i don't see those as dramatic at all. I am bullish that we will end the year with Spy at 410-430, these short term dips are just buying opportunities."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel ya. I bought in at $135 on Apple and it sucks but it’s temporary. In 6 months it’ll be up.

Unlike GME, averaging down on Apple isn’t a stupid play."
03/29/2021,stocks,"No one can tell you the bottom of the market, but a correction hasn't started yet. I would average lower."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ohh, yeah I would. I'm set on bb, but for sure if I could, I'd buy more. But don't expect it to skyrocket anytime soon. Need to be patient with that one."

If it doesn't do what you want it's rich assholes controlling. If it does you beat the rich assholes who control everything. But if they control everything then how can you beat them?

03/29/2021,stocks,"In dollars. Its just the value of the option. For example, If you roll down an option to a lower strike, you pay more for that option than the one you're holding, so you pay the difference, ie: the debit amount. If you're buying an option, you will always be paying the debit amount. When you sell an option, you get the credit amount, all in dollars."

Then when you file your 2021 return you have to list how much you paid in Q1 with the dates that you paid for both Fed and state. Hope that helps."

Neither would surprise"

03/29/2021,stocks,"It would be better to do 50% VTI and 50% split amongst 5 growth stocks if you want to be riskier. Putting it all on AAPL doesn’t make sense, it’s already one of the biggest companies in the world. How much more increase in market cap do you expect?"
03/29/2021,stocks,then i'd put 80% in vti and use the 20% for riskier plays. but it's your money.
03/29/2021,stocks,"As others have said, not a smart play in my opinion. Go 80% into a growth index and 20% speculation if you like. But at the end of 5 years the earnings will most likely be higher in the growth index.   
AAPL has had an incredible 4-5 year run where it quadrupled in value, is it likely to do that again? No."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I have one I'm very interested in, and to my eyes, and knowing the situation they are in, at least publicly, it seems to be a good investment. But I see the Schwab reviews and Morningstar I think, and it makes me question if I know what I know. Haha."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Determining the meaningful metrics is part of the DD and is company/industry specific. Use the finviz screener to compare companies of similar size/business based on valuation metrics. At the very least, be able to explain why a company deviates from their market and if that’s good or bad. The importance of metrics changed significantly if you are looking at growth or value. Also keep in mind a forward PE relies on company projections so take into account everything you learned in the original review.

Support lines are part of a whole different animal called technical analysis. The first thing to know is there’s no exact science for it, so don’t bet your life on a chart pattern. There are people who make tons of money with it but it’s not clear to me how much of that is random variation and self fulfilling prophecies so I don’t trade that way. However, I do use technicals as a way to evaluate entry points. I always layer on bollinger bands and multiple simple moving averages."

03/29/2021,stocks,"What happens when they deflate? Does that just mean they go down overall in value?

And what do you think they'll deflate to? And yes, doing my own research, which has people going wildly in both directions (sell vs buy)."
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah exactly. NOK is a reasonable one. The thing is that companies that pay dividends and don't have big price fluctuations you're less likely to get called (unless you're selling in the money calls) and it's priced into what you can get for the calls you sell.
03/29/2021,stocks,Make a lot of money at your job and invest it into SPY or whatever broad market index regularly

03/29/2021,stocks,Well to be clear I am talking about retail and not institutional investors. I completely understand why hedge-fund managers with millions and billions under management can't beat the market because the opportunities are thinner up there on those mountains but it's just hard to believe that the retail investor can't muster up a 20% return per year through simple market volatility and drift.
03/29/2021,stocks,Super low volume

03/29/2021,stocks,"See, the things you are describing are exactly the things I want to learn. I really didn't understand most of that, to be honest. But I want to. I can go and look up each term, and thats a start... But even after I do that, I have a hard time looking at a wall of numbers and coming away with any meaningful conclusions. 

Is there a source or a guide you would recommend to baby-step me through this type of thing? 

Also, I think I understand what you mean by the difference between tech/charting and using the metrics. I think I was basically doing the same.. I was charting support and resistance on my current holdings to see if I had entered at a relatively good time or not. (Narrator: He didn't). 

But I'm not doing too badly. I'm not in the red anyway. My plan right now is to split my brokerage between S&P 500 ETF, and individual stocks. So that I can average ~9.5% on at least half of my money, and try to beat that with the other half. I am tech heavy at the moment, but trying to diversify that.

/s but that’s basically been the sentiment of every stock related sub where they say “the stock that must not be named” or some other snide comment when they don’t see any fault with the financial institutions.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Depends on what you think of the fund strategy.  If you buy the case made by ARK that the ultra-high valuations on the holdings in the funds are warranted and they can continue to grow, yes, this is a good entry point, you'd expect the recent downward price pressure boils off in the coming months and you got a reasonable deal on it (doesn't mean it might not go lower in the near term).

I think there is a lot of valid skepticism around the fund - the strategy, and the way it is composed, seems fairly suspect.  A lot of people look at major holdings like $TSLA and $SQ and can't really imagine the valuations go higher as they already reflect an incredibly bullish future for these companies.  It seems much more likely a significant number of these holdings lose their luster as long term innovation plays as we move forward and reality falls short of the sky-high expectations, and the fund just loses air.

At a certain point a rational person might expect that these companies need to demonstrate performance & growth justifying their present valuation before they continue inflating, or even that they are already so inflated a bull case might just be they trade sideways for a few years as they mature into the valuations being somewhat reasonable.

Personally I don't want anything to do with any of the ARK funds, as they represent a lot of risk.  Sure, they do have a bull case stronger than most other funds you can put your money in, but the bear case is also much worse."

The drastical drop seems to be caused by the correction in addition to a short report based on undocumented claims.
So my thesis is that it cannot go to far further down and if it continues to follow rest of the EV sector it could have a large upside.
But for what I know it could plumit to 0 after the earnings and turn up to be a spac scam, so do your own DD 😂"
03/29/2021,stocks,Why so bearish?
03/29/2021,stocks,"have you looked at VIAC earnings?

I have. And their earnings haven't changed much. from the height of 2020.

projected earnings are also relatively flat compared to 2019.

so how is it worth triple at the all time high compared to january 2020? or even 28% premium right now?

VIAC has been behaving like a meme stock.

undervalued meme stock is an oxymoron"
03/29/2021,stocks,Oh man I wish I met you before I got myself into this.
03/29/2021,stocks,"In this case, because when it goes flat on GME and when there is low volume, with out SSR, the tendency is for a breakout down.

I'm wanting to hop in for a run up, I'm quite bullish, but options are very expensive, so they arent an option, really.

The cost of the share is borderline prohibitive, so I'm actually hopeful for some prolice drop before it rockets, if it does at all.

Being realistic, the gamma side of thing eases on the options market.  Plus no one in their right mind is exercising a 180c option.  Just wait a few months and buy shares at 50 when the price drops.

So for short squeeze, I'm not sold it will happen.  We saw the market swat it down and slap the share price in the face at 340, and again after the earnings report, resulting in a sell off.

Go ahead, be bullish.  But march was a bearish month."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ok....so it now has a P/E of 11.  

Why bother.  In your head it's overpriced, you don't want information.  Not sure why you bothered replying.

Can I get your ROI on your portfolio and current stock pics, since you're so all-knowing?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"The stock currently sits at $180, you call that a bearish month?"
03/29/2021,stocks,GME was sub-$100 at the beginning of the month and is now at $180. That’s not bearish at all.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Shrooms aren’t going to get the political backing in the US for quite some time. Science obviously isn’t enough to sway the political needle, and it’s a long ways off from being the hill prominent politicians are willing to die on. There may be progress internationally, but I don’t believe it will be on the scale required to grow sustainably in American markets. Pure speculation for years to come imo."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Im long Mind Medicine. One of their core trials, MC-18, is basically the solution to the opioid epidemic if they’re able to successfully pull it off.

Its extremely speculative and is a pretty binary option considering if their trials fail the company will go to 0. But if it succeeds it has the serious potential to 5 or 10x over the next 5 years. Check out r/shroomstocks for more targeted discussions, im pretty sure most shroom tickers are against the rules here

Edit: in case I don’t make it abundantly clear, because i thought i did: THIS IS ALL SPECULATION. I DON’T KNOW THE FUTURE OF THIS COMPANY AND ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU THEY DO IS LYING"
03/29/2021,stocks,"There is a an etf for that called PSYK, you can take the largest cap companies from there, the biggest being cmps which is also on nasdaq, there are other ones but they are on the otc market (i cannot name them here)"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I bought 30 shares of $AIKI a couple of months ago, but it lost about 25%.  I will hold it for a long term.  I believe in mushrooms to treat depression, but not sure how legality will turn out."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm in SHRMF, not a huge position but believe light psychedelics will gain legality in the same way weed did."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Although i agree to an extent, the FDA has already fast tracked two psychedelic trials, one of which from the currently largest company in the space, Compass pathways, which is researching fixing treatment resistant depression. Also Mind Medicine is working on Phase 2A trials for MC-18, a drug that if successful, solves the entire opioid epidemic. If the science is there to back it up and the FDA approves any psychedelic treatments it doesn’t matter what politicians have to say, none of these companies are pushing for recreational use, so legislation doesn’t matter. The key is that these trials are working to get psychedelics approved as drugs for treatment with a therapist, *none* of them want your average joe blow to be able to buy LSD or shrooms at a walmart. These treatments are setting out to fix and take over entire markets in sweeps; the opioid epidemic, addiction in general, and *treatment resistant* depression are all entirely open markets that are just waiting for a company to swoop in and dominate. 

I think with the focus on FDA approval as opposed to legislation, alongside the growing concerns of mental health in the states and internationally, if there is science to back it up they can all make bank. Many people are apprehensive about psychedelics but a lot of the negative stigma would change drastically if there were trained professionals offering a service to fix a currently unfixable problem. 

Thats just my 2 cents, i could be entirely wrong. Im not arguing that its not extremely speculative, because it is. Im just saying that if some of these drugs get approved, there is a huge market for them to make money (they’re all looking to finish trials within the next 2-3 years). Currently its insanely speculative as nobody knows if any of these drugs will pass or work, BUT there has been decades of research and anecdotal experiences that heavily point towards their successes. Obviously do your own DD, im not advocating for anyone to invest, i just truly find the space fascinating 

Completely offhanded because it doesnt matter much in the grand scheme of things but even investors like Kevin O’Leary and Peter Thiel are heavily invested in psychedelics, i cant imagine them being in the industry without seeing some future success"
03/29/2021,stocks,"But who would pay for this product such that this company would be wildly profitable? The people who are addicted to opioids? They don't have money and definitely don't have insurance. The government? Lol no not unless it was dirt cheap. There aren't even that many people addicted to opioids, it's not like it's depression or anxiety. Let them just do something good for a group that desperately needs it but don't expect to make a profit off of something like this."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes this ETF exists but the rest of your statement is wrong. Biggest position is $SEEL, which is trafing on NASDAQ. There are more which are not on the OTC."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Theres a million different answers for this depending on which company in the space you’re looking at. Mind Medicine is looking to make money in a different way than Compass Pathways, which is also looking to make money differently than Numinus Wellness etc. There isn’t *one* answer and if you’re really curious you should just do your own DD. Each company in the space is pretty open about their plans for their future.

Also, the US government spent [~$631B](https://www.soa.org/globalassets/assets/files/resources/research-report/2019/econ-impact-non-medical-opioid-use.pdf) between 2015-2018 because of the opioid crisis. I am not saying the government will pay for these therapies or treatments, because absolutely nobody knows. However, it would be extremely naive to think the government wouldn’t have financial incentive to fund a program that would end the opioid epidemic, considering it would very likely be much cheaper than their current situation

Also to your point that “its not like its depression or anxiety”. Mind Medicine, for example, is working on a drug that treats adult ADHD, another for PTSD, another for Depression, AND the addiction therapy, which focuses on opioids, alcoholism, and any other addictive substance.

Edit: to address the part where you add “just let them do something good for people without trying to make a profit” this is probably the most naive point you make. The company needs funding to succeed, how do they raise funding? By people investing. Yes I’m not a billionaire but I AM directly giving them my money to help create these therapies. Them making money is a side effect, because they are ALL businesses. The companies making these therapies and drugs are trying to make money, they are patenting their treatments. The companies doing this aren’t doing it for the greater good, sure that may be part of it but they are trying to *make money*"

Plus the 10 year rising so much, meaning bonds are more attractive, and beat down reopening stocks becoming more attractive. Also, Biden getting in office was kind of a “sell the news” event for a lot of stocks. Now that we know solar will be well treated by the current administration, it becomes time to sell. Oh, also copper rising…don’t solar panels need a lot of copper?

From a technical POV, it’s finding support at its 100 day MA, so it’s at least not dropping like a stone. It should recover, but because it led so much in 2020, don’t expect it to lead again for a while, IMO."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I can't speak to SPWR in particular (though I hold 300 shares). They recently sold a lot of ENPH stock close to its high, so they had a sudden rush of money that's not related to the core of their business, thus their 2020 Q4 results shouldn't be considered representative. 

Solar in general has passed a major milestone in 2019/2020 in which it became cheaper than nuclear power (residential solar) and even natural gas (utility solar). Since solar is likely to get cheaper still due to Swanson's law (similar to Moore's law), the tailwinds are very strongly at the back of all stocks in this sector. 

That said, as  an investor I've noticed that the rise in the price of solar equities like SPWR is correlated to EVs. It wouldn't surprise me if solar is just tagged ""green high growth"" in algorithms along with hydrogen and EVs. Right now a lot of their movement is correlated, even though in my opinion the case for solar is much stronger  in the medium and long term than either hydrogen or EVs. It's not like a Tesla is rapidly becoming cheaper than a Honda, but solar is becoming much cheaper than its fossil fuel competitors. 

The biggest concern is the sensitivity these stocks may have to interest rates. Most need debt."
03/29/2021,stocks,"SPWR is growing, they are also in California where the government passed a law a few years ago that ALL new homes need to have some solar panels.  The real question is, can they stay afloat until the turn a profit and before the investment money runs out."

Basically it should do fine, just not be the leader it’s been. Better to think long term than short term, though all losses suck. In general, I try to sell if stocks break the 50 day MA or 100 day MA, which causes further losses, depending on my timeline. If things cross the 50 day MA on strong volume it can mean really bad things.

I feel like the stock market just reacts to news and is completely random? How can you calculate that?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It seems to be more of a self fulfilling prophecy. Technical analysis has some basic principles that everyone follows such as plotting the 50 and 200 day moving averages, although there are variations, for the most part there is a consensus on what everyone watches and trades off of. So if everyone thinks ok it’s going to bounce off this support level so I should buy in, then of course it will because everyone is buying in due to them having plotted a similar support level."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The idea of technical analysis isn't that you can predict how stocks will behave, it's that you can predict how *traders* will behave."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Patterns arise in nature all the time. Humans are no different. The pattern didn't mean anything like predicting the future, it just gives you an idea of what the hive mind is doing. A catalyst will break the pattern and the cycle begins new."
03/29/2021,stocks,"For investing long term, TA isn't a big deal.  You buy and hold for 10 years.  

For trading you should learn TA

Stocks hit resistance and support levels every day when they are being traded. Knowing those levels can give you an advantage when making a trade"
03/29/2021,stocks,"TA has its place if you’re day trading. Candlestick patterns *can* have a strongly indicative patterns, MA’s *can* suggest certain behavior, same goes for oscillators and Fibonacci retracement/extension. The reason a lot of these indicators tend to be accurate during a short time period is because of machine trading and day traders. 

If you want to day trade it’s worth learning, but a dangerous game. Look around TradingView, there are very few consistent contributors. Very often TA can just reaffirm confirmation bias seeing patterns that don’t exist. For example, if you don’t like a daily MA move the chart hourly, weekly, whatever you’ll eventually find a way to fit the data to your opinion.

My 2 cents is never rely on one indicator, get a read on overall sentiment, and have stop losses. A lot of the time day trading you might be buying in at near ATH prices to scalp the last bit of the ride up. It’s imperative not to become a bag holder at the peak.

Longterm I wouldn’t give TA to much merit. Analysis of the underlying business is far more important. Fundamentals and growth outweigh TA by a long shot."
03/29/2021,stocks,"What people don't understand about technical analysis is that nobody claims it predicts the direction of stocks with 100% accuracy.  But it absolutely can help you increase the likelihood of success.  The important thing is to stick to the basics, like supply/demand zones, moving averages, and candlestick patterns, because those give you insight into the underlying psychology of investors/traders and helps you interpret the level of demand for stocks at different prices.

I tried being a technical trader for years with little success.  However, once I switched to long-term investing and starting using TA to identify entry and exit points, it became much, much more useful."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'd say yes, it's worth learning - it's another tool to use, but shouldn't be used in isolation imo.

As other's have said, it's probably more useful for trading than investing, but it's great for understanding key support/resistance levels and spotting potential reversals."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Technical analysis - ""Don't worry guys, this stock is hitting its resistance line. Okay, its bottoming out now. Wait... okay wait... I see the new resistance line.... yep. Double bottom bounce cup and handle is happening. Wait... nope. Okay... bullflag now... yep... my moon is in Capricorn were about to rocket ship. ""

&#x200B;

The only credibility I give to TA is that enough people pay attention to it that it might affect the price of a stock. 

The most annoying part of TA is when someone is doing analysis and they just focus on one stock. For example - we recently had a tech speculative bubble pop. The charts are rather meaningless when it is a sector sell-off IMO."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Some people think it can give you a small edge that can pay off in the long term but there's a very real selection bias at play as well.

I actually feel that unless you have intimate experience a
with a company and proven to yourself that you have your finger on the pulse of how the public reacts with a specific security, giving significant weight to TA in your investment decisions will actually reduce most people's edge."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The short answer to your question is no. But you need to understand how and why to use it. TA is NOT a crystal ball that whill tell you when or how much a stock is going to move. It IS a tool you can use to tell if a stock is undervalued/overvalued and what its overall trends are. But you also need context for those data points which comes from things like earnings calls, investor day events and *groan* even the news.

But be careful. You need to know the purpose and limitations of each metric. Many tools like SMA, EMA and MACD are reactionary, just like the news is, and used to determine PAST trends. Trying to use these tools in a predictive manner would be like trying to cut a tree down with a hammer."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Some TA is worth learning. Technical analysis CAN give you real information about what the market consensus is doing currently and has done in the past. This is valuable information to help formulate your strategies. 

It's also much more of an art than a science. There are no hard and fast rules, only tendencies. Take it with a grain of salt."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I read this in a book and I liked it a lot: 

Fundamental analysis is used to answer the question ""WHAT do I invest in?"" technical analysis is used to answer the question ""WHEN do I invest?""

Always value real value and information the most, but technical analysis isn't totally useless, especially when there are already many people that believe in it. The stock market doesn't represent the value of the companies, it represents what investors think the value of the company is"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I used to think it was bullshit, and after getting my knees cut off in Feb/March of last year I started studying it. Now I can say that trend following is an actual thing, certain patterns in charts can actually be meaningful (if for no other reason than others believe it and react), and that things like a stock in a downtrend is not good, while a study in an uptrend is good. Paying attention to charts helps me as an investor...though truth be told the jury is still out on whether it's better than just being a boglehead, from a total return standpoint.  
A good place to start if you're curious about technically understand your stonks is The Final Bar, a great youtube show done by StockCharts.com daily. I've learned tons from the show."
03/29/2021,stocks," I look twice at momentum and cycles. Last year the Energy sector was hit hard in March, so it was a no brainer to invest in oil and natural gas stocks!

Inflation is just around the corner."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes, basically. There is no way to predict the outcome of the market by simply looking at the stock chart. It's fortune telling. There are patterns but all patterns are derived from big money(since little money can't move the stock) and news/fundamentals and in that sense TA has a foundation, but 99% of it is bullshit. Want proof? Look how many TA's write books.

&#x200B;

Look, if anyone has a method they want to sell you on how to get rich, TELL THEM TO FUCK OFF! If they had an actual method AND wanted you to be rich they would just use that method to make trillions and give you that money. They are either outright liars or morons. This shit is just a product of capitalism. Some people going to shill, others going to con, others going to thieve, some will sell their bodies, and some will just work their fingers to the bone to try to do what is right. When you have to make money to exist a problem occurs when the bankers interest gets too much to pay off."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It has very little value in my opinion.  It does help to understand trends & historical priice ranges.  But that means very little without further context ... e.g. valuation factors, current news, possible catalysts.  

Look at the charts.  Don't depend on the charts."
03/29/2021,stocks,"TA works. Unlike what most people think, it's not about ""prediction"" but rather it's a way to identify market trends (e.g. higher highs and higher lows) and allows for you to make optimal entries and exits in accordance to that trend.

TA is a disciplinary strategy that allows you to manage risk. You can lose 90% of the time, but all it takes is a good winner to outweigh all your losses."
03/29/2021,stocks,TA is bullshit
03/29/2021,stocks,"Bottom line: if it worked in a predictive way, everyone who used it would be rich, and there would be no need for ""TA experts"" to be shilling their services for a fee to followers.

I just don't understand how you can use TA with things like the aforementioned factors."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If technical analysis isn’t real how does one create a profitable trading algorithm? Algorithms are a set of strictly defined rules, and those rules have to be base on quantitative metrics, which is most likely in this case, price. The quants on Wall Street with the phds are squeezing every bit of estimated value of a move, down to the pip. You can do what they do (Technical analysis) to a much smaller degree, to turn yourself into a profitable trader. This is akin to taking a self defense class or being a world class fighter. Just because you aren’t as good as the UFC champs doesn’t mean you aren’t better off for it."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I saw a comment somewhere on WSB about some guy making the absolute best, mind blowing TA out there until someone else pointed out the company has been on track to go bankrupt for years and sort of threw out his TA out the window. I’d say if enough people believed in it and applied it to the stock market then it works right ? I’m assuming TA should only be used for trading. The guys TA might have still been valid just because the company stock was going from 100-0 in a month doesn’t mean he couldn’t have bought hundreds of stocks at 87, waited for it to jump to 95 (I’m assuming like he had planned) and then sold just to watch the stock plummet down to let’s say 80 by the end of the week"

Then just taking a few minutes every so often and marking up charts of companies you like...it can make a huge difference."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm pretty positive it's all bullshit and it's all random. I feel like there's always a bullish chart with lines of support and whatever crap they come up with all the time. Once it fails, someone else comes along and draws more lines pointing out another bullish theory."
03/29/2021,stocks,No it's not bs. Is everyone's ta correct? Of course not
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes, because TA is for short term trading, not investing. If you're investing then you only care about the fundamentals of the business and the long term cash flows."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Charts aren't complete bullshit.  We all use them to see the trend of a stock during the day, month, year, etc. And make decisions off of that. Nobody buys a stock outright without looking at its chart right?

03/29/2021,stocks,"Its only for trading really. Its only gambling when you trade without a plan. Knowing how to lose is the hardest part of trading. You will lose but if your trades are quality you will cover any losing trades when you win. You can lose 9 times out of 10 and still profit if you cut your losses at your plan. But at that point your system is a bit screwy.

With TA you can understand and decide entry and exit points much more accurately. Also many algos (which nowadays move 80% or so of the money) use TA or Fibonacci levels or whatever to buy or sell. Also, what's more important than prices and volume? It would be stupid not to look at them.  
EDIT: moreover, TA is simply a visual representation of traders and investors psychology and behaviour"
03/29/2021,stocks,"To build upon the answers here. You found a stock, a stock that is good for your strategy and you want in.
You want to maximize your gains and to do this in the short , you need to understand the movements. So you analize the plot, candles, TIs and everything else you can so you can be sure you have a tactic regarding this stock.

For example. You found stock XYZ at 47.5$. After your TA, you concluded that of the price goes bellow 46$ it will tank to 40$, but if it goes to 49$ it will soar to 55$. 

Based on the above knowledge, which is true from you POV, you set your orders:

Limit Buy at 46.5$
STOP-LOSS at 45.5$
Take-Profit at 54$"

03/29/2021,stocks,"In my view, those that put down or do not employ the use of Technical Analysis are those that don't want to bother learning how to use it.  There is a lot to learn in TA, so perhaps it's easier to cast aside the idea of its value rather than take the time to learn all about it.

In trading, I always use TA via charting to help determine support and resistance levels, see analogs and longer term price movement, all of which help in making better entries and exits.

I am a math analyst by profession so I know about some math models and strengths/weaknesses of models and how to look for them.  Many TA are bogus and silly and many are good.

03/29/2021,stocks,"my personal experience and my personal opinion: 

&#x200B;

I follow stocks almost daily. I ´ve been dabbling / Investing for a good portion of 20 years now. 

I´ve seen plenty of times where patterns from TA were indeed working.

I have only recently added a pattern indicator in my tradeview account and almost all sell / buy signals on all stocks I did test runs with were right, most of the time. (lets say about 75% of the time.

yet I always have t remember:   
\- only about 10% of acutal daytraders (professional , educated and informed traders) beat the market consistently. 

\- not even 10% of Forex traders make actual profit conistently.

daytraders and forex traders seem to rely heavily on TA as they rarely stay long enough into any investment to make FA even worthwile to spend time on. 

So I draw my own conclusions on this: if it would be working and would be more reliable, the yields of traders would be much muich higher than they are in reality. again, I am talking consistent , long term profits. not having a few good weeks, months or even years. 

&#x200B;

so, I love to be able to at least know what is happening. but I would never bet more than my usual risk tolerance level on any single security simply because a TA indicator seems to be right."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's not but what you see on youtube isn't technical analysis. 

The people making money off of analyzing market trends all have masters or doctorates in statistics. They're the people who actually enjoy math. To them, sitting down for 10 hours a day and making models with R or Python is fun. You don't need a degree, but you definitely need to be able to immerse yourself in numbers and understand things that look esoteric and headache inducing to normal people. 

So yea, you can do it, but it's going to take years of hard work and studying to actually learn how, and 90% of what you see out there is just voodoo. So I personally don't think it's worth it. I'd rather spend that time learning skills in fields I actually like and making more money that way"

For example, there simple technical trading using RSI values that go above 70 and come below 30; I algorithmically used machine learning to discover proper values for RSI long/short trades strategy ([https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042114/overbought-or-oversold-use-relative-strength-index-find-out.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/042114/overbought-or-oversold-use-relative-strength-index-find-out.asp))  on S&P500 holdings, and realized that 70/30 rule of RSI is not holding for the majority of the securities in S&P500 and most of the securities had their RSI pair-value for better trading. So if you are blindly, for example, follow overbough/oversold RSI trading strategy to select your holdings, you might end up losing money without having ability to finetune the parameters automatically.

 I personally think, in this day and age, if you are going to be using technical indicators, you need to rely on computational models and algorithms. They are better suited to ""discover"" patterns specific to individual securities using technical indicators and test their reliability, unlike many humans! Also, you must acknowledge that discovered pattern might have a very low lifespan and you might end up looking for new ones! so you are better off finding a way to automate this whole process.

Because of this philosophy, I went on building [www.etfocean.com](https://www.etfocean.com) and we are not alone, look at Wealthfront and betterment as well for ""Robo"" advising - which might be a new emerging term for ""algorithmic portfolio management"""

03/29/2021,stocks,"No, but computers are better at pattern recognition than humans. Faster too. Thinking you can beat computers at this is like thinking you can consistantly beat computers at chess or poker."
03/29/2021,stocks,"kind of, but sometimes they are spot on."
03/29/2021,stocks,Even a broken clock is right twice a day
03/29/2021,stocks,Technical analysis works 50% of the time.
03/29/2021,stocks,I read in an Econ paper that sold tech analysis can have some weak benefits. But only a few components help even a small amount. Basically being an expert is a step up above reading tea leaves. And many people who try to do this are not even experts.
03/29/2021,stocks,Big money uses technical analysis so it follows that the market moves.  I have seen time and time again where the public news followed.  Also I watched an amateur's  you tuber keep saying that it was 1939 all over again as the market rebound from 2009.  Anyone who listened to him missed a lot of gain.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Buy low, sell high. All the technical analysis you really need. Know your fundamentals, what it's worth, why it's undervalued, and when you want to sell. I don't recommend day trading. Fast way to lose money. Most strong plays take a days to weeks, if not months to a year. Buffet says you can't predict or time the market, and this still holds true no matter how many lines you draw on a chart."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It isn't, but you need to pay attention to a bunch of different factors and timeframes. It is really only practical (for most people) to do programmatically."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Currently listening to Trading In The Zone. He says 'no', because no two trades are ever the same."
03/29/2021,stocks,It works about as well as a compass on a planet with shifting polarity
03/29/2021,stocks,"I may be an old fashioned guy buy to me ""investing"" is buying and holding for the long term. So yes, when it comes to investing I think TA is irrelevant.  However, if you want to trade, which I do not consider investing TA can be useful for some.  Depends on what you want to do."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The idea of technical analysis is that you can predict a future stock price using trading history like volume and price movement.

So, yeah, in long-term investing, it’s bullshit. Some trend line on a 30-day chart won’t tell me where the stock price goes in 5 years."
03/29/2021,stocks,Testicle analysis is pretty much horology.
03/29/2021,stocks,it's the anti-vaxxing of finance
03/29/2021,stocks,Yes
03/29/2021,stocks,"Im not super experienced but to a degree I would say yes. There's a level of probability with all of this, just understand that it's a crap shoot. I think it's better to be informed on the market, know how laws affect your returns, how market makers could be moving, and overall sentament of retail."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It is 100% BS in my opinion.

I have ran statistically and advanced ML algorithms and found very very few prediction capability. And the times there was a slight prediction capability, it was much more advanced than what humans are capable of.

It is a waste in my opinion. Otherwise everyone would be rich just by using the TA.

But you can tell whether the stock is volatile or not, but it won’t help much"
03/29/2021,stocks,You’re right it is all bullshit
03/29/2021,stocks,Hmmmm that’s a good point.
03/29/2021,stocks,"A person who actually uses tech analysis successfully in the stock market would find trends that nobody else has realized yet.

Which is extremely difficult. You are basically competing against every math nerd who works in finance. But it is certainly possible. Someone ends up winning on every trade after all, usually it's said math nerd who went to wharton and double majored statistics and finance"
03/29/2021,stocks,It's like inflation. Self fulfilling.
03/29/2021,stocks,"This.   Technical analysis covers the psychology of the market.    That's why companies with poor fundamentals can trade above those with solid fundamentals sometimes for years.    If fundamentals were the only factor,  stocks would be fairly predictable.

Also, many algorithms trigger buys, shorts, and sells based on the technical indicators, which adds to the self-fulfilling prophecy effect.

As some one else posted, the fundamentals become more important than the technicals as you get into much longer hold positions (ie, investing, rather than trading)."
03/29/2021,stocks,Which will predict how the stock will behave. So you are basically saying the same
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yup, RSI over 70 always brings in the FOMO yolos which is why you shouldnt buy in once RSI reaches too high of a level for 1Y or 3M at the minimum. TA is very real and it works more often than not"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m tired of seeing TA every week of a stock “mooning soon”. Sure i guess if people claim something is gonna moon 27 weeks in a row, it’ll become true at some point lol"
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol good one
03/29/2021,stocks,Even then I'm still skeptical. Day traders seem to do really shit at their job
03/29/2021,stocks,"Except it doesn't give you positive odds at all, no more then tarot cards or reading tea leafs. If it worked the market would adjust and any advantage would be lost/priced in. Unless you create *your own, brand new TA* and even if you do the minute you're successful others will follow...




And a majority of traders, even the pros with algos, education and the best TA charts you can dream of looses over time. No chance a retail (amateur) could find a secret TA that works long term"
03/29/2021,stocks,this
03/29/2021,stocks,"Id say slightly less negative odds, but still less than 50/50"
03/29/2021,stocks,"""Gambling with slightly positive odds"" - that's not gambling anymore. Any casino game is still has a house edge even if you optimize your strategy. If TA has any ""slightly positive odds,"" that means the Law of Large Numbers applies and can be done profitably over time. The strategy that comes to mind is 3:1 reward-risk odds that only has to work 25% of the time to break even - anything beyond 25% is just pure profit. With a big enough of a sample size, TA should work."
03/29/2021,stocks,Probably the best explanation here and how I use TA for daytrading
03/29/2021,stocks,I’d go insane
03/29/2021,stocks,"And how do the fundamentals and growth outweigh TA when a growth stock makes great earnings, but then tumbles to everyone's surprise?  Both fundamentals and TA help give one a better \*guess\* at what happens next; but only price pays \[tells the story\]."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Importantly FA will tell you what to buy, and TA tells you when. People trying to apply TA to meme stocks are asking to get burned. Trade solid companies that you'd be happy to invest in and you'll rarely miss a night of sleep."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I will never be a trader, but least now I'm trying to understand my stocks or ETFs better and how they compare to other things, and why I should keep holding or set stops and exit."
03/29/2021,stocks,"TA is statistics of mass psychology. It tells you what is likely to happen, not what will happen. There's a concept that a lot of inexperienced traders ignore called ""waiting for confirmation"". If a certain indicator is accurate 70% of the time, that's pretty good odds. Bt the odds are even better if you are a little bit patient and wait to make sure the price action confirms the signal. The fact of the matter is support and resistance lines ARE accurate gauges of what a stock is likely to do, because most traders (especially institutional traders with their expensive algorithms) use them to make buy/sell decisions"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I dont agree. For 1D with 1m candle sticks sure, patterns are pretty rare to actually be useful but for things like 1Y you can very clearly see real patterns that matter in the psychological aspect. Such as trends and triangle patterns"
03/29/2021,stocks,"What's the difference between saying, ""Look at the charts. Don't depend on the charts."" and saying, ""Look at price; don't depend on price.""  ?"
03/29/2021,stocks,">You can lose 90% of the time, but all it takes is a good winner to outweigh all your losses.

Relying on this sort of gambler's fallacy ironically exposes TA for what exactly it is: bullshit.

03/29/2021,stocks,"TA is more like counting cards in Blackjack.  Except the high is not necessarily 21, it's determined in real time by players at all the tables in all the casinos on the strip.  TA lets you see what they're all doing and act accordingly.  

Because if you're buying long term, just buy.  If you're trading, then it's about the other traders, not the stocks themselves."
03/29/2021,stocks,I don't know of any scientific evidence that it actually increases the success rate. You just made this up and you should feel bad. For all we know TA could just as well reduce your rate of success significantly.
03/29/2021,stocks,">But you can increase your chance of a successful bet

sure, but some evidence that TA can do that would be a requirement to make that assumption. even then, increasing your odds so slightly has a large chance of just being margin of error."
03/29/2021,stocks,"What an utter load of rubbish.

TA doesn't increase your chances of winning, it is at best making an educated guess, more likely it is reading tea leaves."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Wait - you've never seen Warren Buffett's candlestick charts that show how he plays the bounce off the 200-day MA before selling?

03/29/2021,stocks,"The fact that you think technicals are applied to investing shows how little you actually know. Investors don't use technical analysis, because it was never meant to be applied to investing. It's for trading."
03/29/2021,stocks,That is a terrible analogy.
03/29/2021,stocks,The problem is that you are not in a drivers seat if we talk about the stock market. You just imagine that all those numbers are useful for you.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Would you say fundamentals and news is way more important than TA? 

Like if fundamentals are good for a company and news is good, analysts are saying it’s a buy but TA says it’s a sell, what should you do? 

Only buy when all 3 align?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I was going to say the same as this.  TA isn't only for technical analysis.  If you decided to take a position in a company you can use TA to determine when to pull the trigger, or what price to use.  It could be the difference of throwing a market order in when the stock is up against a resistance level or waiting a few minutes and let the price come back down to you near the middle, or support.  It may only be a small difference in price but for something like T it might be the difference between being slightly green with no movement of the stock for months, or looking at that same stock slightly in red with no movement.  Staring at it in red for weeks at a time is going to have a negative psychological impact."
03/29/2021,stocks,It's not.
03/29/2021,stocks,The issue with TA is that it's a lagging indicator but they are useful for seeing patterns and obviously to where there's support and resistence.
03/29/2021,stocks,I am a total newb so makes sense.
03/29/2021,stocks,"> I´ve seen plenty of times where patterns from TA were indeed working.

TA patterns are 100% accurate until the trend changes. Which can happen at any moment and you can't know when it will happen."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You don’t have to beat the computer though. You can just ride the wave. 

I’m satisfied being the little maggot consuming the rotting scraps that are left behind by the heavy hitters."
03/29/2021,stocks,Made me giggle and almost wake my wife up.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thanks but I don’t think I answered your question, is technical analysis worth learning? Well lots of retail traders and institutions trade via computer algorithms who’s job it is to automatically execute trades usually based on technical indicators. So while no technical analysis can ever be perfect, I would argue its worth learning if for no other reason than to find a good entry or exit point for a stock aka finding a good support and resistance. When I was a new trader I would randomly get into trades without any TA and many times been burned at least in the short term."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Trends hold until they don't. This is the exact opposite of a good use for TA; it is far more reliable as a self fulfilling prophesy on popular stocks that everyone is watching (and even then it's not that reliable).

Past a certain entry point, being a bigger math nerd doesn't actually help. Having access to information sooner, having a large enough bankroll to move a stock's price, and having inside information help."
03/29/2021,stocks,"> Someone ends up winning on every trade after all

Nah."
03/29/2021,stocks,GameStop is a perfect example of this. Fundamentally they are worth 20-40 not anything close to 200 lmao.
03/29/2021,stocks,So do you like the idea of getting fundamental ETFs?
03/29/2021,stocks,Happy cake day 🎂
03/29/2021,stocks,"Kind of like picking something that happened in 1929, seeing it happen once here and ""calling"" a crash."
03/29/2021,stocks,I find TA is best used to do the exact opposite. Return to mean is far more likely a prediction than shooting off a bunch in a direction.
03/29/2021,stocks,"That doesn't mean it doesn't work. It just means many people suck at it. 99.99999% of the people in the world would fail if they'd try to make a quantum computer, doesn't mean it can't be done or that quantum computers are useless."
03/29/2021,stocks,Doesn't have to be 50/50. TA with a 3:1 reward-risk only needs to work 25% of the time to break even.
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you're good at it you can absolutely make money, so it's more than 50/50. Most people are just not that good at it so they're lower than 50/50."
03/29/2021,stocks,">TA is statistics of mass psychology.

No, it's not. Statistics is the statistics of mass psychology. There's no mathematical rigour behind TA at all, but there are ACTUAL statistical methods that you can use (time series, cluster analysis, logit reg, etc) that some brainy math PhDs will occasionally write papers on. But they're not dumb enough to actually bet their money on it. These are models far more advanced and comprehensive than the chart reading and indicators used by both your average retail indicators and even some of the institutional algos, and yet they're still not capable of accurately gauging the market's movements.

The bottom line is, the market literally involves millions of variables that chart reading and TA indicators do not wholly account for. There is an entire field of research dedicated to modelling and forecasting not just the market, but group psychology in other applications such as politics, health, consumption, demographics, and so on. TA is hardly a factor in that research."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Markets are fractal.  Whatever can be seen in patterns, support and resistance on a longer time frame \[day, week, month\], can be seen on 1m, 5m, 15m charts.  One chooses their timeframe, and trades that timeframe."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The chart is looking at what happened to the price.  It tells you a lot, but it's doesn't tell you what's going to happen.  Should you buy?  Should you sell?  The charts can help you make your decision, but they're only one tool."
03/29/2021,stocks,">Relying on this sort of gambler's fallacy ironically exposes TA for what exactly it is: bullshit.

No. TA is statistics of mass psychology. If you overlay a fibbonacci pattern on literally any price chart (try it, I'm not kidding) the high and low points will literally match the pattern. Why? Because the stock market is driven by humans, and humans have a tendency to follow certain distributions.

Also, a poker player may have losing hands 90% of the time, and still regularly win tournaments. Does that mean poker strategies are bullshit?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"No. It's called cutting losses on losers fast, and letting the winners ride.

How many stories have you heard where traders have years of winning, only to lose it all on one bad trade? This is exactly that, in reverse."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know right? You could literally guess on every trade without any analysis other than ""it's green!"" and be just as effective as someone who analyzed the chart for an upward wedge pattern."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The scientific evidence are all the investment bankers that hire math nerds to look at computers for 12 hours a day make money off of little spreads the size of a penny. 85% of all trades are done by these algo traders. 

But yea, if you aren't prepared to work as hard as those math nerds at JPM do, you may as well just do voodoo to pick when to trade, because the work that goes into doing it successfully is a lot more then just ""hurr durr 5 red candle sticks, that means green one probably come next"""
03/29/2021,stocks,"lol thanks, do you understand the point I’m trying to make though? TA is a tool to be used in conjunction with many other tools and types of data. It works best with others. Not many people are trading only on chart data."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel like that a bad strategy as well. 

I feel like if news and company fundamentals are good then TA shouldn’t push you out of buying stock? Or should it? I actually don’t know. Tryna gauge what others do."
03/29/2021,stocks,Well then let’s hear your analogy...
03/29/2021,stocks,"First of all Fundamentals, than technical analysis, than news"
03/29/2021,stocks,"well. its not like there aren´t any leading indicators for ""possible"" trend direction changes as well but ok."
03/29/2021,stocks,It's my belief that the entire ecosystem is computers now. High speed computer maggots already ate the scraps.
03/29/2021,stocks,"This.

When I'm ready to buy, I already know the company and what I'm buying, and what price I'm looking for.  After that I use graphs and indicators to help pinpoint the exact point if entry.

Sometimes the market doesnt cooperate, in that I feel x stock is worth y price, and its trading higher or lower, but I can see if I am buying at a high or a low trend at that point in time."
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah that’s where I’m at right now. I guess I’ll need to do more research on these support levels. Do most people calculate these themselves or is there a good site that just tells you where these levels are?

Some websites like yahoo finance or investing.com will tell you what support and resistance is for a particular stock based on their technical analysis but I think for some features you have to pay. However you can also learn how to do this yourself, there are youtube videos that teach you for free and if you want a more structured learning they have courses on sites like Udacity that you can pay for."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Here’s a list of what most professional traders use, and anyone can feel free to add but these are most common and most useful

Fibonacci retracements is a great way to see support levels - search that term

***Other great indicators used by algos are RSI to see when a stock is oversold or overbought

***The 2 other great indicators are MACD and TTM Squeeze.

***People also very commonly use moving averages like EMA’s as mentioned on the 50 day EMA & 200 day EMA, 
when the 50 crosses the 200 day moving average, you have a Significant reversal of the trend either up or down.  

Having 8 & 20 day EMA’s helps further see the trend is bullish or bearish.

—-

Then also be familiar with basic patterns such as  Flags, Pennants, Head & Shoulders, Inverted head & shoulders, Cup & Handle, bearish engulfing candles.  These patterns are actually very common- especially pennants & flags.  


The market is actually something like 70% algo transactions so yes it’s news based but the news can always be what you use to Confirm your indicators."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You should learn it yourself but you don't need to, there are a lot of popular Youtubers who use technical analysis on livestreams and videos and you can just watch and compare them to understand the general sentiment or group think. Another thing that's useful is to look at options charts for calls and puts in order to understand price action, it shows you which horse people are betting on at any given time and who the expected winner is.

It's really a collective illusion, but if everyone believes in it then they make it real. Personally I just use ""reverse CNBC,"" made a fortune on Tesla that way."

03/29/2021,stocks,"It really depends, but I don't think it's as simple as saying it's because of TA. Yes, there are definitely stocks that are heavily traded via algos and day traders, who do use TA extensively. In that way, TA can become a sort of self-fulfilling prophecy as others have mentioned. And in that way it can 'work'. If it works out well for you, by all means.

But my gripe with TA is that it is not in any way scientific, and it does not rely on statistical methods at all. In statistics, when your hypothesis is wrong, you do not simply shrug your shoulders and say oops. You go back to the drawing board and find an explanation as to why, and then you should begin to question your methodology and revise a better one. For example, if you've built a statistical model to track and predict COVID cases in your hometown, and after a few weeks you realize it's getting worse and worse at predicting daily cases as time goes on, you change your variables or scrap the model and try a different one. That does not happen with TA. When every indicator and chart reading point one way, but the stock goes the other, there is no explanation as to why the technical analysis was wrong. And worse, there's no way to adjust your methodology, because you're using shoddy formulas and techniques written by some dudes decades ago that were never meant to be used to actively trade with.

The whole problem that TA tries to tackle is a grand one in which you are trying to predict the actions of 1000s of traders in any given minute/hour/day, and TA is the most primitive way of doing it."

03/29/2021,stocks,"The only people I've ever seen claiming that TA is supposed to predict the future are those who don't use it. It's statistics, like a weather forecast. 80% chance of rain doesn't mean it will rain, but it means you probably shouldn't be planning a picnic.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Ok, but quantum computers, your original example are built with engineering and backed by science. So, ""anyone"" with the proper training could be involved in their production. Same can't be said for TA or picking up girls."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I just started following him. He's doing a 10k - 50k challenge. He's already up to 38k. I am going small following him to start. I started with 1.8k, currently up to 2.2k. All his trades are time stamped so I can add more images/proof if you want:

03/29/2021,stocks,What's you point here? My original example wasn't perfect? Noted. The point still stands.
03/29/2021,stocks,Creating a business isn't a science but it's hard to do and most people fail to do it successfully. Doesn't mean people aren't good entrepreneurs
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,"It would not hurt for a successful investor to use TA. Not to mention that you are conflating the use of TA for investors, and not traders. You also seem to be unable to let go of the idea that TA is about predictions, when in reality, successful traders use it not to predict, but to react to mass market psychology.

As an investor, I use fundamentals. As a trader, I use TA."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They both rely on statistical probabilities based on historical data. What am I missing here?

How do you think big funds like BlackRock decide when to buy or sell? Their algorithms use TA"
03/29/2021,stocks,I never said creating a business was a science nor did I say people aren't good entrepreneurs.
03/29/2021,stocks,If i was that good I'd share tbh. The server you have to pay to stay in it but i found a way around that... but I'll definitely pay once I make enough off his trades.
03/29/2021,stocks,he also started a twitter if you're interested https://twitter.com/kindreddtrading
03/29/2021,stocks,"Investors have plenty of other sources of actionable data about industries and companies to make decisions, all of which are far more useful and informative than whatever pittance of connection to ""market psychology"" that TA offers."
03/29/2021,stocks,"One has a scientific, empirically-established basis that informs trends, and the other doesn't. I'll let you figure out which one is which!"
03/29/2021,stocks,People with training can be good at TA is all im saying
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,"Again. Traders and investors are two entirely different groups of people. This is something that I don't believe that you are grasping.

TA should not be, and is never part of the equation for an investment thesis. However, as part of a *trading* strategy, it works far better than fundamental analysis."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's funny how those who use TA genuinely enter these discussions with goodwill and intent to explain how it works, while those who don't use it are always pretentious. Literally all you have to do is spend a few minutes learning about some technical indicators, pick some stocks, and backtest them. Then see for yourself that it works. Being condescending does not make you more informed."
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm working on a bot to auto follow his trades so I won't have to. If its profitable its free money
03/29/2021,stocks,">However, as part of a *trading* strategy, it works far better than fundamental analysis

Does it? Do you have any verifiable proof?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Here's the thing: the burden isn't on me to disprove it. It is on TA proponents to demonstrate that it *does* work. And I've never come across any examples of a reliable enough implementation of TA to show that it works any better than random guessing.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ever heard of NKLA? Why do you think it still trades at a $5 billion market cap when fundamentally the company is worth $0? Why do you think it still goes on bullshit 20% runs?

Why do you think TSLA is worth as much as it is?

Fundamentally, it doesn't make sense, and based on fundamentals, I would never *invest* in those companies at their current valuations. However, I would *trade* them, long or short, while market psychology (FOMO, hype, or fear) still dictates their price action."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This isn't a high school debate club. If you believe it is hokum and have never researched it, then your belief is based on literally nothing and frankly you shouldn't even be sharing your opinion. You  should either test it yourself, or shut up, because at this point in time your opinion is worthless."
03/29/2021,stocks,You still haven't provided any proof that TA *actually* works. Or have I missed something?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Oooh, you got me that time. Telling me to shut up and that my opinion is worthless. Wow, that screams confidence *and* maturity. Good luck out there!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I believe I have provided ample evidence. Are you expecting me to provide you with a scientific, peer reviewed article or something? Did you know that, fundamental elements such as P/E ratios aren't proven to consistently work either? I still use such fundamental metrics quite widely regardless.

Here's a question: do trends exist on the stock market? The investor thesis is that the long term trend of the market is that it always goes up. The *trader thesis* though, is that there are short term trends that can be taken advantage of, and that's where TA shines. If you still think TA is about ""the stars have aligned on the chart!"", then you've still a lot to learn. 

I'm not here to convince you otherwise of TA, and I do not believe that I'll change your mind, but I have laid out my case."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes because your condescending attitude paired with your clear lack of knowledge on the subject demonstrates a high level of maturity on your part.

Your opinion is worthless because it has no basis in ANYTHING. You simply have a hunch that TA doesn't work and refuse to test that hypothesis. How can you know with such certainty that it doesn't work if you've never tried it?"
2021-03-29 11:07:41,stocks,"If I make a return of $2k through selling shares held for under a year, am I taxed 10% (lowest bracket) due to short-term capital gains tax? Sorry, I'm just a student yet to acquire a job so I have no experience filing taxes. Also, if I make the same return but through shares held over a year, I assume it's not taxed because it falls under 0% long-term capital gains? And how do taxes on dividends work?

Side-note: Who the fuck is supposed to teach me about how to file taxes? My parents (non-US)? College? First job? Wait until the government nags me about it?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Quick answer, if you make less than $12000, you don’t need to file a return because of standard deduction (you’ll have 0 tax liability). If your parents are claiming you as a dependent, I no longer know what the real answer is."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Long story short (I'm no financial advisors not an accountant) but what I've been told is that 12k profit is tax free a year.

Profit us calculated everytime to sell a share.

You won't be taxed if you make 2k as this is within your 12k allowance.

Dividends is a different type of tax and you get 2k dividends tax free allowance a year, then it's taxed at 7.5% for lowest tax bracket.

This is from UK. Also YouTube will have a lot of info.

Source: I called my account last week to sort this before the tax year ends and he explained it to me."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There are a lot of variables at play here (if you're in the US).  Your age, potentially your parents' income level, etc.  But in general, yes, if you have no other sources of income and you have long-term gains (on items held over a year) you'll pay a 0% capital gains rate.

03/29/2021,stocks,Your accountant or turbo tax lmao...
03/29/2021,stocks,What country are you in?
03/29/2021,stocks,"My financial advisor told me a few months ago 25% for short term and 15% for long term (held for over a year) on capital gains. I live in Tennessee. Pretty sure that's all just federal, and I think some states might actually have additional gains taxes."
03/29/2021,stocks,You taxed like a paycheck
03/29/2021,stocks,"So as near as I can tell, you may be considered a non-dependent for purposes of IRS tax filing based on your family situation as described despite being a dependent for FAFSA purposes.  

As for figuring out about if you need to file taxes, you can start with this: [https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return)"
03/29/2021,stocks,does anybody know how this works for Canada?
03/29/2021,stocks,"If stocks is your only source of income, you could probably even write off business expenses - - laptop and phone, for example."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This depends on many factors but I’ll start with the basic. Short term gains are assets held for less than a year at the ordinary income tax rate. So that’s what you’ll be taxed at. I don’t know your income so I can’t say what tax bracket you fall into. But you can find a chart of the different ranges online. Once you know that you need to find what deductions you qualify for. If you get the standard it’s about 12,000 reduced from your income. So if you made 11,000 through a job and 2k through short term stock you will have to pay taxes on 1,000 of income. Then you have to find out if you qualify for credits or had any past credits rollover and reduce that from the total tax owed. This also ignores any dividend received and any long term stock gains you may have received."
03/29/2021,stocks,">Side-note: Who the fuck is supposed to teach me about how to file taxes? My parents (non-US)? College? First job? Wait until the government nags me about it?

When you file through automated services you learn."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The university I use to go to had an international student association and every year about 2 months before tax time they start doing tax meetings and help sessions. That would be a good place for you to start as your parents being international and out of the country would be a common thing they deal with.

However, the short answer for most people is they get trusted tax software (turbo tax, H&R Block). For many it can be free, but it isn't expensive and the software can electronically file for you in some cases. Most people just answer the questions in the software and fill in all of the tax forms they get from their employment, brokerages, etc... It fills out the forms for you and calculates everything for you. The program will also handle State income tax for you.

99 times out of 100 the tax software will auto fill everything accurately and correctly for you. The thing to watch out for is missing a tax form from a brokerage or other place and not knowing how to answer one of the questions posed in the software. Some individuals have a complex situation where this is not a good option and they really need a tax accountant, but the typical person this works. 

This is where I would start. Fill out everything in the program that your asked. Use the tax forms from your brokerage and then seek help if you don't understanding how to answer a question in the tax program.

These tax programs can also electronically file your taxes for you. If they don't they give you specific instructions on what to print out, where to mail, and -how- to mail it. As someone who did have a filing problem with the IRS once via mail, follow those instructions carefully as they solve problems when things go wrong (ie. use Certified Mail, if you send a check always write in the form you sent in with your check). I use HR & Block software most years and it seems to work well.

In all likelihood you're not going to be paying any taxes, but it is a small possibility you might have a small tax from the state your in based on their laws. Some of this will depend on whether your parents filed US taxes and if they claimed you as a dependent. 

A general note on life.... I hate to pop any bubbles, but there isn't always suppose to be an outside entity to tell us how to do everything. Part of becoming an adult is learning to figure things out for ourselves. Luckily, we live in a world with internet that makes it easy to search for answers.

If you wait until the government nags, you waited to long. Most people would get some help from your parents, but you do have international parents out of country, so they might not know. It isn't the job of a college, but sometimes they have support groups that can help answer questions. It is actually your job and it rests on your shoulders. The best thing you can do is be proactive and start early."
03/29/2021,stocks,There's plenty of books. Hire a CPA. H&R Block? (those idiots will pay you to take a class to fill out other folks taxes)
03/29/2021,stocks,"This will depend on whether he's eligible to be claimed as a dependent.  If he is, he'll need to file if he has 1100 or more in capital gains."
03/29/2021,stocks,You can also backdate the losses. 12k is tax free for capital gains tax.
03/29/2021,stocks,"For the US, the answer is different. 

Op is likely a dependent, so their standard deduction on this type of income is 1100.00."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Thanks! My parents are Asian and consequently work in Asia, so they can't really offer much that would be relevant to American taxes, especially when it comes to taxes on this matter."
03/29/2021,stocks,"folks, google the gains tax brackets and be amazed. long term gains arent taxed if your income is low. short term gains are, but at lower amounts."

03/29/2021,stocks,I identify from an Asian nation but I was born in the US and am trading in the US market.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Short term gains are taxed at whatever your normal income tax rate is.  So, the same rate you would pay on a salary (not counting FICA etc. withholding)."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I always put aside 22%/13% (short/long) as my tax safety net. In Texas."
03/29/2021,stocks,"So if I'm a dependent, my return is only tax-free up to $1100 instead of $12k? I'm also assuming this is about short-term capital gains."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Also, just to add to the two above me. If you do end up getting a job, the short term gains would be combined with your taxable income from your job to determine your tax bracket

03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m talking about total income, not exclusively stocks...if you earn $20k a year from your job and $5k from stocks you pay nothing on your stocks"
03/29/2021,stocks,"That's a hard call to make then, without knowing all the details. You may have the 1100.00 standard deduction, but you may have the 12.5k standard deduction. Or you may be a non resident alien and have a 0 standard deduction."
03/29/2021,stocks,For tax purposes it doesn’t really matter what you identify as. The applicable tax laws depend on what country you’re living right now.
03/29/2021,stocks,Good clarification. Thanks!
03/29/2021,stocks,That's correct.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I see, thanks everyone!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"like op pointed out, nobody is teaching anybody about taxes."
03/29/2021,stocks,And they downvoted you for being right
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,"What details would you need? I'm a standard american citizen, studying in Texas. My parents are of a different nationality and live outside the States, paying taxes to a different nation. However, I did identify as a dependent of my parents when filling my FAFSA, so I'm thinking that makes me a dependent of my parents."
03/29/2021,stocks,Straight clowns
03/29/2021,stocks,Then either the laws have changed or you filed incorrectly my friend
03/29/2021,stocks,"Sorry if my ""identifying"" confused you. I'm of an Asian ethnicity, but I am your standard US-born citizen otherwise."
03/29/2021,stocks,"So you do get some type of standard deduction, as a US citizen.   


Are your parent's US citizens, or not?   


What funds are you using for your support? Scholarships? Loans? Grants? Money from your parents?   


Being a dependent for FAFSA is different then being a tax dependent."
03/29/2021,stocks,If you sold your positions in a year and realized 2k it gets taxed as a short term capital gain which is the same rate as your income tax.if you make less than the standard deduction there’s a high chance you don’t owe any taxes.
03/29/2021,stocks,*as long as they are long term capital gains and you have held the stocks for at least a year. Short term gains are taxed at normal income tax rates
2021-03-29 11:01:05,stocks,"Do large brokerages deal with currency risks when they create international index funds? Hi all, 

I was curious if large brokerages (like Vanguard) deal with large currency impacts when it comes to international index funds. Specifically:

1. When Vanguard uses a US-domiciled fund like VTIAX to invest in equities on foreign stock exchanges, do they first exchange USD into that foreign currency before investing?
2. Then when those foreign equities issue dividends (presumably in foreign currencies), does Vanguard pay FX fees to convert those dividends back into USD to pay US investors?

How does Vanguard deal with all this FX risk / cost?

Thanks!"
03/29/2021,stocks,have you tried googling it ??
03/29/2021,stocks,"They have customers in many countries investing in local currencies, so they maybe do internal fx, or price it into the fund fees/return, I would assume."
03/29/2021,stocks,I wouldn't even know how to google this question
03/29/2021,stocks,"Most indexes and stocks are only traded in one currency. The many customers convert their own currency to get access. In my case my broker is my bank, I give them euros, they exchange them at the bank's rate into dollars, i give those dollars to the broker inside same bank, and the broker gives those dollars to NYSE who don't accept anything else. All electronically of course."

We are assuming the initial decline had nothing to do with Archegos, correct?  And then at some point, on Thursday or Friday, their value ostensibly dropped below Archegos's margin maintenance requirement with places like CS and Nomura (?), thus prompting/requiring Archegos to cash out in a major way in order to fulfill its obligations to those banks?

Assuming this is correct . . . why would Archegos have needed to sell **$20B** in shares -- based on news reports?   This sounds like a staggering amount of money.  Does that not assume that they had to have been long those positions in the first place?  

Thank you."

(b) This is not over and credit Suisse and Nomura have to dump a few billion more in stocks, a few more stocks are going to drop hard, but then this ends

(c) the b scenario happens, but other hedge funds are over leveraged and the sell off means that they get margin called and then they have to sell which leads to other firms getting margin called etcetera etcetera, and Archegos becomes the 2021 version of Lehman Brothers who crashed and helped start the 2008 market collapse"

03/29/2021,stocks,"Look at it this way:

1. You leave money in and see what happens; if no major negative things happens and it normalizes, you could see 10% gains

2. You leave money in and see what happens; it plummets 30% before stabilizing and you have to ride it back up

3. You pull out now and see what happens; if it goes up and never plummets you miss out on those 10% gains, but if it plummets you have a chance to double your position

How much do you think it's going to drop? If you can afford to eat the opportunity costs of letting your money float in your funds for a week while you try to snipe your way back in you could make a decent chunk of change. You could also snipe back in at only 20% drop while it races down to a 50% drop. But then you'd have ridden it from your old position so does it really matter?"

I wonder if we've reached another peak the last year in this near 0 interest rate up up away environment has resulted in leverage being loosened to levels not seen since prior to 08.

Let’s say you pull out your money when the stock’s worth 10 USD. After that the price increases to 11 USD and you have missed out on 1 USD of profit. If you want to get back in you’d also have to spend 11 USD, meaning you would lose more than the initial 1 USD."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Thanks for the info. 

I think I was thinking about the aftermath. When the market crashed in 1929, banks issued margin calls. Due to the massive number of shares bought on margin by the general public and the lack of cash on the sidelines, entire portfolios were liquidated. As a result, the stock market spiraled downwards. Many investors were wiped out, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), which guarantees depositors' funds, didn't exist back then. Many Americans began withdrawing their cash from banks while the banks, which made too many bad loans, were left with significant losses."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I think you're being a bit disingenuous when you say that Bear Stearns was seen a mile away.

I was monitoring a lot of financial news in this period of '08 since I was just an intern with a lot of time on my hands (time this was well before reddit became the defacto place for online article discourse). 

What was being discussed behind closed doors was whether or not Bear or Lehman would be saved like a lot of other institutions and what had happened was that the powers that be decided that they would both fail which was the main black swan event that took the entire market down.   


These failures caused uncertainty since no one know who else was exposed and if they would be left to fail like aforementioned. 

At this moment we won't know who is exposed until it's too late and as new information potentially gyrates the market that could cause other firms to get called out buy prime brokers. 

The actual news of some big institutional failures will 100% cause panic. 

Archegos is possibly just the first small domino to fall. We're not sure but it could  create waves of deleveraging that we wouldn't see for weeks. I think we are getting closer to a market breaking point but it will probably take a few more bumps in the treasury yields to display more weakness.

Regardless of other financial people ""seeing it coming"". The actual selling panic comes when uncertainty breeds into the market and then the broader market precipitates the slide. It's too early to tell now but it can easily happen gradually and then suddenly."

The legit don't care if you can never afford to actually own an asset.  If the markets start to warn about inflation they will just increase bond buying and continue to national private debts.  Inflation is great for the rich, inflate away your debts and pass the cost to consumers.

Not their houses, but by the time it was all settled their investment capital basically went _\*poof\*_

There is A LOT more that goes into calculating your capital gains income than most realize; it's not as simple taking your buy/sell difference.

But yea the main thing is the uncertainty that starts pervading the market once we see the shenanigans being played behind the curtain. There is already a small post-mortem on the Archegos event which does show that there were derivative instruments allowing them to take on a lot more leverage than regulations would have allowed.

I have heard people are pulling from their retirement accounts to do this. Also realize that the reported sale price is the appraisal number and does not include the amount over appraisal.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah guys stop it’s not a bailout when other hedge funds do it, it’s considered a “side car investment”

Totally not a bailout guys. Do not worry Melvin investors, I can confirm that Citadel securities did not in fact bailout Melvin Capital with $2.5 billion. It was a smart investment of $2.5 billion, okay? See the difference? Good, totally not a bailout."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Well I know that there is excess in the system and invesent bank leverage and margin debt reflects that plus investment bank stock prices only go parabolic during a bubble, so yes I see a crash but I can't call a date it may be starting now or may happen two years from now, just stick with safe stocks that you are comfortable with for the long term. Don't try and time a crash more money has been lost doing that then during the crash, however I belive if you see something coming its easier not to panic when it happens."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm not making stuff up lol all you had to do was just simply look at inbestment bank leverage and figure out that they were taking excessive risk, I didn't predict a date duh but I knew it was coming and bear and lehman where the most leveraged so it was obvious who would fall first, plus the housing bubble was being called out by many major economists so it wasn't hard to miss."
03/29/2021,stocks,Appraisals often trail behind the market price if prices are going up or down rapidly as they're based on historical sales. That's not to say that prices won't collapse and crush these people but the price people are willing to pay on the open market is the real value.

03/29/2021,stocks,">I didn’t predict a date duh

Exactly. Thanks for proving my point.

One thing you’re right about, there will be a crash at some point. It could be next year or in 10 years. We all know it will happen some day, but you have absolutely no idea when exactly it will be. Your guess is as good as any random Joe’s on the street. You’re not some Nostradamus, you’re just guessing like the rest of us, stop blowing smoke up our asses."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Got it, Citadel bought Melvin after their $16 billion loss, just like buying the dip. That’s some smart Prudent investing strategy from Citadel. Definitely not a bailout."

2021-03-29 08:18:29,stocks,"How much does pre-market trading affect opening price? Interested in a stock that I (probably incorrectly) think will take off tomorrow.  Currently listed at 15.50, I put in a limit buy order of 47 shares at 16.25 for opening, to protect against paying a huge amount due to an opening spike.

1 - does that even make sense as a thing to do?

2 - can pre-market trading drive the price up before open, to well past my limit buy order, and as a result I don't get any shares?

Thanks"
03/29/2021,stocks,I hate buying on Monday mornings. Always a rip followed by profit taking.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Depending on the stock and volume- a lot.
Higher volume with a sharp increase or decrease in price, indicates that there is something happening and the big boys (the investment bankers and market makers) get first crack at the volatility.
So watching individual stocks can be an indication of something big happening stock related.
If the whole market shifts- look the fuck out.

We’re getting ready to bounce!"
03/29/2021,stocks,">2 - can pre-market trading drive the price up before open, to well past my limit buy order, and as a result I don't get any shares?

Yes, and it can then tank within minutes and your buy order is fulfilled on the way down.

In a way, pre-market price directly affects opening price since it is actually the last trade so that's the price. The very next trade can have a completely different price though. A stock has no obligation to stay anywhere near opening price for any amount of time."
03/29/2021,stocks,Just keep an eye at 4am New york time on yahoo finance for the pre market price
03/29/2021,stocks,Just check the bid and ask prices pre-market if you can’t get a real time quote.
03/29/2021,stocks,It two days it will go down below $15 then you get in.
03/29/2021,stocks,Limit buys can be set for pre market and after hours. Check your brokerage websites FAQ and/or google it.
03/29/2021,stocks,yeah
03/29/2021,stocks,Almost all of the gains and losses of indices happen outside of market hours.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yup
03/29/2021,stocks,Yessir. And from the open the stock can drop.
03/29/2021,stocks,Definitely isn’t gonna be a rip tmrw morning lol
03/29/2021,stocks,"Bid and ask are currently over 18.  I guess this means the limit I have set right now is too low.

03/29/2021,stocks,"You’re right. And it’s only been getting worse, and it 100% on purpose to screw people over holding options, because the same guys doing it are also writing contracts. Doesn’t matter if we’re both downvoted here, you’re actually totally correct."
03/29/2021,stocks,"A few. But often those are dependent on derivatives that get rebalanced after close, meaning they will move against you when you have zero facility to react.

Dig up the charts on XIV (now defunct) if you want an example.  It was famous for consistently having 2/3rds of its movement happen overnight. Then it was famous for moving 95% overnight, triggering acceleration (forced redemption), and wiping out everyone holding it."

03/29/2021,stocks,What's the volume on those bids and asks? What's the usual volume/volume you expect on open? Completely normal market movement can wipe out (fulfill) all those orders in no time.

Fourth quarter Net Loss was $298.3 million, compared to Net Income of $15.2 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. Fourth quarter Net Margin was (194.3%). The loss was primarily due to a $296.7 million year-over- year increase in stock-based compensation expense and payroll tax expense related to stock-based compensation, including $285.3 million related to the non-recurring Co-Chief Executive Officers’ awards made in connection with the IPO. The loss was also due to a $41.7 million non-cash non-recurring charge related to a charitable stock donation in support of our philanthropic endeavours. We committed to this donation at the time of our IPO and executed on it in the fourth quarter.
Net Loss for the full year was $293.6 million, compared to Net Income of $66.0 million in 2019. Full year Net Margin was (53.3%)."

Then I got prescribed another medication that my insurance is refusing to cover and there’s no generic version or really even any alternative options that I know of. It’s nearly $1500/month. How much is it on GoodRX? $1450..."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know several pharmacies around here that refuse to accept Good RX. Dunno what they did to piss em off, but it's a growing issue and makes me hesitant. Walmart, our CVS, and Kroger will not accept their bins"

Long story short, I don't talk to this friend anymore.

I may go back into it, especially at this price."
03/29/2021,stocks,Amazon hasn’t started doing prescriptions
03/29/2021,stocks,"Apparently GoodRX is costing the pharmacies boatloads of cash.  They don't completely reimburse them for the drugs. My understanding from the techs at the hospital is you can throw a proper hissy fit if a location tries to deny you and eventually they'll accept it...but the embarrassment/PIA of having to go full Karen is enough to make folks just use a different one or skip it entirely. Let's face it, people who are at the pharmacist generally are sick and not in a mood to fight over a few bucks.

It makes sense once she explained it.  Some chains can handle a loss here and there but until the company can play nice with the dispensers or becomes one themselves it's a ticking bomb.  Even the big boys aren't going to let themselves get shorted forever."

Timing is bad or I'd actually buy into it tomorrow but I have some bets that I have to wait a couple more weeks to see if they pan out."
03/29/2021,stocks,I think that’s why it dropped from  $70. I believe it was an over reaction and think we will see $50 again
03/29/2021,stocks,Any bets worth sharing?

Hopefully if I'm able to exit my thing in a week or two I'll get back into the gates if it's still at the low price."
03/29/2021,stocks,I think Amazon is going to link having Amazon Prime and also it will take a few days from medicine to be delivered where GoodRX you can pick up same day and not have to pay a membership fee to benefit. Also don’t have to worry about someone stealing your Prescriptions from the mailbox
03/29/2021,stocks,112m ppl have Amazon Prime. Not including shared accts. thats an awfully high number to go against. I think you underestimate what a company of this size can do to competition

03/29/2021,stocks,Ive held disney since 2000 when it was ~$40. I'll continue to hold.
03/29/2021,stocks,"My cost basis for DIS is less than a $100.  Added more at $81 last year.  :)  I expect DIS to pull back quite a bit from recent prices in the event of a general market decline but my cost basis is low enough I feel comfortable holding.   I won't be adding at the current price.

The ideal stock to hold is a solid company at a great price.  There are lots of great companies but it can take patience and luck to buy at a great price.  If you get that then you get a good margin of safety with a great return, the Holy Grail.  Hold on until something changes in the business to indicate it is no longer a great company."

I like them long term because I’m a fan of most of what they do and they’ve figured out some things - but let’s not act like it’s a set it and forget it stock and always has been."
03/29/2021,stocks,Long term I think Disney is great. I recently bought the dip at 185. It’ll hit 200. Bought it also when it was 120 last year. Then sold it for GME 😄

03/29/2021,stocks,Don't forget that you so have more options than just hold and sell! We often forget that selling just a portion of our stock is also a viable option.

don't matter how good it actually is, I see a path were it will stay at 200$ line for a LONG time and you will most def not see substantial growth. If you are a safe value long term person, sure, but if you want anywhere from 30% return from year, I somehow doubt it. DIS is already sort of expensive and not 100 anymore. I know some will dislike this comment but I just don't see the stock itself moving a lot and becoming the new AAPL of this year."

Not just for Media and streaming,there is also the theme parks for post Covid recover, they also develop and create a lot of the technology they use as well. DIS has its hands in a lot that’s worthwhile in my mind. 

Buying dips is what I’m doing with DIS"
03/29/2021,stocks,Its never a bad idea to sell and take some profits when something has run up so much.  However DIS is solid and will likely continue to grow did a while.  Now they are starting to eat Netflix lunch as well so.
03/29/2021,stocks,"If I had to put all my money into one stock for two years, it'd be Disney."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Am I the only one that’s going to come out and say Disney is a strong sell right now? Historical PE of roughly 20 and forward PE of 65. Parks and cruises are still a long way off from fully reopening (Parks is what, like a 25% soft reopen in Q2). We don’t know the price elasticity on Disney+, the product people usually point to justify their high valuation. For comparison, Netflix, which has demonstrated a 2x dollar consumer willingness to pay, is trading at a forward PE of 51.

Absolutely fantastic company and will kill it over the long term, two decades from now they will still be around and printing money. Just a very poor valuation and investment at this point in time. There are so many better places out there to put money if you’re going to invest. This is what Buffett would call a wonderful company at a terrible price."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I sold some Disney and thinking about closing my position entirely. Great company, would buy again when priced appropriately."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’d take my money and buy it when it hits a hundred again. The market is adjusting to PEs of 30-35, DIS has a forward PE of 49

They’re going to get smoked in this rotation, take the money and find some decent large cap that’s still trading at 23x or less and hang out for a few months."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't know much about the fundamentals of Disney, so take this with a grain of salt, but one thing I do know a lot about is Star Wars, and I can just tell you I saw their price surge when they released their list of shows and thought... ""Why?""

Mando generated a lot of buzz when it was released initially because star wars fans were excited about a live action star wars show, plus they had a strong beginning which attracted mainstream viewers. But now that their initial story which was established in the first episode is over, I really don't think as many people are going to care about the third. Shows retain audiences with memorable characters that the audience feels something for, Mandolorian has none of those, every character seems copy and pasted from an algorithm

Boba Fett and Kenobi, again, might generate some buzz because all the star wars fans are going to be excited. But just like with the Mandalorian, I don't think they'll actually be good shows, they'll be something that your girlfriend will fall asleep to while you try to explain all the lore and references to her.

Now, just by itself, that would make me not necessarily bearish, but just, not really bullish either. But there's like 7 more star wars shows they are making. I think almost all are going to flop. Disney just has no idea how to do star wars. I have no idea how that affects the stock price, I don't have an opinion on it being a buy or a hold, but I would factor it in your decision that Disney is killing at least of their golden geese by continuously releasing cash grab shows containing nothing but fan service"
03/29/2021,stocks,"So -- looking at the graph of the last 3 years, Disney seems wildly overvalued to me. I keep wanting to buy but then I look and see that graph and it's just gone up so much this year it seems like I'd be buying in at a bad time. Is there something I've missed here? Why has it run up so much during a time when it should be hurting, given the closed parks, lack of movies in theaters, etc? Seems like all the recovery and then a lot more is already priced in."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Im new but i feel most stocks at this point are not holds, anything thats doubled or trippled in value since a year ago is being propped up by the stimmy package, long term holds for me

03/29/2021,stocks,Those who hold. Are you reinvesting dividends (for when they restart again)?

03/29/2021,stocks,I think you should hold your Disney stock.  Its got more to go..
03/29/2021,stocks,"I second this.  Disney is for sure a lifetime hold.  It has been for the last 75 years.  They buy up their competition.  They are constantly putting out new material.  If nothing else, the new Marvel phase is only just beginning."
03/29/2021,stocks,What are the other 6 ?
03/29/2021,stocks,Would you put in more even at this price point?
03/29/2021,stocks,Its out in Singapore already at least.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Think I'm started to agree seeing those numbers. As a big nerd, I can just say (and I just wasted a lot of time writing long winded posts about it because I'm procrastinating finishing a dreadful assignment) that they are really milking star wars and marvel too much. I'm willing to bet they will run into problems with those franchises over the next couple of years. They are just making too much content with them.

Sure it's Disney and they'll just buy out a new franchise and then destroy that one within a week if SW and marvel stop being a cash cows, but I think it's priced right now based on people believing that Avengers 36 is going to get as many viewers as Avengers 1-35, and that's just not happening"
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is the correct answer, thanks for some company on this thread. “Valuation” seems to be a dirty word when dealing with a wonderful company."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Disney plus, was not around during the years you are looking at.

Legit competitor to Netflix."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Nah you’re looking at the right stuff. If you scroll through this thread there is basically zilch on valuation, most of it is “Disney is a buy and hold forever company.”

I put up above but here’s some good ammo - Disney historical PE is 20. Their forward PE is 65. Netflix, which has demonstrated a 2x consumer price point of Disney+ has a forward PE of 51. Netflix is also the undisputed leader in streaming. Can someone really convince me that Disney + can bring the company’s valuation up that much, especially when they have less viewers and half the monthly consumer cost point? It is fantasy. 

Furthermore, we are in the middle of a pandemic. No idea when Parks will open fully, they’re at 25% in Q2. Same with cruises. The valuation is ridiculous. 

The scary thing is I take this thread as an indicator of who is investing in the stock market and feel like there is going to be a rude awakening at some point. Or a very expensive lesson."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think there are a lot of value traps in the stocks you are talking about “boomer stocks”. During the pandemic the reason technology stocks did so well was because they were the companies that were providing a need to society. I think a lot of the so-called recovery stocks companies will not be around.  We are going to see so much closure. Just my opinion. Technology is everything Fintech, Biotech, e-commerce’s, the future of cars, new age internet....etc"
03/29/2021,stocks,Only problem with your thesis is that the stagnant  boomer stocks you’re taking about haven’t grown in decades; what makes you think they’ll grow now? A stock that didn’t grow during one of the best bull markets in history likely has A LOT of problems.
03/29/2021,stocks,That's the plan!
03/29/2021,stocks,When do they restart dividends
03/29/2021,stocks,The mouse always wins.
03/29/2021,stocks,Disney's has so many cash cows.  I would hold that long too if you're not just trading short term.  Marvel and star wars alone will provide endless content for Disney +.   This company is powerful and cutthroat.  They have armies of lawyers protecting their IP.  You can't even sell a damn watch with any Disney characters without getting a cease and decist letter.  That means licensing gonna keep bringing in the cash.  They even managed profit with all the parks closed last quarter.  Just amazingly well run.
03/29/2021,stocks,Marvel and Starwars alone are going to net them a killing.
03/29/2021,stocks,I’m also curious
03/29/2021,stocks,It’s a buy below $192 based on technicals. I’m also holding long term and adding more here. Short term we may feel some pain.
03/29/2021,stocks,[deleted]
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah some are better suited than others for the future, i just see any stock that doubled or tripled during a pandemic as very risky, a correction is coming and those companies that thrived off money from the government have the biggest downside.  The ones that were more stable both down and up are the ones with the lesser risk, to me anyway.  I dont think a growth stock is going to do well when stimmys stop coming in.  Again it depends on the company but my metric is simply looking at the 52 week high and lows, i see the risk as any stock could hit its 52 week low. So the closer the stock already is to that the less the risk. That being said i see new lows being made at some point, short term is the only play for me except what im already bag holding until the new lows hit"
03/29/2021,stocks,"They arnt growth stocks thats why they dont grow much.  My thesis isnt that they would grow at all.  However there are alot of people jumping on them right now so there is the possibility but im not banking on it.  The point is most of them give dividends and sometimes they move a little bit. My main point is im waiting for the dip on whatever looks tasty but trying to avoid double or triple over lows stocks, and only holding short term.  Hoping to avoid the crash, hoping to buy the crash. So basically im snatching dividends and hoping not to lose much on the crash which will let me piviot to the basement bargin prices when it does"
03/29/2021,stocks,🤷‍♂️
03/29/2021,stocks,This seems so obvious either OP is screwing with us... or he doesn't have a damn clue what he is doing.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I really think they aren't going to see as much revenue coming from these franchises going forward.

Star wars fans never thought they would ever get an episode 7. Marvel fans never thought they would see their favorite characters get such high budgeted movies with cross overs. There was a wave of excitement and hype that won't be there anymore. 

I see the Avengers being like xmen, where once they had to reboot and start introducing heroes nobody really cared for it started to fall off. Star wars is never going to have another weekend like Force Awakens again. 

Not that it's going to hurt Disney long term or anything, but short term I can see there being problems because of how reliant Disney is on these franchises. At a certain point they'll start releasing hundred garillion dollar avengers movie and lose a tons of money when only families with young children go and see them"
03/29/2021,stocks,"VT, AVUV, AVDV, O, WPC, BOMN, TWTR, DIS, SQ.

9 I guess. But that’s my entire portfolio."
03/29/2021,stocks,Appreciate the input my dude!
03/29/2021,stocks,"What makes you think they won't crash with the rest? I think being specific matters, here. A dividend stock could stop paying a dividend during a general crash. That's what happened with many of the air lines stocks. Also, many of them DO follow the market down WITHOUT following the market up. Look at T, as an example - in 2008 T took a dive with the rest of the market and went from $40 to $20. But while the rest of the market recovered and went to an all time high, T is still at $30 today. That's a terrible return for investment if you just held through the crash, even with the 7% dividend, because the rest of the market is up like 200%.

That's the danger with these kinds of stocks. Most of them will participate in the crash, but won't participate in the recovery."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Literally just trying to get some insight man. I don't deal with individual stocks often, chill."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is crazy talk. You’re comparing avengers to X-men? People are gobbling marvel content up. Especially since they are steaming spin-offs such as Loki, Wandavision and falcon winter soldier. Those alone are huge benefits for Disney plus.  They have built such a successful universe through Marvel and continue to do so. I doubt they will reboot anything for a long time. Star Wars has gained a lot from the  fan service show The Mandolorian and the upcoming obi show. All that and still dishing out some pretty great animated movies like Soul and Raya. Some movies they are charging $30 rentals and I’m sure most with Disney plus purchased those movies. Don’t they own Pixar? Sorry, but this is such an odd comment considering the hype for all of these franchises presently."
03/29/2021,stocks,Every movie nets them a billion dollars. Then there’s all the toys and merchandise. Every single MCU movie in the past decade has been a smash. They’re really producing solid content and all the ancillary shows are just building the hype even bigger when the movies come out they’re going to blow up.
03/29/2021,stocks,I know what you are thinking but I can't see that happening with the amount of content and new ip being developed by armies of teams under the Disney flag.
03/29/2021,stocks,"T is probably the worst example because they have other facts like directv, but long term it’s actually good because it didnt over inflate with the stimulus.  So in theory next crash it doesnt have nearly as hard of a fall.  Now look at square from 48 to almost 300?  If you bought in at the high thinking its going to continue, well of it crashes your losing 4x your money.  If T crashes again your losing half? Maybe? But while you sit and wait your getting 7% so lets say for example 2-4 years for a real crash thats 14-28% youve almost crash proofed yourself and thats assuming you went to sleep on the stock market and waited to sell at the bottom.  My idea isnt to wait that long, to get out at some point then wait and jump into something with lots of growth potential.  Not to ride the crash back up inside a dividend stock.  But if your in a aristocrat dividend stock the chances of them removing the dividend are lower so thats still a potential play.  Considering it does take a while for the market to go back up 7% probably isnt a bad thing"
03/29/2021,stocks,"For real though, unless you need the money... never sell Disney. Only buy more."
03/29/2021,stocks,I mean it is the nicest way 😌
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks man. Would you consider it even at this price point if you could toss a g in?
03/29/2021,stocks,"I mean, if you're trying to do trades and all that than there are better options available.  It's not like Disney is just gonna shoot up to $800 this year.  But if you're looking for a long term investment that will never let you down, it's one of the best (imo). Not an advisor"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Stocks are going through a cycle currently... I'd expect it to drop at minimum for a week or two before going back up.

The least amount of fun you can have is buying a stock somewhere near it's all time high and waiting for it to go back up. Trust me on this."
03/29/2021,stocks,"IMO, if you're looking to *invest* $1000 right now, I'd buy $AAPL over $DIS
But again, that's a buy and hold forever stock."
2021-03-29 05:37:38,stocks,"ENPH Ensemble storage revenues priced in? When the stock market has such an aggressive pull back on the hot 2020 stocks (ie. green energy, cloud/SaaS, high tech growth, etc), it made me revisit my conviction with all the stocks I own.

This had me re-reading the ENPH Q4 annual report. In 2020, ENPH didn't sell any energy storage solutions. In their Q4, the 10K states that ENPH will introduce a new energy storage product called Ensemble.

https://investor.enphase.com/node/18836/html#ib51ac078944f40aabcb529ec51955ccf_409

> We expect further revisions of our storage products with Ensemble technology to be released in 2021, with a focus on the grid-agnostic IQ 8 PV microinverter for residential installations.

This is reinforced on their website:

https://enphase.com/en-us/ensemble-technology-enphase-installers


Looking at their 10K, its not very clear whether their storage solution is included in their revenue. Their supplemental data only covers microinverter system shipments:

> https://investor.enphase.com/static-files/5e9174b7-a787-4e4d-8d7b-307ce2813b77

But their annual report press release states that their Ensemble storage solution increased by 35%

Does anyone know how their storage solution is incorporated into their aggregate revenue? Also, does anyone have a feeling if the growth projections of their storage solution is priced into the stock price?

The PE ratio is currently at a monstrous ~150 with PS ratio of 25. With their market cap currently at $20B with annual revenue of $774M and net income of $133M.

ENPH has to see revenues increase by 20x to get to a reasonable PE ratio. Its not TSLA levels ridiculous, but its up there."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's a tough stock to time buying into considering the multiples it went up over the past year and it's currently in the middle of an extended dip.

Comparing it to something like VZ which was at a 180 day low within the past month... I'd feel a hell of a lot safer buying VZ anywhere near that dip. Would sleep better at night and not have to check the market everyday of the week."
03/29/2021,stocks,I prefer NEE for a green energy stock. But thats just my opinion and I don’t know much about ENPH.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’ll admit the pullback shook me off ICLN, LAC and SUNW permanently. I took my losses and bought AAPL. Sleeping much better at night now. Like a baby"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I had NEE, and liked it. But because its a regulated utility, you have to be comfortable with the slow progressive gains. It made an impressive 100% gain in the past 3 years, and for a regulated utility that's impressive.

ENPH is a B2B and B2C business that sells microinverters for converting DC solar panel generated electrical to AC.

When you say ""thats just my opinion"", what is your specific opinion on why NEE is the best green energy stock?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Great fundamentals, plus they are continuing to expand their solar and wind plants from out of the state of Florida. Yes its slow progressive gains but I am playing the market long term and buying stocks in companies that are going to be around and big in the future and NEE is doing just that. Also if your looking for short term catalysts, Biden is about to pass his infrastructure bill which NEE will certainly benefit. Like I said I don’t know much about ENPH and havent done any research on them. The main thing that puts me off of them is that they are one of those speculative stocks that absolutely exploded in just one year off of hype while NEE has been slowly growing the last 5 years."
2021-03-29 05:26:11,stocks,"Does anyone just own SCV, REITs, etc. outright instead of as part of an official ""tilt""? Just curious if anyone owns small cap value funds like AVUV, AVDV, VBR, etc. or REITs (O, WPC, VNQ, etc.) in a fixed $ allocation vs. as a tilt as part of their overall portfolio?

Whenever I see discussions around divesting from the ""total stock market / total bond market"" portfolio, people seem to either always mention a tilt, or individual equities they own in a ""play"" account.

I rarely see someone saying they own $10k of VNQ or $10k of VBR just to see what happens, outside of any normal allocation. Is this because these things are only beneficial when you own them in a way where you can get the rebalancing bonuses, etc.?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Think you may be arguing semantics here because overall allocations should be considered as a percentage of total investable assets. For me, my Roth IRA is dedicated entirely to individual REITs because I believe VNQ is way too overweight on cell towers and data centers. In a way I’m trying to tilt exposure away from that but I believe in these individual REITs and have a fixed amount in each."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I guess in this case I wouldn’t have to rebalance from TSM into REITs (or vice versa). 

Do you plan to add to your REIT allocation if TSM grows or only when you feel like REITs deserve more of your cash?

I would love to dedicate my entire Roth to REITs but wouldn’t know how to factor that into all of my other holdings. I don’t want to “have” to have a 10% REIT allocation."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah that’s a dilemma. To be honest the way I have it now, I did a major overhaul of my Roth earlier this year so I’m basically slightly overweight REITs compared to where I’ll end up based on my contributions and some basic calculations. I’ve overshot it slightly but over the year it’ll adjust back to where I want it, about 15%. I’m a believer in REITs and overall I have a fairly barbell approach, with a decent bifurcation between “growth” and “value/income”. I don’t like to describe them as such because my growth names have great FCF generation already, they just don’t pay a dividend. And likewise my value/income names are still growing and in some cases (some REITs) in very aggressive expansion mode. So it’s overall very nuanced, but either way most of my money is in TSM and an international allocation. 

To answer your question, I’d contribute more to REITs definitely, especially if they’re good value at the time. I just need to consider the tax implications since the Roth contribution is a small fraction every year and in the end I don’t want REITs to get dwarfed by everything else."
03/29/2021,stocks,Got it! So sounds like you generally have “about 15%” but it isn’t a hard and fast rule compared to TSM?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Exactly. I’m targeting between 10-20%, if it goes significantly over (unlikely) or under, I’m willing to think about allocating non-tax advantaged dollars if there’s a good opportunity remaining in REITs."
03/29/2021,stocks,Got it! Thanks for the help.

03/29/2021,stocks,Pretty sure it's for terrafarming mars with John deere tractors.
03/29/2021,stocks,Moon farming
03/29/2021,stocks,There's a bunch of satellite imagery farming equipment being developed
03/29/2021,stocks,"Could be 30% now, lol"
03/29/2021,stocks,They have five satellites in orbit already and they are [SpaceX guinea pigs](https://spacenews.com/spacex-launches-siriusxm-satellite/). It's not a stretch. I doubt it'll be more than a tiny fraction of the portfolio anyways.
03/29/2021,stocks,Exactly. I can’t in any way take this fund seriously when they include that.
03/29/2021,stocks,Robo radio
03/29/2021,stocks,"Welp, it is a bargain..."
03/29/2021,stocks,Howard Stern is big in Space radio
03/29/2021,stocks,Need some music if you’re gonna moonwalk
03/29/2021,stocks,"Problem is, there is no plan for SpaceX to go public"
03/29/2021,stocks,Then why wouldn't I just buy SpaceX when it goes public instead of this ETF with John Deere and JD.com  in it
03/29/2021,stocks,Elon said he will take space x public once they are established on mars so 7-10 yrs
03/29/2021,stocks,An etf cant have more than 10 percent in one position......
03/29/2021,stocks,"An IPO? It's an ETF. Consisting of a bunch of different companies. I guess they'll all dip before they begin to climb. Makes perfect sense! Pulling nonsense out of butt

03/29/2021,stocks,i think her real date is 2030. she either becomes irrelevant or very very very relevant. Super relevant even. Marvel Studios in talks about a script super relevancy.

03/29/2021,stocks,What does that have have to do with space exploration?
03/29/2021,stocks,All fair points which don't have a damn thing to do with space exploration
03/29/2021,stocks,These are speculations LOL
03/29/2021,stocks,He said right in the OP that this is what he thinks could be in it. This is his own speculation.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah. I was hyped for this until I saw that. Maybe satellite radio has other plans for the future?
03/29/2021,stocks,Why?
03/29/2021,stocks,Space X will never be a public company.  Not in any time frame thats worth holding out investing elsewhere on.  Why would Elon ever give up control of his favorite play toy?  He needs and wants for nothing in contracts and future growth.  An IPO just gives him alot of red tape for making dynamic decisions going forward from then.
03/29/2021,stocks,This one can have 30 baby yeah! Seriously she changed the rules look it up.
03/29/2021,stocks,I don't know if the other guy is correct about 30% however my point was this etf will be driven as the primary holding by space-x which should drive the price.
03/29/2021,stocks,"What are you talking about?
VGT one of the most popular IT ETFs has 20% Apple and 15% MSFT"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's an Initial Public Offering (IPO) *for* an ETF

but trust; it's not nonsense.  IPOs are always pretty shakey"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I read a comment on here a few days ago saying basically that the available volume would be really low the first day(s). With a super high demand and low volume, the price is going to be much higher than when volume grows to normal levels."

03/29/2021,stocks,It's after all the overvalued companies she keeps buying blows up in her face
03/29/2021,stocks,"I feel pretty confident in long term valuations.  I emotionally separate what's new and cool from excessive value to what it actually means in dollars and cents to the consumers and industries it represents.  I really focus on what it means in true sales,  dollars,  and cents without calling something a trillion dollars because it's a world changing technology. Of course,  I could be on the wrong side.  But that's my choice and reasoning for disagreeing with her positions. I just feel there isn't enough thought on reddit about valuations and balance sheets.  Hence why is like a cult following of cathie woods, and or all the same group of stocks posted about daily"

03/29/2021,stocks,"That's quite an interpretation of what I said. Obviously satellites are part of space exploration. However, John Deere is using them to advance terrestrial farm equipment. They are purely a beneficiary of the industry.  As I see it, a space exploration etf should include companies advancing the industry, not just benefiting from it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You don't need to know your position on the globe when you're in space, duh"
03/29/2021,stocks,Moon crops ain’t gonna farm themselves

03/29/2021,stocks,"Still, why speculate companies that literally have nothing to do with space exploration/innovation? I don't think simply having satellites in orbit makes one a 'space' company, and certainly not in the scope of this fund."

03/29/2021,stocks,Robert Friedland was a part of it in the first place. I would consider rethinking your preconceptions here.
03/29/2021,stocks,"XMs business model is actually in decline because terrestrial data services are outpacing satellites ability to deliver bandwidth at competitive prices. It’s a mature business and one that will make money but it will be less and less. It’s not a future play or a space play other than they own some satellites.

It’s just sort of shoehorned in there."
03/29/2021,stocks,Couldn't the same been said of Tesla PreIPO
03/29/2021,stocks,I agree. I don’t see SpaceX ever being public.
03/29/2021,stocks,Mhn interesting. I will look at it closely
03/29/2021,stocks,"Market is forward looking. 

Sure there will be losers but the winners will be bigger."
03/29/2021,stocks,You're speaking like stocks reflect valuations and balance sheets
03/29/2021,stocks,very true.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Cheers, thank you

I think out of all of them Netflix’s inclusion surprised me the most"
03/29/2021,stocks,You’re not surprised their own fund for 3D printing is the 2nd largest holding? I am a bit.
03/29/2021,stocks,And gotta make crop circles somehow
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well, they gonna do if they become autonomous..."
03/29/2021,stocks,"It might not be space exploration specifically that makes ARKX want the equity in Deere, but their ability to work with others that are focused on it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Uh, am I missing something here?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Gotcha, I could imagine them facing away from earth in the future, clients could be other satellites or mining operations"
03/29/2021,stocks,"I dont think so.  The majority of Elons compensation was dependent on a successful IPO and stock price for Tesla.  Thats WHY hes 1st or 2nd richest person on earth.  Now that hes there, he doesn't need the same from Space X and makes a ton of money all the same as the company is already his."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah,  those winners will not be pltr and tsla.  I promise"
03/29/2021,stocks,"There's reasonable valuations to continue to buy,  then there unreasonable.  The issue I have is that reddit keeps pushing the same ones that have gone up beyond reason. Those are generally ones that have forward earnings priced in as if they're executed today.  Generally the market values future earnings at a discounted rate,  and in not seeing that on some of these plays"
03/29/2021,stocks,Ever read Bob Verse? They built ships in space with large scale metal 3D printing.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Drives under overpass ""fuck"""
03/29/2021,stocks,Pretty unlikely that SpaceX goes public but if Elon separates Starlink then it has a decent chance of going public IMO and will definitely be included in this etf.
03/29/2021,stocks,"So what stocks will they be Mr. Buffet? C'mon now, out with it!"
03/29/2021,stocks,Well tsla already won and pltr could go either way. I got 100 shares just in case.
03/29/2021,stocks,Tesla's satellite internet alone could displace the entire market of Comcast and Verizon
03/29/2021,stocks,Is it really that much of a stretch to assume a company working on autonomous vehicles would be useful in space exploration and colonization?
03/29/2021,stocks,Who do you think is going to terra-form Mars or the moon?!
03/29/2021,stocks,"That doesn't work on me, tard"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Haha, never used Satellite radio?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Do you not agree that it is much easier to dismiss TSLA’s current valuation than to give value to any near normal company with a near normal valuation?  I don’t even need to do napkin math to see TSLA is out of whack.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Let's put it this way,  expand yourself outside the realm of the same reddit stocks.  I've made it clear in the past I will not disclose my plays,  however if you really care,  I've leaked a couple. I believe the ones I've previously disclosed were of CCL at 18$, of ARWR at $3.25, and  DDD at $5.13. I also did a bit of BLUE $26.72 after they got hammered recently. I am contradicting myself on telling you this because you'd only find it through comment history.  I have about 3 dozen companies in currently long in and a half dozen I hold short.  My point is,  the research has to be done by you,  not because it's a popular reddit name.  Aside from CCL, you probably never see a reddit post on those others.  The blue chip companies I have follow a similar pattern of being bought after an unnecessary sell off.  I think if more folks on here tried to follow balance sheets,  comparable market caps for the respected business vs peers, cash flow,  and sales,  we would be a stronger and more respected community."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I agree tsla has won for those who had bought,  and sold.... ones that continue to hold should be looking for their exit.  There isn't a company who has ever maintained 1000x earnings in price long term,  they have lots of ideas.... and until they prove viable on earnings,  I think a hard correction is in order."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why,  because they say so? If you're OK paying for the company as if they've already proven that and that it's 100% going to happen, thats how they're priced."
03/29/2021,stocks,No. It's not.
03/29/2021,stocks,No one.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes, I has Sirius in a car I had for 5 years. It cut out under bridges and in drive though. Being close to the side of a building would lose signal completely."
03/29/2021,stocks,"First off, I own no shares of Tesla cause it's too expensive for me. 

Secondly isn't Tesla more than a car company? Don't they do things with energy and insurance as well? Not to mention bitcoin now (that's a different story). I think Tesla has big plans for the future as really if you think about it they're pretty much a new company in terms of long term big picture thinking. The old guard GM Ford Chrysler all had to start somewhere as well, but they are now old companies and quite frankly I think out of touch and have no vision, regardless of their current pivoting to EV. I've owned all of the big 3 at some point and I can honestly say never again. They make garbage. I drive a Toyota, regardless what you think of Toyota as a company, the Japanese are technology and quality driven, I think that's what Tesla is going for and will probably introduce a dividend at some point in its history. Again, I don't own shares of Tesla, and I don't know the stocks history, but wasn't there a short squeeze on it before when it was at $40? Maybe that's why they refuse to dilute the stock so nobody thinks of trying to short it again. Correct me if I'm wrong. I'm just spit balling"
03/29/2021,stocks,"One question, what is the point in hiding your positions? Are you playing with millions of dollars?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Hard correction already happened dude. It's time to buy the dip.
03/29/2021,stocks,So you agree that Deere can have something to do with space exploration?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Mostly a joke... but on a serious note Deere has a history of working with NASA and JPL on precision GPS integration. 
All those beautifully straight lines of crops that you see in the Midwest are a result of the StarFire nav system."
03/29/2021,stocks,I have had it for a few years and literally never have that problem.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Big plans?  Ya, so what, they are literally blowing smoke up your ass and you are believing it all.  Insurance?  If you believe that I have a bridge to sell you, a Robo bridge."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Even if you add in other businesses such as energy,  compare to the leading backup energy player generac... They're a cap of about 20b. They also lead tsla and will continue to lead them in battery systems Because their product is good and they already have the network built out for distribution and installation. They have no business trading at 600b. That valuation assumes that they will execute perfectly on all these future business ideas with no discount. So who the hell wants to buy into something where they have to innovate even further to get the returns.  You're already practically paying full price as if they are selling Robotaxis today."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I do a lot of research on my buys, but it's less about sharing them as it is about my ethics of influencing others who can potentially lose money on my opinions if I'm wrong.  My initial buy in arwr was at 5.50 after a drop.  I've compiled years of research and filled an entire marble composition book on research from earnings calls,  scientific research on rna, and dpc (their delivery system of the rna which was their biggest part of the ip) They became my biggest position and I had 10k shares when they dropped to under 2$ when they scraped intravenous dpc delivery and their entire pipeline to recreate it as subq. I was in a huge hole,  but my research had me understand it was going to work.  I continued to add to lower my cost basis,  and made out really well on it.  My point is..... it seems like online there's a need for instant gratification.  I would've been crucified when it dropped under 2$ in 2016 for years if I posted pumps about it on reddit.  but the return I have in it now is a return people would only wish they could get over a few years. I don't post my plays because they aren't necessarily going to be popular,  I don't want to hear from people who lose money on them,  and I take a lot of time to carefully pick them.  It would be like studying hard on a test and giving the guy who didn't study the answers.... and then if he gets an F, he's coming at me."
03/29/2021,stocks,"If you think it's still 600b, you really need to work away from the hype train, and read Financials.  There's nothing that would put them close to this.  You can't value future earnings and ideas as if they are executed today.  Future sales generally come at a discount,  but not the way tsla is priced"
03/29/2021,stocks,No.
03/29/2021,stocks,Gotcha.
03/29/2021,stocks,Clearly stated I have no positions. Why so hostile?
03/29/2021,stocks,"No one is following your plays, mate."
03/29/2021,stocks,No offense but that seems like a big waste of time. I just buy whatever's popular on r/wallstreetbets up 250% this year. No DD on my part required 🙃🤡🌎
03/29/2021,stocks,"All you have to do is buy and wait. If you're truly long term you shouldn't sell when the stock drops 30%. You should buy.

03/29/2021,stocks,No no.
03/29/2021,stocks,I guess I don't get what your position is then.
03/29/2021,stocks,"You've been investing for a year and a half,  that's the problem with claiming you can just buy and hold and it works.  You haven't been doing this long enough to see companies fall and never recover. Look at companies like GE. Say you bought them high in the late 90s. You would be holding for 20 years at a loss. You still have to know what price your buying a stock at. There's no guarantee tsla ever goes to 900$ again."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Asset allocation and risk management bro.

60% s&p index fund, 10% international, and the rest goes towards ark and pltr. 

It's easy and all I have to do it buy that with my paychecks. If my stock picks don't work it's fine. 

So yes buying and holding is the best plan."
2021-03-29 04:17:50,stocks,"What is VTI annual returns WITH dividends reinvested? I always hear that VTI average return is around 10% without accounting for inflation but are these claims WITH dividends reinvested? If not, what would the returns be with dividends reinvested? I feel like the dividends aspect is pretty overlooked for some reason and people think it’s such a boomer thing but I disagree. I think it’s a very important aspect of investing."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Google portfolio visualizer backtest.
Plug in VTI."
03/29/2021,stocks,"According to portfolio analyzer, 9.21% without dividends reinvested, 7.21% without.  Starting in 2002 at inception, $10k would become $38k without dividends and $54k with.  

You have to remember that reinvesting the early dividends compounds them year over year same as your original investment."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I invest mainly in VTI and using a backtest analysis from when I started investing in 2016 or so VTI returned nearly 2% more with dividends reinvested. 13.4% vs 15.5%. Historically though this is a good return. 

Dividends are def a ""boomer thing"" but there's nothing wrong with that. I'm a professional with a self-managed retirement account and didn't even really understand dividends (other than reinvesting the random money that showed up in my SEP IRA) until the IRS sent me a ""FYI you owe us taxes on yo dividends"" letter last year..  Regarding FIRE, $2.5m in VTI would produce almost $35k/yr in dividends.."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not a significant difference. Even if dividends were 10%, 10% of 10% is only 1%. So that would only bring you up to 11%..."
03/29/2021,stocks,Such a good tool.  Made a huge difference to help me to streamline my Vanguard holdings for my purposes.
03/29/2021,stocks,Do you think it’s possible to invest $3K monthly into VTI with $120K gross household income? HCOL
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's a huge difference actually.  From 2002, $10k invested without dividend reinvestment would become $39k now and you would have received $5700 in dividends, so about $45k total.  Reinvesting those dividends would instead grow to $54k over the same period.  That's a 20% over performance even with a small dividend because that dividend amount also gets time in market effects."
03/29/2021,stocks,"So yes, it would make a noticeable difference over 30 years. No, it won't change the annual rate of return by very much. I did a brief search and saw 1.37% dividend yield. So reinvesting those and getting your 10% on them changes your 10% to 10.137%."
03/29/2021,stocks,1% over 40+ years matters ***a lot***
03/29/2021,stocks,1% makes a fairly large difference in the long run. Almost a $1 million difference after 30 years.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not necessarily... Everything depends on time horizon. The longer the time horizon, the bigger the returns from reinvesting would yield. 

So saying that it would bump the average return up 1% is probably an understatement. I can’t for sure say because idk what the dividends were for VTI the past 20 years, but if it’s 1%/year the average return will add up to more than 1%"
03/29/2021,stocks,Right. The 10% I'm assuming is reported per year. Whatever the new rate is (I'm assuming it's closer to 10.3% than 11%) gets compounded as usual.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Depends how big your mortgage is.

3k is pretty easy if you're disciplined."
03/29/2021,stocks,That leaves you with $86k (before taxes?). Seems very possible to live off of
03/29/2021,stocks,I make a bit more than that in san Francisco and would have around 3k a month to live off after. Doable if you're living with family or roomates but you're going to be living pretty meager
03/29/2021,stocks,"Difficult due to HCOL. Possible, yes."

2021-03-29 04:01:52,stocks,"Time to Position for 2nd Quarter Here are my top picks for Q 2:

CC:  strong earnings rebound underway.  Stock is cheap based on estimates which are too low. Look forward company to beat expectations and stock to get re-rated higher.

IEC:  company is doing everything right.  Strong growth throughout Covid.  Wall Street ignores the stock due to small mkt cap and only 10.6 million shares outstanding.  Top and bottom line growth again this year.  This $13 stock can break $20 with a little retail interest and P/E expansion to market multiple.

OC:  Still trades at a huge discount to mkt despite strong earnings and even better outlook.  If there is a better/cheaper play in both reopening and red hot housing mkt, I haven’t found it!

TEVA:  Trades at a crazy low PE multiple due to overly pessimistic Opioid concerns.  CEO is engineering a trifocals turnaround and as trial dates get set post-Covid the pressure will be on to finally reach a long-delayed settlement.  Stock will soar in that news or even a hint that it is coming!

I’ve enjoyed a double digit gain in my portfolio YTD and expect these 4 to be big drivers in the next quarter and beyond!"
03/29/2021,stocks,I got 100 shares of TEVA at $10.50 and I'm happy so far.
03/29/2021,stocks,"And sorry for the typo on IEC...Roughly a $12 stock currently, not $13, but on its way to $20 I’m hoping!"

Other investors have to buy more shares for the price to go up so that still raises the question, why do those investors want to buy a stock that don’t pay dividends?"
03/29/2021,stocks,AMZN doesn’t pay dividends.
03/29/2021,stocks,Because we are taking a bet on the future growth of a company or industry that might not yet make to pay a dividend. However the growth potential and price increase can be quite dramatic . ( so can the loss)
03/29/2021,stocks,"Most of the portfolio is in index funds.

When I buy individual stocks, I am trying to drastically outperform the market.  I almost specifically am targeting stocks that do not pay dividends.  I am looking for smaller companies that are still in growth mode.  

Sort of a controversial comment but dividends are paid out by companies that don’t know how else to significantly grow their business.  I prefer companies that want to invest in themselves and continue growing."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The general notion is that one buys (stock in) a company that doesn’t pay dividends, because one trusts that the company can utilise the money not paid out in dividends in a  more productive way to grow the business. For example, Amazon using money not paid out as dividends to reinvest in its infrastructure or “last mile” solutions. It often/historically reflects where a company is in its life cycle, ... so as companies age and mature, become cash generation machines without know where to expand into next, they pay dividends c.f. CSCO, AAPL, IBM, KO, MSFT, etc."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Imagine you have a farm and you have a field that grows crop. At the end of the year you gather the crop and sell it for $10,000.

Option 1: you take the profit (dividend), pax tax, and repeat the next year the same cycle.

Option 2: you invest $10,000 to buy one more field (growth). Then next year you get $20,000 from both fields and you buy 2 more fields, and so on.

Now ask yourself, at the end of 5 years - what will be your equity from these two options.

Option 1: you enjoyed your dividend but your farm costs the same and you will receive the same amount year after year, plus you had to pay income tax every year.

Option 2: your farm now costs at least 10 times of what you originally invested, you paid 0 tax, and now you can sell one field, or you can start get dividends, or you can sell the whole farm at 10x profit of your original investment."
03/29/2021,stocks,To be rich.
03/29/2021,stocks,"You are buying a portion of the company.  If the company has 2X the sales, 2X the profit, and 2X times the capital equipment/offices ........: doesn’t that make it worth double.   I sold to get double and the next guy is banking on the same thing.  

Look at Amazon grow, imagine what that dividend will be some day when they decide to stop putting 100% of profit back into growth"
03/29/2021,stocks,5% dividends on a stock that returns 5% capital gains is not as good a performer as a stock that returns 15% capital gains. People who don’t buy for dividends are buying in search of the larger capital gains. It’s a simple risk-reward thing.

03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm glad I joined this sub. All I know about stocks is to buy a company you think will grow, and wait. A quick Google of dividends gives me the impression that company keeps creating shares to give you for holding shares. Would that not dilute the stock by increasing shares without increasing capitol or anything else?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Dividend stocks have their place, they’re great for passive income and retirement, but they likely won’t make me as much money as growth stocks will if you pick the right stocks. 

When you buy stock you’re buying a piece of the business, so when the company goes from making say 1b $ a year to making 10b $, who cares if they pay dividends if they’re growing the business at a rapid rate. I would rather own 1% of a business when it’s 1b company and hold it for say 5 years until it’s a 10b company then collect a modest 2-3% annual dividend with little to no appreciation in the businesses value. 

For me I don’t care about dividends at all at this point in my life (I’m only 20), but if I was nearing retirement then I would opt more for the passive income. 

Growth companies tend to offer better returns than dividend stocks. This isn’t ***always*** the case, but it is more often than not."
03/29/2021,stocks,Dividends are the last thing I look. At the end if they're there then that's a bonus.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Because I’d rather have the company, I’ve invested in, to use it’s cash for R&D and growing their business rather than bribe shareholders with guaranteed annual return."
03/29/2021,stocks,"They kinda are, technically if a stock never gets a dividend the stock is worthless, the reason small companies get bought up before they install a dividend is because people want to get in before the stock pays a dividend, so yea dividends are kinda everything without them a stock is really just a peice of paper

Edit-many people seemed to have misunderstood, I never said don't buy a stock without dividends, I said if you do buy a stock without dividends you should buy with the hope it will one day have dividends, you buy growth stocks so they one day will become value stocks"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, this question isn't as stupid as it might look like. Dividends are how firm performance and stock ownerships are connected in the most obvious way. In theory, it is no good to hold a fairly valued piece of a company if you're not entitled to a share of the firm's profits at some point. 

@OP, one good way of looking at it is that you trust the firm you're investing in with your money, so rather than have it pay out profits to you, you allow them to reinvest those profits to grow the company. After all there's no difference between holding a non-dividend stock and holding a dividend stock where you reinvest the dividend."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Exactly. Is the company pays dividends than they more than likely don’t have anywhere else to put the cash. I would rather own a piece of a company that is investing into itself for future growth than a company that pays a modest 2-3% dividend with little to no growth. This probably has to do a lot with my age (20s). If I was 65 and about to retire than I am sure I would be more likely to opt for a 2-3% annual dividend and enjoy the passive income at that point in my life, but because I don’t care about that passive income just yet I’d rather try and grow my money as much as possible within my personal risk tolerance, so I opt for growth stocks that don’t pay a dividend."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Very simple and easy to understand, good explanation for op who so far seems oblivious to everything."
03/29/2021,stocks,Only correct answer is downvoted lol
03/29/2021,stocks,What are you getting in return from a companies growth?
03/29/2021,stocks,"So you’re saying investors buy non dividend paying stocks like Amazon because of its growth potential.

Now I wanna know what will make it grow?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"No.  Dividends typically come from profits (or sometimes to pay down large reserves).  Companies that earn money, pay out some of that money to its owners.  They don't just keep diluting shares to pay dividends."
03/29/2021,stocks,Growth investors aren't buying for a dividend
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why do you say companies without a dividend are worthless?  There’s an entire market that says otherwise.
1) you own a piece of the company when you hold a share, as company has greater earnings your share becomes worth more
2) the stock ownership is a store of value: you have more money than you need to pay your bills and therefore want to hold your money somewhere - what are your options?  One option is to buy ownership in a successful company"
03/29/2021,stocks,">	They kinda are, technically without a dividend a stock is worthless

My covered call premiums say otherwise."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I make 30%+ per year for 12 years on stocks that don't pay dividend, you can keep your 3% dividend. And it's in registered accounts so I don't even have to pay taxes. Who gives a crap about a dividend."
03/29/2021,stocks,"dividends is a sign the company isnt as good as you think it is... im not buying stock for 6% dividends, im buying stocks that will 10x in the next couple years, not buying stocks bc they dont have dividends is very aut1sm"
03/29/2021,stocks,"The giant dividend they will pay in the future because they grew from a garage to what Amazon is today.

I own several stocks that have grown for years while not paying a dividend & then started paying one.


Edit:  imagine how slow Amazon would have grown had all those profits went to dividends instead of swallowing the entire market"
03/29/2021,stocks,You literally own shares of the company. A growth in that company’s value is a growth in your holdings. We want companies to invest in themselves so that the value of our shares increase. You only want dividends if you are older and/or supplementing your retirement income. Growth over the long term will far exceed the dividends you receive.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Monetary profit? If I buy into a company when it’s worth 1b$ and I sell it when it’s worth 2b$ five years later that’s a 100% gain in 5 years. (Rough example of course, there’s many ways to value companies so you take that into consideration for every different company to determine a fair value of the company). 

If I invest the same amount into Coca Cola and expect a modest 3% dividend and I expect the company to grow at maybe 5% a year then it’s a pretty obvious choice for me which one I would rather have at this point in my life. As I near retirement maybe then my focus will be directed at slower growing companies that pay a small dividend and offer me a small amount of passive income."
03/29/2021,stocks,"my shars being worth more...? ight bruh i dont think investing is for you, just buy s&p500 with ur paychecks"
03/29/2021,stocks,"what will make the stock grow or the company?

are you rly confused as to what makes a company or a stock grow?

why would i want a stock i own to pay a dividend instead of reinvesting the profits for growth?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Oh okay. I thought they issued shares instead of cash. Thank you.
03/29/2021,stocks,"He's technically right although not explaining it well, in a world with only rational actors the only reason to buy stock is for the dividend or potential dividend in the future, however we live in an irrational world where you can bank on crowd psychology and game theory leading to people buying things that they think other people will want to buy for more money later. So it's true but also completely not true in practice, people are dumb."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Not just growth. Even the stalwart value stock BRK doesn’t pet dividends. 

To answer OP. You either invest in no dividend companies because you recognize they need every dime to enact their growth plans(or could fail and go bankrupt) OR you trust the company exclusively to continue to generate value than an individual could (Berkshire)"
03/29/2021,stocks,"They should be, why do you want earnings growthz because you want the company to make more profits, and you own a portion of the company so yea you actually are buying for the future flow of dividends"
03/29/2021,stocks,"They are worthless if they never get a dividend, investors buy a portion of the company to get a portion of the profit in the form of dividends, the share goes up when the earnings are higher because the stock is more valuable, why? Because it will pay a greater dividend. Also stock ownership isn't really a store of value if dividends aren't being paid because other than dividends or the earnings of a company the stock is really just paper. Now I'm not saying never buy a stock without dividends but if you do buy a stock without dividends you should be hoping it will pay dividends in the future when the company grows."
03/29/2021,stocks,Options are a derivative
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well, my Local Bank Stock, $HWC,  consistently pays quarterly dividends, which I COULD receive a Check to Cash, however I allow them to Reinvest by buying more shares of $HWC each quarter.

My original 150 Shares is now up to 160.134 Shares. Dividend Rate was .270000 and my Net Dividend was $44.29 or 0.739 Shares added to my existing 159.395 Shares.

03/29/2021,stocks,"This is a total misunderstanding of stock value and ownership. If you buy a stock, and the book value of the stock increases, then you made money because you own something that appreciated in value. Just because you don't receive *cash flow* in the form of a dividend, that doesn't make it worthless.

Would you apply the same logic to a different capital asset like gold? Of course not, because it's ridiculous"
03/29/2021,stocks,“Stocks are worthless if they never get a dividend” holy brain dead wtf
03/29/2021,stocks,dude ur dumb asf wtf have fun with 6% gains a year
03/29/2021,stocks,you realize there is a direct correlation between the dividend you’re paid and the immediate drop in share value right? it’s 1:1. basically dividends are just the company forcing you to sell off a fraction of your shares every quarter/year.
03/29/2021,stocks,">	Options are a derivative

Not wrong, but not relevant either."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There are plenty of instances where the book value increases and the share price stays the same or decreases. Since there isn't a guaranteed relationship between book value and share price, you need to dig deeper to actually explain how owning a share is the same as owning a piece of the company (ignoring dividend payouts)"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Lol a stock is not comparable to gold at all in the slightest, stocks fundamental value comes from the fact they create something or earnings, golds fundamental value comes from years of prestige, the fact you even compared them is fairly ridiculous. Also what I ment was if a stock never pays a dividend, if you buy a stock early on in the hopes it will one day have a dividend that is a smart investment."

2021-03-29 03:07:37,stocks,"My Watchlist For 3/29/21 -- Again I am focusing Financial / Utilities / Consumer / and Healthcare Tickers. Use a stop loss or bag hold. $AB   - I called this Thursday too, this is just such a gorgeous up trend. Such a beautiful channel, still at value- and the key is very low risk. I love this setup so much.

&#x200B;

$AGO  - there is 0 (none) volume $42 - $40, so I am ANTICIPATING and ONLY WILL ENTER if we hit $40. Right there and a dash lower this is an amazing deal, and a great setup.

&#x200B;

$EVR  - I think this also is a bit high for me personally, but it just got ABOVE the 50EMA so that is also confirmation too! So waiting for value or now is fine, I like this a lot.

&#x200B;

$FBP  - right BELOW the 50EMA and right ABOVE what I would consider value. So I would give this a day or two to see where it is going to go. This is still a long term gem.

&#x200B;

$FRC  - Just crossed above the 50EMA as well, so that can be a form of confirmation. This has mega potential, and I really enjoy this setup and channel as well.

&#x200B;

$GBIO - One of my favorites today, Right in value, small up trend is present, EMA lines are far away so they mean nothing to us here. I love this setup man - beautiful.

&#x200B;

$NNOX - Very bright future for this company. Right in value, right above POC and support, love it. Can make you a f\*\*\* ton if it does what it is supposed to lol.

&#x200B;

$NWBI - Very similar to my other financial sector plays, a bit high for me. I think this long term is beautiful, but I think it can be a bit cheaper - BUT it confirmed over the 50.

&#x200B;

$RVMD - Bouncing off the 200EMA like a gosh darn gem. Right above support as well, I love this setup. such a gorgeous play.

&#x200B;

$SBBP - Harder to read but a beautiful setup none-the-less. Price target by brokers is 200% away so that alone for a long term hold could be insanity."
2021-03-29 02:56:57,stocks,"Resources to find tickers to research and trade I really want to start forming my own ideas for trades and sourcing news and information myself to make swing trades, instead of relying on the due diligence of others. I am very familiar with fundamental and technical analysis, but where I fall short is finding a company to research in the first place. I use MarketWatch, Bloomberg, EDGAR filings, and others to see if I cant find companies reporting news, and I also use the Finviz stock scanner, but I feel that the scanner is geared more towards longer term investing. What I'm after are volatile, short term moves.

At these valuations you need to be careful and always have an eye out for an empty chair when the music stops unless you are young with a long time horizon.

Worth mentioning, you have to ask yourself if the guidance they bring is what’s best for you, or what’s best for them. (Yes they have to act “in your best interests”, but that is more ambiguous than it sounds)

More to the point, if their plan returns small to moderate growth every year, but in the long run produces less money than holding through volatility and doubling down on stocks you believe in as they drop, is that really better?

Currently, I'm invested in 3 companies- lloyds,coats and rentokill and looking to add to this ( looking to invest at a most 5 pound per share) . Previously, I had followed my parents advice when investing however I'm 90% certain the internet is better for giving advice on things like this as yall more knowledgable lol. Anyway I'm just looking for general advice on investing- e.g. any sites that are informative regarding this or what to look out for when investing just things like that really; any advice is welcomed.  
Oh as a point of notice I'm not very experienced with the stock market so if possible could you essentially dumb it down thanks lol."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Haha, I’m also in the UK and my parents are fixated on the price per share, only going for cheap companies and thinking it’s a good deal because you then own more shares (compared to investing the same capital in companies with more expensive shares). I had to wonder if that advice in the OP came from your parents.

In reality I don’t think it matters much at all, assuming you can buy fractional shares. ‘Cheap’ shares might not move very much or even fall, while ‘expensive’ shares can still give you good gains. I don’t have much money invested but am still able to grow it by paying more attention to the possible percentage change in a stock rather than the absolute price.

Another piece of advice would be to use a broker that gives you access to US shares as well as UK shares. I (personally) find the US market much more exciting! You have to fill out a W8-BEN form - nowadays it’s just ticking a few boxes in the app with most brokers."

Look to the west for growth stocks or check how your bank/country handles dividend taxation on foreign exchanges. 

Since you’re young you should embrace growth and volatility. Do not overestimate diversification, five stocks are a good start - two does well, two does ok and one does shit. As your capital grows and you find new opportunities you may want to start diversifying or just abandon old investments. 

As long are you are continually dropping money in to the market you’re pretty much immune to dips and crashes over the long run.

Perhaps pick 2 really good solid blue chips, 2 solid growth companies and then 1 high risk/high reward play (with Max 10% weight).

2021-03-29 01:13:05,stocks,"Passenger Rail Transportation in the US So the advice I'm looking for is:

How do you find companies that don't exactly prioritize something, but would be well suited to tackle a job if it became a subject of public interest?

I'm looking to invest in companies that facilitate passenger rail transportation. Particularly, ""next-gen"" rail transportation. 

However I've had some trouble pinpointing what companies would be involved in rail passenger transportation. Most company profiles that I've read specify freight, but literally none of them mention passengers.

My rationale is that the Biden infrastructure plan will include initiatives in 

1. Clean energy, 
2. Innovation (buzzword), and 
3. Transportation. 

The US has a distinct lack of rail transportation that would provide incredible cost-efficient benefits. Rail is far more affordable in both the near and far term say the interstate road system. Additionally, it does not have as much detrimental environmental impact. So, it checks a lot of boxes.

""Next-generation"" while it has been around for quite some time, would include maglev, think bullet trains. 

Amtrak is not publicly traded, that was my starting point."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The best place to start would be to look at who makes the railcars. Many are Japanese. Kinki Sharyo and Nippon Sharyo makes a lot of light rail rolling stock in the US, though they dont have an OTC stock to my knowledge. Kawaski, Siemens , Hitachi, and Sumitomo make passenger car rolling stock as well but both of those are large companies that make many other things. Central Japan Railways has looked at funding some projects in the US like the DC to Baltimore Maglev. I believe Alstrom is heavily involved in making the new high speed Acela trains. Unfortunately there aren't many companies solely dedicated to making rail cars, but are subsidiaries of larger companies. I'd recommend researching all of those, but especially Siemens, Alstrom, and Central Japan. Kinki Sharyo would be great but I only see their Nikkei listed stock, and not even an OTC listed stock. But those 4 I would recommend looking at. Maybe even steel companies that have to make the tracks as well."

03/29/2021,stocks,"may he rest well, what a man."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Well that's really nice of the guy, he must not have had family or whatever.. He obviously lived well and left his legacy to charity, sound as fook. That's some good karma there 👌I just hope they're charities and not Bill Gates or George Soros style *charities* (murderous scams and people smuggling). RIP Jack you kind, generous dood! ✌️"
03/29/2021,stocks,"A true man. Works hard for everyone but himself and dies to get out of the way so we can plunder his investments. What every young man should aspire to be, a large payday, for others."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Very generous of him, but I don't think I'll go that route. Universities sit on tons of money so they don't need anything from me. Salvation Army is a good place to put money.

I like the idea of a charitable trust, but I would like to make sure it goes to folks who need it and not bonuses, raises, and parties for the people running the show. For example, I met a young veteran and his pregnant wife living in their van until they could find a place to live. His cardboard sign was ""I'll work for food.""  As a veteran myself, I talked to him about his service, and he had the correct answers so I figured he was legit.  Getting him in contact with the right people got him and his wife out of the van and back on their feet, with a little cash in their pocket until the paycheck came in.

I've been told that big charities can make the donations go further. I'm not so sure. I watched a number of TED Talk pods where ""I get paid xxxmillion dollars a year because I bring in xxxxxxxxxxmillions to the charity.""  Okay, I get it: you're a rich person living off my $25 donation.

If I came into the kind of money Mr. Jack did, I'd want to see it at work: Get that lady and her kids out of the car and into a home, help folks get back on their feet, winter coats, shoes, back packs, etc.  What he did was great, but I'd like to help the little guy first.  JMHO."

03/29/2021,stocks,Note to self: Rename myself to Charity.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Stuff like this is awesome. I was just reading a comment yesterday where someone mentioned their friend who makes $15k/month but lives paycheck to paycheck cuz he spends it all on $500 shots at clubs, buys watches and hookers and referred to him as a ""good guy"" and I had to step in with my opinion that anyone who lives paycheck to paycheck on $15k month cuz they blow it all on pointless garbage without saving a penny for the less fortunate is not what I would call a good guy. This man, Jack McDonald, now this is a good guy."
03/29/2021,stocks,">For those that have made large gains this year, remember to give back to those that are less fortunate.

03/29/2021,stocks,He's living my dream. Not the lawyer or dead bit. The massive amount left to charity bit lol.
03/29/2021,stocks,I’m always so sceptical about charities! How do they even distribute such a large amount?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Adopt a Classroom is one of the charities I like giving to. You can give directly to a teacher or school of your choice. Teachers post requests for money they need for a class and how they intend to spend it. (Books, writing tools, art supplies, iPads, etc) Most of the requests are around $500-700 but you can give any amount. 

I prefer donating to specific individuals rather than organizations because I know it will have a direct and focused impact.

I want to make more money than I could  ever need and then start walking around town handing out envelopes with a few thousand dollars to strangers who might really need it, no strings attached. Why not?"

I also know that the richest I will ever be is when my parents die. I’m not looking forward to that and would happily forego all of that money to avoid it.

Spend some time volunteering in your own community and actually interacting with charitable organizations.   If you spend some time on the ground working on causes you believe in, you’ll realize that it’s incredibly easy to find a charity that truly operates to maximize the outcomes of its beneficiaries.  

The real challenge in this scenario would be finding a charity that is localized enough to have significant impact, but operates under good fiscal management at a scale large enough to accommodate even a fraction of Jack’s wealth.  Fortunately, for the average investor who’s truly interested in benefiting the nonprofit sector, this is not a real barrier."

Worked for 3 non profits, none of which actually donated anything of value to those in need. 


If they got extra donations, they would usually raise their salaries, donate something useless that really didn't help or just do corporate outreach.


The saddest story was I helped corporations do yearly ""charity"" events for the homeless and vets. (*Side note *Most events were structured to have ""volunteers"" there for 3 hours, because they would lose interest and leave) 


The vet living and working at the hospital realized all the crappy work we were doing and how much it was worth and he said to me, ""you know what we really need is ....""

Of course they do... otherwise they would have to pay income tax on the tip for nothing.

Its still a net zero position for them, 'income' in matches spend out.

03/29/2021,stocks,"This is a really solid point and a think that 100% does happen much if not most of the time, yet most of your responses are from people who misunderstood you (or otherwise did understand but didn’t bother to fact check their gut responses)

The one thing I consider is that the past or anticipated sum amounts of those contributions likely factor into the calculated donation by the company, so even if your donation doesn’t directly increase the campaign they say you’re donating to, it may increase the likelihood or amount of other corporate donations.

That said, I donate a large percent of my income and don’t feel the least bad turning these down in lieu of my orgs which are almost always WAY more effective and impactful"
03/29/2021,stocks,"You can think of it like investing because that's exactly what it is. You're not looking for the highest dollar amount someday on the future. You're looking for max returns. If you pay for someone's groceries and that allows them to pay rent and their kids to stay in school and they graduate and don't end up addicted to heroin etc etc then the return on that $75 was pretty fucking good. 

If you invest that $75 and in 5 years have $300, yeah sweet more money for solving proboems. But now the problem isn't unpaid groceries its 3 homeless people with addiction problems."

03/29/2021,stocks,Seems better than giving it to Goodwill  so they can keep exploiting the mentally disabled and persecuting the gays. Or is the last one specifically Salvation Army?  Both maybe...??

03/29/2021,stocks,"I've seen comments like this half a dozen times this week. I think there is a push to get people to distrust charities and not donate?

I don't know who is pushing this narrative or where it's coming from. To get lack of empathy to spread like a virus, I suppose.

Some charities suck, obviously. It's so easy to check up on how reputable any given charity is, the idea that 99% of charities are strictly grifts is laughable."

03/29/2021,stocks,"This. Yes, it’d be better to donate the money yourself. 99.99% of people won’t though, so the fact that they offer this is a good thing."
03/29/2021,stocks,"You’re correct (though I think OP was facetiously talking about he himself taking an .11 cent deduction on his schedule A).  But  from the corporate POV, this would be a liability to the company (not their money, so not recognized as income), and then they forward it to the charity (and don’t get a deduction for it).

It would be different if they said, “and we’ll match every donation, up to X.xx”, then they really are putting their own money into it and they would get a deduction for charitable contribution on their tax return."
03/29/2021,stocks,They probably claim 90% administrative costs on that revenue... Idk just spitballing but that sounds right to me.

03/29/2021,stocks,"There are tons of great charities out there, I would say most are good. You can often contact them and ask them what a monetary donation would go to and some smaller charities will allow you to dictate where the money goes (ex. donating to a local cat rescue specifically for vet bills). Also second using the charity rating sites, they are pretty comprehensive."

Any charity where it's the charity distributing the money to others gets a bit iffy.  I've donated to St Jude's not just bc it involves children, but bc I know the money is going to operating expenses, even if they are bloated. The families generally don't pay anything.

03/29/2021,stocks,"When he intends 100k to go to the library he means 100k in addition to the current and future planned funds. The point is to enhance the target in a substantial manner above what it would have been.

Ohio had a similar scam where it legalized state gambling in lottery systems by convincing voters the funds would go to schools. Then they just reduced school budgets by the windfall from the lotteries. This is a bastardization of the intent."
03/29/2021,stocks,Money can be moved around. They give it all to the library and slay the regular library budget to $0 for a decade or two. This is used commonly in taxes.

Her publicising the fact she is giving it away is to encourage others to do the same as she’s signed up to Warren Buffets Giving Pledge.

They want the government to provide everything and think charities existing take away from the government's ability to provide it, and also are some evil tax dodge by billionaire's to circumvent the collective good for their own bidding. Here's one hot take from a google search:  https://socialistreview.org.uk/402/philanthropy-capitalist-art-deception

Libertarians generally love charity as it's all voluntary. The belief is why should a government provide food to the needy by ""force"" if a charity could and all money is given voluntarily? It's not that a libertarian doesn't want food to go to the needy, they just don't want people to be forced to give to the needy if they don't want to. They also think governments are garbage at resource allocation and private would allocate it more efficiently. libertarianism and charity: https://www.libertarianism.org/essays/libertarian-vision-for-poverty-welfare"

It also includes doctors that work at hospitals. Do you want a highly skilled surgeon at your hospital or not? The vast majority of ""normal"" charities ceos make in that ballpark of 221k or less.

Government benefits from economies of scale, no fundraising spend, and no accountability. Count the amount of fraud going on. More than 10% of unemployment or 63 billion has gone to fraud. Tons more people couldn't even login to claim it, because their websites are garbage and offices and phones understaffed. Maybe they should have paid a little extra to hire competent people."
03/29/2021,stocks,"There's laws governing how much they can pay themselves (it has to be comparable to a similar for profit job of a similar size). If you find certain charity staff to be paid unreasonable, you can report them, and they get fines and their tax charity status revoked.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Corn can be used to embezzle. A local coop had a location manager that, for some reason, his fuel receipts never matched, his cameras always needed to be fixed, his fertilizer and chemical inventory counts were always off and him and his family always had hand entered tickets for grain coming across the scale. 

He ended up stealing over $80,000 from the coop with those phantom grain trucks. The only way they caught him was that he was planning a trip to Hawaii with the money and used company email to coordinate it. 

His mom was the head of the local bank and friends with the prosecutor. She paid the coop back for what they could prove and he was never prosecuted. He currently works for a competitor."
03/29/2021,stocks,It’s better to donate cash. A good pantry can pool the cash  to get better deals through bulk purchases.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Frankly I think too much weight is given to administrative%. It leads lots of charities to run very barebones operations that are significantly less efficient because of it. If it's something egregious like the Susan G. Komen foundation paying their CEO $600k, that's a huge fucking issue, but the constant pressure to pare down administrative costs can make it really difficult for charities to function efficiently.

Also if you want another good site to check out charities, check out GiveWell. They do super indepth analysis of tons of charities worldwide to determine which ones do the most with your money. If your goal, for instance, is to lengthen human lives by as much as you can per dollar, their spreadsheet will tell you the top ones for that. If you want to specifically reduce diseases that cause the most suffering, or things that affect certain groups, or locations, you can make all of those things factors too and give them whatever weight you want in the analysis, and then they'll use those weights to figure out the most effective charities for your goal. Fucking amazing organization. They also have an option to donate to their own ""Maximum Wellness Fund"", where all of your money goes to the charities and gets sent to whatever ones at that time need it most/are most effective."

03/29/2021,stocks,You should choose better charities then.  Classifying all charities as inefficient and/or corrupt is incorrect.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Plenty of charities are 100% fraudulent. Plenty others give only like 5% of their budget to the cause they purport to fund. Another advantage that government programs have is that they don't have to spend money on fundraising events, while some charities end up spending well over half their budget this way. 

You're right about the doctors and surgeons, but only 500 physicians in the country make over $1 million and not all of them are working for 501(c)3s."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know the board doesn't directly get a paycheck but literally everyone is leadership makes 6 figures. Not that that's a lot of money but you're probably right by limits on their ""direct"" pay.

03/29/2021,stocks,"At this point I'd welcome federal prison. At least I could make some news friends.

It's not hard making friends in jail unless you're a total a hole."
03/29/2021,stocks,Just donate the money to Lamborghini
03/29/2021,stocks,"I’m sorry but that doesn’t even make sense. You pay Panda Express $11 for your meal. You give $1 to St Judes or whoever they support. Even IF they declared that as $12 in revenue with a $1 writeoff, the net effect on income would be zero. Of course, that’s not actually how those programs work. It is illegal to claim it as revenue and consequently is tax fraud. The only way that they could claim a deduction would be if they matched the donation, which seems fair. That’s coming out of their own bottom line. There is no tax write-off for the administrative costs associated with the programs either, in case you’re wondering.

Edit: in case you’re curious or want to read more look up commercial co-ventures."
03/29/2021,stocks,It’s either donate $110k or eat the million meals...a choice must be made!
03/29/2021,stocks,"And I respect your personal choice. However, I prefer to spend my money in way that benefit me and mine, since I do not see the benefit I do not donate."
03/29/2021,stocks,Same to you!
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is why you don’t donate to colleges.

I’ve worked in a colleges charity department."
03/29/2021,stocks,Then they'll just add the money while also cutting the budget.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't give a shit. If I was dead you could bang me all you want. I mean who cares? A dead body is like a piece of trash. I mean shove as much shit in there as you want. Fill me up with cream, make a stew out of my ass. What's the big deal? Bang me, eat me, grind me up into little pieces, throw me in the river. Who gives a shit? You're dead, you're dead! "
03/29/2021,stocks,"Sometimes, one’s purpose in life is to serve as a warning to others."
03/29/2021,stocks,Oh. Can I really do that?  I’d like to have the military blow my mom up.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Bodies being used for awful things the family didn't want is sadly a fairly common thing. They tell you that your family member's body will be used for research to save lives and offer to pay for the funeral and any other costs but they don't tell you that that ""research"" might be your mom being used as a crash test dummy or might be dismembered and end up with multiple parts in some creepy dude's fridge who buys parts to sell to research facilities but ends up stuck with a bunch that don't get purchased and sticks em in his freezer in the garage. That shit is not cool."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Whoa, never heard that one before."
03/29/2021,stocks,That’s... a pretty fucking awesome funeral though
03/29/2021,stocks,"In fairness, it probably did yield some important data. They don’t just blow up corpses for shits and giggles."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah this didn't really sound all that bad. I remember specifically that only a portion was specifically earmarked for the library. A career center sounds awesome, and maybe he liked sports too?"
03/29/2021,stocks,You first. Let me know when it's done.
03/29/2021,stocks,Honestly. If I was stupid rich I'd be paying my maid like 30 bucks an hour. If I'm rich enough to have hired help on full time I'm rich enough to afford them some dignity in life.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Amen. Put your maid in the will, set up a trust for them and their children. I'll keep it local and personal."
03/29/2021,stocks,"its funny you say that because ive always had that same thought whenever i read an article like this. I would like to know if they paid out their long time gardener, maid, hair stylist/barber, mailman, package delivery driver, etc or if they just donated it all to charity? 

Like it was mentioned above, one of the worries i would have donating to my local college, city, etc is that the money would get misused. So that would be the first place i would start"
03/29/2021,stocks,Cuz donating millions to the maid doesn't give them a tax break
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah imagine working your whole life for a company, saving up all they money you made, and then that money going right back to the company when you die. What the fuck."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Food banks can be huge. Take [Chicago's Food Bank](https://www.chicagosfoodbank.org/about/), for example. From the about page:

> We act as the hub for a network of more than 700 food pantries, soup kitchens, shelters and other programs. These programs provide food where it’s most needed. We also address the root causes of hunger. Public benefits outreach and job training programs offer support for our neighbors to overcome poverty.

Or from [Food Bank for New York City](https://1giqgs400j4830k22r3m4wqg-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/FBNYC_Annual-Report_FY2019.pdf):

> 57.5 million meals distributed to 1.4 million new yorkers

> 132 free meals moved per minute

That corresponds to an overhead of less than one cent per meal if the Executive director for NYC was earning $400K/year. About 1/6 of that organization's expenses are management and fundraising. About $5 million for management, $3 million fundraising.

This doesn't include additional costs incurred at each individual food pantry, since they primarily depend on food banks, although  they take local donations, too."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That's money well spent then. Top talent that can ramp the charity up like that is going to cost money, the director could likely make better money in the private sector but chooses to work for the food bank. Sometimes paying top money for top talent gets you better bang for your buck than cheaping out."
03/29/2021,stocks,Never understood why someone who's talented at managing a large non profit organization can't be compensated for their added value.
03/29/2021,stocks,"All non profit CEOs make absurd salaries like that. I just don't get it. 

Makes me feel like non-profits like the trump foundation are just horseshit in some way"
03/29/2021,stocks,I've been leeching corn syrup for years! Got my little nest egg saved up. Gonna open a candy factory
03/29/2021,stocks,"Poor Chickens! That Skeezy Bastard stole Chicken Coop Grain, caused the Coop to experience hunger and ghost trucks haunted the Coop!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Very much this. When nonprofits try to get an attractive % of funds that go directly to helping it can often be at the cost of their own community and their cause overall. If a non profit can only offer 40k per year for a role that requires a master degree, then they are unlikely to be able to find talent that will actually help their cause be more impactful. Not only that, but it means folks who can afford to take an unpaid internship or work for less money will dominate the industry, often leading to nonprofits filled with homogenous staff coming from well off backgrounds working in aid work. There are a lot of implications with it"
03/29/2021,stocks,Try the art department
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know right, he must’ve been like - you want to marry me??"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just an observation. You never see ""some people are ignorant"""
03/29/2021,stocks,Sounds like capitalism to me brev
03/29/2021,stocks,"You're just saying ""plenty"" when you have literally no idea what the numbers are but are trying to imply significant #s.

>Our data shows that 7 out of 10 charities we've evaluated spend at least 75% of their budget on the programs and services they exist to provide. And 9 out of 10 spend at least 65%.

https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=content.view&cpid=48

It's wildly rare that charities spend 5% or less on the programs. 

It's also very very rare for charities to be purely fraudulent, though I'm sure it happens. All financials are public info, so it seems to be a very dumb way to commit fraud. 

I mentioned doctors and surgeons, simply to explain 501c3 orgs represent more than people would think at first glance, not to explain away the entire discrepancy. Sure, plenty of execs of very very large non profits do make very high salaries, but it's a goofy metric to compare govt leadership salary to private leadership salary to show efficiency."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Think about why would leadership of a very large organization get 6 figures. Do you want to recruit smart people with experience in leadership or not? If a highly skilled leader makes 200k at a private job, they might work for 6 figures at a charity they believe in, but probably not for 50k. The gap is too large. 

Not sure why you think this is some fraudulent funneling happening. You know many groups did study face mask efficacy, those studies basically have to be funded by grants, and that data was very very valuable in fighting covid. You can also click into the study and see who the ivey league economists that were working on it. You can probably go even call them up and ask them questions if you think this was some sort of scam. I guess it's easier to just call people helping the world scammers than do 5 minutes of research though."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why?

Also aldi is privately owned"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It's not the job of a charity to solve a systemic issue. Rarely is there a problem that can be solved so easily. Complicated problems require government intervention. Charities are an essential component, but putting it all.om their shoulders is shifting responsibility where it doesn't belong."
03/29/2021,stocks,"From today, the evidence is pretty clear. https://www.reddit.com/r/LateStageCapitalism/comments/mf0pxn/philanthropy_exists_as_a_way_to_launder/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf lots of upvotes."
03/29/2021,stocks,"> I can't see it for you unfortunately.

That is just a nonsense conspiracy thing thing to say, as is the Givewell people statement, a lot of people think they do great work, hence they get recommended. When you read effective altruism books and forums they are mentioned all the time.

I don't really see any issues, unless big malaria and big deworm have got to me."
03/29/2021,stocks,yeah....dont know how youd fund that.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The. Company. Eats. Panda. 1M. Times?

Now I’m confused!  Or just trying to act silly to break up monotony of the workday.  Happy Monday everyone who reads this!!"
03/29/2021,stocks,Well you have to understand I had 8k to my name and put it all into a penny stock and it went up 10x and I made 80k. So to me 80k is more than enough for me to live in my apartment with my cats and boyfriend. I’m sterile so I’m not having kids. To me this was just donating some of the money I made. Now I have 65k in this other penny stock that I believe could run. I hope the universe blessings me good luck to you!🙌
03/29/2021,stocks,"I started multiple businesses and had side hustles while active duty.

03/29/2021,stocks,"My grandmother said this as well, after learning how much money people spend on funerals haha. “I won’t notice the fancy casket, I’ll be dead. Just throw me in the trash”"
03/29/2021,stocks,I don't know how many years on this Earth I got left. I'm gonna get real weird with it

03/29/2021,stocks,Nice golden girls ref.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I want to be run through a wood chipper on the deck of a ship, to feed the fish. After I die."
03/29/2021,stocks,I hadn't even *started* repaying my student loans when the university started hitting me up for alumus donations.
03/29/2021,stocks,"So where does donated money typically end up, aside from buying extraneous electronics?"
03/29/2021,stocks,And it's not even close to the worst thing they did with the bodies they bought.
03/29/2021,stocks,"You have to wait until after she dies, dude."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Holy run-on sentence, Batman!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Honestly if my soul sack or parts of it has more value to some dude sitting in his fridge than paying for it to be burnt to ashes or dug into the ground, all the more power to him. I'd rather at least something resembling something productive be done with it, even if its not as noble a cause as what people normally imagine when ""donating to science""."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That shit is deffo not cool

*Its ice fuckin cold man* ya know cuz it’s in the freezer."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Oh sure, the act itself is not bad IMO. If I could sign up to sell my body for $5 or more and give the money to my family, I would seriously consider it. It's more the fact that I feel like that kind of treatment should require consent from the family. My guess would be there were some painful years at the end of her life due to Alzheimer's. The family likely got some peace from thinking donating the body to research would possibly help with Alzheimer's research. Instead, they just sold the body and the military blew it up."
03/29/2021,stocks,I only have $200 in my checking account and I gave it to the food bank. Done. Easy peasy
03/29/2021,stocks,"Right, but you'd never give them a million up front bc then you'd lose a maid. Lol"
03/29/2021,stocks,"But therein lies the problem. CEOs are compared to other CEOs. In that sense the CEO that makes 5% more looks rich compared to the CEO making 5% less. So they compete against themselves. But 5% of $400K is $20K. That $20K could be the entire salary of a non profit worker that's not a CEO. So each year, the CEOs are trying to make more than the CEO next to them, not considering the downstream effects. Before you know it, CEOs are getting yearly raises, bonuses, and other compensation worth way more to the rest of society, but they only see it as a marginal benefit to them. As a result, CEO and executive pay runs rampant at little to no benefit to the actual charity under the guise that it's fair because other CEOs with runaway salary's are making that much. Another way to think about it is, what is the marginal value of a 5% raise to someone making $20K a year vs. $200K a year. Now, what is $10k to someone making $20K a year vs someone making $200K a year. OR, what is $10K toward the actual mission of the charity, if it's, say a food bank, that's a hell of a lot of canned goods and non perishables. The marginal benefit is significantly higher to the lower paid worker. So, while $400K a year among CEOs may not be a big deal. Simply paying a salary of $400K a year in a nonprofit setting, may be."
03/29/2021,stocks,"The CEO in question went from serving 2 million pounds of food to 67 million pounds of food. How many more families were taken care of because he was there? But here you would rather pay a CEO $40,000 a year and only deliver 2 million pounds of food?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Haha! Co-op. Not chicken coop.
03/29/2021,stocks,Even good people can be ignorant and stupid lol.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I am most certainly not trying to imply anything I'm not saying. The completely fraudulent charities like ""We Build The Wall"" and the Cancer Fund of America get shut down before doing too much damage, but [huge charities like the Red Cross are known to fudge their numbers significantly](https://www.propublica.org/article/red-cross-ceo-has-been-misleading-about-donations) by not including fundraising costs as part of their overhead. They're listed as 91% efficient as of 2014 but fundraising cost alone brings it down to 74%. Then on top of that they have additional indirect administrative costs that also don't count as overhead for some reason, which the Red Cross refused to disclose. And the Red Cross is one of the best charities out there. The 10% rate of fraud for unemployment insurance looks pretty good in comparison.

Then you have charities like the Gates Foundation that spend billions on soft lobbying and expanding for-profit public-private partnerships in developing countries, which technically counts as spending money on a cause but isn't really charity in any sense of the word."
03/29/2021,stocks,"By my guest and report your findings. 

Unfortunately I'm not at my goal point to start donating so it would be a waste of my time in the meantime."
03/29/2021,stocks,"https://imgur.com/a/fNdeoYz

I'm all for supporting charities that try to resolve issues permanently.  And I love nature.

What I don't like is charities that come to an area and then never leave - like the Save the Children Charity.  They do great work, but every time I talk to anyone associated with them, they can never point and say 'hey, we succeeded here and left the area because our work was done there'."
03/29/2021,stocks,I know I'm just saying cuz anybody putting a grocery out where people can't get to grocery stores is gonna make a killing. But I chose aldi's for being generally cheaper
03/29/2021,stocks,"I disagree.

There’s plenty of evidence that charities cause harm, even though they mean to do good.

The only government that counts is that which is effective and responsive to the people. 

If the government can’t fix poverty in a small area (generally due to lack of resources) why can’t NGOs help?  Why shouldn’t they help?

Charities need to consider the big picture and ask themselves if they are perpetuating the cycle of the very issue that they are there for."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ignore the haters

This place is filled with boomer idealists"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Ya, with distributing 20-30m last year they're WELL KNOWN throughout the world!

It's practically a household name up there with tesla, apple and microsoft. Give me a break."
03/29/2021,stocks,I bet there's at minimum 1t sitting in charity funds within the usa. They could buy and build out a county if any of them really wanted the homeless to live the life they want to live.

03/29/2021,stocks,Block the wind while I roast this bone
03/29/2021,stocks,How so? Kobe & Ginobli were beasts! And our fearless leader Kenobi would never be tossed in the trash
03/29/2021,stocks,That’s not how you wanna die? Hahahaha. Good specification at the end there
03/29/2021,stocks,I dont think I had even graduated when my school started sending me the paperwork.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Same here, they called me once and never again. The conversation went like this. Remember that $60,000 I gave you for a piece of paper? What did you do with all that money? Call me in a decade once I’ve finished paying that off any maybe I’ll consider donating."
03/29/2021,stocks,"20 yrs later, 7 different addresses, haven't sent them a $.01 and they still ask for $$ a few times every year."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I hadn't even started attending college (just accepted) and I was already getting hit up for donations. Seriously, wtaf."
03/29/2021,stocks,"So donations are restricted, donor sets a specific goal or specific fund for it to go towards. Or they are unrestricted in which case they go the the general fund/slush fund or what ever they want.

So it typically ends up in the general fund. Which the college can pretty much do whatever they want with, such as building stadiums, giving students who are underachievers athletic scholarships. Etc."
03/29/2021,stocks,Depends on where she lives actually. The US military blows up plenty of people while they're alive too.
03/29/2021,stocks,Of course. That’s what I meant. I knew that.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The family was overly attached, I feel. At the end of that day, the woman had died and disappeared. All that was left was a corpse, and it wasn’t even property of the family anymore.

Tactless? Yes. But at the same time, the family should let go and not be so sentimental about it. In some ways, she contributed to Alzheimer’s research anyway. They had more than enough bodies, and the funding they got would help them continue their research.

And I say this as someone who just lost his own father a little over a month ago."
03/29/2021,stocks,It may be advisable to give yourself a financial buffer in case tough times fall upon you.... Good luck to you.
03/29/2021,stocks,No that would be a terrible way of doing it for everybody but the maid.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Uhh yea job offers have to be competitive.   It's why certain jobs don't attract top talent. We have genius mathematicians figuring out Algorithms for the stock market instead of developing space ships because the money is better.   

A ceo does have value. Sometimes they're worth it."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That assumes the pay is directly correlated to results. Lol. If he used the extra 100,000 a year to serve just as much food then what?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Fine, their Salary will be Celery, Bell Peppers and Okra, (since there's always too much)!

03/29/2021,stocks,"Ha-ha! I know! But you started it, so I Co-opted it."
03/29/2021,stocks,It's not a waste of time to make accusations of fraud against large groups of people you have 0 knowledge about that are trying to help the world though?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, I think it's all a matter of putting your money where you believe it will help the most, whatever that means to you individually.

By the way, respect for the donation to the Access Fund and thanks for helping out!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well save the children is pretty vague isn't it?  Even if they do enough to resolve issues in one country, they can always find another country with issues. Or find new issues. The charity is designed to never end. It's like that dude in Memento creating a case he can't solve."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I think the reason they choose not to open in those areas is because it's unprofitable. Not enough people/ too much risk of theft or damage/ people in those areas don't spend as much on groceries. It sucks, and I think sometimes the government offers incentives but you still end up with food deserts."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I did not say what you are implying, that is just a random strawman comment and avoids all discussion about any of the points."

03/29/2021,stocks,The rich have to keep some people poor huh
03/29/2021,stocks,"Well they weren't doing that much before he started. So it sounds like he has something to do with it. If he could 33x my business, I'd pay him $4 million a year without a second thought. It sounds to me like he's already working for a pretty significant discount. 

I don't think the pay is correlated to results. I think the results are correlated to the pay. The more you pay for a position, the higher quality candidates you can attract."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Look through the list. If it smells like shi and looks like shi, it's probably shi. Bad enough the charity guide was created by a hedge fund guy.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Wal-Mart has opened up shoppettes in some of these areas. They're about the size of an Aldi's I guess and they're usually on a supply route to a bigger store.

So what do you think are the best bets today, considering both potential upside and risk, if you hope to see a profit or simply are willing to completely change your portfolio composition within a couple years?

I’m long on the aerospace industry, with Boeing, Lockheed, Airbus and Rolls Royce. They have been beaten up because of the pandemic but I assume they will recover nicely within the time. They can be volatile though.

Long Visa and MasterCard, as the move to cashless payments is surely a continuing trend.
I see a couple risks here. One is disruption by other companies. Consumer facing brands with a large user base, especially Apple Amazon and Google, have already stepped in the field and could eventually try to create their own payment networks. Then there is possible government disruption, with the move to digital currency, that could affect their margins.

Getting more speculative, PayPal is tempting because it had such a great run and then a pullback, but seems also a lot more risk, both comparatively overvalued and easier to replace.

Travel recovery looks also like a safe bet, Delta United Hilton Marriot are some interesting names, Airbnb even, but I’d be interested in finding good alternatives.

E-commerce, Amazon MercadoLibre and Alibaba are at the moment in widely different situations, but on the whole I suspect they will do well in a couple years.
MELI is a growth stock, which is toxic these days, but appears it may honestly grow. BABA is undervalued because China, but I’m confident Jack Ma and the government will find a middle ground as they have largely common interests.

Still the relations between China and much of the rest of the world are rapidly deteriorating, something I’m very concerned about, but the greatest worry is that the effect could spill well beyond Chinese stocks.

Shorting a bunch of EV and Green energy names is a temptation, but handling the volatility would require a huge margin and the risk high. Meh.

Admittedly a shorter timeframe, highly speculative bet, PSTH is tempting because of the fame of Ackman, and being back close to the initial offering price. SPACs are fast falling out of favor, yet this one has been widely publicized and could see a nice bump of share price if a merger is announced.

2021-03-28 22:20:54,stocks,"Jerome Powell and the 2% inflation promise. FOMC in a nutshell. On March 17, 2021 at the FOMC event, the FED Chairman Jerome Powell stated that he expect to keep interest rates close to zero until at least 2024, even as the FED has upgraded their US growth forecasts because of a massive fiscal stimulus and an accelerating vaccine rollout.

 
Powell precisely refers to a ""…full range of tools to provide relief and stability, to ensure that the recovery will be as strong as possible, and to limit lasting damage to the economy. 
… achieving the monetary policy goals that Congress has given us: maximum employment and price stability."" 

 
Further he adds that their ""…ability to achieve maximum employment in the years ahead depends importantly on having longer-term inflation expectations well anchored at 2 percent.""
So basically the unemployment rate is now forecast to fall to 4.5% by the end of the year instead of 5%. On the other side PCE inflation is expected to rise to 2.2% compared with the rise to 1.8% predicted in December.
But Fed officials expect the bump in consumer prices to be temporary, with PCE inflation falling back in 2022-2023, even as unemployment drops further.

 
 
And regarding to the federal funds rates the FED continues to ""expect it will be appropriate to maintain the current 0 to 0.25 percent target range""
So they will continue to increase their ""holdings of Treasury securities by at least $80 billion per month and of agency mortgage-backed securities by at least $40 billion per month""

 
So the Fed has managed to maintain rock-bottom interest rates ""…with inflation running persistently below 2 percent"" in order to ""achieve inflation moderately above 2 percent for some time so that inflation averages 2 percent over time and longer-term inflation expectations remain well anchored at 2 percent"" until the US reaches full employment, with inflation hitting 2 per cent and being on track to exceed that target. The central bank also reiterated that it would continue to buy bonds at a rate of $120bn per month until “substantial further progress” was made.

 
And they ""will continue to provide the economy the support that it needs for as long as it takes.""
An approach similar to the famous Mario Draghi ""Whatever it takes"" to save Europe in 2012, from a deep economic crisis.

 
As a result of this policy the upgrades to the forecasts from Fed officials were significant. In fact back in December they predicted 4.2% growth this year, while now they have raised that estimate up to 6.5% (+2.3%), which would be the fastest economic expansion since 1984.

 
What we can say is that this sharp upgrade to the FED's summary of economic projections will certainly generate doubts to the central bank's dovish policy.

 
During his speech Powell reiterates many times that ""The economic recovery remains uneven and far from complete, and the path ahead remains uncertain.""
And that the FED has provided essential support to households, businesses and communities, and the recovery in economic activity since last spring is due to ""an unprecedented fiscal and monetary policy actions.""

 
He concludes by saying that the FED understands that ""our actions affect communities, families, and businesses across the country. Everything we do is in service to our public mission… and to help assure that the recovery from this difficult period will be as robust as possible""

 
So this is what happened during the last FOMC event.

What do you guys think about Powell speech?

What consequences will the markets undergo in the next months?"

2021-03-28 22:07:40,stocks,"I save my entire income and can't stop losing money Sorry for my english, it's not my first language. Disclaimer: ECH = IPSA. It's an index, not a company.

So I'm a very disciplined person and since my first job back when I was 17 y/o i've been saving 100% of my income every single month. I'm a software engineer and since i'm still young, i'm still living with my parents and help the household with secondary sources of income such as freelance work and etcetera.

The thing is, it's been over 5 years and I'm still in the red. I always read that time in the market beats timing the markets, the story about the world's unluckiest investor in the SP500, but for some reason this doesn't apply to me. Back when I started it was kinda difficult to invest in foreign markets, so most of my portfolio is basically my country's index, $ECH (Chile IPSA index), which has done nothing but go down in the last 5 years from its $55USD high to the current $33.6 where it's sitting right now.

A while ago i discovered a fintech that allows us chileans to invest in the US tech sector (a fund composed of ARKK, ARKW, Tesla, Apple and such), and since a lot of people said 2021 was the ""year of recovery"", I diversified with that... and 3 days later the treasury-yield crash came and that's now in the red too. The saddest thing is, not only did I start investing my monthly salary in the tech sector, but also a payment from a freelance job i had been working in since early 2020, so I lost a bunch of money with the recent crash because I didn't DCA. Now, the reason i didn't DCA is 1) i believed in analysts saying 2021 was the year of recovery and 2) i had a horrible experience with DCA'ing in ECH, as i ""buy the dip"" but it keeps getting lower and lower. It doesn't matter that i bought cheaper the next month: it just keeps going lower and lower.

I honestly don't know why I have such bad luck. I can't withdraw my money even if i wanted to because of the losses (I don't want to do so anyways) and i would've been much better just spending everything instead in a car, a house or something.

How can I stop losing all of my income? Thanks.

&#x200B;

**EDIT**: I'm adding some context on the chilean market below. I tried to be as concise as possible, I hope it's good enough.

I started investing IPSA in late 2017. Back then (early 2017), the index was looking good because of high expectations in the new president (Sebastian Piñera, a right-winging conservative) economic outlook, people thought Chile would skyrocket thanks to his administration.

2018 came and chilean growth was mediocre at best. People started noticing Piñera's better times (Tiempos Mejores) weren't a reality, as economy-oriented government reforms were hard to implement because of the left-wing politicans in the chamber of deputies blocking them.

It's 2019, the year of the commercial war between the US and China. China was the main economic partner of Chile, so the confrontation was very bad for the chilean economy. Some side effects of the trade war, according to analysts, include lower prices in commodities such as copper. There is a very high, known historical correlation between copper and the Chile IPSA index (you can read about it in [this](https://repositoriodigital.bcentral.cl/xmlui/bitstream/handle/20.500.12580/3612/BCCh-rec-v17n3dic2014p056-085.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y) paper, the point being it's been studied). So, low copper prices + trade war = $ECH goes down even more.

October 2019 comes and the 30 peso revolution starts. Public protests were an alien thing for us chileans before October 2019, we had a very stable country with low to none social revolts in our recent history. This revolt started because of a subway (Metro) fare price hike 2 days prior. Protesters destroyed the subway, supermarkets, police stations, and so on and so forth, asking for a refundation and a new constitution that replaces the one written by Pinochet's regime 40 years ago. The IPSA crashes.

Late 2019 comes and politicians from all sectors, left and right, conservatives and liberals, reach an agreement for a new constitution, one to be written by 155 electors chosen by popular vote in the same way as deputies. The IPSA goes up 8% in a single day because everything seems to be going good. The protests mostly stop and Chile finds its new peace. Investors are scared at first because of the potential dangers of a new constituion, but since we have a D'Hondt voting system, right-wing politicans are certain to reach the necessary threshold of representatives to keep the political stability that characterizes Chile as a country, especially when compared to its latin american neighbors. Investors stop fearing so much, and it's this point when i said to myself ""it's finally going to pay off. 2020 is going to be a great year for my portfolio!""

Then 2020 comes and the virus comes. The IPSA crashes to 2008 levels. At this point, it just makes me laugh how unlucky I can be. There is a small-percentage recovery right now from the absolutely low nonsense prices we had in 2020, especially because Chile is the second best country in vaccination speed after Israel, we're expected to reach herd immunity in June 2021 or earlier. Also copper is at all-time high prices, but we lost the copper-to-IPSA correlation after these recent events.

That's where Chile stands at, 2009 levels right now. In order to recover my losses, the IPSA would need to recover from: a commercial war, a social revolt, the dangers of a new constitution, the coronavirus, and the impact of low copper prices from years prior.

But testimonies from Reddit that I read every day (i'm quite interested in the possibility of emigrating for new opportunities) show there's more to it than getting to the US and instantly 6x'ing my current income. You have to beat hundreds of white Americans from the top universities in the world by solving long, hard interview questions that penalize you for anything. If the redditors from r/cscareerquestions can't get a job after years and years of trying even with a top-college degree, then I'm sure to fail, especially considering that the situation is very different in Chile as there is a shortage of programmers, it pays way less but you can get a job very quickly.

Can you explain how world funds don't protect you for inflation? I'm not very familiarised with world funds so I don't fully understand how they work. I was under the impression that if you buy VTI for example, you buy the shares in USD and it stays that way until you withdraw the gains (probably losses for me haha). Luckily there's not much inflation in the chilean economy, but being protected from that would be great.

For years I've lied to myself by believing in a recovery after so many falls, and the news and index being so doomed that it's stuck in 2008 levels only reinforced this thought of an eventual, strong rebound.

The truth is, that's not gonna happen. Hasn't happened in 10 years and won't happen now or maybe ever.

03/29/2021,stocks,We literally rallied back to opening prices I don’t know why everyone is panicking. I was down by 3% on the day at 10 am pst and by 11 or 12 I was up 1%. I think if anything the late day was a sign of things to come I think we will have a fantastic week. However I’m not making any decisions till 10 if it’s deep red.
03/29/2021,stocks,Obviously I’m going to make some reckless decisions on margin.
03/29/2021,stocks,ive got cash ready to go this week
03/29/2021,stocks,I'm going to sell puts and buy stock... not selling anything.
03/29/2021,stocks,it costs nothing to hold. Average down if its below your average. Sell any crazy run. But buying selling and repeating destroys your earnings longterm to capital gains tax.
03/29/2021,stocks,Buy the Dips. ;)
03/29/2021,stocks,My feeling is this is going to trigger a run for the doors note that people are going to be buying the dip. I'll just be sitting on my positions because they are mostly longer term anyway (and the fundamenta haven't changed) with some shorts that are probably going to pay.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know absolutely nothing but, I'm gonna play like this sell off isn't over and probably just hold for the first half of the week. I was able to average down on quite a few things last week so I'm not super worried about some short term choppy lines."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm definitely buying. I remember when [UBS underwent a forced liquidation](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-19/ubs-to-redeem-two-leveraged-mortgage-etns-after-95-plunge) of some of their leveraged mreit products during the 2020 crash, which caused stocks like NLY to drop to under $4 in a single day. I snatched up a bunch of NLY paying out a ridiculous 25% dividend along with the stock quickly rebounding 50% in a matter of days. Still collecting that dividend.

The people who buy into the forced liquidations have a good chance of profiting from the firm's loss. It is basically a ""going out of business"" fire sale for anyone with the resources to buy in."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This could start to get interesting. With the whole world based on credit a domino effect could be unleashed here.

According to Yahoo Finance Morgan Stanley owns 43m shares of Viacom so the 45m offer of shares for sale rumour does have a degree of credibility.

It's funny reading that Goldman Sachs is selling a block trade on behalf of a client when they seem to own 10m shares of Viacom.

I wonder if they have sold those already?

There could be a way to make some money here.

If Tencent have done a share buyback then they obviously know that their share price is undervalued after the plunge so if Viacom and others don't follow suit then might be a good idea to short them as they obviously will be worth less."
03/29/2021,stocks,[removed]
03/29/2021,stocks,Im going to hold.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I am not trying to be a naysayer by any means, but this is starting to feel like the beginning of ‘08 all over again. I wish I was wrong but something just isn’t right... how many funds can collapse before the market can no longer absorb the effects without major corrections?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"> gin callsare the reason 

i bought the dip for the last 4 weeks.

now i haz no money.....

the market can stay iirational longer than i can stay liquid"
03/29/2021,stocks,same. I'll be holding as well. fomo and fear are when you lose money
03/29/2021,stocks,Unless you count profits you lost by holding instead of selling high and rebuying when prices drop.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Bought into the Corona crash Feb/Mrch 2020, held until mid year, bought other quality stocks, made 50% net return over 1.5 yrs, bought into GME the first stocks at btw $5-10, they had cash and assets that offered downside protection and turnaround potential, held until Jan and made a 300% net return. Now I am big time into MOMO Inc. It‘s tech, but profitable and downside protection with huge upside I believe. What I mean is, downside protection, fundamentals and sound prospects matter a lot at any company, especially tech. Upside comes naturally then."
03/29/2021,stocks,I love you.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Why do people even short? It costs money to short and there’s unlimited downside with limited upside. 

Why doesn’t everyone just go long and have stocks literally go straight up with much less downwards force?"
03/29/2021,stocks,I definitely remember the guy who kept posting about his VIAC yolo..where is he now I wonder...
03/29/2021,stocks,I’m deep in DISCA and have no fear.
03/29/2021,stocks,GS sold the shares in a block trade on behalf of another entity that got margin called after losing big on a leveraged position. They didn't own the shares themselves.
03/29/2021,stocks,"They need liquidity to cover short positions 

I posted before and was downvoted to oblivion that a market crash would occur solely to create liquidity for covering shorts."
03/29/2021,stocks,They have a cash requirement they need to maintain thanks to new FED requirements that begin this week. They have an open short position on a stock that some believe could short squeeze soon ($CLVS). They might need the cash to close / cover that position.
03/29/2021,stocks,Silver lol
03/29/2021,stocks,"Just look at what Goldman Sachs sold. A bunch of crap companies that went up like crazy over the last year. They weren’t selling good companies like Google, Amazon etc. it’s trash Chinese stocks like alibaba and things that are going to do bad once accounting standards are forced upon them. How much money can a Chinese Amazon type thing make when they are selling counterfeit drugs, clothes and yes you can even buy counterfeit us currency on alibaba. Can’t wait to see them fined and delisted."
03/29/2021,stocks,I am almost certain this will domino effect
03/29/2021,stocks,I must admit also interested in what you down if they all plummeted
03/29/2021,stocks,I will bet you $1 that you are wrong...or right.
03/29/2021,stocks,"What we are waiting for now is another bigger company needing to to the same thing because another margin call was made, and the ensuing domino effect."
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is supposing that the selloff didn't destroy other highly leveraged positions that are now about to be margin called.

I suspect (hope) that if that were the case it would have happened by now. I don't know whether we have that kind of systemic risk, but I fear stocks have been in a speculative bubble for a while, and interest rates are low, so the vulnerability could be there."
03/29/2021,stocks,Not isolated. A second HF is about to sell off a huge block of VIAC. https://reddit.com/r/GME/comments/mfdt7m/another_large_block_trade/
03/29/2021,stocks,"Based on current volume, you’re not alone"
03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah that damn boat is gonna hurt for a while.
03/29/2021,stocks,How much was liquidated on Friday and where did you get the 25-30b?
03/29/2021,stocks,This. David Faber from CNBC tweeted today that 45 million shares of VIAC were put up for sale tonight by one or more hedge funds. Tomorrow morning is going to be crazy.
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol... you must be new
03/29/2021,stocks,"You are long on large cap stocks and think this somehow equates to putting one over on rich people...?

One of the largest tricks the rich have pulled off for themselves in the past 40 years is destroying pensions and turning the 401k into the new retirement vehicle of choice for middle-class Americans. Even if your money is growing, you're not really taking it from anyone, and certainly not from the rich who own those shares in much higher quantities than you do."
03/29/2021,stocks,Those are solid picks.
03/29/2021,stocks,"The fund is not Chinese... Bill Hwang is Korean by descent and his fund is based in New York City.

There has already been a selloff in Chinese markets, since mid-February. Check the CSI 300 and Hang Seng index.

Chinese tech has also had a particularly rough sell-off for the past few days. Baidu and TME got it the worst, as far as I can tell. Chinese tech stocks overall have gotten much larger corrections than their American counterparts.

I would say (hope) that Chinese tech is poised for a recovery now that it's clear why Friday's selloff happened (i.e. nothing about the fundamentals)."
03/29/2021,stocks,Do u think it's good time to buy the stocks that got sold off?
03/29/2021,stocks,"There is a [three year grace period.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-24/sec-starts-implementing-law-that-risks-chinese-stock-de-listings) From the linked source:

> In a Wednesday statement, the SEC said it’s taking initial steps to force accounting firms to let U.S. regulators review the financial audits of overseas companies. The penalty for non-compliance, as stipulated by the law Congress approved in December, is ejection from the New York Stock Exchange or Nasdaq for any business that doesn’t allow their audit to be inspected for three years.

This is a hella long time. Odds are that the rule will get reversed, or it will get weakened, or the companies will figure out the necessary compliance."
03/29/2021,stocks,Lmao. They are about as likely to delist BABA as they are gonna delist Amazon. That's the stupidest thing I've seen here and I've been here for a couple of years.
03/29/2021,stocks,There were reports a few hours ago that some other hedge fund is selling huge blocks of shares tonight. Not sure what's going to happen tomorrow morning.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yup. Buying more during the dip reduces your cost per share basis.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Unless the companies you bought go out of business you'll still make money in the long run.  There is always a better time to buy/sell, so don't sweat missing the perfect moment."
03/29/2021,stocks,Let’s say intercourse instead.  This is a family sub.
03/29/2021,stocks,When do I sell high?
03/29/2021,stocks,"Shorts provide two valuable and indispensable services to the broader market. 

Liquidity for one. They help make a market with bid and ask prices. 

Two, they also sniff out cons, liars, frauds and other flim-flam operators with bogus claims about their companies.

These firms with 'billions under management' can't just shove all their money in an index fund or a single company or even an entire sector. They are making huge amounts in fees to give clients the opportunity to beat the market. Beating the market means making money in both directions.

I think what we are probably seeing right now play out in real time is short tech / long cyclicals in the market.

But I agree. I don't short individual stocks ever. One bit of bad timing and you are BTFO. You can get short exposure with much less risk through directional ETF's or put options on individual shares."
03/29/2021,stocks,Buy $CORN lad!
03/29/2021,stocks,Short oil?
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks for the fish.
03/29/2021,stocks,Explain like I’m 5.
03/29/2021,stocks,CLVS has pretty low short volume (15%) according to Fintel. Why would it squeeze?
03/29/2021,stocks,a few of them are Asian tech names. For US the largest positions were viacom and discovery I think.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I just sell half if I'm not sure, then I can average down or buy a dip later depending on how it goes."
03/29/2021,stocks,Not a bad idea. Stop losses are a thing I use for my thresholds.
03/29/2021,stocks,Those weren’t Goldman Sachs’ positions. They were acting on behalf of a Chinese fund that got margin called after being way leveraged in tech stocks
03/29/2021,stocks,They are selling whatever Archegos had put up as collateral...

03/29/2021,stocks,Bill Hwang is Korean. The surname is similar to the Chinese surname Huang (and pronounced the same) but Chinese and Korean have different romanization systems.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I watched my portfolio of ETF based stocks (DVY, IVW) go from 175k to 119k last year during the COVID crises. I panicked but held. When my value came back up to 160k late last year I sold, happy to have most of my money back. I decided to day trade to make back my losses. Made about 10k to bring my portfolio up to 170k, then everything started to just rise and I couldn't find any bargains. I put it all back in the market on growth/weed/tech stocks first week of February. Am back down to 143k.  I should have left what I had in DVY and IVW, as I would have been way up by now."
03/29/2021,stocks,Also increases the total amount of money I have to get completely fucked out of.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Depends on the stock. There are lots of ways to see when a stock is soaring high enough to justify closing your position or taking profits. 

When a stock is dramatically overvalued. When it's growth potential gets destroyed. When its industry/sector is or will be dramatically compromised. When holding that stock gives you less earning potential than investing in another stock.

Is GOOGL a good stock? I believe so. Is it a long term hold? Absolutely. 

But I just sold it to buy  stocks for companies that will profit from infrastructure (Biden to announce that plan shortly).

GOOGL went down 3.5%. My infrastructure stocks went up 10%.

When infrastructure stocks are overvalued, I will sell those stocks and rebuy GOOGL (assuming it's at the right price).

Follow profit, not companies."
03/29/2021,stocks,"noob question, but how do you read the futures graph , for example, the S&P 500?"

03/29/2021,stocks,It has to do with CLVS announcing recently that Phase 3 trials of their drug Rubraca was positive in treating Ovarian Cancer. Once FDA gives it the thumbs up I could see it squeeze.
03/29/2021,stocks,Yes I know. They sold it on behalf of them. So there’s no need for panic this is them selling some trash positions a bad client had.
03/29/2021,stocks,I mean if you could buy a meme ETF I'd be all over it
03/29/2021,stocks,Japan sold something like 20 billion worth.  Barely a drop in the bucket in the bond market which is worth trillions.  Did you think people would keep accepting negative real yields after everyone was vaccinated and the economy reopened?
03/29/2021,stocks,"You still use risk free rates , which in the US use usually the 10yr, when you value a company far in the future cause of the time value of money. 

Getting spooked by the 10yr increasing is literally fundamentals that affects value. That being said most prices are obviously outta wack these days anyways but price is always gonna be crazy."
03/29/2021,stocks,With the FED being very very clear they want greater than 2% inflation you think yields will stay at 1.7%?  You think prople will continue to accept negative real yields when everyone is vaccinated and the economy is reopened?
03/29/2021,stocks,You’ve been trading for like 6 months chill Warren buffet. Gonna trigger short term capital gains taxes so this strategy usually isn’t the best

03/29/2021,stocks,"What if you buy at 100, it drops to 80 and you have good reason to believe it'll drop more. So you sell, and buy back in at 60. Then you wait for it to go back up to 100. Now you've made $20 instead of breaking even."

03/29/2021,stocks,Idk what you mean by “read”. It’s the same as any other bar chart.
03/29/2021,stocks,Because it is limited downside with a put option. You are exposed to unlimited losses shorting stock.
03/29/2021,stocks,You don't think 20 billion could move the rate .5 or so of a percentage point in one month? How much glue did you sniff?
03/29/2021,stocks,If it's that obvious then the market should've priced it in by now.

03/29/2021,stocks,Yeah it's just Stox but the icon once installed is stoxy
03/29/2021,stocks,Oh true. But puts have theta decay which is ass but also shorting stocks requires interest to hold the shares so I guess they both have pros and cons

03/29/2021,stocks,"No, I think it's definitely concerning. At nearly 30T, the level of debt can't be sustained unless rates remain artificially low.

The market freaked out in 2018 when the 10 year yield was hitting 3%. Now, it's having issues at just half that."
03/29/2021,stocks,You aren't triggering a 300% rise with a 20 billion sale lol.  You are severely misunderstanding the size of the bond market.
03/29/2021,stocks,The market didn't price in Corona virus for weeks letting the nice people at wallstreetbets make a kill buying shorts.  The market isn't absolutely perfect if it was prices would be completely flat.

03/29/2021,stocks,"My entire portfolio is down nearly 30%.  It's brutal.  Only seen losses for like 7 weeks straight no matter how much I try to average down or diversify.  I bought one share of SPY just so that something looks green on my portfolio and that shit has been red 5 days out of 7 too.    


I'm not selling anything, but I'm running on fumes right now trying to buy shares when I think something is a good deal because it's gotten so low.  Everything just keeps dropping.  I've already resigned myself to the mindset that I'm currently setting myself up to have an incredible 2026."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Given I ended green and I also own Baidu, I'm not that concerned. But if there is another big dip I will have some limit buys set to catch some falling knives."
03/29/2021,stocks,Have you added your portfolio? I can never seem to get these things to give accurate performance
03/29/2021,stocks,"From my perspective, your loss is UNLIMITED on short shares. You buy a put for $1 or $2.50 or whatever, that is your max loss. You short the wrong stock at the wrong time and you are literally blown completely out of the water if it moves hard enough against you. Big difference from just a risk standpoint."
03/29/2021,stocks,Some banks link the accounts so if one gets overdrawn the other one covers so both can get robbed
03/29/2021,stocks,I'll be honest I'm not going to do all of that. I don't buy apple and probably never will. If you want to explain your point I'll gladly entertain it and give you my thoughts but one company means nothing in the grand scheme of things in my opinion. Rising yields are a sign that people aren't buying bonds and have nothing to do with apples earning growth.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Again, concerning for certain stocks sure. 

According to the fed they will remain low for a few more years, sooo no big deal. This is all according to their plan. The real issue is the banks not liking it and them taking it out on the market."
03/29/2021,stocks,Guess we will see in the next few months.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't think rising interest rates and a once in a lifetime global pandemic are the same thing. As you say, the fed is crystal clear about their intentions, and the relationship between the yields and stocks is well understood. So the fed is upfront, while the Whitehouse told everyone coronavirus was just going to disappear.

Either way, we've had greater than two percent yields before. Maybe it will destroy growth stocks, I don't think it will. You can make your own assumption."
03/29/2021,stocks,smart.
03/29/2021,stocks,Ligma boomer.. take that advice
03/29/2021,stocks,"I honestly don't buy anything that I can't see myself holding for at least a year to avoid the short term cap gains. 

Mostly I invest in ETF/Index,my wife's preferred stock package through work, but I also have some pretty speculative holdings. I earn enough to lose all of that and not really effect my lifestyle, but it sucks to see it in the red again and again. 

I honestly don't even look at the 401k/index/ETF stuff because thats more of a 10-30 year timeline."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Dang. Mine is down from what it was, but it's still up 20% and that's just since September."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Haven't tried that yet.

Just used the app for a quick and tidy overview of the global market so far."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah, that's not good.  I think they call it overdraft protection.  They charge for that ""diservice""...though if that feature was disabled, you'd get charged an NSF fee if you didn't have it anyway (the payee may charge a bounce fee too)...but if it's fraud, at least you'd still have your savings."
03/29/2021,stocks,If you aren't willing to look at the 10 year bond yield chart you probably shouldn't be expressing an opinion about the 10 year bond yield.
03/29/2021,stocks,"Concerning certain stocks, like everything outside of the financial sector, utilities, and commodities. Growth oriented stocks like tech suffer from inflation.

The Fed can say they will be keeping rates low, and they certainly can choose to avoid raising interest rates, but that is quite counterproductive during economic expansion like what we are seeing now. Even if they don't raise rates, the yield curve will act on its own (like what is going on now) and the same thing will happen regardless."
03/29/2021,stocks,"!remindme 3 months

Has the 10 yr yield risen past 2%?"
03/29/2021,stocks,Peasant ass mad af lmao dead
03/29/2021,stocks,Like it. Thanks for that. I’ve been using the apple stocks native app and it’s not really cutting the mustard. I’ll give this one a good go - any tips much appreciated
03/29/2021,stocks,"Trust that I have looked at the ten year bond chart, I'm not going to compare it to apples ten year chart then look into their earnings growth.... That's what you said to do... I'm not going to tie the ten yrs to a certain stock and act like it means something."
03/29/2021,stocks,Of course it will rise above 2% it's just not a big of a deal as people are making it. It was above 2% pre pandemic.
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol u have 1 karma.. 👍🏽👍🏽
03/29/2021,stocks,And growth equity valuation where 1/2 of their current valuation pre pandemic.  Debt level have grown and these companies certainly aren't making 100% more money.
03/29/2021,stocks,imagine caring about fake internet points 😂
03/29/2021,stocks,Guess we'll see who is right in 3 months. My will stay where it is though.
2021-03-28 21:39:20,stocks,"WAHT'S GOING ON?? Wall Street banks ditch $19 billion of stocks in ‘unprecedented’ block trade selloff – media Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley have reportedly sold $19 billion worth of shares in Chinese tech and US media companies. Traders are now wondering what caused the unusually massive move and whether it will continue next week.

Goldman Sachs alone liquidated $10.5 billion worth of stocks in block trades on Friday, Bloomberg reported citing the investment bank’s email to clients. The first batch, that included $6.6 billion worth of shares of Baidu, Tencent Music Entertainment Group and Vipshop Holdings, was sold before the market opened on Friday. Later that day, the bank reportedly managed the sale of $3.9 billion worth of shares in American media conglomerates ViacomCBS and Discovery, as well some other companies, such as Farfetch, iQiyi and GSX Techedu. 

Another US investment bank involved in the block trades, which are believed to have wiped $35 billion off affected firms’ valuations in just one day, was Morgan Stanley. The investment bank offered two batches of shares worth $4 billion each on Friday, according to the Financial Times. 
While block trades, when sellers are looking for buyers for large volumes of securities at a price sometimes negotiated privately between the two parties, are a common thing, the scale of Friday’s moves raised eyebrows. 

Continue...

“I’ve never seen something of this magnitude in my 25-year career,” portfolio manager at Swiss-based Bellevue Asset Management AG, Michel Keusch, told Bloomberg. 
Senior vice president at Wealthspire Advisors, Oliver Pursche, called the move “highly unusual,” adding that the market participants are now wondering if another wave of block trades could hit the market on Monday and Tuesday, causing wild price swings in the affected stocks.
Another issue is the unclear nature of those trades. Goldman Sachs explained the sales with “forced deleveraging,” the Financial Times wrote citing people with knowledge of the matter. The outlet also said that the move could indicate that a big hedge fund or family office faced some serious problems. 
Meanwhile, CNBC reported the selling pressure in some US media and Chinese stocks was linked to the forced liquidation of positions held by family investment office Archegos Capital Management. The lack of details about the move makes the situation worrisome, Pursche said, as investors don’t know “whether this was the liquidation of just one fund or more than a fund, or whether it was a fund liquidation to begin with and the reason behind it.”"
03/29/2021,stocks,"This is a big deal.

The problem with this system is that there are too many parasites/middlemen, and everyone is incentivized to cheat or at least overextend themselves.  It's never just two players, as we should have figured out in 2008.  It's a domino effect through the whole system.

""Nomura canceled plans to sell dollar-denominated bonds.""  That is vague.  Which bonds?  Why?  They're just a broker, right?  Why would they not want to sell bonds and take their commission?

This is a lot bigger than one $2 billion loss by one company.  It's hard to say from this article where the deeper rot is, but it is there."

Waste of time IMO. You can learn stocks and trading while in school. People do it all the time. If you still want to take a gap year, work hard, practice being an adult, find out what you wanna do in college. 


> SO I am taking a gap year after highschool ends in the coming months. I plan on doing a job and earning and using that money to invest. I live with my parents and have nearly zero expenditures of my own.


IMO it’s not cool to take a gap year and just live off your parents. If you’re gonna take a gap year at least pay rent and pitch in or better yet live on your own. 


IMHO. It seems like you don’t understand trading or investing, which isn’t entirely your fault, but you’re making bad decisions based off ignorance which isn’t good. Trading/investing is not easy. You likely won’t make money, and you lose the most valuable thing...time. Assuming you retire at 65, and you’re 18 right now and flat broke. You put in  a small but doable $500 a month until you retire at 7% annual return....


If you start now you’d have $1,975,346 by the age of 65. 


If you waste a year you’d have $1,840,510 by the age of 65. 


If you waste two years you’d have $1,714,495 by the age of 65. 


And if you waste three years you’d have $1,596,725 by the age of 65. 


Then things you haven’t considered about trading/investing: 


1) If I remember right, 80% of traders quit within a year, after 5 years over 97% of traders quit. They quit because: 


2) 97% of traders don’t make money. Only 3% of traders make a profit...and less than 1% made more than minimum wage. You’re better off working a fast food job for minimum wage than trading stocks. (This came from a study that analyzed over 20,000 stock traders and their returns) 


3) You need capital. If you need $50k to live off of. And you achieve an average 7% return (which is a very good return for an active trader/investor). You’d need about $750,000 to start with, do you have $750,000? However you’d need more because if we assume you need the $50k to live off of, as inflation eats away at your principal and increases your expenses, you’d need a lot more to avoid running out of money. The ideal %age is the 4% rule, so you’d need about $1,250,000 to sustain yourself with an average return of 7% per year...which is hard to achieve long term. 


4) I have not found a study that shows evidence of learning when it comes to trading. Meaning, you don’t get better over time or with more experience.  


5) You don’t have guaranteed income. You can’t plan your life and expenses out very well.


Ofc this isn’t financial advice."

There are laws that govern the exchange of information between departments in a company. For example the M&A dept talking to CompanyX about an acquisition can't disclosed that information to the investment fund dept that recommends equities to clients, that would be insider trading.

However, as far as I am aware there are no laws stating that an analyst's price targets can't be communicated by a companies CEO once they are published and in the public domain. The whole point of an analyst is to make a prediction and for the company, other companies and general public use that how they wish as a guide for investments. 

Can you provide a source for the securities laws you're referring to? I would be quite interested to see what is written down on this subject.

>Imagine if the CEOs of Barclays, City Group, JP Morgan, Roth Capital, Bernstein or Gordon Johnson would go all over social media and tweet that Tesla is 60 to 90% over priced in the market.

They might not get on twitter but they do interviews where they make broad market predictions that can move entire sectors. Many CEOs have come out and said  ""we see the price of oil/gold/the dollar increasing over the next X months/years"". Larry Flink CEO of BlackRock ($8T AUM) recently said they are changing their investment strategy towards climate change  and sustainability, that moved the green energy sector in its entirety.

> One, it would be extremely unprofessional for them to do so

How unprofessional is it for Josh Brown who is CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management to be on CNBC every day talking prices and predictions? I'm honestly not getting where this unprofessional stance is coming from.

>But to put their opinion on it would, in my opinion, be breaking the ethics code

Warren Buffet, the most influential investor of many generations recently said that Berkshire Hathaway overpaid for their investment in Kraft Heinz, is this also an ethical violation? I don't see it. CEOs, anybody for that matter, can make their opinion known on any subject as long as the information they are communicating is pubic knowledge and not based on inside information that is subject to NDA.

Stock picking is somewhat simple to measure. You just compare your performance with an index of your choice. Beating index is good, losing to index not so. But how can you measure your timing?

[Here's](https://imgur.com/a/8SS9R23) my attempt to visualize my timing success. I have sliced my stock history to half-year pieces and drawn how much and how profitably I have invested in each period. The farther back in time the investment goes, the bigger the profit bars should grow. Well, not quite in my case. This chart is not a clean picture of timing alone. 2010 - 2015 I did some pretty unfortunate stock picks and it shows here. Some periods have not broken even. Still, the chart has a story to tell. 2009 was a sweet time to enter market. 2020 looks good too.

I think market timing is a way of value investing for a person with my mental capacity. I have no skill or patience to calculate intrinsic values of companies. I really don't think I can judge a company better than all the wise people playing the same game. As the picture shows, my stock picks can be horrific. However, I can recognize market crash when one comes. It is kind of easy - indexes go down 30% or more. In the bottom of the crash it seems that almost any stock is a winner. I don't even need to hit the lowest spot of the crash. The time window for good buys is wide. This is borrowing a page from Benjamin Graham. This is exploiting Mr. Market in his most depressed mood."

# Why have the markets been volatile?

A few things have been at play to cause the market to both go up, and down.

* Doubts growing around the vaccine roll-out, fuelled by export bans from the EU and India, along with the looming threat of a 3rd wave in Europe, saw bond yields dip earlier in the week. This helped support the price of growth/tech stocks earlier in the week.
* Tensions between the US and China increased, and US regulators renewed their threats to delist Chinese stocks quoted in the US. This saw Chinese tech giants such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba all drop significantly *(there’s actually a bit more to this story now, rumour has it that a hedge fund or family office blew up last week, creating a fire sale).*
* Energy stocks & related commodities shot-up as a massive ship blocked the Suez canal, blocking the fastest shipping route linking Europe and Asia.
* Quarter-end rebalancing for many asset-management firms will see a flow out from equities to bonds, as many have to maintain proportions of equities-to-bonds in their portfolios, which would have been thrown out of whack given the rally stocks have been on since the start of the year.Money put into stocks was at its lowest since Dec 20 ($4.1Bn) while money flowing into cash instruments was at its highest since Apr 20 ($45.6bn), [TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) saw its third largest inflows ever.](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-markets-flows-bofa/investors-rush-into-cash-at-fastest-pace-since-april-2020-bofa-idUSKBN2BI16H?il=0)

Definitely more volatility, especially as COVID outlooks yo-yo. Prices likely to dip lower, particularly for the highly overvalued growth stocks (EV anyone?) and a continued rotation from tech/growth stocks into cyclical stocks and inflation-protected bonds.

# What about the longer term?

The outlook is better. A return to normal *(how many times have you heard that saying now?)* is now more tangible, as more vaccines get announced and administered *(*[*Biden has doubled targets to 200m doses in his 100 days in office*](https://www.ft.com/content/a1accbdf-0010-426c-9442-feb73b5c8a1d)*, UK have confirmed they are on target to offer a vaccine to all adults by July, with nearly half already administered a first dose)*. After all, the whole worry of rising inflation is due to rapidly recovering economies.

This makes these few weeks a perfect opportunity to research and pick out some long term prospects, to purchase at these subdued prices and hold through the volatility.

To help you do that, i’ve researched up and coming sectors, and likely players in that field to help give you some inspiration. Now just because a stock is on this list does not mean it’s a good investment choice, but it’s a good place to start looking.

# Cloud computing

**What is it?**

Cloud computing is the delivery of on-demand computing services, including servers, storage, databases, networking and software over the internet. Typically, You only pay for the services you use, and can obtain extra resources or computing power within minutes, meaning quicker set-up and lower operating costs with more flexibility.

**Why should I be excited?**

Cloud computing has seen tremendous growth over the last decade. Revenues grew from $197Bn in 2018 to $266Bn just 2 years later. This is forecasted to grow to $354Bn by 2022 as take-up scales.

Cloud computing is already a go to solution for internet services like large websites (Reddit), content delivery platforms (Netflix, Spotify) and start-ups. This is driven by its simplicity, flexibility, cost advantages and an ever-growing number of solution services ([AWS offering pre-built fraud detection solutions for example](https://aws.amazon.com/fraud-detector/?nc2=h_ql_prod_ml_fd)).

Larger, more traditional corporations have been also making the move to cloud computing, albeit at a slower pace. This could be due to security hesitancy *(worries of hacks, leaks etc)*, legal requirements *(GDPR requires personal data to be stored in the same jurisdiction, FDA has stringent requirements for cloud usage)* or the right solution not available currently.

These barriers are reduced constantly as the sector advances, meaning take up of cloud becomes easier, and more necessary, as computing requirements increase.

Additionally, with increasing internet bandwidth and speed across the world, new cloud solutions also become more feasible. Take **cloud gaming** for example. Rather than having to build and maintain your own gaming PC, [Shadow](https://shadow.tech/en-gb/) provide a high-end PC to play with, streamed over your internet connection, all for a minimal monthly fee. Since the company maintain the infrastructure, in a few years time when more powerful PC parts come out, they will upgrade that infrastructure for you.

**Relevant Stocks**

* Amazon (AMZN)
* Microsoft (MSFT)
* Google (GOOGL)

No cloud computing list is complete without the 3 stocks above, between them and their services (AWS, Azure and GCP) they absolutely dominate the cloud market.

* Digital Ocean (DOCN)
* Salesforce (CRM)
* DataDog (DDOG)
* Cloudflare (NET)
* Twilio (TWLO)
* Dropbox (DBX)

# Clean energy

**What is it?**

Clean energy is useful energy that is collected from renewable, zero emission sources, most of which are naturally replenished on a human timescale, including carbon neutral sources like sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

There is a large crossover between clean and renewable energy sources, although they are not the same. Uranium for example is classed a clean energy source *(due to low atmosphere pollution)* but is not renewable.

**Why should I be excited?**

This one is pretty obvious, globally people are moving towards more sustainable uses of the Earth’s resources, to ensure we don’t damage the planet even more.

Governments are becoming more stringent with energy regulations, and companies are now measured by ESG standards *(Environmental, Sustainable and Governance).*

As clean energy technology improves, it will without a doubt become more widely used and adopted. It has rapidly picked up over the last year, accelerated by Biden being voted into power, and a funding frenzy meaning more capital is being pumped in than ever before.

This extract from the FT summarises the breadth of this sector well:

>From [new battery storage technologies](https://www.ft.com/content/fb1fa29b-7f2b-448b-ba47-05f16eccad97) to sustainable aviation fuel, lab-grown meat and low-carbon concrete, investors are rushing to put money behind [renewable energy producers and other companies fighting climate change](https://www.ft.com/content/0a3d0af8-7092-44c3-9c98-a513a22629be).

Michael J Burry has also recently gone in on clean energy, through Uranium holdings, [here is a good post discussing it](https://www.reddit.com/r/investing/comments/lj4w42/michael_burry_appears_to_shift_focus_to_clean/).

**Relevant stocks**

* URA
* URNM
* NLR
* ICLN
* TAN
* BEP
* Nextera (NEE)

The majority of these are ETFs, which would be my suggested way of investing into clean energy, given that most of the companies in this sector are still immature, and you would need to allocate a large amount of time into researching them to select the right one.

# Genetic therapy and genomics 

**What is it?**

Genetic therapy is an approach that uses a person’s genes to treat or even prevent diseases. There are several different types of therapy, such as replacing a mutated, disease-causing gene with a healthy version, getting rid of a mutated gene that isn’t working properly and even introducing a new gene into the body to fight off diseases.

**Why should I be excited?**

While still in very early stages, and likely to take the longest to develop compared to the other sectors I’ve discussed, this one can have tremendous pay-off.

So far, two therapies have managed regulatory approval, Novartis’ Zolgensma for spinal muscular atrophy, and Spark’s Luxturna for a rare form of genetic blindness. More are waiting their turn. To give you an idea of the magnitude of diseases gene therapy can solve, here are some recent developments:

* Earlier in the year, German scientists reported they were able to use gene therapy to [help paralyzed mice run again](https://www.republicworld.com/world-news/europe/german-scientists-made-paralysed-mice-run-again-through-gene-therapy.html). 
* Chinese scientists develop gene therapy which could [reverse the effects of ageing](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-genes-ageing-idUKKBN29P02V).
* Trials are ongoing with CRISPR technology to[ tackle leukemia and lymphoma](https://synbiobeta.com/crispr-clinical-trials-a-2021-update/)

**Relevant stocks**

* CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)
* Invitae Corp (NVTA)
* Sarepta Therapeutics (SRPT)
* Agilent Technologies (A)
* Editas Medicine (EDIT)
* Bio-Rad (BIO)

# Artificial Intelligence

**What is it?**

Artificial intelligence is intelligence demonstrated by machines, unlike the natural intelligence displayed by humans and animals, which involves consciousness and emotionality.

Artificial General intelligence (AGI) which attempts to emulate a more broad level of intelligence, similar to humans, is still a fair way away.

However, Narrow Artificial Intelligence (what most people refer to when mentioning today’s technology) which is good at performing a specific task, like [playing a game of poker](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/347/6218/145), or [faking videos of Tom Cruise](https://www.inputmag.com/tech/deepfake-videos-of-tom-cruise-show-just-fast-its-improving), has come on leaps and bounds, and is an area of both massive funding and development.

**Why should I be excited?**

AI has already become an integral part of technology solutions. Ranging from recommending Youtube videos, powering FaceID and enhancing photos to self-driving tech, property heating optimisation and trade execution optimisation.

Believe it or not, the technology is still relatively young, the first working deep learning algorithm being purchased by Google in 2012 *(oh, you don’t believe it was that recent?* [*read this article then*](https://www.wired.com/story/secret-auction-race-ai-supremacy-google-microsoft-baidu/)*).*

There is still a tremendous amount of potential to be gained from AI algorithms, with uses in pretty much every industry imaginable, from manufacturing, to health care and social media.

**Relevant stocks**

This one is trickier than you think, lots of companies use AI, but there aren’t many *pure-play AI* stocks, especially since up and coming technology tends to get purchased by the big players at early stages.

ETFs in such a fast moving world would be a good option in this case.

* IBM (IBM)
* Palantir (PLTR)
* Baidu (BIDU)
* C3.ai (AI)
* ARKQ
* IRBO

   * Important notes: this stock is undervalued compared to peers IMO, especially considering their \~$80B in revenue and P/E of 13 | AMD and NVDA sit in 70's with $10B in revenue
* TSMC (TSM) - world's leading foundry with notable technology and industry customers ranging from NVDA, AMD, Apple, and automotive players
* Applied Materials (AMAT) and KLA Corp (KLAC) - leaders in metrology and lithography capital equipment that the above semi players (and Samsung) rely on for manufacturing
* ASML (ASML) - no semiconductor list would be complete without ASML as their near monopolies on EUV and overall lithography (circuit printing technology) have made them an absolute must in any semiconductor fab moving forward. There's already waiting lists for their $120M lithography machines into late 2022/early '23.
* AMD (AMD) - Intel's recent product gaps have given AMD time to step up. Even with the new leadership at Intel, it's unlikely that they will maintain market share dominance to the same extent over the next decade, and that's a massive available market for AMD to continue growing within.

03/29/2021,stocks,"Mentions Gene Editing but fails to mentions Base Editing and one of the major players behind a prime editing therapy for sickle cell anemia and progeria: Beam Therapeutics ($BEAM). And why do I think Beam is better than CRSP and any of the other players? They have sole-proprietorship over deaminase-mediated base editing. For those in the know, that’s extremely bullish

What’s base editing? I’ll keep it ELI5, but it boils down to replacing a single building block of damaged DNA rather that multiple locations (gene editing). By focusing on a single point, you have greater ability to build a protein that edits that specific spot. In the case of prime editing as a whole, there’s less bystanders and less miss-edits versus some of the therapies CRSP and EDIT are attempting.

Jan 4. Next."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That's what I'm basing my analysis off of. With countless content services that have subscription fees, making it more like cable people are trying to save money where they can. So out of Amazon Prime, Netflix, Disney+, HBO Max, or Discovery+ ($60 a month in subscription cost all together) if you had to choose 1, you're going to choose a service that has good entertainment. Amazon, Netflix, Disney and HBO all have a healthy library of old stuff and pretty good new stuff.  
Discovery has 11 seasons of Gold Rush. How many times can you watch American Chopper reruns? Property Bros?   
People are looking for value for their money. Discovery doesn't offer that. The programming Discovery puts out is to pass the time - you're right it is great for background noise. Watching the whole MCU however is an experience. Basically it comes down to this: if you're going to spend $70 a year on one subscription would you rather have Disney or Discovery?  
Disney."
03/29/2021,stocks,Oh fair enough
03/29/2021,stocks,"Netflix and Disney are must have for new content. But they are both spending ridiculous amounts of cash and it’s only going up as they battle it out. Netflix is at $19B a year for programming. Disney cut their dividend and still won’t spend as much as Netflix, yet.

Discovery doesn’t need to spend that much. So they can keep their price point lower and still make money. People really do enjoy the new content from Discovery’s channels. Don’t underestimate the need for background tv and the replay-ability of their shows. 

Discovery+ wouldn’t be most people’s first choice but for $5 it’s an easy second add-on. It’s sticky too. Nobody is going to cancel something they throw on almost every day to only save $5 per month. 

The current market cap is $20B, they have $12B in equity, and they generate $2B per year in free cash flow on $10B in revenue. Discovery is at a good price now."

Valuations of most Canadian lps are pretty bloated. MSOs are making money hand over fist compared to them, yet insanely have similar valuations.

When Gamestop reversed course due to Ryan Cohen/Blackrock intervention and promotion of the stock by Keith Gill, the stock rose and forced a margin call on Melvin.

However, the reported SI is still over 100% float; and it is *suspected* by the proponents of a GME squeeze that the hedge funds holding shorts have been shorting to cover shorts and hiding these shorts through various means (dark pool trading, abuse of reporting windows to cover synthetic shorts, etc).

Covid crash was the most predictable crash in history.  Unfortunately, it was a once in a lifetime chance."
03/29/2021,stocks,"That's a simplistic view on trading and your anecdotal evidence doesn't offer much proof. 497 stocks of the 500 in the S&P went up since March last year. It literally doesn't matter what approach you took. You would have made money so making money doesn't prove you have a good strategy. 

The target is to buy stocks which have a lot of potential growth in price. This can be achieved by purchasing undervalued stocks in companies with good fundamentals, purchasing companies that have obvious and confirmed growth potential which will push price up an appropriate amount that makes them profitable - OR a combination of the two strategies. 

You want to make real money, buy undervalued stocks with growth potential. 

Your Covid crash example is a bit silly. 

People literally made money because they ""timed"" the market. It crashed, they thought it was bottom or near bottom, bought stocks and made money. Or people like you held as increased retail trade volume pushed prices until they were overvalued."

""Don't time the market"" is bad advice just like ""stocks always go up"".

Ostensibly both are very valid ideas to understand. How you use those ideas is what's most important.

Trying to time the market by doing a day trade on a volatile stock based on the fact that you think a merger is happening this week = dumb.

Trying to time the market by selling off your stocks and hedging cash while buying inverse ETFs when you recognize overwhelming evidence that a correction is coming = smart.

Just buying stocks and holding them forever isn't a nuanced approach. Oddly, people take this weird pride in it like holding is brave or a testament to character. It becomes emotional which is deadly.

I find all that very puzzling. The NASDAQ has had more down days than up days over its history. People want to restrict making money to half of the time instead of all of the time. 

I'm not a bear or a bull. I'm a guy who does what is best to make money. Sometimes that's buy and hold, sometimes that's cut and run.

I will never argue with someone taking a buy and hold approach to companies with proven value or potential. But I can't agree with the ""stocks only go up"" ""don't time the market"" mentality."

It seems, based on your own examples, that active stock picking with a very long time horizon is more dangerous *if you pick stocks that are doing very well right now*. If you assume Amazon will be around forever and just park your money there for 20 years, by your argument, this is a bad idea. But buying a newer company that you are very bullish on over a longer time horizon may not be a bad idea precisely for that same reason. It's the difference between betting on Sony in 1999 because ""the Walkman is everywhere"" vs. betting on Apple in that same year because you see it as the future."

Have you had any losses at all within the last 30 days?

Investopedia: 
“A wash sale occurs when an investor sells or trades a security at a loss, and within 30 days before or after, buys another one that is substantially similar. It also happens if the individual sells the security at a loss, and their spouse or a company they control buys a substantially similar security within 30 days.”"

And how long have you invested such that you can now evaluate your ""long term"" plays? Unless it's been a few years, then you're in no position to evaluate how good or bad your LT plays are yet unless something material changed to your investment. 

As far as old school stock investors, at least for me, the market has been generally the same. It's just now more people have ways to communicate and show off and you see some interesting results like the GME/RKT craze, but those don't really influence nor make a lasting impact on the much larger market.

If there's one big change in investing from 10 years ago, then it would be just how cheap or free it is to make trades and invest for retail investors.  Everything else has been the same."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I know ""market manipulation"" is all the rage right now. However, the manipulation is nothing like it used to be. It of course still exists, and probably will forever.

You'd just say your company made whatever you felt like. Heck, insider trading used to actually be legal. You'd have a ceo literally dump all his stock before bad news would hit. Wall Street is as clean as its ever been. 

Further, most people here seem to ascribe ""market manipulation"" to ""something I don't like or understand."" Stock goes down = ""market manipulation."" Incompetent news organization with shallow analysis = ""clear market manipulation by the hedgies."" Idiots with false bullish DD about GME, which actually is very close to the definition of market manipulation = perfectly normal discourse.

03/29/2021,stocks,"If history is any indication, it's NAT that will once again gain meme status. Not sure other tanker stocks did the same type of multiplier increase.

03/29/2021,stocks,"If you buy 1 million shares you also sell 1 million shares. You say increase in demand. But there's also an equale DEcrease in demand. Someone is dumping 1 million shares too, don't forget that. So in theory they should cancel each other out. On the open market all kinds of silliness might happen but on the dark pool not so much.

You say buyers get a better price, but then the sellers get a worse price. But also if the seller sold 1 million shares the buyer would get a much better price. See how both are happening at the same time?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"unfortunately it has traded sideways for 6 months - losing 1.5% value. As tech pulls back a little, why do you think a P/E of 75 is sustainable when all big tech is 18-35 p/e?"
03/29/2021,stocks,An economy is not a zero sum game. Nothing is stopping lenders from shorting instead. They chose not to do that because the risk of lending is much less than the risk of shorting.
03/29/2021,stocks,"I agree an economy is not a zero sum game.  
But can you argue this is full economy? In a full economy, people produce things and, ideally, they win, distributors win, retailers win, etc. 
But I see this as more like a casino - no production, just a fixed number of chips on the table. 
How am I wrong?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"When your broker recalls your shares the shorting shareholder has to give back your shares. So he has to buy them on the market. And whoever sold these shares - their fault cause they can't vote anymore. Also the price would increase and so on..., right?!

The less sellers at that moment, the faster the price increases. But I think its almost impossible that you lose your voting right, because there is always someone selling.

And even if you would lose your vote. The increase in price would be so strong that this could actually be a catalyst. And that's what we want."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Sorry to disappoint, but it’s nothing as exciting: over the months after the Corona crash I wrote OTM VXX puts at “low-points”, let myself get assigned when expiring ITM, and kept the position, waiting for another significant volatility event that never came, despite all direct volatility thanks to the world shattering events that happened out in the real world. Add to that loss aversion, which makes any little small bad thing oh so much worse."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I was in a similar situation where I had a large influx of cash and needed it in the next 6 months for a down payment on a house.

I floated the idea of putting that money into mutual funds for short term to my financial advisor and portfolio manager. He advised against it, stating that he wouldn’t risk it at all seeing as it was needed in the relative short term. 

I took his advise and glad I did, considering what the market across the board has done in the past few weeks.

If I were you I would just pop it into a high interest savings account. The market is volatile right now and seeing as six months is not exactly long term, it’d be a risk to put it into the market. 

If I were you I’d also pay some debt off. Again, if it were me, likely not all at once to keep liquid cash - savings and the investments and build. It’s a good way to build a nest especially if you have regular income to cover monthly loan payments. My 2 cents."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Hey I really appreciate your input, it's great to hear from someone who had been in a similar situation. I think what you're saying makes a lot of sense. After seeing all these comments and yours, I'm definitely leaning towards just paying off a good chunk of my highest interest debt and keeping a chunk as you've suggested. The HISA is definitely pretty high on my list of options now. Thank you!"
03/29/2021,stocks,"It isn’t “horrible for the environment” when you consider the opportunity cost. Do you think our current monetary structure uses no energy? Bitcoin has just made it very transparent in how much energy is used to process a transaction. Now, if we go add up everything from the processing power of a credit card scanner to the fuel used by an employee to go into a bank and look for fraudulent transactions and everything in between, you wouldn’t feel this way. 

I do kind of agree that if Tesla shareholders wanted in on bitcoin they could buy it themselves though, but if they do plan to accept it as payment, they will need a reserve to avoid currency risk. 

Also do agree that it isn’t currently feasible to be used for day to do transactions.. but likely will be at some point."

03/29/2021,stocks,"> genocide

idk about genocide but USA is a very seperated country compared to china. There is no unity within the usa cause of the different culture clashes. Within the USA, we have a few big issues going on now called racism, cancel culture, illegal migation. BLM and Anti-Asian are two main topics going on that I think the government should fix before getting involved in other countries matters. Mexcio border issues is a big issue, literally my tax money is going to illegals... These issues need to be fixed asap cause that shit is gonna kill our country."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I'm American and what I can say is that if you're worried about tax dollars supporting those who have illegally immigrated then I would hope you're just as worried about corporate welfare, because that costs us trillions every year versus billions.

How do you suppose the government should fix racism?"
03/29/2021,stocks,"Hmm Corporate welfare would be a different topic cause it’s like a balance, if the govt don’t give these breaks to these corporates, then there would be jobs for the medium class, it’s like you must give to gain. 

Illegal is a different story, you’re talking about if the govt gives over benefits to illegals, what is their gain for the country? Do we get more taxes or are we just feeding ppl? 

Racism can’t be solved cause USA is a broken culture clash country. Can see from it’s laws and system, extremely slow and ineffective which gonna drag down our country’s growth."
03/29/2021,stocks,"Is it a balance though?

The middle class is shrinking and corporations continue to get bailouts and tax perks *and yet still* hide taxes off shore or in tax haven states.

It would seem a one sided relationship there.

The US needs immigrants. Our birthrate doesn't replace our population. That's a huge demographic crisis waiting to happen. Honestly if it weren't for some of the ""Free Trade"" agreements the US has signed and all the meddling in Latin America the US has done, they're wouldn't be such a mass of illegal immigration.

Like... what I'm getting at is, these are systemic problems. They aren't the problems of people seeking to feed their families or send a pittance back home so they can afford a roof."
03/29/2021,stocks,"I don't buy any of that. I'm consider myself middle class and i know that i'm paying more tax than 98% of americans.

Put this chart here, 95% of the taxes is being paid by 50k+ salaries individuals. Your assumption here is that USA should let illegal immigration come in and feed off of 95% of taxpayers money?

Yes, the game they released had great potential that was only realized by players modifications.

Either way it's not great. Might be the catalyst for a late January like market selloff before a rally in April as the window of weakness isn't closed yet but then again the Nikkei doesn't appear to give two ****'s right now and although the US and Europe futures are down, it's not really to the point of being noteworthy.

Tax hike means everyone in US lose big time, from stocks to jobs. Lose lose vicious cycle. The losses for every American especially those close to retirement will easily be 10x more than the worst case scenario for Texas electricity. Also very few Texas power grid event actually pays that much extra, now the tax hike is gonna cost at least 1 Griddy electricity bill for everyone with 401k and then some, with little to no benefits at all from the speculative spending bill. Infrastructure plans usually fail big time, spending trillions on it makes no sense. The US government is by far the worst large cap organization to be given money to. Deficit will always be there no matter how much they collect. Not only that, the building materials are all so expensive right now, they are just gonna ask for 3 trillion more to even get them in place for their current plan, a big disaster waiting to unfold, Oh lord."

03/29/2021,stocks,"It doesn't matter what order you buy/sell.

The IRS sees that you bought shares at 3 distinct times, and 2 of those times qualify as ""previous 30 days"".

the wash sale rule says that if you sell at a loss, and you bought additional shares any time in the previous or next 30 days, you can't claim the loss.

When you sold batch #1, you had already bought 3 batches prior to that sale. (This is the part that is probably tripping you up)

If you had bought all of those shares in one transaction (instead of 3), then you could claim the total loss without doing the special wash sale calculation

&#x200B;

simplified example...

You buy $40, $30, $20

stock is now $10, and you sell everything in 3 sell transactions.

You sell the $40 for a $30 loss. This $30 loss gets added to your cost basis of the remaining shares ($30+20)+$30 = $80 for the remaining 2 shares.

You sell the $30 for a $20 loss. The $20 loss gets added to your cost basis of the remaining share ($20 share) +$30 (loss from previous sale) + $20 loss here = $70 cost basis for the final share.

Now you sell the final $20 share for $10. and your net is $10-$70 (wash sale cost basis from line above) = $60 loss.

so in the end, the loss is correct, but the order they add/subtract is not what you're used to."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Tax cut have always been a MAG policy, nothing to shill because past 6 decades proved they are very effective and the mass majority of people see huge gains from it. Nearly every politician love to do them until now. Tax hike is the biggest shill policy as government is by far the number 1 large cap organization with the worst credit score. Losses mount no matter how much money they get for years with very little to show for. If a company or any individual is asking for a larger sum of money every year with shills talk about how their big plan is gonna help everyone, yet their track record shows every spending project ended up way over the budget, they would be laugh off and be considered as scammer. So you are the shill here, still shilling for tax hike and let the absolute worst organization in handling money to get more money."

03/29/2021,stocks,"I did the same as you, though fewer shares because I'm overly cautious. Sold half at double to recoup my initial cost, rolling on with the rest."
03/29/2021,stocks,I’m a medical student and first heard about the drug during my rotations a few months ago. Started reading into the science and the studies and saw some things from smarter people than me who were already in on lenz long before and was convinced it would be a good play! Results today were very encouraging!
03/29/2021,stocks,"Very bullish!

54% relative reduction on the primary endpoint for mITT population vs. SOC population is very encouraging, imo. Still waiting the full results of the study and secondary endpoints which I'm interested in seeing. I thought the price would consolidate higher after a good P3 results so I think there's room to go (or I'm wrong haha!)

Now, HGEN also suspended their ATM sales agreement w/ Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. and are issuing a public offering of 5mil common stock shares. Looks like they are gearing up for manufacturing by acquiring some $$$

The big ticket is EUA authorization for use of Lenz and this is the next step

Things to look out for ahead are the rest of the P3 results being released (like secondary endpoints for ex.) and chatter re: FDA meeting, EUA stuff, ACTIV-5 trial update, talks with governments, partnerships. I expect to see a lot of positive news in the future, but if some of this is negative then I'll consider selling earlier for sure"

03/29/2021,stocks,I didn't say when lol. For OP only.
03/29/2021,stocks,I bought another 40. Missed it when it dipped to $20 today for a bit but I'm still up with 2nd batch too. I just don't know how long to hold for. This is my play money & I'm so new at this I don't know what I'm doing.
03/29/2021,stocks,Are you continuing to hold?

03/29/2021,stocks,"Maybe GME HGEN is an anagram for something. Congrats on the 50% so far today. I bought a little before the announcement and more right after, I'm hoping for a big day, but I will keep holding this. When the emergency use is approved another big spike."

03/29/2021,stocks,Seems like it.
03/29/2021,stocks,Lol I feel so stupid. Well hope you guys all go to the moon!
03/29/2021,stocks,"Yes. The big ticket is FDA approval. This phase 3 study was very promising... 54% reduction in the mITT population for the primary endpoint vs. SOC is very encouraging. I thought the price would consolidate higher based on a good P3 study alone so I think there's room to go yet or I'm wrong. You could sell now for a nice profit (personally I think this would be a mistake) of course but the dream 5-10x profit scenario is if the drug is EUA approved.

03/29/2021,stocks,"> This is indicative of the complexity involved in creating several algorithms that all contribute to the decision making process. Seamlessly blending micro and macro level decision making processes that encompass every scenario is proving to be very difficult.

Interesting takeaway. There have been noticeably less proofs of concept. Which that would explain why there hasn’t been more expanded efforts to push testing to a larger bubble. 

> We still haven't defined how should the car should behave when one or more of its systems either can't be relied on or is unwittingly providing bad information.

Working in robotics this exact issue reoccurring. My bias on computational limits is sometimes these problems can overcome by introducing an additional classifier. Most of the time you’re 100% correct. It’s a complexity issue. Especially when the regulating algorithm fails.

I appreciate your time. It was naive to only claim it’s a computation problem when it might simply not be presently even possible to interweave a whole network of classifiers a to make the process viable in a variable environment in the first place. But assuming you’re speaking to an audience that’s overselling Tesla’s fanboy rhetoric it’s easy to point out in present state an FSD would require a Titan X (if not a few in addition to a massive CPU and several other cost prohibitive sensor). Still will heed your advice and stay within my lane of research.

> Its one of those things that would have been true if you were talking to literally 99.99% of the population, but by sheer horrible luck you just happened to be talking to someone in that 0.01%.

03/29/2021,stocks,Thoughts of SMH vs PSI? Apologies if this has already been discussed.
03/29/2021,stocks,I prefer SMH over PSI due to the ER. But if i was buying back in or for the first time id buy SOXX. Slightly higher ER but similar performance. However SMH is very heavy weighted in TSM but SOXX is more evenly weighted.
03/29/2021,stocks,Thanks and agree. Also looked like SMH went Intel and PSI went AMD in top holdings.

03/29/2021,stocks,"It hurts, but this is why I am an advocate of deep due diligence before buying a stock. Pore over the financials, annual statements, management outlook, industry trends, risk factors and company specific risk, and formulate your own value target based on these fundamentals. That way, even when the stock goes down, you’ll know the fundamentals are sound, and everything else is just near term price action shenanigans. 

I also personally feel that many of the tech names are going to stagnate in the near 1-3 years because of the insane run up and disconnect from their fundamentals, which may also be disproportionately weighing down your portfolio."

03/29/2021,stocks,"Yeah it's for real and the same thing happens to me. My capital gain was well over 150k despite me making 45k from actual trading

My go-to ticker was tesla traded all year long without 31 day pause.

The article is wrong - you need 31 days and 61 days to be or 31 days and after 31 days 
in the same year. 

This was what my new trader cpa told me.

800k that's stupid man - if he only makes 45k irs will give him a break or they may not. 

My tax attorney told me IRS does not give you a break if they feel they can collect from you in your life time.

So if you own home that has equity they will force you to use the equity to pay for it.

All I gotta say to new traders is have a 31-day gap in the year you have a wash sale on a ticker and don't trade that ticker in January of 2022 - that's it...

Simple rul but a lot of us missed it.

FYI: trading volume doesn't matter. You can trade 500M and have 0 profit.

How? Buy 300 shares of tesla in and out 10 to 20 scalps a day,, and you've already hit 3.9M in volume....
