04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, big things in store for MVIS. I bought in way too high so I sold at the peak on Wednesday for a small profit, but have been buying back in slowly and averaging down before this company absolutely explodes"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm all in on MVIS with 11,000 shares. I am now looking to add more since I sold off some of my boring value stocks like Restoration Hardware and CAT that gave me extra powder. I‚Äôm more than happy to be 100% MVIS in my portfolio but I hate to ruin my $7.20 average by adding now... fuck it. Adding more Monday. April is going to be EPIC"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When a buy out is announced, it‚Äôll be to late."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great writeup! You may want to add Russell reconstitution in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices from what I can tell -- it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several. 
-- A long, long, long-time MVIS long. Like 21 freakin years!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought...no I chased it the other day at 18 like an idiot but glad I did. Only 10 shares but I‚Äôll average down and see what happens.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write-up. I would just change ‚Äúinfamous‚Äù to ‚Äúfamous‚Äù or even ‚Äúlegendary.‚Äù

‚ÄúInfamous‚Äù means something bad happened but what /u/s2upid did in that video was the complete opposite of bad, which is what I‚Äôm sure you meant to say!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This was one of the stocks attacked by Hindenburg. Pisses me off. They just attacked $RIDE with a bunch of false claims. Hindenburg is literally technically incompetent. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/47545695-high-tech-stock-review/5535965-technically-incompetent-short-seller-hindenburg-makes-false-statements-microvision
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write-up! I recently wrote an article on LinkedIn Pulse about MicroVision's LiDAR potential and the ""famous"" teardown video.

If you read it and like it, click the Like/Comment/Share button and let's help spread the word about this cool little company and its amazing tech. They've been innovating for decades and it would be great to see them finally get the attention and recognition they deserve."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to see a fellow supporter.... I have been buying since May as well. First on the 4th... discount on the 8th... .5795/share
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I want one and as many stocks as I can buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Farhi retiring from the BoD is a huge indication that a BO is done (or close) I wouldn't stop baby sitting my 9 plus million shares with out being totally confident that my investment is secure. 

Also Oz isn't working for free!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just got in for 100 shares yesterday, and thinking about just fomoing with the rest of my small dry powder stores next week"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ARMY/IVAS contract is worth $22 BILLION. That‚Äôs one customer. A huge customer, but it shows you that this product line is worth so much more. And MVIS is the secret sauce that powers it. Here‚Äôs a quote from the hololens creator, Alex Kipman:

‚ÄúBefore Microsoft started using MEMS technology, some executives believed it would be many years before the company could improve the HoloLens field of view. ""It was a significant engineering problem,"" said Zulfi Alam, a general manager who worked on the displays and screens of the HoloLens

Kipman called the new approach a ""miracle.""‚Äù

Yes, they are referring to MicroVision‚Äôs MEMS Display engine. 

In simplistic, but logical terms, let‚Äôs think about the market cap. The entire company is sitting at a $2.5 Billion value. There is a $22B deal and so much more to come in future sales from HL2, that MVIS gets a percent of with zero cost of goods sold. Now on the LiDAR front, we have LAZR valued at $8B. MVIS is dropping an ‚ÄúBest in class‚Äù A-sample with better capabilities and specs at a very cheap cost of under $1,000 per vehicle. And with those two verticals... $MVIS still has a market cap of only $2.44 Billion. 

Not advising anything, just dropping what I know."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done. This company is such an underdog and I love it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Life changing tech. Life changing stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,best DD I've read in a while

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great writeup, summarized all the key points I knew and gave me even more that I hadn't caught.
I'm still small time, but I'm in for 140 shares, might buy more next opening because of this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck it, I'm in!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Bought about 2.3k shares on Thursday @ 15.28.

I don't have much to add in terms of info, but can say if a bidding war starts between giants list Microsoft and Google, the prices it can reach is literally in the moon lol. My brother is a brilliant software engineer and even before he finished army here in Israel (in the famous 8200 unit), Google, Facebook, Apple and more were all chasing after him and the salary offers he got were crazy and was funny to see from the side, so I can only imagine how it will be with MVIS"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This was good quality DD sir. Might grab some shares on Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in with 3000 shares at 17.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great post üëçSummarized very well. Crisp.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on MVIS, I believe it is one of the smartest investments going into April where the A Sample Demo is expected to be announced any day... could go $40-50 by the end of month, triple digits this year or whenever the buyout takes place I believe."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. 150 @16.00
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been chasing VR as my pack horse but apparently AR was the thing.  Boy do I wish oculus had went public before the Facebook acquisition.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started buying sub 10$, wish i bought more when it was cheaper. Holding 4000 @ 15.5$ ready for takeoff."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, ‚Äúwe believe in mvis‚Äù and comments after, they have better tech than Luminar."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actual DD flaired as DD. Well done.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,MVIS is ready to explode upwards this month. Get ready
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing the same DD, and have posted on r/mvis ....this is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great company with upcoming Lidar presentation soon and after that ""THE MOON"" or ""Buyout "" i will buy some at opening.  Thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in for the buyout üöÄüöÄ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember when this was just a speculation play lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 20 MVIS yesterday, all that I could afford right now. The future looks bright for this company."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. 100 Shares and 15.00 C for august.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Better get in there and buy Mortimer buy!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Me with 75 shares ...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"2k shares at 1.81. Sold 500 at 10$ to get my initial investment back.

Hoping this will pay off my student loans and give me a sizable chunk of change to rely on in the future."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic investment thesis, I am expecting a giant green laser dildo and have all of my beans in one basket."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already in and looking to add more next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel bad for who miss out on this great chance of technology
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to options contracts in the event of a buyout?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This rocket is not even in the stratosphere yet, get on before it flies to the moon üöÄüåù"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought LEAPS awhile ago, working well for me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I just like this stock.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post, this company is set to moon."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the details and research.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 219 shares at an average of 13. Anything over 50$ a share and I'll have enough for a house deposit. Pipedream but fingers crossed a realistic one!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been on the fence about MVIS - but you glorious bastard convinced me, liquidating my shitty boomers for this come monday! Happy easter fuckers"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets, Been in since sub $1
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a student and I totally believe in MVIS, right now it‚Äòs 100% of my ‚Äûportfolio‚Äú and I put every money I can afford into it buying the dips. 
Holding 66 shares right now since 2 months. Not that much but in case of a buyout it would be a little fortune to me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I knew this company existed last year. Would‚Äôve scooped up some shares for less than a dollar each. Oh well...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chiming in cuz ~~skynet~~ i mean palantir has their hands in everything, maybe. (Note, rehashing from a vid i watched cred goes to that ape for the seed for making my brain wrinkle)


So MVIS creates all the hardware and MSFT is the front company doing the software right. But PLTR has a hand in analyzing the data, which is already in a controlled VR environment. Imagine how easy it would be for them to utilize their scalability model to sell more programs to the military this way. 



Pos just PLTR shares no options
Liking MVIS on monday"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,remindme! 3 months
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got this at 1.92 for no other reason than it was cheap and in seattle. (Local to me) sold at 22. Really wish I had bought more than  21 shares lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The price target according to cnnmoney is 25 cents lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own some MVIS to sell ccs on and short puts when it sells off. But 2 things: 

1) Blackrock buying MVIS means literally nothing they are one of the largest asset managers in the world, primarily run passive funds, and own every single stock. (They own iShares which is IWM etc)

2) short volume doesn‚Äôt equal short interest so for fucks sake can everyone stop repeating this stupidity?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,KOPIN anyone ?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD my fellow ape.  This is the way üôåüèºüòéüíéüöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gfg!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Might buy some after Gamestop MOASS
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A general counsel doesn't step down because of an incoming acquisition. They would be more important than ever. No target company is going to allow their acquirer to negotiate legal for them. What?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm Warren Buffett and this stock is overvalued.

EDIT: I'm getting downvoted for being Warren Buffett?!?!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it‚Äôs very tempting to do that based on the Fibonacci retracement golden zone, but at this point I‚Äôm just buying the dips. I don‚Äôt want to risk being caught in transition when the A-Sample or buyout PR drops, which could literally be any day now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All in club üíéüôåüíéüöÄüåô
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Based on all signs I expect a buyout is already being negotiated and I would expect we may even see an announcement in the next few months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late for what? It will already be priced in? It hasn‚Äôt been announced yet so now is a great time?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to the stock if the company is bought out? Are you supposed to sell the stock before the merger?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep yep
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great add, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In a month from now you‚Äôll be laughing. Lots of great value increasing things on their way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Updated to legendary, thanks for the suggestion! Sometimes I use infamous in a positive connotation but you are correct it is technically a negative connotation historically. Ie I could care less vs I couldn‚Äôt care less haha... Cheers and BOL"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're literally the reason I know they exist. Heard they attacked a company that really didn't deserve it and wanted to look into it myself. Looked at their chart and was like ""maybe they deserve it"", then looked at their company vs market cap and was like ""holy fuck!"" then bought some at 6.50 and averaged down as it consolidated further at 5.50"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing article, thanks for sharing."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great read! Thanks for sharing!  Liked :)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice! Yeah I currently hold ~13,300 shares in Roth and brokerage and 93 calls/LEAPS. LFG"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"First jumped on MVIS last year at around 0.20, been adding to my position with any available powder. The last few months have been exciting. Let‚Äôs go MVIS!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,BAFF!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomski üí•
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fomo'd in at 22 about a month ago and have been averaging down. they have a lidar demo this month, this will cement them as the top lidar company.   


Since other lidar companies are trading at a hiring price, the MVIS community expects a big jump in stock price. There are also other verticals like their partnership with Microsoft in producing the hololens2

&#x200B;

wording is hard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm HOPING to hop in for around 2k shares Monday. As long as it stays nice and calm before then lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs crazy how undervalued they still are... my price target is $150/share... $70-100/share just for the auto LiDAR vertical (Our next closest competitor Luminar is currently valued at $8.5B and they were $10B pre-correction).
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, life changing for sure!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt regret not buying more. üíéüôåüíé
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US! ONE OF US!! ONE OF US!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true. I suspect Google is ahead in this race and may already have a deal negotiated, but it would behoove the other tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc.) to not lose out on this treasure trove of IP. They could try to force a hostile takeover buy acquiring a large % of retail shares at high limit sells... who knows, whatever happens, it‚Äôs good for us :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, you‚Äôll be glad you did!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I hear ya. I bought 3200 @ $1.50, been accumulating up to +13,000 today but would‚Äôve have been nice to buy more back then! üíéüôåüíé"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually an under the radar talking point. Seems kind of out of left field if you didn't know what MVIS was capable of. I LOVE this from Kang.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added, thanks brotha"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The will skyrocket based on the skyrocketing share price and can be sold for massive profit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price share will move up to just below the buyout price and hang there until the deal closes. If your strike is below the buyout price, you make money, if it is above the buyout, you lose. As of now, the highest strike is $35. You should be rolling in it. Holding 140 May, August, and Jan 22 calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This post right here! What'll happen to call options? My understanding is that if they jump into ITM status when a buyout share price is revealed then the calls could be sold for beaucoup bucks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LFG
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LFG
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added /u/WrathofKhaan as an approved submitter. Hey OP, mention any crypto, SPACs, or stocks under the market cap lower bound (1 billion) and this will be revoked."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice average, party on your yacht :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight is 20/20. It was also a riskier investment last year as they had much less cash runway. Sumit Sharma has guided the ship beautifully. You can‚Äôt change the past but you can still benefit more by increasing position now, that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing all along the way."

And read #8 in this amazing article - https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the OP means that the general counsel sees the writing is on the wall and he will be canned after the merger

I agree though the existing company wants the GC through the merger and would give them stock options/ bonuses etc to stay on as they all knew the GC is gone after the merger

Now if the language is already agreed upon........."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless the deal has already been negotiated and just not yet announced...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No sir... you are Warren Broke
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, can you clarify your valuation for this gentleman? We need clarity, your opinions don‚Äôt matter üòâ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I‚Äôm just gonna sell like 20% at the next peak, and buy back in when it dips. That way it‚Äôs not a big risk, but should hopefully guarantee an increase in shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride or die to the MOONKSI!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you keeping or selling upon announcements
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or few weeks, that would be nice. üî•"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, agree now is the time to own. Anything under 20 I believe will double"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs definitely a great time to buy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They just mean it will be too late to buy the stock and profit once a buyout is announced
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the company or one of its verticals is acquired, the shareholders will be compensated either with stock of the acquiring company, cash, or a mix of both.  An announcement of M&A will cause the share price to moon, at which point you could either sell high or hold through the merger to get compensation. I will most likely hold depending on the situation, as there is massive value in not just the Auto LiDAR vertical, but also consumer LiDAR and AR verticals."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 1 Month
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck to you comrade, when one eats... we ALL eat. It‚Äôs been an insane ride but I‚Äôm bullish long term. Congrats to those who got in early... I thought I got in cheap haha."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, and well done!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch I'm in
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There may be a complication if just one vertical is sold off and shareholders receive compensation in the form of a special dividend. Not entirely sure what the best strategy for maximizing option value would be in that scenario, it might just be as simple as selling the calls if a dividend is confirmed and buying back in if you‚Äôre interested in their other verticals, but it‚Äôs worth consideration."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd also add that their IP could be worth a TON if properly implemented (which it looks like they're doing), but if the company faces liquidation then it's not worth very much at all. I see that as why their stock was soooo cheap last year while still justifying a higher valuation than their current price now that they have no chance of going under with such a massive cash pile relative to their burn rate.

(also I don't think people knew about the MSFT connection back then, or at least a lot less sure)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely agree they‚Äôre morons. Just thought it was funny not saying I agreed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No stonks on the moon, good call."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well put man ü§ô
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Any idea about tax implications for those buying now that would get compensated within one year? Curious if it is treated as short term gains.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you share with the rest of the class what lesson you learn.  So we don‚Äôt make the same mistake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No risk it no biscuit

Go big or go home

This is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When a special dividend is announced the share price would go up to include the dividend amount  plus whatever people value the company at, then on the ex dividend date the price would fall roughly the amount of the dividend."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, some knew but not nearly as many as today. Also, the automotive LiDAR vertical wasn‚Äôt as much of a focal point back then as it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, messing with you... I love conflicting opinions and devils advocates. I see you got downvoted, I went the other direction. I admire those who speak freely."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Full retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I plan on buying MVIS stock soon, what happens when there's a buyout? Never heard of a compensation, I only started investing a few months ago, can you give me more details?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think anything below $16 is still a discount. After the msft IVAS contract though it could be argued the new floor is at least double that üòÜ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the response. So it seems if you have calls and just one vertical was sold, you would have to exit your position to take advantage of a dividend once announced and just buy back in after the dividend was issued and the share price settles."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The downvote button isn‚Äôt meant to silence people for giving conflicting opinions but for weeding out low effort content that doesn‚Äôt contribute to the discussion.

If OC actually gave even a single insight as to why they think so then it may have been a worthwhile comment. But they didn‚Äôt so I see no reason to be upset over downvotes when used correctly.

Go ahead and admire bulls or admire bears, that‚Äôs how it should be, but admiring low effort junk doesn‚Äôt help anyone, including yourself."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will get compensated with with cash, stock in the acquiring company, or both."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy leaps I guess? Not really asking for advice just your thoughts. I‚Äôm definitely trying to play MVIS one way or the other
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Noswad27 knows!  Hope all is well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shortly after such an announcement there would likely be a pretty big run up as shorts and naked calls have to cover and that'd likely be the best exit for calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt remember asking for any help... this forum is for free speech. Who are you to dictate what is quality and not? I know... an egomaniac who has time to write a paragraph about something that doesn‚Äôt involve him üôåüèª glad I got you to get emotional and waste time writing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all the authorities have to give their okay w/ the buyout. After that we, the shareholders, have to vote on the offer. And after that comes the cash/stocks. So it‚Äòll take some time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when im holding calls like a degenerate?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've been buying jan 2022 $35 calls with profits from may $20 calls. Haha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not dictating, I‚Äôm explaining to you what the rules of the site you are posting on are because you seem to not understand them at all. But I guess it‚Äôs only free speech if you‚Äôre right, and when someone tells you you‚Äôre wrong suddenly you make fun of them for what they write? Lol, the irony..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop trying to silence me, sweetie :P"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls with a strike price under the buyout price per share moon. Calls with a strike price over the buyout price get fukt.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can always exercise your calls and hold shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably worthless if the stock can‚Äôt be bought on expiry, but I‚Äôm not sure."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks snowflake üôåüèª there‚Äôs plenty of others to downvote that don‚Äôt offer quality either. None of them seem to be impacted. Also, I make fun of no one... just point out the obvious."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The exact opposite, they moon as long as the buyout price per share is higher than your strike price, which in all likelihood it will be.

It‚Äôs also not like a buyout gets announced and then you need to make your decision ASAP. First there would be an M&A report, then the share price would shoot up to around it (and potentially exceed it quite a bit as shorts get squeezed to death) and then it would still likely be months until the actual deal goes through so everyone holding shares or calls will be in a great position with time on their side no matter what."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny how the only time I ever hear the word snowflake being used is from the biggest snowflakes themselves projecting it on to others. Enjoy your weekend and learn not to take life so seriously.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that makes sense, but what happens if the strike price is after the company does not exist?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rubber vs glue scenario... I used that in elementary school too. Stick and stones may break my bones but nosy people never hurt me. You know this had zero to do with you, that‚Äôs my issue. If people worried about their own business, we‚Äôd all be better off.

PS - I‚Äôm in a room full of people and we are all laughing right now. Breathe... mind your own business.. and learn from today.

Edit: Once again stop with the ego, don‚Äôt tell me how to take life. You just dont get it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll have ample opportunity to either sell your contracts for big profit or exercise them far before you ever need to worry about that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I‚Äôm sorry, I didn‚Äôt realize I stumbled into a private conversation, here I thought I was commenting on a public message board where I didn‚Äôt need permission on which matters I can and cannot comment on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but does that mean they stop writing options contracts after the announcement? What happens to the very last contracts?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So it went from needing quality posts, to being a public forum in the same thread... love the hypocrisy.

I love that you can‚Äôt stop responding, you‚Äôll be thinking about this all day and night. Need to let it go."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A fraction of that money is going to roads and bridges. Plus it takes States years to plan and actually utilize these funds, like 10 years."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think this is the biggest infrastructure bill since the new deal, I guess you didn't read it either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll take look at the charts, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, that‚Äôs why all of these (relatively) dumped after the announcement. Buy the rumour, sell the news style situation.

At least that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm telling myself after getting burned on X FDs"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"skimmed it, that fucker is long and ape no read good"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean you‚Äôre almost all the way there, only 25% more to go!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are actually retarded for not unloading it when it was $14 last week.

At this point you might as well chase losses by selling and buying $SPY 0TDE's with what's left. Definitely don't baghold, those are 99.99% going worthless lol."

I'm looking at either $700-720 gap up to unload. There's heavy resistance at 690-700.  


What I've learned with TSLA is never become attached and hold on too long. If you see an opening, get out because there's more chance to get in lower and give you more time/room. Holding on to hope is what kills most trades"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my gourd!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock dropped because of uncertainty in the already-high delivery expectations. And then they beat them...

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,True
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Believe the stock will go lower. Hardly any short interest in the name. The delivery numbers are expected based on the annual 500,000 sales last year and the growth trajectory going forward.  So they sell 800,000 cars. They still deserve 1,000 Forward P/E .. How many cars do the other makers make .. This is just my feelin. Sell the news event."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I told you I‚Äôm retarded.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,for sure! I mean I wouldn't load up if I didn't see it going to $7xx
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It will have to reverse the downtrend. It has had all sorts of reasons to go higher. But valuation has it going lower. The move higher to $900 was fake based on WS front running the inclusion with an overnight duplicate algo trade. I watched it a few nights and it almost made me puke. My target is $420
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I meant options bro, not actual shares. When it comes to shares yea lmao hold the good ones until moon"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the beat YoY delivery numbers by 108%. Which mean with CURRENT production they'll hit 1M. Except Berlin and Shanghai is going to go online soon. 1M is almost guaranteed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that with their new production capabilities and new factories they will break 1M this year.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 1 day trend was down.  The 5 day trend is up.  The 1 month/6 month/1 year/5 year trend is up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the most interesting thing is that they won this contract in a month. Good for them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh cool! So +4%monday and then back to red for the rest of the week.  Yaay!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So load up on puts at open. Got it

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR stock keeps dipping because insiders including the CEO, Alex Karp, are exercising their options. They need to sell some shares to cover taxes which is putting a downward pressure on the stock.

This is good news for any long term bulls on PLTR as we can buy the dips.

Edit: I'm not a finance or investment advisor."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love how WSB and r/stocks has the exact same reaction to this: PLTR announced good news, guess the stock is going down.

It's like the anti-YOLO. If you're in PLTR, you need to be in for a long time, not for a good time. **Slowest. Orgasm. Ever.**"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has a ridiculous market cap of 40B. This would be huge news if it was appropriately valued. 

So this contract is worth 0.2% of their market cap...the value is only in the headline news."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I whopping $89M contract?!  That's unbelievable money!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a $1-$2 dip based on this news.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why there was a sec filing for 200 mil revolving credit. LFG!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally found some commonsense. 90mil to a 42 bil market cap is a drop in the ocean.

One contractor is 500k a year billing at $250 an hour so that's like 180 people over one year, or more likely 60 people over 3 or like 40 over 5.

Its actually a pretty small contract compared to other IT projects I've seen."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm going to assume you are either self employed or a low level associate. 

I‚Äôve been blessed to have RSOs and a good amount.

when you execute the RSO you have to pay taxes immediately on them like your paycheck you get from your job. 

You also have a date you must execute the RSO so he can‚Äôt sit on them for ever.  The media didn‚Äôt report how many shares he got but all he did was this.

1. Executed RSO‚Äôs, got a fuck ton of shares in pltr.  He owed taxes, instead of going to his bank account, he sold the exact amount of shares needed to cover the taxes and he KEPT the rest of the shares as shares.  If he paid 10m for taxes, he executed around 30m worth of shares. 

It already came out from PLTR Karps sale was to offset taxes for executing RSO.  

You learned something new today, maybe one day you will get high enough in a compant to get RSO and understand them from a financial point."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, imagine thinking people cares anything but profit. Also assuming this is ‚Äúbig news‚Äù for company with market cap over 40B. What is the margin from this contract?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It might actually have something to do with their own projections of 5B revenue by 2025 versus the current market cap of 42B.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody hates it it‚Äôs just fully valued. $40B market cap is very high based on their revenue and growth projections. Not sure why people can‚Äôt understand that. Valuation didn‚Äôt matter last year, now it does."

Their army contract is worth $460M... this is not about the size, it's about the client diversification. Think that PLTR does not spend a cent in comertials or public comunication, they just go and win contracts or get clients from other client's recomendation. It's not a big deal... but it's still a deal."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea and crytpo like ADA have a market cap of 40 billion but that doesnt mean it makes sense or is valued correctly. Bubbles exist

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought it and immediately sold it at open the next day, made a quick 15%"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it is valued just fine, it has shown growth every year.  You do realize that Karp looked at IPO back in 2018 and back in 2018 at 490m in revenue banks gave it a market cap of 40b back then.

Then Karp decided to not IPO yet.  There value is plenty fine, if they were not showing crazy growth it would be concerning but 30-40% projected growth over the next 5 years is solid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We have the hottest HR manager I‚Äôve ever seen.  She just oozes sex.  I told her I‚Äôm gonna marry her some day.  It‚Äôs not harassment if we‚Äôre married. *taps head*

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet she's a sadist since she works in HR.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the hell are you using Robinhood?!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please note that I did not post up to date graph because I have friends and family follow my account and they can go fuck themselves. I dont want them to know exactly how stupid I am.

Edit: I realized it's not clear but I sold. Realized the gains at 16$ a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to diversify üòâ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have the gains I just moved money out of robinhood and didn't save a screenshot of the big pp graph at the time. Just like the screenshot here the numbers are off because I didn't hold onto my plays I realized them. 


I also have losses too with screenshots. But for the full gains/losses I'd have to post buy sell history which looks ugly to me. 

The only thing I don't want to post is my YTD because of f&f. They bug me about wasting my money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Money is just paper. Real wealth is in Karma apparently.

I've always had really good fills, really good UI, really good options menus, etc. Is the only problem that one time they blocked people from buying meme stocks because their clearing House got overloaded? You realize almost every other broker also had to block it except for like 2 brokers world wide?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you‚Äôre showing selective screenshots to limit the amount of backlash you‚Äôd receive from friends and family while also trying to maximize the amount of validation and updoots you can get from a bunch of retards?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck do they ""follow"" your account?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep money doesn't make me happy. But karma makes pp hard.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RH first to start the wave. First to call back margin orders on it and last to remove restrictions on buying. I had some issues back with RH during March/April last year but January was the last straw. There‚Äôs plenty they‚Äôve done wrong before that if you wanna do a quick Google search.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats basically it. I dont want f&f to know exactly how much money i have.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how responsible boomer stocks like lumber and steel get hyped here now and then. It's the yin to the wsb yang
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just lumber. Building materials period. Builders are struggling to keep up with demand for new homes because it's harder and harder to get these supplies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since we are talking Canadian Lumber, what are your takes on Western Forest Products Inc. ($WEF.TO)?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I'd like to point out as a Canadian is that we pay ridiculous prices for the shittiest quality lumber that we cut and produce here at home, we take all the good stuff and sell it abroad. Also if you want to dig deeper look into 'J grade' lumber, it's wood we sell exclusively to Japan because they demand the highest quality and are willing to pay top price."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In my town a sheet of ¬Ω inch plywood used to be around $25-$30... Now they are $70....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, I've been thinking of getting into lumber recently based on some articles I've been reading but they are in the US. Do you have any thoughts on US lumber stocks?

So you are not worried lumber supply will go back to normal once mills open back up and people are taking on less projects?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I drive on the canfor roads from time

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How can someone in the US get in on this action? I own a bunch of Canadian stocks- not on the TSX or whatever but their American equivalents. Cant seem to find this one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good find and DD. Worth looking into. What are you thinking fair value is?

Is there a bear thesis at all? I did a quick skim on the interwebs and didn't see many people talking about this anywhere. The ones that are talking about it are bullish."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought lumber prices were high be because the wood was being diverted into disposable masks and other COVID PPE?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"my 2 cents:

1. are growth expectations not included in current price?
2. as summer comes and these corporations use futures/forward contracts, isn't the price going to drop in the next months (- check out seasonality). i'd pick up in October maybe? or at least wait a couple months?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Canfor looks good. Unfortunately no options since it‚Äôs Canadian

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I'm holding off on wood for a deck project, which leads me to another opportunity this summer may be TREX.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,shower bad or bunk bed bad?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can agree that these are boomer stocks but they did extremely well 2020 and they‚Äôre offering a lot of growth for 2021 and there‚Äôs lots of money to be made off of these. You gotta go with the sector that has a lot of momentum right now and it‚Äôs lumber imo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">	prefer to invest in nebulous tech companies with no discernible product or profit.

And offer clients booze, coke and escorts"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Brother in law is a lumber salesman. Husband is a truss salesman. Their commissions right now are obscene. They are the ones asking me and my sister to look into construction stocks to invest in.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are very late to that game.  That just eats into profits, not drive up prices."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can‚Äôt speak on it because it‚Äôs < 1 billion market cap, but check my post history I made a DD on that stock as well"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it‚Äôll last for at least 2021 cause a lot of these companies are booked and have work all through the summer. Even with supply meeting demand it‚Äôll take a while for things to get back to normal and for lumber prices to retreat to their normal levels. Keep in mind Q2 and Q3 lumber companies are doing the best in terms of revenue as that‚Äôs peak season. US lumber companies are seeing and will see the same growth as well imo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What motherfucker is wearing a wooden mask?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would have the price of lumber is jacked to the tits , am Canadian ape."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Demand versus supply actually. The demand is going up since home mortgages have cheap rates. On top of it, the wood supply is not catching up fast enough. A 10 dollar piece of wood now costs 7 times that"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôve switched almost fully to ICF builds, as they‚Äôre beating wood on cost, and offering a bunch of benefits. 

Trex could be a good play but unfortunately it‚Äôs reserved to deck boards and etc."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,don't forget to pay 5x too much for the property to build on.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just teasing. Commodities are exactly where you should be looking when you're expecting a downturn. I've had an eye on lumber myself but figured I already missed the boat.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am being serious though. Bark Beetles

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haven‚Äôt looked deeply into them tbh so i can‚Äôt recommend any but lumber as a whole is doing good so US companies should follow. Canada is known for their lumber though, and railways and oil."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can look at RFP. They've been on a solid uptrend for the last year. I think there's some DD floating around one or two of the subs in it. Probably have to look back a month or so which is when I first saw it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So buying a shit load of shares and a shit load of calls with no shorts is gonna make the stock drop? HOW do you think the stock market works?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah I was up close to 50 percent and I've got more in msft calls and charge point. Worst case I'm looking at a 75 percent loss and that doesn't leave me down enough to kill me.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My target for TSLA is $420 .. Ever hear of ""sell the news""?  The more cars they sell the more money they lose right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"More of a longer term play but I really like $UAL. Just announced they are resuming pilot hiring yesterday, and have a bunch of government $ through end of September. IMHO they are in the best position to profit from travel resuming of any big airline. Only question in my mind is how long it will take to open up international travel since that‚Äôs such a huge pet of their profit margins. I‚Äôm buying September calls on Monday"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$PYPL is $60 down from a 3 year high. That‚Äôs not a dip. It‚Äôs barely even a correction. That might be its new support but that‚Äôs hardly a buyable dip. 

$MP shows promise though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Customer service is hot garbage
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I absolutely concur. Soooo many people have been burned by PayPal that you can google for ""friends don't let friends use paypal"" and get tons of results"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With eBay ditching them for managed payments, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve used PayPal since."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao bro who hurt you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, like 2 elements of over 20. Not that vanadium isn‚Äôt useful, but it‚Äôs a complete side gig for them. Its just a byproduct of their method of processing uranium, afaik. I‚Äôd like to know if I‚Äôm wrong. TMRC is more of a competitor, but there still getting started . I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôre even a year into getting the round top processing  research underway. They‚Äôll be big eventually.

MP is also still a few years from producing the production usable products that would ease the shortage. Not really a short term play."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,and then drop down to 500 just to jump back up to 700 the next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We will probably see a move toward movie theatres that have fewer seats but include a menu and table service. Screenings of old movies and TV series will become more common since most new releases will be available online. Alcohol and GANJA will become huge sources of revenue.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The near/mid term cinema won't be making money sure, but the streaming argument gonna end up just like printer in the start of the internet, people tough they are gonna be worthless because with email and electronic document you won't need to print and send by post, but in the end it just made the use of printer even more intensive.

Same thing happened with radio and tv. I thing movie theater will make a huge comeback after covid, because even if you can watch anything on stream many people will still want the experience in a huge screen with surround sound and with other people just like music concert are always fully booked even though you can listen to the music anywhere anytime."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What leads you to believe they will likely dilute? There was a bunch of FUD and shitty headlines released yesterday but Aron acknowledged that retail owns the stock and the vote doesnt even take place until May 4th. Then another vote/shareholder meeting would be needed to actually distribute those shares.

&#x200B;

Edit i didnt do any of my own research, im just deep into AMC And need the confirmation bias this am with my crayon/coffee combo"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god this post didn't mention AMC then, huh."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,>i agree with you about their dispute resolution; also would be curious to see how many people here that bashed paypal consistently use venmo. i've noticed a lot of people forget pypl owns venmo...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought ER was pre-released. Seems there was a run up and it will back some to maybe 16.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already started....cliffs gonna be big all year
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is the SNDL of reopening stocks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is seeking approval from shareholders to have the authority to issue 500m shares if needed. I doubt shareholders will vote yes for this. And even if they do it doesn‚Äôt mean they dilute ASAP. They have the ability if they need capital. In all honestly it was probably a ploy to get a share recount done to see exactly where the stock stands in regards to synthetic shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I understand ‚Äúsell the news‚Äù, but Tesla is far ahead of anyone in the EV arms race and is proving consumer demand with this particular news. My Target for them is currently the moon üåô"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why do you think they are better positioned than other airlines?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used PayPal for everything online for the ""protections"" , over the years crazy amounts of money. I had one situation of fraud for like $600 and they couldn't be bothered to respond to me properly through the tickets, just auto rejections and stone walls and then eventually after me jumping through hoops just said no.  Did a chargeback on the credit card and haven't used them since, never plan on it again."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, and personally really miss the cinema, nothing beats a cinema night, popcorn etc but there will be competition from streaming and the big impact that has IMO is not on direct ticket sales but on the fees (not sure what they're called) payed by movie makers to cinemas, cinemas may end up with less of the profit pie."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why, while my investing strategy is nothing like the 'WSB vibe' (I wish everyone the best but I visit here mainly for the lols), my portfolio is pretty much 100% CNK/CINE/CGX/IMAX right now.

I'll go back to incredibly broad ETFs, but when I see an opportunity I want to seize it.

1. Going to the cinema is another experience of watching a movie

2. It's also an excuse to go out and meet friends - that's not gonna change

3. Even if some millennials have changed their viewing habits, there are still a bunch of parents that take their smaller children there

4. There are a bunch of hit releases coming up

5. This is one of the last industries to not ""fix"" itself post-corona. JETS is already pre-pandemic levels. With vaccines I believe we're at the end of this and it's just a matter of time.

* I am not suggesting betting on any one chain, but on the whole industry (excluding AMC which correlates with the GME craziness - personally not for me). Also, you may need to hold it for a year or more.

** Not advice, just my mindset."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I admit I may be a victim of FUD.. the truth is an alusive tendie. But, I think AMC will need more capital to see them to post pandemic times."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">Look at GME, AMC, etc."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Partial ER was pre-released. Full ER and guidance on 4/22. But ya, some of the hype was already priced in this past week. The SP might dip a bit to around $17-$18, but with today's jobs report and yesterday's ISM report, chances are outlook for CLF will be positive."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For sure. They make ~~balls~~ rolls of steel. Goes great with diamond hands.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs rough dude. Sold stuff through eBay for a long time. Got fucked over by two buyers in one week.

Finally got another person and they said ok we got you. Let me get your refund started. I‚Äôm gonna transfer you to our escalation specialist so they can finish it. It was the SAME LADY and she told me NO AGAIN even after the last agent said he was gonna refund me. I lost it. Never again.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"its okay, we all just apes trying our best. That is probably true though in regards to capital. I guess only time will tell, until then im gunna just buy and HODL cuz idk what else to do with all my nanners.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah. I was curious as to if there was a unexpected catalyst which could see a big jump in the current trading price since you commented on it being a Top Pick. So, nothing out of the ordinary growth then."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah, don't have any unexpected catalyst for you if we disregard higher than expected hiring data. 

Except for maybe TSLA, I don't see any unexpected catalysts for OP's top picks either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, TSLA and GME. Didn‚Äôt see anything yet about the others. Just asked about it since you mentioned it and thought I should look into it for some unusual options activity on when there may be a surge of buying."

It has just been a month of pain... down 15k. I know it can run up fast though and if they get more institutional investment things will ramp fast. I also think the GME mania will be good for signups in Q1.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly is PLTR working on AWS?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok - so here's what this may mean for PLTR stock.

When a company announces they partner with AWS, it means 1 of 2 things:

1 - they are going to host their product on AWS. Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.

Minimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.

2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).


Now - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.


How are #1 and #2 related?

Let's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). 

That said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.


What does this all mean for PLTR stock?

Nothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:

Job postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.

PLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)

Announcements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS

PLTR Announcing professional services/consulting 

PLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace


If one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.

I write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.

BTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD. Lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So wait is AWS partnership with PLTR a new deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such brilliant move by PLTR , springboard from government clients to global enterprise Via AWS ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like PLTR for the long-term benefits of integrating with a giant like AWS. I have built systems on AWS for almost a decade now.

My only concern with PLTR is that it's still overvalued today.  Maybe if we could get some real-time demos on PLTR tech I could change my mind short-term."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good DD other than it all being useless and not having a clue how AWS works, yes AWS is big and used by many companies. But what is the announcement about? They are just offering their solution to AWS users in an AWS optimized way, it is not becoming a core AWS service. Go to AWS Marketplace and you can find thousands of AWS optimized solutions by many companies that want you to integrate their product with your cloud solution and that are created in collaboration with AWS teams. This is like saying just because somebody posts their sudoku app on a Google/Apple store they have a a potential to make billions as app marketplaces are so widely used and bringing in so much revenue."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a good pitch for AWS, but can't find that ticker. I guess I'll just buy AWSL, has Solar in the name."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What does PLTR actually do?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AWS has made PLTR software solutions available to AWS clients.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You should check out SNOW LOL !!!! That piece of shit is overvalued
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Palantir Gotham demo: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=_NeFrUCqL0k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How is it over valued? And which method are u using to come up with a valuation?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do you know there‚Äôs a PLTR demo day this month?

Would be interested in your perspective."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The information is misleading. You can buy one PLTR module on AWS, it's not an integrated partnership. Even if your company is an AWS shop, the full suite of products aren't available. There's no simple conversion or integration."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah... im long PLTR too but all this means is that you can use their software on AWS...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This sounds like arrogant BS.

Comparing a trusted AWS offering with a Goog/Apple app shows how little you know.

Don‚Äôt buy the stonk.

Better yet..short the stonk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AWS means Amazon Web Services.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs a valued added services?

AWS native Ec2 is wildly popular . PLTR on AWS will enable it to gain global enterprise clientele 
Being on subscription it will have predictable revenue streams for PLTR too
PLTR is on the right track 

next is on PLTR  on azure ? Alibaba cloud ? Google cloud?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"42B Market Cap. to give you an idea that is almost X2 the value of VIAC with revenues of 25B compared to PLTRs 1B.

I don't think you need the smooth brains to figure out PLTR is all speculation, marketing, and spectacle right now.

give it 5 years and we'll see how well these comments age."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, what's the day? do you have to be registered?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you know this?

AWS wouldn‚Äôt offer PLTR if it isn‚Äôt a seamless client experience."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry if it sounds arrogant but reading the topic as somebody who works with AWS daily and has gone through some of their certifications it makes me cringe badly how severely you are misinterpreting what has been announced so far and what that means for PLTR. I like PLTR and I've held it for quite some time I think they have some amazing talent with some throat cutting hiring procedures to take only the best. But that does not change the fact that they will be one of thousands of vendors to offer their product for easy integration and licensing in AWS and taking it as some major milestone and they capturing 5% of AWS customers is beyond silly
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"what is that, internet for ants?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ERP...likely expanding to other data intensive applications...Finance, Marketing, Industrial Design, Production"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"bruh compare PLTR to other SAAS companies, not a media conglomerate lmao."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait wait. Viac as in viacom?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you compare two companies in two entirely different industries to prove your point?  Tech and growth companies tend to get higher valuations than a media company that has existed in some form or fashion since 1952.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And snowflake has been consistently trading at 200x+ TTM. These numbers mean nothing. If I‚Äôm honest, Palantir should trade at a higher premium than snowflake."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://palantir.events/doubleclick

yes you need to register"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll add that I am bullish on PLTR for their ability to win government data science contracts consistently and their partnership with IBM. A lot of companies use IBM consultants to advise on purchasing decisions and they clearly have some secret sauce that wins over government contracts that I don't have insight to.  


I should clarify that I'm not an IBM employee either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in the industry and have seen a PLTR demo while consulting for a customer. I am not a PLTR employee so this information may not be 100% accurate. How familiar are you with AWS and their offerings? My understanding is that:

  
PLTR is an AWS partner and uses AWS hardware for Foundry, but that is still purchased directly through PLTR and not instantiable in a private AWS instance

PLTR does have an S3 based ERP offering you can stand up on AWS. That's the extent of the partnership.

If you're an existing AWS customer, there's no new change to the adoption cost for palantir for anything other than ERP."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I also work with as quite a bit. Came here to find someone like you speaking some sense.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know business development.

Edit: I‚Äôm slightly retarded disregard this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked at a very similar company, Glencore, which is worth ¬£38b on ¬£142b in revenue, so on this basis PLTR should be worth $270m and my price target is $0.15. I have bought puts accordingly.

/sarcasm"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR was DPO so wallstreet is spreading hate and FUD meanwhile SNOW is okay at this valuation? Such bullshit and that's why I am long on PLTR, it's about time for it to explode to the moon ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may work in the industry and have AWS insights.

But, this is about a Business Development pipeline.

I know business development...and this is exactly how you turn prospects into long-term clients."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,u talk good for an ant
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you're right! VIAC and PLTR have been very volatile recently therefore they must deserve to trade at exactly the same revenue multiples. Margins they earn and expected CAGR be damned!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""a little bit"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Considering Palantir is a monopoly and trading at 40x TTM.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got VIAC call too. It better rebounce like Discovery!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on viacom too, but I'm not ballsy enough to go in on options. I think the stock price will eventually return to the $100/share levels, but it'll probably take months to get there based on the rate of growth for the share price in the last 6 months. I'm not expecting a quick pop. I think the stock price has reached its floor, +/- $4, so it'll start to renormalize to previous levels over time. The theta decay for short term options may not be good for a longer term payout...  


What am I missing that you guys see? Why aim for a 4/16 expiration date?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you plan to do with this account? Basically empty sitting with $37K cash?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, now go into your drawer and grab a 24 pack of crayons and indulge as it goes to the moon"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you not just let it expire?
I thought calls were only exercised if you choose to do so?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow!  What a retarded ape.  So awesome.  That was actually a good mistake to make; you actually did yourself a favor.  Consider it your Fairy GodApe looking out for you.  You will be thankful in the long run when you're on the moon. ;)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry u lost the intrinsic value on the contracts!! You will really like this stock üöÄüöÄ

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not the worst thing that could of happened to you lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought Robinhood would sell your option on the last day? Or I guess if your ahead they sell instead? Or they only sell if you don‚Äôt have enough $ to exercise?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unbeknownst baller status. That‚Äôs the real real
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No sell. Only buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A mistake with a big payout
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 150 shares at average 140 and you by far have the better deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a good deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, much like my birth this is a ""happy accident"".."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome aboard retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, you've already made money!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything under 200 is a bargain.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could have afford to forget I have $40K of cash in my account too @.@. THis is the way!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So big dumb stupid ape here. They expired and robinhood automatically made you close them with funds you had available? Is that just how it works? I'm dumb but I thought options expired and thats that. What would happen if you didn't have the money?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Next you‚Äôre gonna trip and fall into some 10/10 pussy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I have 5k, and I‚Äôm extremely confident a stock will show significant gains by EOY, can I buy options in that stock that will either make a Dick load of money or lose my 5k if it doesn‚Äôt work?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôre all learning... it‚Äôs fine. 

Ok we‚Äôre not learning, but that‚Äôs also fine."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre average cost is still less than mine daddy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than the guy the other day who accidentally bought $4m of SPY on margin by forgetting to sell/cancel his calls that were barely in the money.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool I don‚Äôt know shit about options, but I swear I read a highly upvoted comment that basically says you have the option to buy the shares, but you don‚Äôt have to, so if you don‚Äôt buy them the contract just goes away. Does it always just forces an exercise for buy/sell the shares at the end?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,*Oops*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oops üòÅ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"same here bruh..

my afternoon naps have saved my ass more than once... not to mention ....my naps have also been more than once had me waking up to me dancing like a school girl lol. One might say that my afternoon naps are goodluck ...lol

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"200 shares, if you sell them for a million each, you‚Äôll have a trillion dollars!!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's like saying,  I just tripped and my d**k happened to find it's way into that woman....üöÄ‚úãüíé"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Week done!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a good problem to have.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I read it backwards and was like--how did you get 185 shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you make some tendies, cuz when your wifes boyfriend finds out ,  The only ass your touching is going to be purchased upfront"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hate when that happens
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Help, I just accidentally a GameStop"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you‚Äôre in, I‚Äôm in"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we do an off exchange trade like the hedgie fuckers?  I will buy some offa  u at this price;)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yall really have been on WSB for less than 2 months huh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They would be exercised anyway if you had a real broker, and you would merely be on warned about a regulation T until you sell the shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve been selling covered calls and puts and it‚Äôs been earning me several Gs these past months. I used to own 100 shares at $40
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm just a smooth brain but I‚Äôd at least cover up your positions. They are collecting this shit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you call Robinhood they will be cool about it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the group GME.. So u sold out contract earlier?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It will all be worth it when GME crosses $200 and you make a FAT $3000 profit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry to hear that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You had the funds to exercise?  Clearly you are new to options trading. You will learn, just give it time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ey bro, what's your number? My wife keeps fucking nagging me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wow what would happen if you had insufficient funds to exercise them?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The classic Bart Simpson head pattern
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The benefits of not being that wealthy yet. My broke ass would have had them auto sell lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof. Dw, Ill take them if you don't want them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You're lucky as fuck it didn't close below 185 ü§£
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations. 200 tickets to the moon.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is something like $1500 ""fuck you"" money if I literally could have burned it and not cared...too much. Is that how it works or does it need to be a certain amount?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cries in one share.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong sub, going to be down voted... but this is a good opportunity to sell calls!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,can we hang out or something maybe I can just like do your laundry as you go about your business?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs ok.    Will be 485$ soon.    Retard.   üôåüíé
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Sweeeet""...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically speaking, if you let your option contract expire without funds to exercise, you have not met the requirements to fulfill the contract, and the broker defaults on filling your contract."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Boo hoo"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Even the computer likes the stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You probably lucked out with that bungle.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many shares of GME are you holding?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do ppl say hodl instead of hold? I‚Äôve missed that point entirely. Also YOLO LIFE BRUH hold!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"so this is what happens when an option expires, good to know"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Best mistake ever!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what‚Äôs the point of the option if you exercise it and have to pay the strike price? Am intarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You say that like it‚Äôs a bad thing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell calls on half and let the other half ride.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls and get that cost basis down to 0 üòÑ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dam
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice. If only you used a broker that actually purchased the shares so the stock price would reflect it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tfw your wife dumps her bf for this guy (feels good tbh)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy accident if I ever saw one
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He accidentally the whole thing...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," you'll most likely be able to sell a deep ITM call to cash out, don't sweat it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm so sad I don‚Äôt understand this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Either you got a ticket to the moon, or you wind up with a lot of losses to offset future gains. 

Good job!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing your part

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong, but even if the stock moves up just a little bit after exercising you make more profit than selling the contracts back at close."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you have 37k in an investment acct, betting on the GUARANTEED play. Don't trip you're gonna be rich af if you aren't already."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you're up why not just sale some off if you're not willing to risk that amount. Don't be peer pressure to hold for no reason.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now get out of RH and move to a real broker.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real atrocity here is that you have 30k in robin hood my friend.

If your trading 500$ worth go ahead use RH but if you got thousands in get a real broker better execution priority etc if your investing a decent amount its well worth having a real broker not rh who will limit you to selling or buying only when there hedge customers are getting railed by a squeeze etc

At the very least go with TD ameritrade there think and swim platform is good and miles ahead RH"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you're a billionaire üçæ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you don‚Äôt really own any shares because you‚Äôre still on Robinhood for some reason

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,STOP POSTING POSITIONS ugh.... python scripts running these threads and subs and giving hedgies knowledge. we all know they're fucked anyway but stop giving them information.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"But Robinhood tho.... 

That‚Äôs a no for me dawg"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you retards still on robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the millionaire family!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That tracks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha congrats ape with decent funds. How does it feel to be smooth brain like some of us smaller apes. Now we are all apes. Ape like ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,üíéüëê
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to start selling weekly covered calls for dumb otm strikes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question for you. Can I buy 4 call contracts at $200 of gme, wait till gme hits 1k, sell my 80 shares, than excercise my contracts with the 80k to have 400 shares?
Edit. Missed a 0"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Am still learning could someone please explain this to me. A guy buys a contract and guesses the price of the stock eg will be $185 (& pays for this) if he guesses right & wants to buy the stock what does he pay? Can‚Äôt be $185 each for the 100 shares as that‚Äôs normal value. What‚Äôs the plus side discount? Cheers
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically you're saying you had no intention of owning GME.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered puts and calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serendipity, it seems..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúForgot‚Äù don‚Äôt lie to yourself man, you never knew"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Who cares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,#so you put non-FU money in RH?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you buy half a call?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I can use the ‚ÄúI accidentally fell in it‚Äù excuse properly now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Purposefully didn‚Äôt post yesterday because I didn‚Äôt want it to be mistaken for a joke.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape real fools
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape real fool
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All of you are missing the boat on the OTC stock of the year EEENF. If you guys put 1 share of GME into this you are going to make more money off of it in the short term and possibly even long term and then you can come back to GME. Take your blinders off!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to r/thetagang
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Until the squeeze happens then you wish wouldn't have

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks in his sleep.  Officially invited to my sleepover.  üëÄ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Everyday an ape is born.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GD, that must have been a stomach drop before you realized you were moon or death."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well.... that‚Äôs a nice way to slip into the moon and become an accidental millionaire.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This might be the greatest accident you ever make.  That and your wife.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I fully support the stock"" = only owns the shares he accidentally bought.

Well now you're stuck with us"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately sell 2 covered calls on Monday for your strike price. Do it over and over until it gets exercised and pocket the premium
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be more kind to you, at least you got them at $185 and not $385. You could likely dump them at $200 first thing Monday before the weekly 100 point dip."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just accidentally made the best buy of your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll still never understand why someone with the capital to ‚Äòyolo‚Äô $37,000 is using Robinhood out of all trading platforms"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""This is not ""fuck you money i intend to play with""'

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls against your shares to lower your costs basis. You're good.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,extremely new dumb ape here and this helped me understand what not to do with call options!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My, what big balls and diamond hands you have"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's meant to be..

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Smoothest of brains I‚Äôve seen!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy negligently fucks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the stock goes down in the market open, we will know you sold"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre going to want to change this story around to make you a badass stonk god once your family is set for generations to come.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls against your newly owned shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you, you fucking monkey"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's $191.64 right now.  You could unload at open; trouser $1300 and wait for a price you like better.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP it's meant to be !!! Now if you sell, the stock will moon the next day, if you hold, it'll stay same price for 3 more months"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will not cast even a sliver of shade your direction should you decide to sell some shares & get back to a risk level you are comfortable at.

Until then, good luck, good humor, and godspeed with your unintentional YOLO! To paraphrase an Irish blessing, May the HFs always lose in your favor, and the $GME always rise to meet your feet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Accidental billionaire.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Accidentally became an absolute legend, we wont let you down ‚ù§Ô∏è"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now run a wheel on it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He‚Äôs just fucking casually
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the best accidental investment of your life. You‚Äôve just made ¬£200million, min."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unintentional yolo is the way!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just start selling OTM weekly covered calls!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,now sell covered calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,üëè get üëè off üëè Robinhood üëè

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats rtard!!  üéàüéà
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best thing I've seen online this year and I've seen a lot of things in the last three months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had 37,000 mistake dollars. I'd gladly mistake all 37,000 to the stonk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hero
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay for the contracts??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wishing you 10x returns my fellow Ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep holding. It will be a happy accident soon enough.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I Love You Sir!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robinhood with contracts. They take so much commission compared to anyone else.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed a lot! Thank you for that! I‚Äôm sure everything will be okay when you‚Äôre rich!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I accidentally bot 500 shares when it was 49 a share, and realized my mistake after the chart started clicking away...I was shocked my account had enough in it to let me fuck up like that. At that time , I just decided to yolo it and let it sit. Best decision I ever made. On Feb 24, I was happiest ape alive. Still holding , won't sell. But...I do have them with a real broker ..not RH"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can try to sell some weekly OTM options to recoup some of the premium you dished out... Just be mindful when you get cucked because the stock moves
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How can they force you to exercise? Did you Buy a Call? I thought it gave you the ""right"" not the ""obligation""?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a matter of interest, what were you saving the money for?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you my gfs bf?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't this just mean you exercised options worth 37k with 37k of cash and then owned 37k in shares?

What's the problem here? As far as I can tell you are in a more stable position now without the options and lost no value.

Am I missing something?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you could se...... no actually we don‚Äôt do that round here üíéüôå
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt mean to be mean, but your story is confusing to say the least. You play with money that aren‚Äôt ‚Äôfuck you‚Äô but you ~~spend it~~ gamble it on extremely expensive options of a VERY volatile stock, that you ‚Äòsupport‚Äô, but would rather sell this stock that you support rather then own it. Yeah... you belong here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If/when this works you're going to be extremely rich. Good luck, to all of us apes!   üíéüôåüíéüôåüíé"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mistakenly YOLO, best YOLO there is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you have failed options 101
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Paperhands and I will roast your parents on a spit. This is not financial advice... Unless you want it to be.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,5Ge is not 5G..... FYI
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"please explain to a stupid non-ape:  barring fees/commissions, wouldn't you realize the same amount of gains by immediately selling the stock after the exercise of the call if the stock doesn't fall in the meantime?  It was my understanding that ITM options  eventually would be exercised by someone, most people just don't bother and instead will sell the option itself for profit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started as a hope to make some ""fuck you"" spending money... turned into ""fuck myself"" that cost a lot of money, but it comes with a ticket to ride. If you can afford it, the new game is to hold until share value eclipses the call gains you were looking at. If you believed in it enough to bet on it for short term gains the only thing that changed is the timeline until gains?  


If you can't afford to hold, at least you helped the stock by making your call writer buy 200 shares... I think I have no idea how this works (not trying to play up the dumb persona of the sub), I truly have no idea how options work and who is on the hook for your shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this isn‚Äôt the way, but if this isn‚Äôt fuck you money, or it‚Äôs not an amount you‚Äôre comfortable losing, sell off your position or a portion of it. You‚Äôre still profiting. BUT if you are able to hold, diamond hands fellow ape üíéüôåüèº"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a way you could reverse this mistake if you absolutely needed to?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôll be happy once these shares are $37,000 each"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No more using this term plz. I dont wanna be a partypooper but its ammo for the media to screw us. Even though we use it in another way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you üëç
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got my comment removed and got a ""anti hate warning"" from admins for using the same word you just did in the same subreddit???

Wtf are the rules do I have to use the word ape too or did I not have enough üíéüëã emojis? Lmao"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you gonna do with it?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I were looking for a word to describe call prices on GME, ""low"" would not be at the top of my list."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started with $4.5k mid November 2020 and was fortunate/lucky enough to make around $60-70k in three months. That‚Äôs why it‚Äôs just sitting there, and this is not money I want to be playing with."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I try and have 10% of my mortgage in cash just in case of emergencies. I also try and have one year of dividend income from my yielding portfolio which I keep as a ‚Äòin case of global pandemic and dividends stop being issued, break glass‚Äô fund. So this amounts to about 60k. It took a lot of work but I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôve got it set up since I no longer really have to worry. 

Plus I can dip into the dividend fund for fun plays, like GME."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt want to be born with this massive dong, but there it is. Help me roll it back up.‚Äù"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell a put when the stock was at/around a peak?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And now you have enough to turn around and sell weekly covered calls on those babies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once that happened to me when I was in a highway rest stop. Luckily I didn‚Äôt not get turbo AIDS, but I was not very excited in that moment."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down to $256, you are welcome Ape-holes! There is no way algorithms and hedges could possibly understand this Stock with all this apes trading GME.  üíéüôå best option"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But his premium pad was close to $20/share. His effective cost is closer to $205 but still not a horrible place to be
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you üöÄüíé
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the app
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because this is RH, I doubt he actually owns those shares"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the easiest way to transfer?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I just started my transfer yesterday from RH to Fidelity. Holding my jacked tits for a week or so.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Around $4k for the both
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would have sold my contracts for whatever price, would have been a loss of about $2k I think"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"From as early as I saw, someone bought a billboard for GME saying something like **‚Äù$GME üöÄHODL‚Äù** instead of ‚ÄòHOLD‚Äô"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes that's true. Believe it or not, contracts actually serve a purpose besides giving you leverage on their extrinsic value."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll be selling most of it Monday for sure, I believe in the squeeze but I can‚Äôt be playing with this much money haha."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity or TD Ameritrade are good, don‚Äôt use RobinHood"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I await with my pinkies up in style
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, except you're going to need at least $20k to buy 4 200c"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not $37,000 worth"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Not at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/min4s7/i_forgot_my_contracts_would_be_exercised_instead/gt5hr7b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3), just haven‚Äôt transferred my account yet."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DRE: Wait! What if there's a good explanation for this shit?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape can read the mod warnings!  Wrinkles there:)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The only joke is that you have >30k in a Robinhood account. Get a real broker
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You act like this is a bad thing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh good, now you won't be mistaken!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,how much did it cost you initally
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His intended play was to hold onto the money as cash, so he is still less disappointed if the squeeze happens"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think my wife just found her new boyfriend

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this comment.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's gamestop, not best buy."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,muh free trades
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen if you are extremely new to calls it's extremely unlikely your account will have $38k of pocket change to cover contracts you forgot about lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre welcome üëç
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, he's definitely helped someone make that. It's just not him."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wut
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Once I can close out of my longer positions I‚Äôll be transferring everything to my Fidelity account. Didn‚Äôt want to run into the troubles other people were reporting trying to transfer out.

Also, I don‚Äôt need to have skin in the game to support it. But I‚Äôm in it now, so."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They bought two call options, for a total of $4,000. At market close, the option value would have been about $13,000. Now their exposure to GME is $40,000. 

$4,000 may be ""fuck you"" money but depending on the size of their portfolio, adding a zero could be a problem."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just said sell and I will murder your parents.  This seems like a great thing to have on record.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Markets closed before he noticed.  He could sell Monday at open if he wanted though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, he can sell the shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It might still be within the timeframe to request a 30 day refund.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You could just sell first thing monday and get your money back (and maybe some more). I wouldn't sweat about losing it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,leave RH now!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thought it was free money. Premiums were insane. No way it would go back down to $75.

But if it did go down $75 isn‚Äôt a bad entry anyway."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he though $75 was a good price and he's willing to buy at that price, selling a put lets him lower his cost basis or pocket a premium. Premiums on GME puts were insane around then so not a bad strategy."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you initiated through fidelity instead of rH the transfer will be faster
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh thank you! It was actually more of a legitimate question for my personal knowledge lol. So you can go negative in your balance but it'll still execute and you do have ownership of the shares and can sell them to bring the account back to positive? I'm a dumb ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, not that I know anything about it personally, but rumor has it if you don‚Äôt sell back your options you can actually make more money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you still make a good profit. I don‚Äôt know enough to mess around with options yet but exercising them should be worth more than the contracts themselves right?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Appreciate you giving me a wrinkle.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nvmd see the 200. Don‚Äôt know where I thought I saw 50

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can keep your dead robinhood account after transfer, it'll show your trade histroy and cost basis still.  Then you can manually punch them in Fidelity.

You can also keep a list on robinhood too, if you are attached to the app.  I switched to Fidelity, love their desktop app and can tolerate the android app."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take your time, shit is volatile and you don't want to miss out on gains. I set up options level two and added cash prior to transferring to Fidelity and they took it all. Thank you for voting with your wallet. Fuck Robinhood"

Executed the options by mistake and paid $37k for 200 shares. 

His 200 shares are up $1.3k, but he‚Äôs still overall down $2.7k cause the options cost him $4k. Ergo his GameStop shares have to be worth a total of $41k to break even, or a share price of $205. 

So he‚Äôll roughly make $215 a share when he cashes out at $420 per share, cause he‚Äôs no paper handed little bitch.

Edit: easier way of putting it- he‚Äôs $41k invested but currently it‚Äôs only worth $38k."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not use Robinhood any longer thankfully, it has been awhile. I just refuse to bash another Ape for using that platform without at least giving them the courtesy of an explanation.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put ur cash/stocks somewhere like Webull. Its a Chinese company but hey its more trustworthy than RH right!?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is garbage
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Etrade lends shares out and doesnt tell me. Whats the difference theyre ALL doing these ‚Äúshady‚Äù practices. Dont think theyre not. RH is no diff than any other brokerage.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Parasomnia is the result of your brain being caught between¬†sleep¬†stages. This in-between phase may make you act like you're awake when you're still asleep. People with sexsomnia experience¬†sleep-related sexual behavior. These behaviors range from masturbation to sexual intercourse.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,One time I woke up in a cramped room with my dick in my hand to the sound of my dad screaming. That's when I found out that I could walk *and* piss in my sleep.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been on the other side of this. Felt bad tbh! Like, sorry, I legit thought you were conscious and consenting...?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My last GF said I constantly reach over to play with her in the middle of the night. 

I didn't believe her and asked why she never wakes me up. 
She said she has but I always just go straight back to sleep. 

So I told her to make sure I don't go back to sleep. Finally she got me to stay awake and not only did I remember that time I remembered a few seconds leading upto the moment she woke me up. I was wondering how my hands found her goodies if I was asleep. I could see in my mind where she was without looking. Like I was aware of her orientation in space. Almost like psychic but probably more like a memory. 

I've kicked and punched girlfriends in my sleep thinking that I was in a fight with someone as well as kicking and punching walls. I have had a few other girlfriends and even my ex wife said I grope them in my sleep and I have even had a couple one night stands accuse me of knowingly groping them in THIER sleep. My policy now is to just warn any women sleeping in my bed of the inherent risks of either getting randomly groped, kicked or punched in the middle of the night."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, if two people who both have this condition have sleep sex who is the one that raped the other? We need to ask the humanities majors..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy you were ‚Äúsleep‚Äù fucking confused?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check the actual webpage for the cost basis. 
They'll stay at zero forever on thinkorswim, even after i transferred from fidelity, and you'll have to contact customer service to sync the prices (TOS customer service,  through the in app chat thing basically, not ameritrade customer service), but at least if they prices show up in your account on td ameritrade then you'll be good for tax purposes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks so much for explaining!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't clean it every few hours, no.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries at all, glad I could help. The math behind options tends to confuse cause the true cost per share here was: 

Price per contract (option) plus cost of shares at contract price. 

Ergo- each contract cost about $20. It allowed him to purchase shares at $185. Thereby break even is $205 per share. 

However, Robinhood and other platforms won‚Äôt factor the option price into the cost basis, cause an option is its own commodity. 

Anybody else have input? I think I‚Äôm right but if I‚Äôm not I invite elaboration :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,holy shit this is going to make you so much money and will be a LEGENDARY story for your family for generations!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually I'd consider buying at that price.. i was watchin the 4/16 $290 right around when the stock jumped down to $150. It was around $600 and later that day $2.4k or something stupid (I was like 10min late on taking the shot). That call will be $2k the second we get any big movement, which at this point could be literally any day"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would I clean your toilet, let alone every few hours?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"uh, yeah? I mean I clean out my bathroom at least like, twice a day. Once after I have my coffee and once before bed."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the type of stuff that makes people paper hand. I didn‚Äôt mean for any friction or animosity. How do we know this Ape didn‚Äôt start trading days ago?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely always write/sell calls on your shares if possible but be okay with potentially losing them. You can even do an aggressive CC strategy where you choose a closer strike near at the money for quick in and out plays more short term. Or if you want to be safe do 2 standard deviations strike from current average. Consider writing puts too if you want to go for premium too but wouldn‚Äôt mind owning the stock. Thetagang won‚Äôt make wsb front page but it‚Äôll get you consistent revenue if done decently. Both styles covered, I do not do naked calls/puts lol and I don‚Äôt buy calls/puts at the moment maybe in future"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But already exited my calls I bought. I never hold those well. Just need more practice.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Curious and yea I can Google. But why do 60 calls and 3 puts. The hedge? What‚Äôs top line reason on this In ur opinion.  I‚Äôm a fairly new options trader so trying to absorb as much input from diff angles of strategies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought my calls 3 @ .316 4/16 30c and 10 shares @ 24.93 Wednesday morning after the sell off. I‚Äôm a doofus and didn‚Äôt believe in my own DD enough to put in more money. I‚Äôve done this twice now in the last two weeks... I believe ASO still has a TON of room to run. So I‚Äôll be buying again Monday morning.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Apr 16 $30c here!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You jerk off?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool with getting shares called away?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold the 30 and bought the 35. It was at $27 when I sold the calls two weeks ago and bought the $35 when it was $25.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,People will tell you conflicting points on this matter. Shares are the best for helping the squeeze but options provide better profits. I do 90-95% shares and 5-10% calls. I sell calls and then use that to buy calls at a higher price typically.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Close OTM calls can help by forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge. If all I could afford was $45c, I'd just buy shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You won‚Äôt help the squeeze. You are a microcosmic atom in the cells of institutions and hedge funds. Buy what maximizes your profits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I‚Äôm on my fucking way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pulling the trigger for a call on Monday!  LET'S DO THIS!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you buy on a weekend?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it dropped it $24 I sold a bunch of puts at the $20 strike because it was free money. I do a lot of covered call straddles and strangles.

Edit: I exited out of a bunch of the puts I sold at 80-90% profit to free up capital"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably will buy the highest call for May just in case it pops. Will be alright if it gets called away.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why buy calls higher than you sold? Were the 35s further out?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do calls provide any weight to drive a stock up? Or purely buying shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that GME is the main focus right now, but it would be great if this got some exposure"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Interest and good move! Gonna look up the straddling. I‚Äôm at best using the wheel strategy on covered calls/puts.  But thx for info and DD. Serious thoughts on hopping on the choo choo with ya! ‚úäüèº
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I always struggle with picking a strike. How far otm was it when you sold?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls do provide weight to drive up the stock. Market movers have to be delta neutral. Option chains and open interest drives activity and awareness

Edit: there are some good articles on gamma squeezes and stuff like that on here"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like RKT. When it pops it will get the exposure and then it‚Äôs time to sell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm balls deep in GME, but the rest of powder went to ASO this week. A double GME ASO mooning in the next two weeks would be spectacular."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is over, just bagholders now"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Most people suggest a 0.3 delta. But a potential squeeze makes it even more uncertain. I simply sell whatever call I‚Äôm comfortable taking profits on.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just let one of my written RKT puts get assigned yesterday.
2021-04-02 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Heavy Sack Update April 2: Happy Easter, you damned dirty apes "
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,weird how RKT feels like the worst bet out of all of these
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You walk around with all that?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,One of those things is not the others...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Luckily RKT has been finding hard resistance at 23 lately and it should shoot up back above that level on open Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow RKTer here with my baby dick 104 shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The dream diamond hands portfolio.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A perfectly diversified boomer portfolio. Nice.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Same companies I hold, except I have 3 shares of NOK for the lols"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Quite a chunk
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Big balls man
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is junk bond status and I believe that one day the stock will be worth $0 when the debt collectors take over the chain.  RKT is a way better choice despite the wave of people not paying Mortgages.  GME is solid compared to these two.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet its the most sound bet because they are actually worth more than what the stock price is at
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a great entry price though. Someday it will be worth more than double that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I think it's A longer play then I care for though. Might drop what I have (@$26)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre a grower, not a shower."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Join the RKT club my fellow apes... 600 @ 25.60
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is only around because the shares are cheap.  Retail better support it hard because a CEO doubling his salary and trying to add more shares to the float, and they almost ran out of many multiple times last year.  This is a debt mountain and will likely chip away until its down to very little.  I have a position on AMC, but definitely not convinced it will do anything."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomer logic.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A golden shower
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got a CC that I continue to roll every fake-out ramp up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So naked short sell then?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't they getting rid of alot of debt by these offerings?  It sucks for shareholders but I think they are paying down debt. That and the insiders getting rich by unloading in retail lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they decide to use it for debt, yes. There is plenty of good that can come from having capital. The business has been operating lean and avoiding running out of cash, those practices will really reflect when the consumers start coming back. Collecting a lot more cash doesn't seem reasonable at the moment, but I'm sure they want to capitalize on the stock price while they can."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart ape ü¶ß
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get Ryan cohens dick out your mouth you retard. amc is going to the moon. They really need to change the name of WSB to gme.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They did that for a pile of debt from silver lake earlier.  500M debt was converted to stock then sold to pay off the debt of I read the article correctly.  I would assume is it isn't going to nefarious reasons they would pay off more debt.  Not sure what else they can be doing with a mountain of cash.  Unless they remodel their theaters to try to create a new movie going experience.  The business model is not good currently and they don't make enough from ticket sales.  Maybe they can drive more profit by making it more like studio movie grill with higher end food and alcohol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao imagine being this guy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is an actual meme. Enjoy getting diluted over and over, paying for more bonuses"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be. There are plenty of ways they could spend and really increase the experience. Not sure why they haven't been doing that over the past several years, but it's a reasonable way to spend. Not saying raising money would be for nefarious reasons, but as a shareholder I would love to know exactly where they'll be putting the money is going. Right now, they're just trying to survive to a post-pandemic state."
2021-04-02 19:04:25,wallstreetbets,WSB discussion this week

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep in mind that mods are deleting half the GME conversations
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to see MVIS at the end lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It feels good to start to see MVIS get the attention it deserves. This month is going to be insane for us.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really want some to commentate this gif like a horse race! ""we got GME in front with Palantir quickly come from behind! Palantir over takes him, but GME is coming back! They are neck and neck folks! here they come down the home stretch, this is going to be a close one!"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO is such a dark horse. It didn‚Äôt even make the top 10 this week yet it might be one of the best bets I‚Äôve found here in recent weeks.

Short squeeze potential aside (that honestly may or may not even come to fruition) the company is just straight up undervalued based on its fundamentals.

You only find the true WSB gems if you are sorting by ‚Äúnew‚Äù. By the time shit becomes ‚Äúhot‚Äù, you might be too late."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Havent all the GME holders started saying the same exact thing? Hold forever until it moons because y'all think you can name your price or whatever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also SNDL's shares are sooo diluted, it has 1.65 Billion shares float. They gotta make around 14 million profit to make the share price move by a penny.

Others, like DFV himself, believe the stock will simply rise to its ATH again just through fundamentals (from the e-commerce transformation).

Meanwhile Palantards think a $50 or $100 million dollar contract means it‚Äôs MC should be $10 billion higher... while ignoring the millions of shares being dumped by insiders. While ignoring the CEO himself saying he doesn‚Äôt care about short term share price."

Surely if they needed to buy cheap stock that bad they would have taken advantage of that back when it was 40, maybe not ALL of the position, but at least enough to the point they're not desperately trying to get cheaper prices right now. The fact it's been $100+ for nearly a month now makes me think that's case, as if they still needed to cover they'd be doing more ladder attacks and such"

2021-04-02 17:41:24,wallstreetbets,"I built a program that tracks mentions and sentiment of stocks across Reddit and Twitter to find rising stocks! This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM) **Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **130%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **324%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world‚Äôs largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world‚Äôs 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

&#x200B;

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world‚Äôs made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4‚Äô20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management‚Äôs confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV‚Äôs tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan‚Äôs chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC‚Äôs EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world‚Äôs largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC‚Äôs current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice post.  Thank you for taking the time to do it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello, just swinging by and saw one of my favorite topics mentioned, fabrication strengths.

For those not into tech, you may not realize that 10nm/7nm is more or less a marketing number - it only measures the distance between transistors in one dimension.  What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.

Although Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).

**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  

Please note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.  Overall, I do agree with OP (also, nice post!), but I wanted to point out that the difference in fabrication technology is closer than the layperson might tell.  Finally, fuck this tiny window to write text in.

Edit: In case if process node is a new term to anyone, if someone is referring to Intel 10nm, that's a process node, while a process node advancement would be moving from Intel 10nm to Intel 7nm (Or TSMC 7nm to 5nm, but you get the point)."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a really great idea! It'd be interesting to run your program on historical data. For example, see what it would come up based on January sentiment, then track how that stock performed in Feb and March (or even go back a few years and track long term growth).  I'd have to believe that the data is out there. It would help you refine your models if you didn't find good correlation in the sentiment and price.  In fact, you could look at the data in reverse. Find what stocks had good movement in 2020, then analyze the trends in sentiment for an X-week period before their big jumps."

There is no way in hell we will ever rely on a foreign company for the defense of our nation. We spend more than the next ten-twenty nations combined on our defense. Our government routinely lets Intel look over its shoulders at our national research labs such as Los Alamos etc. Intel knows the future in Chip design will be in neural multi dimensional design layouts. It‚Äôs already partnered with the national lab in Chicago to study neural AI chips. Look up the size differences of Nano Meters. It‚Äôs stupid to even fuss over. Density is much more important at that scale. And greater density will only be achieved at that shrinking scale by using 3 dimensions or more.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks a lot for the write-up! This is exactly the kind of thing I am looking for while posting my DD!  Two questions

1. Do you have some sources for the transistor density part? (not that I doubt your expertise, but why would all the companies prefer a lower nm if it's just for marketing? They can just as well go with the higher ones and save the cost right!) 
2. Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing? TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup? 

Thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a professor in this area. My team does computer chips all the time in our research projects. I can confirm the post above. Density is what really matters, not the node number."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great reply and good post op never knew about water shortages great bearish point,

TSM will have advantage in <5nm once 2022,23 factories come up but that should last only 1-2 years until competition catches up 

TSM also just announced 100 billion in factory spending to catch up with chip demand market is reacting bullish and that is why it is trending I agree with this

I made a post month ago on TSM, [building](https://www.reddit.com/r/Vitards/comments/lgk4us/tsm_building_before_the_boom/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) before boom as they may see their stellar EPS cut in the upcoming year as they spend so much on new factories price may drop or consolidate before booming I think leaps are the way but I‚Äôm also looking to buy a few hundred shares to sell calls"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Apple is the primary buyer from TSMC, should we expect TSMC to drop in value as Apple moves towards manufacturing its own chip?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry but nobody competes on the same level as TSM.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amd is God for processors bruh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Intel is only shipping *their* 10nm (the ""fixed"" one, their 3rd shot at a decent 10nm process) in a meaningful way in client CPUs, only laptops.

Their 10nm Ice Lake SP server CPU is probably going to be a train wreck, hopefully they deliver something useful with the follow-up Sapphire Rapids later this year.

Meanwhile AMD's TSMC 7nm servers were launched in summer of *2019*. This time to market gap is more likely to increase as AMD's financial position improves, allowing it to invest in bleeding edge processes the way Apple does.

INTC warrants a shitload of skepticism for having lost such a commanding process lead over the span of just a few years, and then boldly claiming that they're going to retake a leadership position after they already paid their key people to retire, and TSM is planning something like 2-3x INTC's planned CAPEX.

Not even talking about the plan for INTC to work as third party foundry because that's gonna be a shitshow.

The reality is that Intel is locked into a course of about 2 more years of collapsing gross margins due to the current state of affairs, and the only reason their market share loss won't be catastrophic is AMD doesn't have enough capacity to take more. After that we'll talk again about whether INTC is a good value play. The inertia of the business is in the completely wrong direction."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not just that but Intel is more vertically integrated, almost as much as Samsung.  
AMD, Nvidia, and Apple all depend on TSMC/Samsung to make their CPU/GPU chips.  


Intel is also about to announce their GPUs made by TSMC that will compete with AMD and Nvidia in the Gaming/AI/Machine Learning space.  


As you pointed out, when they're on the same node Intel CPUs outperform AMD CPUs by a wide margin. As it stands their 14nm are still pretty competitive with AMD's 7nm. Also from a physics stand point to go below 3nm will be quantum computing (some argue 2nm will be achievable but it's unlikely).  


And once Intel hits 3nm it's going to wipe the floor with the competition. In 15 years Intel will be the leader with a market cap nearly as large as AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC combined. The fact that their P/E ratios are 35-80 while Intel is at 13 shows me the markets are not efficient.  


I'm extremely bullish long-term (10-15 years out) on Intel and it makes up 35% of my portfolio. If the stock price hits the 40s again it will for sure be 50% of my portfolio. Not investment advice."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Do you have some sources for the transistor density part?

It's not a great read, but [this article](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/525/iedm-2017-isscc-2018-intels-10nm-switching-to-cobalt-interconnects/6/) has a good image that shows a comparison between gate sizes.  Also it corrects my poor explanation of how transistor density and nm are measured!  Turns out it doesn't move from one dimension to two, but factors in the distance between transistors.

>a lower nm if it's just for marketing

Basically nm is a far easier metric to put on a slide instead of MTr/mm√Ç¬≤.  At the end of the day, the consumer will always figure out which process is best, so it's not really a case of nm is completely incorrect (because comparing 10nm and 7nm in the same company is still perfectly fine) as much as it is an issue of being incredibly confusing for those who aren't knowledgeable about the space.

> Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing?

They put a financial guy in charge.  It didn't help that they had a technology lead at the time, which made the decision to cut research spending on new processes easier.

> TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup? 

Intel can definitely catch up, it just depends on how many of the lessons learned on 10 and 7nm can be applied to 3nm.  I think I forgot to mention there are rumors Intel will just jump from 7 to 3nm...  Which to be fair, they would have to do to reach par with TSMC.  As for capex, I wouldn't read too much into it for now.  Aside from reinforcing the idea that Intel will continue to own fabrication facilities, TSMC is at 100% capacity, and Intel near 100% with their existing fabs.  At the moment it just looks like a ""you have to spend money to make money"" thing."

They‚Äôre hemorrhaging say center marketshare to AMD and this is before those Arm chips are even out. Same with Nvidia whose acquiring Arm and is going heavy on data centers as well.

Intel is extremely important to the American government and military but at best that makes them IBM. If Intel doesn‚Äôt start manufacturing low energy chips to compete with Arm they could be in serious trouble years down the line don‚Äôt you think?"

3- Intel is not even close to competitive in high-end productivity or server applications.

You can reverse engineer what someone else is doing if you're behind, or rely on equipment companies to provide key process development information to catch you up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey that‚Äôs really fascinating as a fan of both Intel and TSMC.

Do you personally think Intel needs to come out with an Arm style low power consumption chip as AWS moves to Arm based Graviton chips and Apple to their M1 arm chips? If so can Intel keep using their x86 architecture?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difference is Intel already secured the $20B, TSMC hasn't."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10 because more bigger more better
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relationships that are quickly deteriorating. You'd have to be insane to go with Xeons over the Milan Epyc cpus, and given the partnership list AMD rolled out on release, it looks like many new server farms are going with AMD. Same with laptop releases, the 5000 series AMD chips are faster, and MUCH more power efficient than anything Intel can offer. I'd honestly be shocked if intel can compete at all within 2 years."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they open in 3 days? I was just making a joke about how you‚Äôre saying 3 days was too far out, so I assumed you‚Äôd only invest in a 1-2 day timeline, like day-trading."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Admittedly I'm not super knowledgeable about the full integration flows/architecture, so I'm totally the wrong person to ask.  You likely know far more than me on that topic :)

My knowledge is more about some of the thinnest films that are required when creating the chips (the transistor-level); our processes are called ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition), so it's putting down atom-by-atom thick layers of various atomic elements.  Most of my specific work is designing the right experiments to better characterize/optimize the properties in that atomic growth across the entire wafer.  

At the transistor level, soon there will be a migration to a GAA (Gate-All-Around) structure.  We've already been working on helping the big boys with that for a few years now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSMC spent 28b, this year. Spending slightly more for the next 3 years doesn't seem like it'll be a problem."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Intel still holds over 90% server market share and about 80% laptop share. I'm not disagreeing with you over amd making better products but Intel is a much much larger company with still vastly greater mindshare and market share in the profitable areas of the industry. If AMD can turn itself around after the FX days while in a massive amount of debt I'm confident that intel can do the same. Have you been following alderlake at all? I feel like that will be their first interesting release since skylake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They'll fire something out as and when they need to. Then AMD will sit on its heels in 2nd place for a few years and decide intel has been on top for too long and bring something else out.. on and on and on. You can't really go wrong with either company... The only thing is intel are completely in house which makes them more attractive as an investment for me. As a consumer I would pick AMD right now but that's only because I do my research.... Most don't.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I didn't want to think about the market because I have been grinding since January and need this short break. 

Probably a selfish comment but with good intentions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's just more profit margin to lose for intel though. Last gen AMD was slightly below intel in some areas and slightly better in others. Milan and the 5000 series desktop/laptop cpus absolutely blow intel out of the water. I see intel losing lots of ground over the next year in both server and laptop segments. Intel is going to have to price its products next to dirt in order to retain anything. I'm not saying intel is done or over by any means, but a new/old CEO isn't going to fix their problems overnight. I think the speed of the intel ""comeback"" is vastly exaggerated. And from what I've seen so far, I'm not confident in the direction they're taking. I also reserve judgment of any new cpus until I see 3rd party reviews and benchmarks. You can't trust ANY marketing slide or internal claims, especially from intel."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I held out for months till I could get an AMD laptop. The AMD cpus have far better integrated graphics than intel. It's actually capable of light gaming and the entire CPU is more powerful.

AMD cpus also produce a little less heat and use a little less energy than Intel which is YUGE for data centers. Power and cooling is about more important than the actual CPU in terms of cost."

I couldn‚Äôt take the constant checking pre market after market and every second of the day waiting for either the squeeze or icarus like plunge we‚Äôve seen far too many times. The tricks these hedges played were crazy and I didn‚Äôt even know they existed. It‚Äôs almost like it‚Äôs been too quiet and you know they‚Äôre plotting and scheming so I hope you guys bend em over. Now I just say trade it when it runs but never ever hold overnight. Learned that the hard way Jan 29th weekend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh absolutely! When you can reap the tendies and you're set to play on that field you should do it. I did and I'm happy with the outcome. I'm all for peeps doing what floats their boat and hope the stonk goes to the moon!

> The private goods-producing sector also added back jobs on net in March after shedding payrolls in February as inclement weather impacted hiring.

> Earlier this week, ADP&#039;s March private payrolls report showed the most jobs added back since September, and the Institute for Supply Management&#039;s manufacturing index pointed to rising employment trends in the goods-producing sector.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10y yield quickly rose after the report.. that ain't good for the Nasdaq. Anyone look at a 25 year chart of the NASDAQ lately?... it's pretty funny.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,PPP ends on May 31st. Afterwards business can start layoffs in haste.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crazy that they don't count PUA/PEUC continuing claims when that is the real amount of continuing claims. only counting claims in the 1st 6 months (state benefit period) gives you an idea of the 6 month rolling # of new claims but not total outstanding. Total unemployment rate is well above 6% still. 

This will bump treasuries up but I still believe any inflation will be transient; I think the Fed is correct in this case and not necessarily just jawboning. Short term there are supply constraints increasing prices combined with an influx of 1 time fiscal stimulus. However, over the long term you cannot really have sustained inflation without an increase in wages and/or a decrease in taxes. Wages account for at least 70% of total inflation. There can be a number of factors leading to inflation in the short term as rates rise such as low margin unprofitable companies like UBER being forced to increase prices as it becomes more difficult to borrow. Companies increasing prices as adspend costs continue to rise. The problem is there needs to be an equilibrium and if these prices increase while there is only a constant pool of money available to be spent, there will be less total sales, putting pressure on those prices.

I also see no evidence that the economic outlook going forward is really any stronger than it was in 2019 despite that being the narrative. I see people talking about a reversal of the tech/globalism induced deflationary trend of the last 20 years but other than a potential decoupling from China (which I don't believe will happen) I don't have reason to believe this is the case."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That means more people have money to shop at Gamestop, go see movies at AMC, and buy houses using loans from Rocket Mortgage!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I thought. I think the US is in a stronger position relative to EU this year compared to 2019 but a weaker position relative to China. The insane prices for commodities we're seeing right now may make 2021 a more steady build back rather than an explosion of growth.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is like a stream. The amount of money flowing in is based off of how good the options are for where the money should go. For a year, stocks were the place, so the stream was going to stocks and not as much to bonds and other options. If other options become more attractive, the stream will slow down. If lots of 401k contributing jobs are cut, the stream will slow down as well, but right now, we are at the tail end of a that stream being a roaring river. Surely, we are at the point other options start to take some of the water away from the stream, but we have reset expectations and what a stock is worth relative to earnings. We have done this in the past too. Metrics change over time and right now there is a lot of confidence in stocks, and people are willing to pay more for earnings than previously. Will this hold? Or will it settle back down? We don‚Äôt know, but history shows that metrics are great in a snapshot, but over a long period of time, expectations and what we look for in metrics changes.  The stream metaphor works even further if you think of companies as farms using the river for irrigation."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn‚Äôt see much with tech but here is a CNBC article about the jobs report this morning. 

Leisure and hospitality, a sector critical to restoring the jobs market to its former strength, showed the strongest gains for the month with 280,000 new hires. Bars and restaurants added 176,000, while arts, entertainment and recreation contributed 64,000 to the total.

Even with the continued gains, the sector remains 3.1 million below its pre-pandemic total in February 2020.

With students heading back into schools, education hiring boomed during the month as well. Local, state and private education institutions combined to hire 190,000 more employees for the month.

Construction also saw a healthy gain of 110,000 new jobs, while professional and business services added 66,000 and manufacturing increased by 53,000. For construction, it was the strongest month of hiring since June 2020.

In addition to the powerful gains for March, previous months also were revised considerably higher. The January total increased 67,000 to 233,000, while February's revisions brought the total up by 89,000 to 468,000.

A slew of other industries also added jobs: Transportation and warehousing (48,000), other services (42,000), social assistance (25,000), wholesale trade (24,000), retail (23,000), mining (21,000), and financial activities (16,000) contributed to the strong month.

Within the other services category, personal and laundry services, which serves as a proxy for general business activity, saw an increase of 19,000."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's actually money printing, btw. 

The only technical difference between printing money and QE is that the Fed claims that, one day, the money will be sucked out of the system. So, wink wink, it's not printing money if they're gonna take it back.

Except when they started to taper the balance sheet in 2018, the stock market tanked 20% and JPow said nvm, we're gonna not taper. 

And so the printing continued. And then Corona happened. 

There has never been a single central bank where they unwound QE.

Yeah, no. I love TSLA, I love Musk, but I love making money more. And TSLA is not going to make me money. TSLA is MAYBE worth $100bn, if it can fend off competition from rivals. That's an 84% drop from its current valuation. I'm not a fan of losing 84% of my investment."

And whenever I play Tesla it does the opposite of what I do so therefore all I have to do is go against my initial instinct and BAM, profit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of your bear reasons is a bull case for Tesla. Tesla and VW are the only companies in the western world taking huge steps to secure their own battery supply chain. The rest of the automakers rely on outside companies, and will compete over the same insufficient battery share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla and Musk got a lot of snide comments for talking about their factories and manufacturing in general. When they talk about an ""alien dreadnaught"" or ""the machine that makes the machine"", it's very easy to dismiss them or make fun of them being ignorant or ignoring the experts, etc.

But these kinds of results mean we should probably take the idea that Tesla could be a global manufacturing expert somewhat seriously. They built their Shanghai factory in record time, started production much faster than almost anyone predicted and have been increasing output at an impressive pace. In Fremont they completely redesigned a core product (Model Y) to use a completely new manufacturing technique, and then rolled that knowledge in to a new factory in Shanghai, again at a pace much faster than anyone would've predicted.

And they've got two more factories in progress, which are huge, and going up extremely quickly. With plans for battery factories and apparently new factories in Shanghai, and they're making huge investments in cutting edge manufacturing and vertical integration. I think a big uncertainty in their future valuation is how well they can pull off big, incredibly ambitious, projects like that.

If they can keep making improvements in manufacturing the way they've been improving recently, then that starts to create a trend for them to really be a leader in automotive (or really any kind of) manufacturing in the next 5-10 years.

They've still got a long ways to go to prove they can actually hit those goal, but these kinds of surprises in quarterly numbers are the kinds of things that might give people confidence they've got the ability to pull it off."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla will be first to market with a compelling ev at a $25k price point. I also think all their models will stay best price/performance for years to come.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"well put. I give more weight right now to the loftly valuation and the competition ramping up so I'm bearish at these prices. But the ties wirh the renewable sectors and the huge head start in the EV are a great reason imo to keep holding shares. They really need to start churning cars, tho."

Ford also makes the legacy and dying products and Tesla current standard.

Its price factors in the likely hood to survive the death of ICE and who do you think is in the best position to do that? The company making EV with basically no debt and no legacy plants or the company making loads of legacy out of loads of legacy plants with a massive debt.

Without looking at any of the other industries tesla is in they are in a better risk position for the death of ICE as a car maker"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't you know, once Tesla starts making more cars, Ford, GM and every other car maker in the world is going to just quit making cars because they can't compete...  edit: /s duh"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many batteries did Ford make? And what about solar panels installed? What kind of move is Ford making into the HVAC market? How many grid tied energy reserves has Ford installed? How fast is the mustang compared to a Tesla? What smart home products does Ford have on the horizon? How‚Äôs fords foreign market penetration? How many manufacturing facilities has Ford Closed in foreign markets and how does that compare to the amount of new facilities for Tesla?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,its all about the growth my dude
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But how many pure EVs they sold? A lot of people keep saying other Automakers made/sold more cars. EV is different from ICE cause they gotta secure batteries and Tesla the biggest EV producer still having battery constraints.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ford is also TRASH!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should buy Ford because of 213k sales per month and going bankrupt over 180k per month with higher increasing margins and poised to become the biggest automaker on the planet. Got ya!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Others have pointed out some key differences between the two, but another large point (to me) is the comparison of electric Semis. Hard to compare now since they aren't in production, but Teslas Semi blew Ford out of the water. If EV is the future, investors are going to see that Ford already doesnt have what it takes. 

\-Eval still crazy though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear I am bearish on Tesla too, however:

Average sale price - Ford $30k rev per car; Tesla $60k.

YOY growth - Ford 0%, Tesla 30-50%

Charging/gas stations: Ford 0, Tesla 20,000

Dealerships owned: Ford 0, Tesla all

Solar/battery argument.

All of this is moot though, as Ford is a typewriter manufacturer in an age when Tesla is a computer manufacturer and 15 years from now Typewriters will be banned. Xerox, like GM, had the lead on computers (GM - EVs) and watched upstarts reinvent it. 

The market cap is still ridiculous when you consider Tesla is nearly the market cap of the ENTIRE auto industry (around $700bn vs around $1T)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And tesla was founded 100 years after ford. For a company to scale production that quick is impressive. Short sellers have all but disappeared.

Also, one is changing a market and 2 years ahead of the competition the other is playing catch up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla have launched more Cars into Space than Lucid have delivered so far...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is room, practically speaking it will take time, hopefully they don't fizzle out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucid is a 0
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won't be able to scale to compete at a meaningful level for a while. The Model S and 4680 cells ramping up next year is almost a death knell for Lucid's current technology. 

There are three aspects that buyers care about in electric car quality(looks, interior, fit and finish, driving capability), range(how far), and infrastructure. Right now lucid can compete on quality and range however when 4680s are starting mass production that range advantage goes away with structural battery and 15% boost in battery capacity. Combined with the supercharger network allowing a much better infrastructure that ""just works"" it becomes hard to compete. 

Lucid is aiming for a significantly higher end market. The profitability per car should be there but battery constraints and using CCS which is reliant on the electrify America network isn't exactly a good thing for the next 2 years. The problem with CCS is that there aren't as many stations and the stations don't have as many stalls as VW only builds the bare minimum. 

Tesla has the first mover advantage with charging, economies of scale with new factories/giga press/battery factory, and the kinks mostly figured out.

Lucid can compete however they'll need to ramp production quickly(difficult look at Ford delaying delivery of Mach-E) while simultaneously maintaining a technological edge and getting their cars out quickly to keep up. 

TLDR: another competitor trying to catch up but lacking the secret sauce"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is room for more competitors.

However, Lucid lying about production in the recent past leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Plus, their projected revenue numbers are pure fantasy. Add to it the Saudi investment and the strings attached and I pulled my investment in them."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you have is a comp with dying legacy companies that have to go through their major
re-orgs. TSLA can certainly be priced with tech stocks, no just based on technology, but on growth.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Though the quality of the cars they produced in 2020 is unarguably terrible.

The one danger OP forgot in the long term is recalls. I mean, it is already a threat as they are recalling in local markets left and right due to motor vehicle authorities clamping down on obvious defects (Germany, KBA, 12k recalls on 5 year old models due to adhesive issues), but the real consequences will be seen in 4-5 years when the less obvious defects on the 2020 models will start getting reported in large numbers. 

These kind of defects will be more similar to the eMMC issue in their ""~~media~~ vehicle control units"". That is a direct consequence of being a disruptive tech innovator in a space that is dominated by safety ratings and 
 automotive standards that limit your ability to innovate for some good reasons. 

They simply don't have the institutional expertise (as it is new factories and new manufacturing engineers) to ramp up their production numbers in a safe manner while also featuring unique solutions in their vehicles. Companies like Magna might sometimes make you wonder if they are retarded when they try to innovate in ADAS, but then Tesla fucks up 100k vehicles on some shitty decision and you realise why Magna is contracted by everybody else to make parts and assemble the damn things."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another important factor of why TSLA ""deserves"" a higher multiple for their stock is growth.  TSLA has been showing 50% growth with potential of 100% growth this year.  ICE companies had mostly plateaued and taking share from each other.  Also, TSLA has potential to make much more income not just from auto but solar, energy, insurance, etc.. in the future and I don't think analysts are really counting on that at all right now.  There's also optimism about TSLA owning the robo-taxi business."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM was making EV's 25 years ago. All ICE companies are working on (MUCH simpler) electric drivetrains. Add in competition from smaller companies like NIO and Workhorse.

I appreciate that you are the first person to make a real argument (debt levels and legacy costs) as to why the valuation of TSLA is not directly comparable to Ford. Thanks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of that debt is from their credit arm to their customers. Which is to say that debt is actually revenue generating.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,wouldn't call tesla the current standard whenthere are still more ICE cars sold than electric
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if one were to just look at it roughly and only factor in the debt load, the question is whether TSLA is worth 3x of F. (600B vs 200B).

In that light most people would say most definitely it is worth 3x."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And in 2000, internet stocks were all about growth as well, until they weren't. In order to justify TODAY'S price, TSLA is going to get 10X more of the automotive market share than Ford right now, or 100X in 5-10 years. Even if they do, they are only worth what they are trading at and have no appreciation potential. However, TSLA stock is simply not based on the underlying business."

The carryover can increase or decrease as it is going to be affected by anything towards the end of the Q that could affect deliveries.  Such as if the end of the month is a weekday vs weekend, weather, delivery rejects, people tending to buy cars more or less based on the time of the year, daily production rates, etc.

Uneven buying patterns for cars by consumers over the calendar year by itself will help ensure deliveries vs total made always varies.  As long as the numbers are small, it doesn't really matter.  You just don't want to see tesla building up surplus, that would be bad."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I answered somewhere else:


Tesla isn't going to be EV only. Their EV innovation started out **years** ago and it panned out into reality and changed the market. But we're at today, not then. Tesla is in the business of pushing for **innovation** around **grand**(iose) ideas. What could this idea be then?

I believe their plan is to be the first to realize the **SMART (autonomous) CAR**, together with a broad-scale **DISTRIBUTED and SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE**.

And that's why it's focusing on energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities by selling batteries and roofs here and there. It's the start to GROWING into something groundbreakingly different as a company.

Pretty much like the back then *""overpriced""* Amazon who *""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world""* as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets you **HAVE** to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain retarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd think OP's ""700 by monday"" isn't really TA based, rather an expression of a bullish thesis.

So on that I agree 100%. 

Yes, might have little effect on the price on Monday, but I really see TSLA going up over the next years  and not as a product of any meme army, but due to the innovation they push to bring to the market and their spirit for fast paced expansion."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So when they meet the production levels of Ford or VW what will the valuation be? 10 trillion?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except VW have just swiped away the European market from TSLA with their new range of electric SUVs. 

Tesla has taken too long to get to where it is, and only delivering 180k cars means people are having to wait to buy one. Especially when so many are in the USA and China. Europe will embrace European manufacturers as the EU will likely be protectionist over their home grown brands. 

I don't see TSLA taking market share from any European manufacturer.  They just can't produce cars fast enough, and have allowed the other manufacturers to catch up. 

TSLA is only going to drop in price over the next 5 years unless they make some massive changes to their operation."

lol wut?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the assumption was always that manufacturing was really hard, and EVs were easy. So the legacy companies would have a huge advantage because they just had to learn how to make an EV.

But I suspect the truth is that they're both really hard? Tesla learned how to make great EVs, and it turns out that might be a really difficult thing to do. So, when they turn towards learning to be a great manufacturer, it gives them a little more credibility. They've got a ton of very talented and very motivated engineers working for them. I wouldn't want to be against that kind of potential."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Though the quality of the cars they produced in 2020 is unarguably terrible.

That's definitely not true. The overwhelming majority of cars that came off the line in 2020 were perfect. They might have a higher rate of cosmetic issues than other cars, things like trim or panel gaps misaligned. Or a lot of times when you see people's issues it's things like not understanding the infotainment or door handles or something.

But the quality of an automaker's cars isn't just defined by a few issues like that. And implying that there's something wrong with all or most of the cars, when we're talking about small differences percentages of visual flaws. 

> The one danger OP forgot in the long term is recalls. I mean, it is already a threat as they are recalling in local markets left and right due to motor vehicle authorities clamping down on obvious defects (Germany, KBA, 12k recalls on 5 year old models due to adhesive issues), but the real consequences will be seen in 4-5 years when the less obvious defects on the 2020 models will start getting reported in large numbers.

There's zero evidence that Tesla is anymore likely to have a recall than other automakers. All automakers have recalls, many of them extremely serious, some of them caused by deaths, and occasionally they've been covered up or fought for years. Compared the industry average there's nothing about Tesla's recall history that stands out as unusually bad.

And there's even less evidence for imaginary recalls that you claim are definitely going to happen in the future."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I recommend Rob's 'Tesla Daily' podcast/youtube. There's a lot of over the top hype but Rob's very detailed and dives into everything with a clear head.  


/u/ragewind isn't the 1st person to be saying this. Maybe that you've heard but us TSLA bulls have been saying this for going on 2 years now. ICE has to chew its own leg off to get out of the bear trap they're caught in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How do they make them simpler? Teslas are RC cars on steroids. I'm not sure GM making EVs 25 years ago will help them much. tech has evolved and engineers from that era are moving on. If they use their 25 year old knowledge it isn't going to be better than Tesla.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you need to look into those other companies and try harder too.

All your examples are of companies that are a magnitude less of EV production than Tesla.

Mustang EV?  Maybe 50k in 2021

Ford EV?  They‚Äôll be lucky to hit 50k in 2021

NIO?  Won‚Äôt ever take foot in places outside of China (which is fine and WILL likely become the main Tesla competition in China)

Workhorse?  They are losing that USPS contract, almost 100%.  They will be bankrupt by 2025.

The ONLY company even close to Tesla numbers is VW.

But all these things forget how big an advantage Tesla has in raw material production AND their modular / ‚Äúclean room‚Äù designed assembly line."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"While the other revenue streams are small you discounting totally is an error. They are revenue streams that ICE auto don‚Äôt have at all and they are revenue streams that will grow. So while small now and worth only a tiny bit it will become sizably relevant.

Take energy, it‚Äôs just been found that Tesla is the source for the batteries at the apple energy project. It‚Äôs a massive project that‚Äôs been contracted for a year with no PR and even now its due to a member of the public finding out and making public. The markets and pros don‚Äôt factor in energy at all but there it is slowly growing on grid level projects, not exciting as its boring infrastructure but infrastructure is large in $$ the more it gets deployed.

FSD is another one, now it‚Äôs a cost but once its working it will be a saving. The majority are hoping mobileye works it out for them, they then hope mobileye don‚Äôt screw them by just upping the monthly charge.

Tesla can also just sell FSD to others for the same fee mobileye will be taking. The EV network is also a future revenue stream that looks like it‚Äôs moving in to commercial reality soon.

Nio is a real competitor as they have the backing of the Chinese government do debt is only a problem if they are politically an issue for the government. So no debt, rapid R&D and massive market.

Workhorse seems to deliver less than Tesla does Vs its hope. So they may be a risk in the future but they seem to be in the same value to risk/potential as tesla but with less deliveries 

VW stands a chance as they seem to have seen the light but they have the same level of debt and the legacy plants to kill off. Engine and gearbox plants are often separate, small and utterly unneeded for EV‚Äôs so they have contaminated sites that cant offload without doing massive cleaning of the earth.

You said this;

>The hopes that TSLA will ""grow into their share price"" is a gamble, not an investment.

I would say;

Investing in ICE auto is not an investment but a gamble that they can survive the death of ICE without going broke. Are they solvent enough to do this and can they develop and produce R&D fast enough and can they convert this to production quickly enough?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you trust Sandy Munro's evaluation of electric motors from different companies, he has said that TSLA's are not only simpler (cheaper to make), but more efficient, and more powerful.  I believe most ICE companies are sourcing EV motors from suppliers and not actually designing and building them themselves (Porsche may be an exception).  You need to provide a source for your statement."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"EVs from ICE-age car makers have generally failed to impress. Certainly failed to de-thrown Tesla as the technological leader. 

It would appear Tesla is the Apple of smartphones. Yes, there is Samsung, and many others. But there is only one Apple.

Most importantly, Tesla is way ahead of the pack in battery procurement and production. The number of EVs you can sell depends on the number of batteries you can source. Ford, GM and others are trying to scale-up, but they woke up late, and will trail Tesla in number of EVs sold for the foreseeable future, because they will trail Tesla in the number of batteries they can get their hands on. 

As EVs become more common place, the Osborne effect will likely hit ICE-age car makers very very hard. Given they already have significant debt, a sales network that stands to lose from the EV transition (far less maintenance), less-then-stellar software expertise (and I'm being very kind here) in a market that is more and more heavily impacted by software - all this doesn't bode well for the incumbents.

The car industry is in the early stages of a technological revolution. In such cases the new players often become dominant, and the few incumbents that survive lose their position of dominance.

And we haven't started talking about autonomous driving. Should this become a reality, we're talking about an even bigger revolution, hitting an already embattled industry."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it‚Äôs paid off yes but it‚Äôs still a risk should economic situations change. On the small scale we have seen this with Covid the only segment of cars that held up through a pandemic was EV and Tesla.

Tesla is richly priced but it is the most likely to live past ICE but for value you have to look at all factors of the business and the market which is far broader than just todays sales."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ICE have 4 years before they start getting banned.

There is no questionability on that that‚Äôs the policies and laws of the country‚Äôs leading this.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A debt is still a debt and always a risk. They may be financing the cars but that‚Äôs one financial crash away from being a big problem. The pandemic showed how external world events impact companies. Ford and ICE firms suffered badly and has governments all over not been propping up people with one for or other of stimulus there would have been loads of defaults.

On the flip side though Tesla was able to maintain their sales as their products are a moat with more demand and supply. They will too face the same risk as Ford has when they are selling at the lower price points and the risk of national and global financial events happen.

But just keep focusing on single issue rather than the whole work out for everyone so far who said tesla had nothing. Ford has to dispose of so many ICE assets to convert that that will be major financial anchor on them that they will not recoup the capital from"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, the fact they are so exposed to their customer‚Äôs credit as well as the resale value of their vehicles means they have an existential risk tied to legacy ICE products."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford basically has one EV that they don‚Äôt want to sell, everything else has an ICE powering it that is legacy and dying tech 

When you make ICE your sales figures mean fuck all in 5 years time when your product starts getting banned

Do you still think that Tesla is only making cars for the rich? Did you miss the 3 and Y and the planned developments. They logically started at the highest margin lowest volume car and are moving down the segments as the technology, scale and price improves"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, nope.  More likely China starts producing batteries that are nearly as good, and half the cost, severly crippling one of their major revenue streams."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I get it.  Been wondering for months how many people think that someday Tesla will produce 75% of the cars in the world.  That would almost justify a valuation 10x that of Ford and GM combined."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""200k cars = stock go up from 600B"" is delusion."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The miss at expected 162k cars is currently priced into the stock. There was an anticipated shortage of chips that was supposed to impact deliveries. Street estimates without the shortage shortfall were 172k. To come in higher by this many percent means that the growth model that the share price is currently discounted to match may be fundamentally flawed as a 10% increase over expectations at this point on a growth curve is significantly compounded years down the line. New projections then need to be discounted back to a current valuation. This leads the share price increasing to match the new undervalued status.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they are selling $200-300/month partial or full self driving subscriptions with high take rates? Yes, they will be worth quite a bit.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their valuation is partially based on expected growth and future earnings.  As they achieve that growth, their growth rate will slow.  The stock will not include as much of the future value, since it won't be there.  We'll probably see that as a lowering in the growth rate of the stock, which is entirely reasonable and expected.

Tesla is on track to double their production this year, and there's a good chance they'll double it again next year.  They also have a ton of promising business in other areas-- battery design, full self driving, solar and energy, etc.  They're a big name with a high valuation for a reason. They're disrupting multiple spaces, and the one they're deepest in (auto) has a bunch of poorly competitive giants stumbling around trying to actually compete."

Tesla makes the car, gives you the insurance, runs the stores and the service centers, makes most of the spare parts, runs the charger network, and in the near future will sell the autodrive as a monthly service subscription if you don't want to buy the full self driving package. Then a robot taxi fleet. Then the battery and solar to charge it at home. And the semi monthly leasing subscriptions. And quite possibly a software, games or media store. You are actually comparing Ford with something that will compete face to face with an entire tenth of S&P500. Aunt Cathie calls for 3000 USD the share? I'm actually fearing it will double it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Tesla is the dumbest stock to own. Everyone's going to be shocked when it tanks and the evaluations become realistic. Tesla should not be worth more than most of all the automakers combined. Nobody should buy Tesla stock unless they think they will destroy every automaker and become a monopoly for the entire car industry, because that's what their evaluation means. Oh, and here comes Rivian backed by Amazon too. Don't forget China's new F-150 competitor that is far superior In technology, cheaper, and is selling well in Australia and South America. They will be exporting it to more countries soon. Tesla is not that edgy, they have fierce competition, and they're going to get squeezed out."

What you fail to understand is each Tesla vehicle, long term, will displace ~10x fossil vehicles.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they'll make it work, maybe they won't.

But it's also pretty impressive how far out on a limb they've gone with Autopilot / FSD without it totally blowing up in their face.

Now, I'm half convinced it *will* blow up in their face at some point. Car runs over a family, jury trial, [compromising audio of Musk](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D94QEVsXYAAaw0m.jpg) shows up or whatever, gazillion dollar settlement, pitchforks, torches, etc.

But if it doesn't, I reckon their Autopilot R&D was able to move 2x, 3x faster than competitors because they are just totally okay with managing this level of risk.

I think that gets overlooked a lot. I didn‚Äôt pay for fsd because I think the car is going to have fsd in a year, I paid for it because the tech is awesome right now, and it is going to get constant updates for the lifespan of the car. I don‚Äôt feel bamboozled by any stretch.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"to be fair the other car brands just dropped the ball hard for the most part because they are old brands with loads of people who focused on petrol powered cars their whole live for 30-40 years and with a really slow moving hierachy. that is what fucks them really hard.

building a car in that sense is way easier for tesla then it is for example for bmw and others.
which obviously is simplifying it because tesla is just really good at what they are doing but tesla started from scratch with their EVs while the others still try to make it work with the parts they already are producing, have to please old customers and still need to fit in that company design language and values. Most of them half assed the first generation EVs because of those reasons in times where EV sales are still only really starting. 

bmw for example probably will need a rebranding down the line because their slogan ""sheer driving pleasure"" doesn't work anymore when people don't drive the car anymore. :D"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Electric motors are wires wrapped around metal making electromagnets that spin. One moving part. There are also no gears to shift to maintain RPM's in a narrow band. Internal combustion engine drivetrains are much more complex.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It honestly wouldn't surprise me to see a few of the big car manufacturers go under. However, it also wouldn't surprise me to see other, new car manufacturers start up. Hundai and Kia were nothing in the 80's. 90's they were crap. By 2010 they were winning awards for quality. I think automotive manufacturing is a VERY competitive market with deep pockets for R&D. TSLA got off to an early lead, but we'll see if they can maintain. Good luck to you in your investment though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Electric motors are much simpler than internal combustion engines.

GM didn't stop R&D on electric cars. They continued. My point is TSLA wasn't a revolutionary concept that nobody thought of. They just did it at a time when battery technology and government subsidies supported it. There is no reason other companies will not be successful in the EV space."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point that I have made multiple times is that the amount of growth that TSLA would have to have to justify TODAY'S valuation is impossible.

1/3 of the revenue, 10x the valuation. So TESLA would have to sell 30 times more cars than they do now to be worth what they are trading at today. Basically every car on the road would have to be a TSLA to justify TODAY'S stock price. If every car on the road is a TSLA (for today's price) where is further growth going to come from to justify any increase in the stock price? This thing is priced beyond perfection. Might be a great underlying business, but it isn't worth today's valuation even with impossible growth."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Still retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 2nd key factor would be emerald mine money. Doesn't have to be emeralds but being born with money puts u in the environments the mental space and the culture of money making and success.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Delusion for the ones that accept it as a possibilty

or for the ones that refute it with such certainty?

It's been played out again I mean, and it didn't go that well for the bear side. Just saying."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"why do you think a miss is priced in? that doesn't seem coherent at all. tesla is currently priced for its potential value 10+ years down the road, so trying to project a growth function that far into the future is going to be fruitless."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,are YOU willing to spend $300 / month on a car in addition to the cost you already have?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Self-driving is going to become ubiquitous across all vehicle manufacturers as time passes.

Even if Tesla is first past the post on the tech, eventually that feature will not be able to command a premium and subscription revenue from that would drop.

If every single one of the cars they delivered this quarter signed up for a $200/month self driving subscription, that only contributes $432M to annual revenue. If you think $432M of ARR supports a $650B valuation, I have a bridge to sell you. Heck, let's say that they get the $300/month, that is about $650M of ARR if a full 25% of buyers sign up annually. Let's say they 5x that over the next year, that's still just $4B annually. 

I don't think you realize just how much $650B is. You're just looking at the share price, not the market cap."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Goodluck gettimg that full self driving approved anywhere with the current tech lel
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont forget all the driving data they are gathering and soon should launch their own auto insurance business and gps killing google maps
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"200/mo for something that costs $10k upfront?   Granted I only paid 4k for FSD on my own tesla for being an early adopter, but jeeze that monthly cost is far too high.  $50/mo max."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,American auto manufacturers used to be fully vertically integrated but stopped that as it was more profitable to outsource parts of the value chain.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Comparing the p/e of Apple and Amazon (30-60) to Tesla (>1000) is laughable and shows just how deep in the sand Tesla tards have your heads.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm curious what makes you think that.  Are teslas designed to last for 10x the miles of a standard internal combustion engine?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'll keep that in mind when SpaceX IPOs lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't tell if this is a joke or if you are legitimately trying to use that as an argument.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would another car manufacturer launch a car into space? It's an expensive publicity stunt to establish brand image. It was excellent for Tesla, but unneccessary for established players."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citation? Especially considering that they haven't even sold 1 million in a year yet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know and understand an exponential growth curve, I also understand that exponential growth curves can become linear over time. Exponential growth at the minute is possible because there are far more consumers looking to purchase electric vehicles than there is supply, hence why the Mach-E flew off the shelves. They didn't ""steal"" customers from Tesla like has been somewhat misleadingly reported, they simply supplied excess demand. However, there's some substantial players coming into the market and Tesla is soon going to have to start competing for customers, that will temper exponential growth."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It isn‚Äôt just cybertruck, it‚Äôs rivian and Bollinger too, who are solely aiming right at that market.

Fords is going to try and shove 3rd party ev stuff into the frame and body of a typical F-150 and be destroyed. They should have engineered a solution to a problem. They didn‚Äôt. They‚Äôll have their cute compliance vehicle that is just other peoples stuff forcibly shoved into their body.

If they were serious they would have brought in engineering, sold a vision, and sent the dividend to future growth. They didn‚Äôt do any of those things.

Maybe the government will take some of your money and give it to them. And they‚Äôll keep paying dividends and giving ceo bonuses. America is a fucking travesty."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you actually seen this what this pivot entails? I would like to see your definition of ""massive"".  $27B over 5 years for GM en $29B for Ford? Meanwhile VW pledged investment of $86B into EVs and autonomous vehicles.

GM's (limited?) edition 1 pickup truck will come out in fall of this year? starting at $112k.

Around the same time the cyber truck will come out at $70k with better specs. Or you could go for a $40k version with similar specs.

The cheapest version of the GM ev truck won't come out until 2024 (if all goes according to plan). And it will be $80k with about the same specs as the $40k cyber truck.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, but the run up wasnt due to ""people"" paying for it. S+P inclusion forced passive funds to buy in order to maintain portfolio balancing requirements. When major institutions are forced to buy it causes the price to skyrocket. However, There isnt alot of fuel left at the top to sustain any more upwards momentum.

Active funds bailed at the top, leaving passive funds holding the bag."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,touche.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were not even making S/X this month though, had Chinese New Year shutting down half their production for a week, and had downtime due to a parts shortage.

Their production usually suffered in Q1 even without these issues. I imagine they use the lower demand to make major factory changes.

Feel free to buy puts though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"850k is doable, but 1m+ will be hard. That said, Q1 always has lower deliveries and production and all other quarters. Furthermore, Tesla had a fire in Q1, the chip shortage, and the fact that Q1 has fewer days than other quarters all contribute. So that is why people are blown away by the numbers and are looking at 1m+ deliveries for the whole year. Maybe with Giga Berlin & Giga Austin coming online this summer, they've got a shot. Exciting times non the less."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Elon has a good track history of meeting deadlines on the head or blowing past them. Man has no exit strategy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did not make any S/X at all. They should get back to 20k/qtr. The Model Y production is ramping out of Giga Shanghai. Between the two, they should be over 200k in Q2. Giga Shanghai‚Äôs production should continue to rise through Q3 this year. Giga Berlin should start up in Q3 and Giga Texas should start up in Q4. The road to 1 million cars in 2021 is certainly possible."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm saying you can Q1 x 4 for 2018-2020 and see how BAD of a predictor that is. Q1 for those 3 years has only been 12-18% of yearly deliveries, not 25% as you're supposing."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just go downhill both ways on all your trips and you'll be good
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I want to know who is making ""MUCH simpler electric drivetrains"" than Tesla."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for being reasonable.

I really do. I already feel bad for legacy auto. Not the board members but the workers who are going to wind up laid off. Tesla is going to do to traditional auto what the 2008 financial crisis did to banks.

There's going to be bankruptcies, liquidation, mergers, etc. And I've been saying it for a while, BWM is going to be on the chopping block."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> My point is TSLA wasn't a revolutionary concept that nobody thought of. 

It was, which is why everyone else was retrofitting large batteries into ICE cars, instead of redesigning a car with lots of small batteries at the bottom.

> They just did it at a time when battery technology and government subsidies supported it. 

Everyone else was working on EVs at the same time.  They just sucked so much at it that they had to pay Tesla $$$ for carbon credits."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, truth!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla could completey fail at the car business, and I'm confident their utility business would be worth a trillion by itself by 2030-35."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My argument is that looking 10 years into the future, the most likely scenario (but by no means certain) is that Tesla will be the dominating car company, and most ICE-age incumbents will be dead or significantly weakened.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The entire thing is absolutely ignorant and not worth my time. I‚Äôm only replying because I‚Äôm enjoying it. There is a gigantic amount of information available and you don‚Äôt seem to have any idea about any of it but want to ‚Äúspit hot takes‚Äù.

Go do your dd. You don‚Äôt have to like tesla, or any other company or stock, but coming out fully retarded is what it is, bull or bear.

You‚Äôre arguing about a stock many people have put TONS of time into, bull and bear, and your take is terrible. Deal with it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some companies and businesses *are* different. I think Elon Musk is absolutely the next visionary and Tesla is going to not only grow into it's current valuation, but surpass it multiple times if it continues to be led by Elon Musk. 

I would have gladly overpaid for other companies led by visionaries if I had the ability. And by visionaries, I mean guys like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Rockefeller, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos - etc.

The difference to me between Musk's level of ability to shape our future and these other leaders, is that I think Musk is **MORE** of a visionary. I think anyone not able to see that of course is going to think TSLA is overvalued. Especially if you see TSLA as just a car company that is currently not producing the profits to justify it's current valuation."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If you think China is going to ban the internal combustion engine, you are out of your mind.

Apparently you haven‚Äôt paid any attention to China then. They are the biggest threat to Tesla because the Chinese government is going all in on EV‚Äôs they have complete cities that are zero emission vehicles only, they are already banning the ICE.


As for Texas they have bigger issues at hand than trying to be the only place propping up ICE, try creating an electric grid fit for the 20th century for a start, then you can try getting it to modern standards"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is still higher the either ford or GM by ~5%, and many foreign govts won't subsidize their cost like Europe and the US..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We've been hearing the same ""the competition is coming"" since 2013. No car manufacturer has the vertical integration that Tesla has. OEMs would have to gut their whole revune syrram to even have a shot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford is only managing to make around 50k Mach-E‚Äôs in the first year due to cell supply constraints. Even that is only contribution margin positive... not gross margin positive. That means they lose money on each one they make on a gross margin basis.

Hey can‚Äôt scale if they don‚Äôt have the parts to scale. In the meantime, their ICE business will die.

They can introduce all the models they want, they can‚Äôt get any decent volume due to cell supply constraints. Plus they are behind in costs and technology."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"YEHA and of those 21 models how many will they produce in 2021?

I‚Äôm betting 50k max.


They can‚Äôt even shore up purchasing enough batteries for fucks sake.

Let‚Äôs also not ignore that making 21 ‚ÄúEV models‚Äù is a fools run meant to get PR.  The idea that they can sustain the design and production of 21 different EVs (even with their cool new ‚ÄúEV platform frame or whatever), is ludicrous.

Not to mention your entire premise that making 21 different models is a GOOD thing is completely upside down."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many bridges are on sale on this thread
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"21 models. Wow. How many actual units? Didn't MachE get capped at 50k units?  


IF they were as efficient as Tesla they would be able to make \~55k units with the same battery supply. But they're not. They're made in Mexico, their kwh / $$$ ratio sucks vs Tesla, and so much more."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don‚Äôt forget Xiaomi and Apple jumping into the industry.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM beat the Model 3 to the market, and at a lower price, and at a higher range. They still only sold less than 10% of the Model 3.

Why do you think their next EVs will do any better?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM said the same thing 2-3 years ago. You know what they have now? A Bigger Chevy Bolt (with same siz battery) the only new feature is driver assist cruise control with pre-mapped LIDAR.

Still waiting on the 20+ electrified vehicles from GM. I was waiting for GM to release something compelling when I owned the Volt."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously man? You think Ford is going to have 21 EVs in 2022? I've got a bridge to sell you...

I trust Volkswagen can scale better than either Ford or GM and look how they've fared in their pivot so far. They've also been way more proactive in preparing for said pivot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they will have an issue with sourcing a large battery supply.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How? They have to shut production of the most popular vehicle in the world. The f150. . Their losses are in the billions already this year. Ford is dropping below 11$ before may.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"21 models, i hope that's a joke"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not without tax credits they're not. The real answer here is no. Fucky accounting is the norm at Tesla.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are completely ignoring TSLA lack of debt.

You are completely ignoring Ford and legacy OEMs huge debt.

You are completely ignoring TSLA 100% YOY growth.

You are completely ignoring that legacy OEM need to destroy their current business to truly compete in BEVs.

You are completely ignoring TSLA industry leading margins with their economy of scale only now kicking in.

At this point maybe we could introduce the idea of FSD and the rest of their battery and solar business.

It is people like you that have cause me to tamp down my risk tolerance regarding TSLA.  Because of you I have only made eight figures instead of nine figures in profit.

Eh, I will live with it...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh so you're saying ""in 2016 the stock was bad and I stayed away"" and it's up 1800% since then. Sounds like your 18x an idiot and you lost out. Go fuck off"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're thinking about it the wrong way. 

All the people who are very bullish on Tesla now buying at 600-800 aren't going to turn into dollar and cents traders overnight once Tesla materializes its future success.

The future expectation is built in and future success will add on to that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't look at value just based on competitors laterally at the one to one value. Tesla is not your standard car company.

Not all car companies are deep into autonomous driving like Tesla. Apple just bought 50 million dollars worth of batteries from Tesla. What if Tesla starts selling batteries to homeowners for their solar panels as part of Biden's green legislation?

You're looking at Tesla way too narrowly."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your valuation is fundamentally based on a comp with legacy automakers that have a Kodak moment coming up. It is like valuing a new house built to the latest standards with houses that have to first be demolished and rebuilt.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs what matters. I made money when it WAS a good investment. The point being it WAS - hence how money was made from it.

I think it was just a pretty 1 in a billion perfect storm of circumstance"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because the price of something goes up doesnt mean its justified. Same for the reverse.  It's just that company that would take 1000 years to earn enough money to justify its value seems like it might be slightly overvalued
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"right, how could i forget that stocks only move in one direction? all of those bears should have learned their lesson from shorting intel in 1999."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that. Self driving sounds cool that plus a car payment is pretty much a full mortgage where I live
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taxi companies/Uber, transport companies etc... certainly are. $300 a month is way cheaper than paying the driver."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If I get to drink and drive home at the same time all legal? Fuck yea! Lots of people gonna buy TSLA just for the self-driving. No more fucking paying attention in fucking traffic jams. And Tsla is just scratching the surface of how impactful self-driving will be.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,By the time they bring that to scale the price would be considerably lower.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on how rich you are and what you commute. $300 a month to not need to deal with traffic cause your car does it for you sounds like a small price to pay in major metros.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"would I spend 300/month for a robotaxi that will earn $10K or more/month?  Hell yes.

Of course by that time Tesla will be charging much more than 300/mo for the software... 

and actually then they won't have to sell cars... just roll them out of the factory to immediately start picking up fares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What if you had no insurance premiums. Would YOU pay $300 a month for a self driving car?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For self driving? For someone who's already buying a tesla? Seems like a no brainer.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. But I throw more money away on a daily Basis on SPY FDs. Money ain‚Äôt going with me when I‚Äôm dead.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I own the full self driving capability package on my car. That covers many, many years of a $200-300 subscription.

So yes, I'm already doing it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No. But is Uber?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Once to try it out. But not again. If I like it, I'll say ""cool, on my next Tesla in 5-10 years, maybe I'll add in self driving"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I go hundreds of miles out of my way and spend thousands of extra dollars to get a manual transmission. However, I'm probably not Teslas target audience for this feature."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree in the manner in which you arrived at today's market cap. Essentially, you are basing Tesla's latest deliveries (180K) as a future metric. It doesn't work like this bc you're neglecting future cash flows (future deliveries). So add a multiple to your $432M. 

Also, this ""revenue"" is essentially camouflaged as pure profit. How? Bc FSD is a recurring revenue stream with **very** little ongoing cost. Think Facebook, AWS, Azure, CRM, etc, and Tesla will probably be even better bc FSD is a real utility. I envision dedicated highway lanes for FSD as a start."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you are not taking into account is Tesla is the only one putting robotaxis in the field *now*.

Fossil companies are scrambling to catch up just on EVs, let alone the AI necessary for robotaxis. Maybe they'll be getting somewhere by 2025.

By that time Tesla will have ~20M live robotaxies out there, and each robotaxi displaces around 10 fossil cars.  If half of Tesla's sales are in the U.S. they will be capable of fulfilling ~100% of the PTMM (personal travel mileage market) cheaper and more conveniently than owning personal vehicles & driving yourself.

Any competition will be fighting over scraps."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA no where close to lvl 5
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How are they going to make money with gps when google maps is free? Make it better? How do you improve a near perfect product that has been in development for decades? Google Maps already perfectly fills its role. Also auto insurance margins are terrible, and unless Tesla is offering insanely low rates nobody will use their insurance, meaning even worse margins. Auto insurance providers now usually make money through bundles with other insurance. Is Tesla going to offer home insurance too?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You know Amazon has had a 1000 p/e several times right?  Not that long ago.  But I guess it was overvalued then right?  LOL
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash your Hands

And don't bet against Elon Musk.

People are investing in Tesla with the hindsight of what Apple and Amazon achieved.  Nobody is investing based on their current p/e ratio. People are investing for 2024 or 2028."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, yeah keep talking crap. While I‚Äôm laughing all the way to the bank, thanks Papa Elon!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazon had a pretty high pe for some time before it came back to where it is now. Combined with FOMO, the Tesla pe makes sense somewhat right now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazon's peak P/E ratio was 3732.43. Sit down boy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You would have shit on Amazon as a fad and an overpriced stock. There was a time where their P/E made Tesla‚Äôs look like a boomer stock, in the neighborhood of 3000 at one point."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like lot of people comparing Tesla to other OEMs have never experienced the product. I might be wrong. But go for a test drive. I think it‚Äôs a game changer. Tesla has so much opportunity in terms of software whether and energy. Whether it‚Äôs selling apps someday to selling FSD. When I used the iPhone first time, it felt like the next step and that‚Äôs what Tesla feels like. Just my 2 cents"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Orujo de hierbas and queso manchego. You learn to see the bright side of life... xDDD

(Yeah, I know, sounds impossible. Remember when a kid out of an internet payment company tried to sell an electric Lotus Elise to the rich guys at USA, like twenty years ago? Or when five mariachi and a nut job started a rocket company last decade? Sounded crazy too...)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Teslas will last a good 2x-4x longer, but that's not why.

All Tesla are robotaxies, just waiting for the software update.

A robotaxi can go all day, where fossil cars just sit parked doing nothing 95% of the time.

A robotaxi will supply the PTM of 10 fossil vehicles.

By 2026 Tesla sales to private owners will not matter. They will sell to fleets or just roll cars right out of the factory to start picking up fares and printing money.

Nobody is in a position to catch up. By 2030 Tesla will capture 1/3 to 1/2 of TPM with insane profit margins. Maybe more if they are licensing their AI and other tech to the other surviving auto makers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually they potentially are. Electric cars are superior to ice cars ever single way except charging atm. They have less parts that could potentially fail.

Are there going to be competitors to Tesla when they achieve full self driving and there are Tesla robo taxis all over the world? If u think Tesla is gonna üí© the bed then put ur money where ur mouth is and short it. I‚Äôll gladly eat ur lunch just like I ate the lunch of all the prior shorty ü©≥ with the help of papa musk.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fords CEO did just give himself like a 2 million $ raise
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah you pretty much just said what I was trying to say. Massive investments. 2024 is less than three years from now. And yes, the cyber truck does look weird and will attract only niche customers. I'd wager in ten years time, the all electric versions of the F-150 will be the best selling trucks on the market. Not everyone wants a Tesla."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Overvalued would mean that it is selling for more than people are willing to pay. I bought into Tesla when I read about their solar roofing concepts and have never looked back. I have tripled my portfolio since then and will not sell my Tesla shares until I retire. These boomers really don't understand that they don't control anything anymore. Most of them have even lost control of their bladder.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are WAY mistaken. Tesla wasnt added until December 21st 2020 at around 640 and was, after factoring in the stock split, 81 the previous December 21st. YoY it exploded WAY before it was included or even announced to be included. I rode that wave all the way up proud that I had done my DD on a company that is NOT overvalued as its self driving maps and technology alone will be worth more than most current car companies. Tesla will likely be the next trillion dollar company and could become the most valuable company before all is said and done. They are constantly looking for ways to build, expand and explore and are not grandpa's GM or GE. Profits are a side effect of Tesla, their primary concern is growing and advancing current tech. This is the direction the world has needed for years and as soon as other companies follow the world will be a much better place. Could you imagine if Amazon worked on actually improving the world?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starlink baby, that shit is going to put tesla over $1k."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but your major increases are also YOY. 2019, 63k q1 to yearly 367, 88.5 2020 q1 to 500, it‚Äôs going to be tough to get to 1M. That said, I‚Äôm in investor."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My comment was that companies who make much more complicated drivetrains (ICE) are not going to have any issue figuring out how to make much simpler (electric) drivetrains. I just worded it bad. Sorry.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well Nissan for one.  The Leaf's drivetrain has no active cooling.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unfortunately, government didn't allow financial institutions to fail (except Lehman Brothers) in 2008, they poured tax dollars and printed money into it. I wonder if they will do the same to.prop up Dodge or Honda?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Alepsa remind me of this drivel in 20 years.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be bigger than the entirety of the world's utility sector, but you may be right."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it MIGHT actually be worth what it is trading at today, ten years from now. In the meantime I'm going to invest my money in a company that is valued in such a way that if the business grows, ten years from now the share price will be higher than it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually predict China reverse engineering their battery tech, improving it, and then selling them for half the price.  Tesla is a disruptor with little or no competition, and govt assistance.  Both of those will change soon."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you think tesla is going to 20x its sales in the next 10 years? And also that none of the the legacy are going to be nearly fully EV by then while also getting ICE sales? You're delusional.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"*see previous post

Company may be good. Stock today is VASTLY overvalued."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since I don't have a position at all, it doesn't hurt me if you make money. I wish you the best of luck. (By the way, perhaps you should take Thomas Edison out of your list of people you would invest money with)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs almost as if they know that subsidies won‚Äôt last forever which is why they‚Äôre aiming to leverage economies of scale (with localized supply chains and factories) and manufacturing improvements (battery day, single piece castings, structural battery pack, etc) to bring the cost of their cars down."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but superior technology aside, maybe there‚Äôs still value in Ford stock like there was value in GameStop stock?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And everyone else.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Also VW DAIMLER and BMW
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They arent the only auto manufacturer to deal with chip shortages. Tesla also had to shut down production.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the intent is to remove short term items, then the CEO performance awards definitely qualify. The various EV tax credits continue... CAFE GHG credits continue and there are various carbon trading credits that continue, like the Chinese ones that Tesla is selling to VW.

So Tesla is actually profitable from the cars."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cars are profitable. Setting up 2 multi billion factories in one year is not profitable without credits. If no credits they will expand slower. By the time credits go away in any case they will be large enough to be able to expand without hitting profitability
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take a look at their quarterly reports.  You can clearly see the profit margins on their vehicle sales (sans ZEV credit sales which they break out).  Where ZEV credits have helped is Elon's stock compensation as he continues to hit company targets.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you should learn how to read a balance sheet before you embarrass yourself. Although probably no one will notice it here anyway.

I'll give you a hint: Try to understand what a captive financing arm is!"

Edit: last two lines."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The price is extremely high, even if Tesla‚Äôs dreams materialize. That‚Äôs the problem."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"80% of TSLA is automotive. They are an automotive business. Their market cap is $635 Billion. $50 million in batteries bought by Apple is rounding error (in fact, when I talk about the valuation of TSLA I don't go to two decimals past the billions because of rounding)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is your fundamental analysis telling you a fair price for tesla should be?

Here's mine. Price/Earnings should equal their growth rate (as a percentage). So for a company growing at 20% per year their P/E ratio should be 20.

(Google PEG ratio)

Tesla's P/E ratio is over 1000, which means they would have to increase in size by 10 teslas every year..... That's how highly valued they are on a fudamental basis."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think we agree.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys both trippin hard. Better go blaze 420.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard that's a sure way to make a quick buck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Others have done as revolutionary a thing, he's just the big name around now. He may push things to new heights, but I think if you put Elon in East LA or even middle income suburb he comes out much less revolutionary."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They most certainly don't that's why one should recognize the environment we're in more. I think it's bullish still at a broad scale for the market.

Everyone and their mother expects a correction here and there, and especially for stocks that run very high, but being on the perma-bear side in this environment kinda means you'd have to make very big money during one of your 10 crash predictions to make up for the other 9.

MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH:

Speaking of environment, historically speaking I don't think tech and its potential for transformation of humanity's socioeconomic activities is similar today to what was possible back then. Making faster computers is much much different than making them accessible at the palm of your hand (see smartphone boom).

Tesla is going for similar groundbreaking level of innovation with a SMART CAR + a SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

And that's why it's focusing on energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a far too optimistic number.  As soon as fsd can operate commercially, investors and groups will come and and whittle that profit margin down to nothing. You'll have months, maximum, to take advantage of robotaxi usage."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's comparing imaginary apples with non-existing oranges.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">implying that a self driving car would result in no insurance premiums.

What world do you live in to even think this was possible?

It's as if you think FSD cars won't get into accidents or don't interact with regular drivers"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My insurance is like $100/month. So no I wouldn‚Äôt pay to avoid that and have self driving. Difference of $2400/yr for me to not drive?  Driving isn‚Äôt that hard. 

That‚Äôs designed for taxis, not the Everyman."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a fixed number of automobiles that everyone in the world will ever acquire. This is not an advertisement, or a consumer electronic device, or anything like that. Eventually, the number of vehicles Tesla delivers will plateau because human beings don't buy ten cars annually. 

My math is actually correct. 180,000 vehicles * $200 = $36M/month of FSD subscription revenue. $36M * 12 = $432M annual revenue.

You are treating cars like a growth industry. It is simply not."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If COVID is driving work remote and pushing people out of the cities and into the suburbs/rural areas, robot taxis are not where you want to be.

Also, why would Tesla want to maintain a taxi network? They can just sell the cars to people who want to be robot taxi purveyors."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just need to go on YouTube and watch a video of Tesla‚Äôs driving in cities. Or through road construction, or a zipper merger, anything that isn‚Äôt mostly straight and predictable to know we are still years way from level 5. 

Unless you fancy buying a new car twice a year."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In regards to the person saying FSD will not work. My Tesla only has enhanced autopilot not FSD and it‚Äôs self highway driving is impressive. Using summon (no one in car) in a crowded parking lot is awesome. If the car can self drive in an environment as complex as a Walmart parking lot I‚Äôm convinced Elon will have FSD working on the highway.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If all cars they are selling are eventually autopilot and they have people data of driving then they can calculate risks sell insurance at minimum to people using their cars. I also forgot about robotaxi othervtransport business even cargo truck transport business. The potiential is immense and they are right on track. Google map doesnt hve the car mechanics driving data testa can predict more accurately in real time driving conditions etc which goigle gps lacks. They can sell their gps for subscribtion or free with ads etc.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Trying to understand the thought process...they grow production by 1000% and the mkt cap stays flat to justify the growth?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're absolutely correct. Viewing TSLA as a ""car company"" right now is like viewing AMZN as a bookstore before they diversified. 

Except that TSLA is going to be able to leverage it's sister companies in it's favor. And it's headed by the latest version of Thomas Edison/Henry Ford/etc. 

People don't want to admit that there's a once in a lifetime train leaving the station and they're scared to get onboard. So they're shitting on those of us who have the courage to."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do the maths then, it's taken them 17 years to get to 1 million sales. They're a tiny car company, to be fair in my original comment I should've clarified that I was talking annual production, but the point still stands. It's easier to grow from a small company to a mid-sized company than a mid-sized company to a global conglomerate. In order to compete with VW Group in annual production of automobiles they'd have to achieve an increase of 1860% based on last years numbers. It's a huge gap, and it's hard to achieve those types of gains exponentially.   


The specific numbers I gave were just to illustrate a generic economic principle, at some point size makes it difficult to grow quickly."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Competitor's have been successfully producing hybrid cars for years, and now a transitioning into the fully EV market. In Europe, we're seeing what happens when Tesla comes up against significant competition, and the result has been promising in many respects but raises significant questions about it's current valuation. 

"" Are there going to be competitors to Tesla when they achieve full self driving and there are Tesla robo taxis all over the world?"" 

That isn't a goal they'll have achieved anytime soon. If they manage to achieve self-driving vehicle technology to the extent which they have promised, then I'll re-evaluate my position.

""If u think Tesla is gonna üí© the bed then put ur money where ur mouth is and short it. I‚Äôll gladly eat ur lunch just like I ate the lunch of all the prior shorty ü©≥ with the help of papa musk.""

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol wut? Value is relative to revenue. Not a boomer here but please understand what you own is overvalued. Doesn‚Äôt mean it can‚Äôt be even MORE overvalued though.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They reduced labor required on the Y with the single piece front and rear casting.  Elon also said they remove the need for about 300 robots for each end the casting is used. The margins are going to be insane this quarter.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No I‚Äôm not sure how many actually.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean he correctly predicted how many cars they would produce years before the deadline.

&#x200B;

Energy storage and power delivery is actually much more complicated and important, and Tesla's lead there is quite significant"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is so far from the truth. ICE manufacturers have fallen so far behind Tesla that it's pretty much impossible to catch up. EVs are a totally different ball game. ICE manufacturers are gonna have trouble even getting the batteries to produce their vehicles.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To some degree, the current infrastructure bill does just that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"6 of the top 10 companies by revenue are oil & gas or electric companies, for what it‚Äôs worth. There is a lot of money to be made in energy. 

I would gladly pay Tesla 15k upfront for panels + energy storage so I don‚Äôt need to depend on PG&E‚Äôs crappy service. The utility makes money over time (would take them about 10-15 years to make that same amount of money from me) while the energy manufacturer makes the money at time of sale."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If Tesla grows as I expect, share price will be much much higher than it is now, as current price factors in the probability of failure (DCF, etc)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So how come Apple still takes the majority of profits in the cell phone market?

Apple wasn't a cell phone marker. It arrived late, with better tech, and took over the market.

Tesla is doing the same to the car market.

Apple cars will be the Samsung phones - very good technically, selling lots of units, but making far less profit than the leader."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a fair point I think. However, I want to echo the point made by the previous commenter; OEM‚Äôs love to publicize how many different models they will offer but say *very little to nothing* about how many EVs they will produce.

To me, that‚Äôs a warning signal. I always ask, how many electric (not ‚Äúelectrified‚Äù) vehicles will these manufacturers sell and I have only gotten one response which is VW (the group, not just VW) guidance for 1M EV‚Äôs in 2021 while in 2020 they produced around 230k. I‚Äôll be extremely and pleasantly surprised if they pull that off and would love to hear that other manufacturers were planning to transition as quickly."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"True. But you have to tie how high the valuation is behind what's driving that valuation.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are an electric vehicle automotive company. You can't compare them one to one with traditional fossil fuel automakers.

Tesla's 20 percent in other green energy solutions can easily grow to more than that.

As far as future growth is concerned storage is going to explode. Auto will be a relatively sedate 40x in that time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"P/E ratio is difficult to use with high growth stocks. Tesla, like many high growth companies are managed for the highest growth possible within their ability to maintain liquidity. Basically, they are managed for cash rather than profits. So if you use a metric that primarily measures historical profit, you miss out on growth stocks.

Enterprise value to revenue is another metric to consider. TSLA is around 13x 2021 estimates and under 10x for 2022 estimates. That is pretty much in line with tech companies like Microsoft, but Tesla is growing faster. NVDA trades at a higher multiple.

If and when the story changes, then the multiples will also change."

And I know what is possible with current hardware & software and what the trends are. Full ""level 5"" autonomy may be here by end of 2021... maybe 2024... either way, Tesla is vastly ahead of the competition. With full autonomy profits will go through the roof."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can't have both...But apparently at the same time people are bullish on Tesla for owning Robotaxis and also selling cars because people then will own Robotaxis.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't be surprised if Tesla does the insurance too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well if you are stuck 2 hours in traffic each day you would think differently. Driving not being hard is a negative because it's boring as fuck if there is traffic and you can't speed for fun. And if you drunk and drive you pay a lot more.   


Many people also work long hours AND have a one hour drive both ways, using that time to relax and sleep instead to also pay attention to the road after a boring as shit office workday.   


In the end people that have the money and can get more comfort than before will do it, quality of life > a few extra bucks saved."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your math in 5 years?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Running a robotaxi network is just software. It is (relatively speaking) easy compared to designing, building & running factories, neural networks for AI, and the logistics of selling & delivering cars to customers. It is far easier and more profitable to just run the network themselves than to worry about selling to millions of individual customers.

They could sell to a fleet, but even there why let some fleet operator capture that portion of the profit when it is so easy to do yourself?

It does not matter where people live, robotaxis will be cheaper and more convenient for almost everyone.

COVID is on the way out by end of year and does not mean much for th 5 or 10 year horizon. That said, even as working remotely becomes ever more common, the need or desire to go from point A to point B will, if anything, increase as people have more free/flexible time. If you can work remotely, you can work from anywhere... so why not travel and work? Or work from coffeeshop, or whatever? It's like paper. We use more paper now than ever, even though it has been obsolete for 2 decades. BUT paper only handles about .00001% of the information storage/transmission market.

Plus if people do stay home, then that vastly increases the need for on-demand last-mail delivery, whether it's lunch, your monthly Rx, or whatever the overall mileage market is going to grow, not shrink."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I drove a BMW with lane assist 7 years ago and what I'm seeing now bearly looks more impressive. 

And ARK sees what, a 30% probability of an operational robotaxi network by 2025? I give it exactly a 0% probability.

Nothing against TSLA otherwise."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything Tesla is doing seems to center on Autopilot yet they don't even have the most reliable system anymore, and without LIDAR it may not even be possible to achieve full self driving. Also risk inclusive insurance is already a thing and many people refuse to use it due to the tracking. Also also you still didn't say how they will monetize the gps system."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  PE means very little with a high-growth-potential company
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"YEHA about, 5 million Tesla‚Äôs produced a year..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know how fast tesla is growing? Not only their car business but their energy business as well. Their margins will likely be very good as well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying it is right. I am just saying that is why people are buying at these prices.

Amazon had a P/E ratio of 1000 in 2013/2014"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would have to be earnings, not necessarily production. I will also add that Tesla made more profits by investing in that decentralized electronic nickels than by selling cars or carbon credits. Food for thought. And you are right, even with such a growth, you would just start to get a somewhat justifiable market cap."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was such a stupidly easy investment to make after they fixed the model 3 ramp issues. It was a crystal clear AWS or iPhone 4 moment, but unlike those two companies people were completely ignoring it."

The maximum amount of ARR one can expect is that figure. Even if they captured that entire number, you are still talking about a 15 P/S at the current valuation. 

Also keep in mind that the largest companies in the world by revenue are Amazon and Walmart. They do like $350B and $550B revenue respectively. Tesla sells a single product, one which has an absolute ceiling in terms of volume. Sure, they have power walls and solar roofs and shit (in the same way that Ford started selling Kingsford charcoal), but those are not their bread and butter."

That's delusional. 

""Anal-ysts have been preaching for ur years how about how the competition is coming... they‚Äôve been wrong about virtually everything regarding Tesla and will continue to be wrong""

And there has been competition, the favoured eco-friendly car of the last decade was the hybrid, not the fully electric vehicle. The competition has officially arrived and Tesla's come third place in Europe, a vital market if their valuation has to be justified. My argument isn't that Tesla is going to fail, it's that it's valuation is unjustified. Speculation and investment aren't 0 sum games. 

"" If u don‚Äôt believe autonomous driving is coming and coming soon - it‚Äôs prob because u don‚Äôt have enough knowledge about machine learning and neural nets.""

Do you care to share your information on these technologies? I'm not a techie. However, I do have a few highly qualified friends that I can share your arguments with and see what they have to say. 

""‚Äôm sure some EV competitors will do alright - but many EV companies emerging now are outright scams (cough cough nkla and lordestown). Be very careful about which EV companies u put ur money into (not financial advice, do whatever u want, I don‚Äôt care)""

Lordestown and Nikola aren't companies that I care about, the big competitors against Tesla are going to be the companies are going to be Peugeot, Volkswagen, the Mitsubishi alliance (I.e Mitsubishi/Nissan/Renault), Hyundai and General Motors. The first four represent 4/5 of the major players in Europe's EV market (the other being Tesla) and two of which (VW and RNM) are ahead in European market share and one of which is just 0.4% behind Tesla. All of these companies have diverse EV models either on the market or coming to the market. All will continue to make inroads into Tesla's market share in different markets. VW's going to start outproducing them in China starting next year, and McKinsey's research showed that German brands are favoured to American in that market. VW's also going to start hitting Tesla in their American market which Ford has already begun to process of doing (but Ford's a bit of a dud ngl, zombie company).

I'm not denying Tesla's a great company, it's just not the road to global dominance. It'll be a powerful player in the EV market from here on but it's not going to be the biggest, and it's valuation is ridiculous."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Comparing a commodity and a company isn‚Äôt exactly apples to apples. The price of a stock is what someone is willing to pay for it. There are very specific metrics on how to evaluate a company and Tesla is overvalued on every one.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is the result - but the part of a company bought reflects the desired -future- value.

People are buying the parts with the hope to sell the parts for more money because they have identified a company that has a high chance of growth (or to receive dividends in lieu of growth).

I know exactly 0 people who are investing in stocks hoping they shrink or take dividends away. (Not here to discuss short selling mechanisms)

The vast majority of dollars do not end up in the stock market because of what -has- happened, they are there because of what -will- happen. 

Past performance is only (an important) one indicator of future performance. 

This is why growth companies are valued much different than non-growth companies. This is why non-growth companies often pay dividends to attract investors. This is why a company that makes 25% the product of another company can be valued 500 times the bigger one - because of the future. It is most important to attempt to consider things in 1 year or longer when investing, not last quarter."

**Downsides.**

1. They have an ongoing case against generics in the US. But that only affects the US market, and only a fraction of the purpose of the drug which only affects less than 10% of sales in US market. They will have exclusivity for the rest of the world.
2. Big money is purposefully holding this down until what I believe will be a buyout later this year. Looking at options, in my opnion the buyout will be between $27-$35 by Jan22. If you can ‚úã[üíé](https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone/)[üíé](https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone/)‚úã while selling deep OTM calls to buy more shares, you will be good. But you would need patience.

a buyout is in the works by years end.**üöÄüåï**

That's a 100% increase YoY and could even get close to a 100% earnings expectations beat."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"/u/mcoclegendary is right in that when the 3 came out S/X sales fell. But now with Plaid coming and a refresh it will drive them back up. I expect 2021 to deliver more S/X than 2020. Maybe back to 2019 numbers. I doubt we'll have them back to 2018 numbers though.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the street and their analysts.


Tesla said they're aiming for 50% annual growth. Where do you get 100% from?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah of course model Y and model will outsell both model S and X. No doubt about that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it bear spread it is
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"500k delivered in 2020, without scaling up they'll be at 720k this year already, after a Q1 that is always the weakest quarter in the industry and was still hindered by COVID, 1-2 days shorter than the other quarters, and while they still have a massive expansion in Shanghai as well as two new factories coming online this year. Last year they ramped over 100% from Q1 to Q4, although Q1 then was affected by a factory shutdown due to COVID, ramping 78% this year with everything that's going on seems very feasible."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elon's internal conversations saying that 1M units in 2021 are within reach.    They provided guidance for an average 50% growth for 10 years. Some years will be higher, some will be lower. 2021 and 2022 will be HIGHER for sure. 20M / year by 2030-32."
2021-04-02 16:21:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a solid play... Ok, this is gonna be a very simple bit of DD...

The subject is our favourite stonk... You know the one...

Now, there's a lot of very optimistic DD out there, and sometimes I feel that does more harm than good... So here is a simple pessimist DD from the point of view of someone who does believe in the squeeze...

Now essentially every stonk play is gambling... The key to successful gambling is balancing risk vs reward... The ultimate example of this is if you imagine a standard, fair, coin toss. If someone said: ""for every dollar you bet on the coin toss, if you guess right you get 1.1 dollars and if you guess wrong you lose your dollar"", then in that situation the right play would be to take that bet over and over again for guaranteed infinite money in the long run...

So that's what successful gambling is all about. Making these probabilistically sound bets over and over and over...

Now let's apply that to the stonk in question... In a very simplified yet reasonable, though pessimistic, way...

Let's take a conservative top for the short squeeze to be $1000 and a conservative likelyhood for that outcome, given that you believe it is a serious possibility, of 25% chance of that squeeze happening.

Let's also take a pessimist worst case of $0 price for this stock without the squeeze happening at all, and a pessimistic probability of that happening of 25%...

And let's take a conservative case of the stock simply drifting down to it's price target of $170 and staying there, with a remaining likelihood of 50%...

Let's then assume that the average buy in price was an expensive $200 dollars...

So the total expected value of the play is as follows:

TEV = (1000 - 200) * 0.25 + (170 - 200) * 0.5 + (0 - 200) * 0.25 = 160.

SO THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE PLAY FOR EVERY $200 INVESTED IS $160 *PROFIT* ON AVERAGE...

Now that's a damn good play...

End of DD.

---

*Edit:*

It has been brought to my attention that good DD should be more informative. So I will include some, again, simplistic data points to inform and back the probabilistic analysis above...

1. Late January FTDs were in the millions. Ryan Cohen and BlackRock buy a lot of stock. Short squeeze ensued.

2. Short squeeze was artificially halted, and immediately collapsed, therefore the full short squeeze was not squoze

3. Late February, FTD data was underwhelming yet we had a gamma squeeze all the same continuing to early March.

4. Lots of calls at 800. Short squeeze halted at 450. Top of 1000 is a serious possibility.

5. Early March the stock was agressively shorted. Shares available are at zero practically.

6. Retail is buying and holding. Price has stabilized at an unexpectedly high 190

7. Points 2 to 5 and 9 below strongly suggest there is significant remaining hidden short interest that has not been covered

8. We know HFs and whales have mechanisms and leverage to massively manipulate the market

9. A lot of data is hidden to us the average Joe's

10. Points above support a significant chance of a short squeeze eventually, yet point 8 tempers that by a lot...

Given the above information the intial probabilistic analysis in the OP is very reasonable"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I use to go by the simple strategy - *high risk high retard*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read the everything short DD. This is a bigger problem than GME. Citadel have shorted the treasury bond market using repo. Once they get margin called they will have to buy GME at any price, 1000 will be nothing.

The scarier thing is the dollar losing its value so our tendies may become as valuable as Monopoly money"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""conservative top"" for a short squeeze is generally 10x the price of the stock when the squeeze begins. 

GME the shorts kept doubling, tripling, quadrupling down which is why it kept going up."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here‚Äôs why your DD is flawed. You forgot one simple fact,  Wall Street doesn‚Äôt obey laws. Not the laws put forth by our government, laws of averages, laws of statistics, it kind of obeys the laws of nature but just kind of."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost me at ""1k conservative""."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think it's going to happen. I bought at $19 and I am still holding just in case but I think the shorts had PLENTY of time to cover when the price dipped to $45 and anyone who thinks they didn't is a fool. I don't see a short squeeze as a possibility after a dip that far. I just like the stock long term so i am holding but anyone who thinks a squeeze is imminent is kidding themselves IMO.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You're mathematically illiterate
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Marijuana is a market performance enhancer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. There is a bigger problem than GME. When they get margin called for shorting the treasury bond market they might have to, or be forced to use all their money to rectify that, at the expense of all other stock. Meanwhile GME shares price stops dead in its tracks, or worse. Given the choice, I‚Äôm sure the government bodies will demand the bond market gets made right before anything else. I‚Äôm genuinely concerned by this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm giving a very conservative estimate based mainly on the massive number of 800 calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you also borrow money from your drug dealer?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street doesn‚Äôt obey laws and the SEC is complicit by giving small fines. 

However, even Wall Street is scared of litigation in federal court houses and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have to be willing to fight with everything we have to get our money if after the squeeze Wall Street doesn‚Äôt want to pay us."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but that is why the downside probability is at 75% and the upside only at 25%..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs an opinion so....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it‚Äôs overly overly simplistic and pretty much garbage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So how come it squeezed at the end of February if they covered at 40?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I second this motion. All in favor say ‚ÄúI‚Äù.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs doesn‚Äôt stop the GME situation though. Someone is on the hook for that in any case.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but isn't everything with regards to stock? Unless you have acces to stock market manipulation, or insider trading, or fresh data (which generally is not available to the public or average 9to5 joe), isn't even the best, most throughly researched DD, no more than an opinion?... Aren't we all just gambling here?..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It didn't? What do you even think a squeeze is/looks like??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For starters, your expected value calculation assumes only three possible values for GME: $1000, $170, and $0.

Google ""discrete vs continuous probability distributions."""

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, they didn‚Äôt borrow those shares from nobody"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree, but if they are not covering our shorts because they have to cover the bond market shorts how would our shares moon to where we want them to? What would increase the price of ours? I‚Äôm seriously dying to know."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DD is informative, someone‚Äôs guesstimating is an opinion. I don‚Äôt have an issue with it but it‚Äôs not groundbreaking stuff."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is OTB"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"People that really understand a business know how to break down a balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, bond ratings, debt covenants, etc....real business stuff that can tell you if a company has real value. This...this ain‚Äôt that. So no, real valuations are not gambling."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm simplifying to extremes. Would probably work out similarly with a continuous distribution.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All the flavors taste high.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel‚Äôs broker and the DTCC are legally obligated to cover for them. Meaning they have to buy our shares if Citadel can‚Äôt.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don‚Äôt think you understand the basic concept of supply and demand. This is not to chastise you, but consider the following:

In the stock market what makes a stock go up? People continuing to buy at whatever price the stock is sold for even if it continues to rise. Now imagine that there are a bunch of people not selling, but someone on the other side is **forced** to buy. 

In this simple exercise, the price will continue to rise until they no longer have to buy. What‚Äôs happening elsewhere doesn‚Äôt matter, if this scenario plays out. If shorts get margin called and are not forced to cover... well why would anyone ever invest in the US market again?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By your own logic this is DD. Traditional stock DD? No. But, as far as explaining the gambling side of this through a probabilistic or statistical matter, yes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, fair enough...

However, I would argue that sensible probabilistic analysis is DD... ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy's
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my sweet summer child... Go pick up a stats textbook, open it up to some later chapters‚ÄîI mean beyond chapter 3 where you learn about Expected Value of coin tosses and marbles pickings‚Äîand try your hand at some more realistic problems using this kind of simplifying intuition.

But no, to be honest, most of the people being critical of you here are only that way because we've all been there and gotten our asses kicked. I have a degree in math / econ so I had to take courses like econometrics. I passed but at times I almost quit for the same reason I quit physics once I got to QM: Intuition stopped working and ""nonsense"" stopped being fun for me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, OK, I understand that completely. We must get paid for our shares. The question I am asking is how much is a share worth? If the shorters don't cover the shares ie buying them in multiples of each other and causing a short squeeze, how will the share price increase? I don't want the DTCC or anybody else buying my shares from me at the price they are just now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre forgetting that they haven‚Äôt been playing by the rules at all since this began, so why would they follow any rule in the future. That is to say, they will not be buying en masse market orders because they ‚Äúhave to‚Äù... That is a guaranteed way to lose all money and crash economy. At the best, they will liquidate the shorts and cover at a slow enough pace and through dark pools so that the price barely increases and they are able to minimize losses as much as possible. That time frame could take years. But that‚Äôs normal for hedge funds and big money to take years for returns anyways. 

We saw the same with Bill Hwang‚Äôs liquidation. The margin loans were split among 4-5 banks who decided to slowly liquidate across a scheduled time table so as not to drastically rock the market. Their downfall was one firm decided to frontrun and get out ASAP. However, the rest of the 4 banks are still slowly liquidating at this point, barely affected the market prices in order to maintain stability. I see this as the de facto method for handling large liquidation and covering efforts. 

For all we know, the shorts have already been margin called. And the lenders have been slowly covering for the past 2 months with blocks of buy orders. This may be the reason we see so much buy pressure (rather than there being ‚Äúhero whales on our side‚Äù). And the lenders will continue doing so for god knows how long. Given that this is the Wall Street establishment and banking backbone, they can drag this on for years no sweat."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry but you pulled all your numbers and probabilities straight out of your ass and didn‚Äôt even bother to really source any of the extra points you added. The only information this post provides is that you personally think GME is a buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"pulling probability numbers out of your ass is not ""sensible probabilistic analysis"" tho"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they get margin called by their brokers or if DTCC says enough is enough find the shares to account for naked shorts with the new settlement rules coming in force, they will have to start buying at market price, as the market dries up the price will keep increasing, supply and demand. Eventually there will be very few shares left and the price will keep increasing as take profits are executed at various prices.
But they have so many naked shorts that the price will just shoot straight up"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be tricky. There might be court cases on how shares are valued but it probably involves large owners not retail owners. 

I guess I found a weekend project to add to my long to do list for whenever I have a free weekend. Hopefully we don‚Äôt need to go that route."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They were selling shares not buying shares when there aren‚Äôt enough to buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming that the data points are provided are common knowledge by now, hence no sourcing. What is new is not the data points, that would be impossible by now. What is original here is the analysis which I have not seen anyone else do yet... Please correct me if I'm wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Please see edit with data points as DD for probabilistic analysis. I'm being pessimistic about the upside and also on the downside risk. Further any one claiming to have probabilistic analysis that is anything more than a very rough estimate would be very disingenuous... I honestly believe this is as solid DD as it gets regarding this play...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, no it‚Äôs not solid at all."
2021-04-02 14:14:38,wallstreetbets,I bought on the way down and on the way up. Does that count as diversification?

As it went down ... I just kept buying back.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,BADABING!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Am at the point now where if I see a GME post I just sort comments by Controversial

I‚Äôm not sure what‚Äôs going on but I feel like something great is passing right by me and I‚Äôm just ignorantly smiling as y‚Äôall take advantage of it. I want to be apart of that.

I know, I‚Äôm probably gonna get shit for this, but if anyone has a little extra time today I would really appreciate it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost, you also need to buy GME from several different(get it) brokers. That is diversification."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that‚Äôs dollar cost averaging/reducing your cost basis

The important thing is do you like the stock?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf how much money yall have? Is that  infinite money glitch?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost 6,000 shares. GFC! You will be able to  do some amazing things with all those bananas"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs called dollar cost averaging. It‚Äôs not ‚Äúdiversifying‚Äú but it is the correct way to keep adding to an investment
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're diversifying autism with idiocy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't buy on way down or way up, you just bought lol.  ""Oh is there air to breath? Better buy GME."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like you're winning
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont post anything related to gme ü§®
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is Gme gonna bounce again then? Looked at it $50 a share and didn‚Äôt bother. Wish I had now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You made the right choice fellow ape. Congrats!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginning to realize these aren‚Äôt apes but rather stupid sheep
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's called cost averaging. Diversification requires a variety of investments to reduce risk. Gme is more of a trade stock at the moment but you are treating it like a long term buy and hold investment. If you really believe in it long term you are better off waiting for the meme to pass and buy when it is offered at a reasonable valuation.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way I started was unfortunately like what you were recommended; to google around, but to google on the right things i suppose.

Start looking into some investopedia sites on some of the terms going around; everytime there's a word you don't understand, just keep reading until you make some sense of it.

Download a balance sheet from a random company, and google the terms to slowly comprehend what everything means in the grand scheme of things.

I'll suggest reading into stocks first and ignoring anything options related; read into the different way people analyze stocks e.g discounted cashflow model.

Go take a looking at morningstar and look at the ratios, and google what they mean and at what numbers people perceive to be cheap and expensive. Start small from there. 

Various subreddits here other than WSB has many guides and introductions on valuations and what stocks are; you can start there.

Once you have learned how to value stocks and buy stocks, profit and then throw that money into options and flush it down the toilet, WSB style.

Obviously not financial advice."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just remember for every guy like this that turns 15k into 1M+ there are WAY WAY more that don't even come close or even lose some if not all their investment. This guy made this amount of money mostly through Option contracts so not only did he have to get the price direction right but he's on a time crunch too. What if GME didn't make this move until later this year or next year? He potentially would have taken a large loss.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, I literally poopoo and peepee onto my crayon drawings for the thrill of the sport. 

I will explain to you what I wish someone explained to me when I first started trading stocks. Don't throw your money into the market without going to a brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Fidelity, and download their trading software (Thinkorswim for TD, or Active Trader for Fidelity) and look up tutorials. These softwares usually have ""paper trading"", or the ability to make trades without real money for the sake of practice. The bottom line, is to learn your respective software (which one really doesn't matter), and read as much as you can about the different styles people have for interacting with the market. Using paper money for a few years is the best bet, as you'll get to know your own trading strategy and observe the market's behavior over a long period of time. You'll quickly find that a trading strategy might work in a certain market condition, but will completely fall flat in another condition. This is because no matter what you read on Reddit, or Motley Fool, or Seeking Alpha, or even Finviz, ZERO PEOPLE other than the market makers on Wall Street that have access to the real-time order flows have any idea whether or not a stock will go up or down. This is why it's so important to do what another user said and download a balance sheet for a random company, since these numbers are part of the ""fundamentals"" of a company and are pretty much all you're going to get in determining how well their stock price will do. Even then, it's flirting with divination. 

If you really want to help your family, consider investing in an index fund (look up tickers $VTI, $VOO, $QQQ). Index funds (and ETFs) are baskets of stocks that are bought by an investment bank that track a certain index. They allow you to invest in a highly diversified collection of stocks that track a certain part of the market or even a particular industry. $VTI, for example, is an index fund that tracks the total stock market, and moves up or down with the general trends of the market (the general trend historically, of which, is up). It even pays a dividend, which is basically a quarterly/monthly payment YOU receive for holding a stock. Index funds, since they are tracking a large, diversified basket of stocks, allow you to reap the benefits of diversification, without the need to learn how to be a star stock-picker or applied portfolio management. In fact, the returns you will get from investing in an index fund, over long periods of time, will almost always (by a large margin) beat stock-picking. Active managers simply do not make better returns over long periods of time than the overall index. That said, a few grand tossed into just $TSLA a few years ago would've made you a millionaire. It's a crap shoot, so if you don't have the money to lose, focus on saving and investing in safe bets as you build up your war chest. Being fiscally responsible and productive will help those around you more than picking the next $GME."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're looking for investment advice you need to go to /r/investing or /r/stocks. This is not a sub to learn the basics it is instead a place for fairly knowledgeable people to make risky, but often calculated, bets.   

But the short of it is that a stock is a portion of a company that is worth a certain value based (theoretically) on that companies fundamentals. The better a company performs or its future outlook, the more likely the price of that stock is to rise. The flip side is true and the worse (theoretically) a company performs the more likely the stock is to drop.  

A companies value on the stock market is the number of shares outstanding x the current trading price. A company like Apple (ticker $AAPL) has a market cap of $2.06 trillion with 16.79 billion shares available, which puts the price of a single share of Apple at $123. Check the stock value and look https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL it costs $123 to buy one share.   

So although a company may have a smaller market value, its number of shares available for trade could be less so it trades at a higher price.   

This is why some companies like Tesla ($TSLA) which is a $635 billion company trades at a stock price of (currently) $658 as they only have a total stock outstanding of 959.85 million.   

This is basic supply and demand.   

Buying a share is a Long position because you're usually buying it now expecting it to increase at a later date.   

Some companies pay dividends which is a payment to you from the company for a certain percentage specified by the company as a reward for investing in them. Your money makes you money but its return is smaller than your initial investment to get those shares in the first place.   

That is the absolute bare minimum to understand what a stock is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I feel like something great is passing right by me and I‚Äôm just ignorantly smiling as y‚Äôall take advantage of it

That sort of thinking will ruin you. There's even a name for it (FOMO). For every million dollar post you see, there are thousands losing money they can't afford to lose buying stocks on a hunch. 

People make or lose money based on the conviction they have on a particular stock. Something great will ALWAYS pass right by you but you don't have to dive in if you don't understand it. Not making money is a lot better than losing what little you have."

The section about index funds really interested me. If they almost always beat stock-picking, and if you're receiving dividends from the companies you're investing in, is the only reason to invest in a single company is for the hopes of what happened to OP here? And I'm sure it depends on how much you have invested in said index fund, but how much can you receive monthly by having those dividends be sent to you? It doesn't seem like there's much risk when it comes to index funds."

I‚Äôll go and spend some time browsing those Reddit‚Äôs. I kinda have a grasp on the basics but not necessarily an understanding of them. It seems like I have a lot of reading to do.

And thankfully because of that I haven't lost anything, but nor have I gained. I'll be patient. I'm young and I like to think I'm smart.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems like there isn't a lot of risk, because there isn't. Especially when investing in a fund with a large net like VTI (it has 3,500+ stocks in it). Side note: you do not receive dividends from the companies in the fund's holdings, you just receive the dividend from the index fund itself (in VTI's case, 1.38% yield which comes out to about ~$0.70 per quarter, per share). VTI, like most dividend yielding stocks, distribute dividends four times per year at the end of each fiscal quarter, rather than monthly. Beware of stocks with high monthly dividend distributions, because that means they are prioritizing shareholder payments rather than reinvesting shareholder money into the company/fund to improve it. In the market, if it's too good to be true, it usually is. That said, even if you're holding an index fund, a market crash a la 2008, 2018, or 2020 will still affect you, there is no running from the market crashing. That is the inherent risk with putting money into ANYTHING in the stock market.

The reason to invest in a single company is if you have high conviction in the company. For example, a popular growth stock is Apple, since they have an incredibly strong innovation track record. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google account for a full third of the stocks tracked in the entire NASDAQ, so Wall Street in general has a high conviction on these particular companies. Warren Buffett's largest holding in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is Apple. 

Many people find themselves in a position where they are largely invested in a single company when they work for said company and have company stock that is granted to employees (many companies will offer employees stock in the company as part of or instead of a pay raise). For example, I've heard of someone that has $1.2 million in AT&T stock since he worked as an engineer for them since the 80s. AT&T pays a great dividend, and his retirement is fully funded by AT&T dividends that he reinvested into fixed-income bonds. He never has to work again a day in his life."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One small advice. There will be days where it will feel like there is no chance for you to understand a concept because everything about it sounds like Latin. Sleep on it, but don't give up. Some ape was able to learn it, so you too can. Document things as you learn, especially when you don't fully understand. Document it the way you understand it, and also what you don't understand. Days later (or even weeks later), if you continue striving to learn, things will start coming together.

The other thing is that Google Search is only as good as the keywords you feed it. Some days, you will search and search and find nothing. But when you finally discover the right word you needed to search, you will get the result you wanted to see.

Finally, some concepts are just simply harder than others. Accept it and be mentally prepared. This is very true as you transition from equities to derivatives (options, etc.)."

As for understanding stocks, it‚Äôs not that complicated. Making good plays is hard ofc but there‚Äôs not much to it. You think a company will be worth more? Buy. What affects this value? Their sales/revenue and people‚Äôs opinions on them

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">how do you know? If the only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do?   

You don't is the simple answer. Market makers don't either. 

The first thing to understand is that a stock is only worth what people think it's worth; and what they think it is worth is what they're willing to pay for it.   

How do you determine that? Well like you've said you look into the fundamentals of a company. What do they offer? What is the demand of that service or product? Is there a place for it? What growth have they shown to improve our expand? Are they getting rid of dead weight in the company? Are they early in their market and in your opinion completely under valued based on what they're offering? Are they hiring known people with a history of massive returns. Etc etc for a million other reasons and possibilities.   

We call this doing your Due Diligence, or DD for short. It's making sure that before you decide to go long on a company that you have done as much research as possible and have a very high certainity that it is going to plan out as you see. It's a risk, it's always a risk, because going back to what I said although you may be ""right"" if the majority don't agree on your valuation then you're out of luck. But if you're early and it sky rockets then congratulations you've hit gold, enjoy your tendies.   

Selling is purely when you feel its the right time to do it. There's a saying on this sub if it's good enough to screen shot it's good enough to realise (sell). But people are greedy and usually hang on for more and more and lose out as the market corrects itself.   

Some companies are seen as ""safe"" due to their consistent year on year profits, like Coca-Cola, but because of this your investment is unlikely to make any substantial growth in the short term, because its expected to perform very high, so it has a slow trend up and tends to trade sideways.   

But it all boils down to doing your research, having a great understanding of the product and its application, and trying to spot future trends etc. Then making sure youre not blinded by your own research and challenge it to make sure you're right.   

There are things like ETFs that exist that are basically a group of companies all put into one ""stock"", and they're fairly reliable because even if only one company fails to perform the other companies in that ETF can make up for it.   

The most common one I expect you to know of is $SPY. Which is a group of the top performing companies in America. SPY 100 = Top 100. SPY 500 = Top 500 etc. But that's another topic."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> how do you know? If the only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do?

You invest based on probabilities. There's a reason why a lot of poker players are good at trading. Trading is all about probabilities. You form a strategy, test it with small amounts repeatedly until you have confidence in it. Even then you can be wrong. A good trade can lose money. And a horrible one can make you lots of money. The hard part is knowing the difference. 

Everybody gets it wrong but the key to trading is risk management. So, even if you lose half the number of times, you can still come ahead if you have a 1:3 (risk:reward) strategy. Look up position sizing to learn more."

I can see it going badly now, the holders ( I was one of them before that ) had a massive opportunity, and I believe people in the boardroom were paid to fuck us by the hedgefund.

When 11% of frequent moviegoers (defined as once a month or more) make up 47% of tickets sold  in the US. (2019)  It's just a matter of time until this goes back.  It may take a year or two to pay off some of the debt incurred by COVID, maintaining empty theaters, next to no revenue, but it will come back. 

 I don't buy the digital sky is falling talk, the way attendance.  Watching Godzilla v Kong was painful on my 75 incher.  I need that in fucking IMAX."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You understand that the share dilution still has yet to be voted on right? And that the CEO himself said that it wouldn‚Äôt be utilized right away even if it does get approved.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously don‚Äôt know how options work doesn‚Äôt need to hit 12 to be in profit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't bag holding. This is wall street BETS. and this moron BET that AMC will pop up. If it pops to $14 a share any time before mid May, then this guy is allowed to whip out his wang and slap you with it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm leaning on voting against. There are better ways of raising money. If they want to help Melvin out of a squeeze they can do it with fewer shares.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The better ways are revenue (which will take a while) or debt (which they are up to their eyeballs in). Issuing new capital should be a last resort and ideally have a plan behind it on how to put money to use so it benefits shareholders long run even if in the short run they are disadvantaged.

To me seems like lose/lose: not sure if the new share issue would solve their issues, and not sure what their plan is if/when it gets voted down. Given the size and sentiment or retail I can see that happening."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also agree, no new shares. They literally just made new shares a few months ago, if even that long.

Where do I vote?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if the vote passes, there has to be another vote to release them. There are also SEC rules where you can't just do one big dump of them. It would be incremental. You're looking at the very least a couple years before all shares would be on the market."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This probably is another last ditch effort tbh.

They paid of a stack of debt, but still have billions to repay.

They would ideally sell chunks of stock for 10k a pop, with something like a 1% discount to raise temporary money, against share price... They already have so many goddamn shares it might not even hurt price. 

It looks like even just the sentiment of dilution hurt their price today... Maybe they can drop their stock price enough to incest in themselves tho? 

There are literally hundreds of technical possibilities"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just making up the shit about another vote to release them? What sec rule about ‚Äúwhere you can‚Äôt just do one big dump of them‚Äù?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME's 10-K didn't look much better than AMC's if we're being completely honest:

\--Under earnings estimate

\--Closure of almost 700 locations

\--No real estimates for growth in the 10-K. None of Cohen's ambitions were outlined

\--Talks of their own dilution with the ATM program expansion

People really want to pretend fundamentals don't matter for GME, but expect everyone to pull out the magnifying glass for AMC. Cohen could announce tomorrow that they plan to open a Gamestop on the moon, even though it is absolutely not in their budget to do so, and people here would believe it, lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What like buy calls and puts like months out , with about 50 bucks between each and the actual  stock price ? Than just wait for the swings and sell ?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"100%, there's not even a guarantee that just because they have the right to issue the shares they will, but:
1) I don't see how else they can get themselves out of the situation they're in
2) 500m shares seems like a shitload, that's like 100% of outstanding shares. My company is asking for approx 10% to further expand our commercial capabilities and even that is not a sure thing whether it gets accepted by shareholders. I can't imagine them getting the rights to this and somehow leaving the authorized capital on the back burner, ESPECIALLY if they feel like the current price is temporary due to some stuff on message boards they don't fully understand but they think it can go down as fast as it went up
3) self fulfilling prophecy as the temporary influx from retail was predominantly there to get them some tendies. Having the value of their investment halved overnight with no guarantee of a squeeze beyond the gammas of the past few weeks may be enough for a significant amount of them to cash in now, expecting others to do the same

There's a number of reasons why I am more bullish on GME than AMC (debt situation, SI etc) but the biggest difference in my opinion is that Ryan Cohen seems to be arriving with a vision and has already dramatically altered the management team with the BoD to follow, you feel like things are being completely transformed over there. Regardless of your stance on either stonk, surely AMC holders would love it if they too had some kind of vision and transformation driving the fundamentals regardless of the fuckery with the stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that's right, I already voted then"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is because you don't understand how it works. Lets say consensus is for the 500,000,000 shares, they still have to have an ADDITIONAL shareholder vote to release them. Finally, according to SEC rules, they would only be able to introduce a certain number of shares per quarter out of the pool.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent analysis, my man"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is the issuing company here so rule 144 doesn‚Äôt apply. Did you actually read that link? Also waiting for your support that the ceo would need another vote to ‚Äúrelease‚Äù shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I bought a call and a put , had to double down on the put once and made about 7k most recently"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And? People are making money on amc by doing puts for the past several weeks. People made money today on puts because amc keeps dropping way more than gme.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure people make money everyday , as long as they are smart about it .

2021-04-02 08:40:03,wallstreetbets,"NFPs tomorrow and the treasuries market (TLT, GOVT, AGG) While everyone has their grand day off (including me, even though honestly I should be at the desk because the mortgage/TBA market is still trading), we have the currently most important piece of data to come out of the United States. 

(as an aside, right now NFPs are 1st, even though I can see CPI inflation becoming the most watched in the next couple of months)

Those are the non-farm payrolls. Basically employment numbers, or how many of our fellow apes have finally hit 0.00 on the account and now gainfully employed and contributing to society through manning the Wendy's counter. The more wagecucks, the more spending. The more spending, the more companies have to hire wagecucks and so on. 

https://preview.redd.it/v8svd5o9soq61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1d0fb1341907cc26729ba79b968c4eb6a39698

I fully expect a blowout number, well above the 647k which is what we're playing with (expectations are set at 650k, so the higher it is, the more unexpectedly bearish for fixed income, and the lower it is below 650k, the more bids there will be for fixed income). 

Why? March takes into account the massive jump in vaccinations. This also plays into the fact that in March, around 20 states have increasingly lowered their age restrictions for vaccines. Every reasonable business owner sees this, and because there is a certain 1-2 week or so lag between interviews. Remember in March 2020 when everyone is trying to front-run the dips, June/July front-run the recovery, and now Citadel trying to front-run the RH GME Diamond Hand Apes? This is the same thing but now in the employment market. 

And this time, all the job gains are in the service industry, the same industry that vomited jobs as we entered the lockdowns. Do you need someone with skills to flip burgers? No. This is all low-hanging (easy to train, no need for previous experience) fruit that's about to get harvested not by hand, but with an industrial thresher that will make your mom blush. Companies are able to hire truckloads of these $7.25/hr minwagecucks because they're cheap, and this time they're needed. In every economic cycle, low-wage service sector jobs are the first to get dumped off the cliff, and first to get shoveled back in. We're just seeing the start of this.

**What does this mean for:**

**Equities**: all these boomer/doomers need to STFU and go suck Cramer's ass hair. A rising yield is good for equities because if a treasury is pulling in 2%/yr RISKFREE, equities need to go higher. Why did tech do a 10% correction during the last 10yr jump from 1.5% to 1.75%? Because no one expected it to go that high. Now my fellow retards at the office and I are expecting 2% to hit as early as June, and so is every other person I'm talking to (mostly my mom). 2% is as good as priced in right now, and because everyone is expecting it, I do not expect an equities tantrum... unless we somehow cross that line and go straight into 2.5%

**Bonds**: this has what I've been mostly doing, apart from some ag and metals. Simple as that - yields go up, bond prices go down. No need to worry about blah blah how this will translate into growth. From basically the realization that the US is going to lead the way with vaccinations, this thing has been going straight down.

&#x200B;

Why tomorrow? Equity markets are closed. The treasuries market will be open, but extremely light in volume. Any blowout number, coupled with no one to trade may lead to a vaccum, amplifying single direction moves. Perhaps we might even get a [rare circuit breaker](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/price-limits.html#interestRates) in the treasuries futures markets. 

Good luck all. Positions below. A lot of 129 Puts for June, which I don't expect to go ITM.

Also you guys buying TLT puts are kinda throwing money away. IV for Puts of the May chain are like 15%. Similar IV for Puts of the June chain (also 50 days to exp) on /ZN (10yr treasury futures) is around 5%. I know it's 20yr vs 10yr but srsly the duration should not mean you're paying 3x as much for volatility. Larry Fink or whoever is writing these is laughing to the bank.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol I got my small entry in at the spike up to 16"". 900k jobs isn't bad and the position is small enough to hold into the weekend. I think treas futures close today at 10am ct"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TD. I don't think there is margin for futures options
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I see, the eventual ""fed will step in before yields choke the economy"" or ""covid 21"" or ""ww3"" play"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"1015 CT today. I took a small win on ZB, closed it out and am flat for the weekend. Happy Good Friday!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks man, next time! Just hope my TLT puts print, but it'll be a big short moment if it's limit down today and I can't close my position lmao"

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO made $9.04 Billion in revenue.
* They spend more than $-14 Billion with a loss of $-3.0 Billion.
* Investors lost $-5.4 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $14.8 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 18.1% a year for the next 5 years. That means SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO will be worth $50.4, which represents a **-17.5%** downside from the current price.

Recovery Trajectory (based on Zack estimates)

If you assume by 2025 LUV goes back to pre-pandemic earnings and P/E - then the stock is **overvalued** by 17.5% ...

Disclosure: I do not long or short LUV"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir positions or ban
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love bear DD for airlines
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. People all think LUV will bounce back the quickest because it has the least corporate travel and the worry is corporate travel isn‚Äôt coming back as quickly / may have permanently changed. So folks bought in hard and now it‚Äôs super overvalued IMO.

I like UAL more, but it does have a good chunk of corporate clients. Alaskan was another good one but has recently gone the same way as LUV.

AAL has legitimate operating issues and a ton of debt so I‚Äôm not touching that one."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Went long 155 shares under $30. Still long 100 shares. Trimmed it back 55 shares at about $40. Got a short call for September at $57.50 since that‚Äôll be LTCG. I‚Äôm happy to sell at that price.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I LUV
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My preferred airline is IAG - during pandemic they brought up competition in multiple regions. Post-pandemic their stock will go higher than it was and it‚Äôs still cheap imo. Price will hike when London/NY route re opens
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall Street growth forecasts are too low with GDP set to grow 6-10%
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people skip over JetBlue ($6B-market) but it‚Äôs a good candidate to be merged into someone larger like Delta or Southwest. It‚Äôs also a good looking candidate because it‚Äôs only $20 now (wishing I held my $14 shares from Nov!) and it‚Äôs one of the few airlines that specialize flights to the Caribbean and Puerto Rico (Puerto Ricans love seeing their families back home!! Trust me, my grandma still flies every 2-3 years and she‚Äôs in her mid 80s!)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm with you on UAL. Like LUV, but see more upside with UAL. Already own BA, though, so probably won‚Äôt go into an airline."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"UAL tends to rise more when the industry rises, and falls less when the industry declines."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed
2021-04-02 07:52:19,wallstreetbets,Someone tell TSLA do that rip thing..I‚Äôm on my last leg.. 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your 2020 tax forms are available.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You have 4K left from 100K at top??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am banking so much on the next Monday in the next week. I am just hoping that because of the long weekend and markets closed many of the gamblers will be more than happy to gamble At risky trades.

I swear if  does not open with 1% I‚Äôm gonna suck my dick."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd take the 2K loss before you lose all of it next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tomorrow they should have their car delivery üöö numbers. If they beat expectations I think of 170k Q1 next week Tesla will üöÄ. I have calls too. 690 4/16C
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúIt‚Äôs just money‚Äù. I knew a guy that used this phrase a lot...We are no longer friends.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You mean to say you already gambled all of your stimulus?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,losing money on Tesla now I‚Äôve seen it all
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Delivery beat in a big way. You might make it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Papa Elon just saved you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Papa has your back. Godspeed my friend!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You might want to roll those to the 23rd. Or don't, idk. You looked good and fucked."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSLA huge beat, you might be saved by Papa Elon after all."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like it‚Äôs your lucky day
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone in Tesla is gonna be fine
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hand that shit to expiration! All or nothing baby! It'll only take 1 or 2 green days to get you close to even
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm down from 220k at the height of the gme squeeze to 15k.. I was at 1500 at the beginning of the week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,More pain to come. It needed a haircut but the barber is old and has shaking hands....and TSLA is a high top.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Charge your phone
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Figures they announce today on a fucking closed day. Would have been exactly the catalyst to fn moon these things. DIS did the same shit to me. Announced the California park opening on Friday night. By Monday fed ripped it apart.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just why? Tesla was already on a downtrend when you bought the options. 

Must not like money?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats, papa saved ur bitch ass"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don‚Äôt sell at a loss unless you can no longer afford a roof over head, warm place to sleep, and food for you and your loved ones. Diamond hand that shit. If you didn‚Äôt stop out at 3% loss, there‚Äôs no point now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That would suck if it rockets after it expires worthless.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pain
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit you might just pull it off
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So is your battery...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the 720c will be ITM eod monday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe don‚Äôt buy calls on a company that‚Äôs already up 800% in the past year and is already extremely overvalued...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Never. And I mean never....count on Tesla.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What? Tesla still a thing?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,#rip
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I paid my taxes, and got $4,800 back.

Yes some of that was from capital losses, but it is still money I had for my Roth IRA."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs balance are you at now?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hot ü•î those bitches before you take a serious L on the 9th.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You should be good unless we get some new Archegos story
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,OR BAN
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, for 2021 he probably won't owe much after this trade"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, blew the whole shit. Peak at 135k.. imma do it again though. This Icarus ain‚Äôt dead ü¶Ö"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Spending 96K on FDs goes by real quickly when having fun with invisible internet friends üôÉ...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,MODS!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ban this guy and unban if he delivers.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought you already did that?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla will moon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks and guy better done paying taxes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yaya I was down 60-80% on Tesla calls for a week, doubled than tripled down. Got down to 1500 at the bottom and end the week at 15k. 

Tesla faked everyone out now they sending it flying to 800 next week"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,i have been taking losses just to see stocks go up right after....fucking hell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He has to wait until next week regardless
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">livery üöö numbers. If they beat expectations I think of 170k Q1 next week Tesla will üöÄ. I have calls too. 690 4/16C

thats not as ballsy as OP lol 690c and for a couple weeks lol...i sold my 645c 4/16 and bought a weekly 670c"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"BOYZZZZZ we are going to the fucking moon next week on these calls! Massive growth in deliveries vs last year and beat last quarter! 184,400 delivers to estimates of 160,000!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just a heads up alot of close followers of Tesla are thinking they'll actually miss this quarter.  See troy teslike on Twitter, Tesla daily etc.  A combo of barely any refreshed model s/x deliveries, closure for the couple days due to chip shortage, giga press fire etc.    A beat would be a straight miracle at this point, but fingers crossed anyways!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How can you lose buying calls on a stock that 10xs in 2 years? There is always a way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs a life changing loss to most of us, hope you recover"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same bro...same
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs your price target ?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LMFAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,More like never bet against Tesla. OP just a noob trying to time the market and make fast money. With Tesla just buy leaps and win.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dumbest comment I've read today. Congrats.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Disagree per delivery report that was released today
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,F
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck OP. What are some plays you think of?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Then reban after he delivers!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,When was this tho? TSLA been fucking around with everyone‚Äôs emotions for a minute now
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This aged very well
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beat by 10k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,By trying to time the market with short expiration calls. If you want to win just buy leaps and relax. A lesson all the noobs will need to learn or they wont last long.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It is.. I started with 10k in December which was my life savings.

Appreciate it"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,3.50 and I hope op knows I just messing with him... I've blown money on lotto tickets too.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ouch. Looks like someone still holding. lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm a tech kinda dude. TTD SHOP TIGR ROKU for the month. But I‚Äôm gonna throw my life into SOXL if the Musk man prevails.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely ban after he delivers a load into his own mouth.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I'm surprised but glad to be wrong :D. Insane numbers considering all the slowdowns this quarter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla leaps. Sure they‚Äôre great if you have 25k for one for damn contract or go so far otm even Cathie wouldn‚Äôt buy it. I hope he hits Monday am!! Then hope aboard the SPY train. It‚Äôs the only option worth doing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just buy shares, use margin if I want leverage."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiot.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are pretty expensive. I have 5 360 calls, 3 400c and 2 600c all purchased last year. The 360 calls started as 1 call for 10k pre split. 360's expire June 2022 the rest are Jan 2023. Right now is great time to buy AG leaps 12 or 15 strike imo. I'm just some retard on the internet though so invest at your own risk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can buy vertical spreads for as cheap as you want. Just capped profits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you get good margin rates.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Those sound great to me! Timing is everything
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think 1.9% on IB.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, nice. IB is the best for margin but I hate the platform."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the desktop app is like msdos. Its not user friendly at all. And if you ask the support they basically tell you RTFM. But it seems to be a solid broker overall. They have all kinds of intruments. I never thought I would need margin for example but now that I need it I am glad I am already on the right platform.
2021-04-02 07:20:30,wallstreetbets,412k QQQJ YOLO - April 1st 2021 - Rumors of my paper handed death have been greatly exaggerated. 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my God.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I have played QQQJ options and made out well. But after playing them for several months, I don't want to be in your position. What makes QQQJ great is it's a steady climber. Hardly had any downside until just recently. But an $8 upside move in just a couple months, I really do hope for your sake it makes it's first hard move to the upside. I'll be watching it and rooting for you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ive been suffering from an infection (Not Covid-19 that, I've already had twice) and have been totally out of it most days this week. A mod also reached out and recommended that I should probably switch over to a weekly vs daily update until I get closer to Expiration"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the horrible hopeless retarded shit I came here to see!

Edit: I genuinely hope this shit hits 40+ and you can tell us all to go to hell"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh fuck.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm fascinated by all of your tabs - my guy is exploring the Nazis, Warhammer, Space Wolves, FB, something about a woman being rejected by a panther, and WSB of course. Your bookmarks are a whole other rabbit hole in themselves."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your trading career looks bright!!!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"been holding a few $35C 6/18 since december, was +100% at one point and now I'm down 60% but still holding"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember it's only money just numbers on a screen I lost 100k on a stupid weekly and my life is no different then it was before. After this if it doesn't print then you could say you took the shot which isn't something most people could say. I'm rooting for you.

I think the good thing is we are almost topped out on interest rate increases, probably be done end of May or June. Once interest rate stops increasing then it going go up.

And if the fed announces yield curve control then the qqq going skyrocket."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QQQJ did do a $8 upside in 4 months. Nasdaq also crashed alongside it then. I think it wont go up vertically but it will start to curve the arc up closer to the summer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling my QQQJ calls in January gave me nearly triple my initial investment, which I then YOLO‚Äôd into GME calls right before the January liftoff.  Super happy that I went through with that decision after seeing QQQJ performance lately."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha ha funny man. I see what you did there
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet that an ETF is gonna be above 40.  So far im very wrong
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Problem for the SEC is that I'm betting that an ETF of 100 stocks is gonna go up. I would love to have them worm their heads up my ass and see them fail
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right at the peak. If I had waited a month I would have been able tl grab the 35s for even less than these.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why do i like this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah I have no doubt it will climb. The issue is theta burn with the rate of climb. I've had weeks where it was a wash even though the stock price climbed. If it picks up pace in the summer like you anticipate you'll be sitting well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It doubled my initial investment. Which I then YOLOd into AMC options

In all seriousness if the market goes up next week pretty well I will HODL on for dear life."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so too. You only need to be right a few times in order to never work another day in your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not likely a dying position though. He probably paid somewhere like $1.30-1.65 for those contracts depending when he bought assuming it was in December when there was the hype for those contracts. 

The 6/18 35c were as low as like .35 per contract just a few days ago and are already back to .60. It's a gamble but he could easily bring his average under $1, even close to .6 if he wanted, and would have 2.5 months for profits"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so too.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"hope you feel better soon. i just get worked up by people saying ""jUsT gEt ThE sHoTs bRo"". its not like i can just go out and get it."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QS? Also what do you mean by Head and Shoulder's pattern?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quantum scape. It's a EV battery stock.
Head and shoulders is when you look on a 6 month stock price history. 
Just Google it in the context of stocks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QQQJ has been out only 6 months. Im fairly certain almost every stock and etf has gone down their first few months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you want is for this bitch to get to 42,  and i pray for you my guy.


 edit : That's a 24% move, with all it's components having run up already the past year, it's tough. 
Since it was created in 6 months it went up 20%."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Im fairly certain that it will hit 35 within 5-10 days and could hit 40 by EOM
2021-04-02 07:09:45,wallstreetbets,Can someone with math skills tell me how much will I lose if we open flat Monday? Theta $1.09 x 7 contracts 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You shouldn‚Äôt be dabbling with options if you can‚Äôt figure this out yourself. Not trying to be an ass, but going off of this, and a few of your last posts, you might be a bit in over your head with option trading."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,-$1.09 x 7 x 100 = -$763.  This of course assumes no change in the underlying.  If it opens and closes at the same price you'll still lose $763. And it will be worse the following day.  Best of luck Ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All of it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Math is that hard?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôll be down about 55% if it opens flat.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a look at the Greeks. If it stays flat then you‚Äôll lose close to the theta
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôll make this easy for you, no math. If it opens flat you‚Äôre down another $2000; you‚Äôll be able to sell the contracts around $10.50 or so, bid will be around $10 and ask will be around $11.  

Note: it‚Äôs highly unlikely that it will open flat. More likely that it opens up or down some.  For your options to remain flat you‚Äôll want to see an open around $195, and you‚Äôll lose more than $2500 on the open if it opens around $190. Good luck; you never know anymore when the GME army will push it up more or if the shorts and day traders will rule the day."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you going be jumping into furnace after losing all that RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In layman‚Äôs terms.. you is fucked
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on where GME opens on Monday. I figured these are the 4/9 $200 Calls. Simple theta calculation is $109 per contract x 7 contracts but you should go on optionsprofitcalculator.com and check out the price vs date calculation. There are a lot of other Greeks in play but OPC should give you a better idea.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro stop buying options. You said you lost $200k? Imagine your gains if you bought $200k worth of shares at even a share price of $100.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôve seen that site recommended a lot. I‚Äôm also new to options trading and the GUH factor is real. Options trading calc should give a rough idea of the relationship between the underlying and the options?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The fight between long and short could take awhile.  I think you‚Äôre gambling anyways, roll them if you still think it will pop."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When people say roll them, they are saying that if you‚Äôre ok with the gambling aspect, there isn‚Äôt much wrong with selling and then repurchasing the same strike with a bit more time on it. You might end up with less contracts by rolling but you‚Äôre still in the game for a pop.  And if it doesn‚Äôt pop then you‚Äôve still lost the money but the arcade game quarter lasts a bit longer.

I personally only buy LEAPS options. I really want the long term capital gains advantage on my winners so I hold just about everything for a full year or more. And the only way to do that with options is to get expirations more than a year out. That‚Äôs all LEAP means, the L is for long - an option with more than a year to work with. But they have horrible thetas and that‚Äôs why most people want shorter terms."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is wrong, at least lately. There is a ton of decay on the weekend. 

For example; I was holding spy puts during the last 3 day weekend (/es trading may cause these to have more decay than a single stock, but point stands) and they incurred at least 2.5 days of full theta burn. This was adjusted for any $ changes due to vega/delta etc. 

There is no way you open a contract Friday at close and it opens up Monday morning without incurring any theta decay. That would be a gamma freeroll because even though shares might not trade, information is flowing and that can easily lead to gaps at open."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"u should be more scared of IV tbh, next time buy shares instead of options on GME. theta gang wins üò≥"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me chime in. You can make money if the stock jumps to $200 early in the week and then climbs consistently towards $215 and above. All perfectly feasible. The issue is that it might not do that and you will quickly lose 90% of your investment. Once you lose 90%, you are better off gambling the remainder value to expiration. Well, that's what I would do given the situation. 

But if the stock jumps dramatically, you'll make some nice money and that's the risk/reward decision to be made. If you are OK vaporizing your investment for the possible reward, go for it. If not, you can get out of those calls asap and buy the shares instead. Another option is to exit the calls and sell short a GME put. If you get assigned you'll own the shares at a lower price, if not, then you would be taking GME bears' money and recoup the portion lost from those calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe a lot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For starters, IV on üî•. You overpaid to begin with. Theta at -1.09, so it‚Äôll drop by ~$1.09/day.


But this is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea theta and delta on this call sucked to begin with, not worth the premium. That same premium would‚Äôve had u way ITM elsewhere."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're actually retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.09 a day is what you lose plus a little extra cause theta increases as it gets closer to opex.

IV on that contract seems really low for gme. People saying watch for the IV crush, IV is kind of low right now cause we traded relatively flat last week. Expect it to be higher next week.

Learn options before you start trading them.

I can't see what strike and expiration they are. 

Also, you have probably lost less then u think you did.

Bid/ask spread on that is super wide, it's probably worth more then what crappy rh is showing.

Never use market orders to buy options and never use market orders to sell options. Rh is always going steal..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can only lose what you paid for the contract
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For the love of god sell and by shares you dipshit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You times that by 100 and it‚Äôs 109 per day you‚Äôre losing to theta
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"‚ÄúIf it‚Äôs in the news, you lose.‚Äù Find a better, less followed stock. GME trading ‚Äî especially short-term options ‚Äî are too hard to predict.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep same boat. I think it‚Äôs a strategy the hedgies are playing. Just kill the theta on all these call options (and also kill the momentum on the stock) then make some sort of desperation move to try and tank it. They‚Äôre running out of plays here tbh

Edit: lol misunderstandings on this comment... I don‚Äôt even have a lot of options and overall I‚Äôve done very well on options. All it takes is one day and it‚Äôs green again, don‚Äôt forget it!"

You guys really want that 10 bagger then stop wasting all your money and just buy in a hole it‚Äôs literally the easiest money anybody can make. Step one, buy.  Step two, set a price alert for 1000.

Hey,  [u/anthont2828](https://www.reddit.com/user/anthont2828/) you're not getting theta fucked as much as you're getting IV fucked."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Step one should be get the F outta RH
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Per day too

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Per share, so $109 per contract."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low volume options like that the bid ask is rarely accurate

BIDX1 meaning there is 1 person out there willing to buy the option from you for 12.60

ASKX1 meaning there is 1 person out there willing to sell you the option for 14.

If I was to go in and put in a limit buy for 13 and it didn't fill all of a sudden your options would be worth more...

Better off searching for an option price calculator so you know what the contracts are actually worth... you ever go to sell those cause there is no buyers or sellers you are going have to take a haircut."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$13,999 loss, cuz I‚Äôll buy it when it hits 0.01. Nice 1$ lottery ticket"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit you have 7 of them? When do they expire like next week?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Time is dead and we have killed it"". - Market makers, probably."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain for monke pls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So by Monday these are down 99.99?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How much would I lose if we open flat Monday?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It would have to hit 220+ next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes next Friday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If everything remains true, you will be down $109 per contract x 7 = -$763....per day**** (most people think theta stops on the weekends for some reason, this is false, the truth, TVOM and decay stop for no one, not even long weekends) then add in the dip that kills ur positions more at around 9am est for an additional x2 loss so give or take -$1500"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I don't mean to be an asshole but if you're buying options you should know all this already. Use that link below next time and be prepared instead of going in blind.

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"200c right? If you hold to opex it's going be worth 1$ for every 1$ over 200 at expiration times 100 times 7.

Depends upon how bullish you are about next week in particular and what your risk taking is like.

If it is even a penny less then 200 next week going be completely worthless.

But if u sell just remember you already paid theta for a long weekend and going take a haircut cause no one is buying/selling with frequency it has a wide bid ask."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but to answer your question yes it‚Äôs per contract. r/thetagang is killing it in GME. I stay away from these options."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So I will have 1500 left by Monday from 9k?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta doesn‚Äôt decay much over weekends. Market closures (holidays and weekends) are priced into the option.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you need to be an asshole. OP is why hedge funds get away with the traunch options they write. If you can bag shit and someone buys it, why not?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, bro you are losing $110 (let‚Äôs round) per day each contract. Friday/Saturday/Sunday, is -$330 per contract x 7 contracts is -$2310. When Monday open comes if you don‚Äôt close, theta will be even higher, as it‚Äôs also growing while the market is closed due to TVOM, the theta will hit harder and harder.

On Monday, expect theta to be more, so that‚Äôs also an additional $-770 bare min if you hold and the stonk goes left to the right.

Today you closed on your contracts total investment return* of -$4000 (rounded).

Friday it will be -$4770

Saturday it will be -$5540

Sunday it will be -$6310

Monday EOD it will be -$7080, for your total investment return.

Tuesday -$7850

Wednesday -$8620

Thursday -$9390

Friday -$10,160 bare min..

Lastly, and don‚Äôt forget, MY FAVORITE way to lose $, factor In theta kill by the market makers churning the stock....and it expires worthless.**

One again this is all things staying equal and constant, and pending a godsend prayer from the stonk gods.

Also, if the stock stays constant, the contract theta will also increase causing bigger losses than just the $770 per day due to TVOM!

TLDR: Get Rekt

2021-04-02 05:39:16,wallstreetbets,"DD: Boomer Edition round 2 - Construction üößüèóÔ∏è Stock - ü¶Ö Eagle Materials EXP Looking for an undervalued company filled with hard workers and actual physical products?  Tired of stocks focused digital things and imaginary future technology that might exist someday?!  Well my second ü•à round of boomer deep dives is for you.  Last time we talked about üöÇ this time üß∞üî®üë∑üöß

So out in Dallas Texas there is great Dividend giving company called Eagle Materials ü¶Öüá∫üá≤

Let's look at their profile compared to competitors in the construction materials field.

Eagles Materials
Revenue: $1.2 billion
Revenue growth: 15%
Profit Margins: 20%
Employees: 2200
PE 16.37

Martin Marietta Materials 
Revenue: $4 billion
Revenue growth: 3%
Profit Margins: 12%
Employees:  8800
PE: 28.92

Summit Materials
Revenue: 2.33 Billion
Revenue Growth: 5%
Profit Margins: 6%
Employees: 6,000
PE: 23.28

Looks like they have far lower price to earnings with better growth and better profits.  They also get a bit more out per employee.  

Effecient and growing ü™¥.  This is what we want in companies!

Now for one of the key points on why this is a 2x buy check their financial filings: http://ir.eaglematerials.com/investor-relations

In their annual report they reiterate the intention of the company to separate their heavy and light materials divisions into entirely independent publically traded stocks.    Why are they doing this?  Because the board and CEO know their stocks are undervalued and a major shareholders they are tired of it.  Splitting the company means you get two stocks with an undervalued PE ratio in more concise markets.  Easier to prove value and easier to get investor intention with a big move.  Those two stocks aren't staying down and even if they evaluate close to properly compared to their competition you are already close to a 2x deal!

But that's not all.  It isn't just that Eagle is in a good position now, the market puts them in a good position long term to succeed.

1. Materialsüß± are scarceüîé across the board right now.  Everyone is behind on deliverys due to COVID related disruptions and the economy reving up too fast.  There is no fast solution to the backlog which means guaranteed revenue stream for over a year AND efficient companies benefit the most by having room to gain market share.  On top of that material suppliers are getting the opportunity to line their pockets with a bit of extra revenue since there really isn't competition for customers in this market.  Many companies aren't even taking on new customers right now because they are already stuck managing allocations for their existing base.

2. Commercial Real Estate is going down hard.  üóÑÔ∏èüñáÔ∏èüìâOffice space in major cities is coming to an end and nothing can stop it.  Companies now know they need less office space and less people in the office so they aren't going to fork out anywhere near as much leasing space in expensive locations like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.   The restructuringüèóÔ∏è needed to account for this will require materials and materials you need for these conversions are the exact types of Products Eagle offersüß±.  Clear case of forward looking demand.

Boomer Points:

1. While it is true that millennials probably couldn't hang dry wall if their lives depended on it üò¥Joe is going let üá≤üáΩüåÆ back in and they can definitely help with all the labor shortages in the construction industry.  We may soon be back to the days where you can pay they nice gentlemen outside home depot to come help you finish a project no questions asked.  Don't have to worry about shithead contractors not showing up for quote.  

2. ü¶Ö is a legimate company that offers their employees pensions, stock options, and solid wages.  People who work there want to work there.  It isn't like my job at Wendy's.  This is a company where talent stays.

3. Dividends ü§©!!!! You can grow your shares more by having shares!

Cons: 

1. Commercial Real Estate crash might bring down everything in the real estate and construction market for a while.  Depends on how much bag holding the commercial landlords insist on doing.  If they don't recalibrate quickly or decide to beg for bailouts we might see a mini recession in that market with lots of empty spaces and no activity to refresh or maintain.  

2. Lots of upside for construction materials is priced in and Eagle has already beat market growth for the year.  However PE still says they don't meet the competition so this probably not substantial.

Warning: This Dick Dipping was performed by my permanently flaccid dicklet that contributed to my eventual divorce and shouldn't be counted as sound financial advice or a means of contributing pleasure to anyone's life.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. 3x gains in under a year isn‚Äôt something reliably done, otherwise we‚Äôd all be billionaires."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At what price lol?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was going to say this... AMC is hemorrhaging money and very likely will BK. Unless a miracle happens and people stop streaming movies at home now. Black Widow... from the comfort of my house. Yes please. BB currently is a great time to enter.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not that I see the potential in AMC I was in the Ape mentality. DD is the sound I hear when I beat my chest. If you were an Ape you would know this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they developed the QNX OS for smart cars as well as an app store called IVY for those very vehicles. They are also in military contracts across the world (UK, Canada, US, Australia to name a few) that include hardware and software (shipyards in the NorthEast US know BB well).

BB is no longer a phone company. In 7 years, they transformed completely into a security and IoT company (Internet of Things - connecting appliances and vehicles / drones to the internet with good security software). They also have a security AI (a real AI, not code that people pass off as an AI as is the case with 99% of companies) and machine learning R&D department that will see revenues start in 2023.

Also, they have a lot of patents that generate money which lessens the need for funding their projects through dilution or debt. The latest patent was 2 weeks ago ([https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=10948920](https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=10948920)), the self refueling AV patent!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And change the world as we know it!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn‚Äôt even make sense
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We‚Äôre not buying, friend!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Come on there are many more examples of stocks that do 3X in under 10 years than relying on BB. BB hasn‚Äôt done shit in 15 years. You act like it‚Äôs some sort of monster stock that‚Äôs been ignored.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. And as much as I like going to the theater and feel it could be a solid spike post covid (briefly) from all the stuff I've read about BB they've actually evolved and are doing things that could lead to it being a really solid hold for the next few years
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes thats what I mean. they are like PLTR but software and security focused.

The problem is that they are completely under appreciated and their portfolio has sure gotten them to become core in current cars...but what has that led to? I'm not sure it's crazy good revenue. I don't see QNX being dramatically better then it is right now. 

There are many other ISO level security options and the BB moat isn't what it once was. I saw alot of their senior leaders sell when the stock moved up recently. I'm of the opinion that leaders that sell stock signal bad things for companies.

I am a fan of BB but at this point, I think it's more of a hope for acquisition then dramatic shopify jump. Their portfolio is just not sexy enough."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre interpreting way too much into my reply. I‚Äôm not the OP. I only bought 200 shares - clearly I don‚Äôt think this is a monster stock. I‚Äôve got 500k in the market, only $1200 is with BB."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a little shocked that they weren't just an old dying phone company anymore. When I read that and saw todays price. I jumped in some option calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">I'm of the opinion that leaders that sell stock signal bad things for companies.

There are many reasons why insiders sell, but only one reason why they would buy. A few insiders selling alone is not an indication of anything. Also, Chen's compensation is heavily geared towards equity, so it is in his best interest to make it work.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't read too much into it TBH. The exit in January was pretty damn attractive especially if you needed liquidity."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,CFO sold a tiny portion of their stock options. Completely overblown
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I played BB once on the run. Took profit already. Wasn't going to go back in until better value
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,CFO's have a clear view of their guidance. Its an indicator for me.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's where I made a mistake. I always poorly time my exit. Not as bad in this case since I wanted to hold anyway but it just means I have to wait longer with less ammo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i had similar issue with AMC and UWMC. I was too greedy. Took a 10k loss of amc and now relying on div for uwmc.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know. Every since 2008, things seemed bleak. This whole Gamestop thing has been very profitable to me, but it‚Äôs more meaningful than that. This resembles resilience and the power of the people. For years, wall street traders revolted against hedge funds and market manipulators who seemed to always get away with something, or manage to workaround and manipulate some weird law, only to twist into their own perspective and make the middle class‚Äôs wallets bleed. For years, many have suffered. Some prosperous of course, but there was and always will be that greater force that could drain a man‚Äôs life savings in mere seconds.

u/deepfuckingvalue, jokes aside, all memes aside, I appreciate the fact that you‚Äôve empowered people, and that you inspired people to put their foot down. Enough is enough, just was enough in 2008. Never in my 28 years of life have I ever witnessed such desperation from multi millionaires and billionaires. But that isn‚Äôt even what‚Äôs crazy about all of this. Besides the charts and technical analysis and the DD and the memes and the widespread media coverage, all anyone and every has been doing and has done is...well, 

THEY HELD THE MOTHERFUCKING STOCK. but why? BECAUSE WE LIKE THE STOCK? why do we like the stock? BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO US AND BECAUSE THAT‚ÄôS WHAT INVESTING IS ALL ABOUT. It‚Äôs about INVESTING into the future, into something you want to see grow, into something you wish to profit off of after commitments and sacrifices.

That‚Äôs what‚Äôs so interesting about all of this. Just buy and hold. They created this fucked up system and we played them at their very own game. I‚Äôve made a lot of fucking money from this and I truly wish to find ways to donate or bring back that money to my community. To be really honest with you, after seeing what money can do to a person at this level, I rather bring someone at the lowest level up, because that‚Äôs what truly makes you in the end. When we all die, we can die knowing that we helped someone else get to the top, whatever their top may be. 

It‚Äôs not great being at your low. GME, all jokes aside, brought back the fire in people‚Äôs eyes, the hatred for the years of sheer market manipulation and unlawful acts of robbery on a marketing level.

Fuck wallstreet, fuck them hard. Fuck these fucked up systems that allow the rich to steal from the poor but do not allow the poor to profit off of the rich. I was a poor man and I‚Äôm a wealthy man. At 18 I lived inna ln a one bedroom apartment as a full-time college student working 40 hours a week. That‚Äôs not cool. That‚Äôs not acceptable. Not everyone is capable of that, and I wasn‚Äôt either, because it took me a couple tries just to finish college and get through my growing pains.

There‚Äôs no room for mercy here. I want to watch these hedge funds suffer. I want them to bleed. Let their wallets feel as empty as their souls. Let their children know that their parents were manipulators. Let everyone know that these people aren‚Äôt your friends. I am not inciting violence, but let it be known that you have the ability to do something and make a change and now is THAT FUCKING TIME PUSSY


BUY AND HODL THE STOCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER and drink aqua üí¶"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know when DFV bought his GME shares? When will his gains be considered long term capital gains (20% tax) instead of ordinary income (37% tax)? Not that he would ever sell GME of course. Diamond hands 5ever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands and diamond balls. This man has it all. We love you!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We are not worthy....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend has it he still holds
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone ELI5 some parts of this, as I'm still new to figuring it all out so I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at. 

It's especially confusing as I've looked at the past several of these he's posted and I see the quantity of 100,000 and 500 never changing (I'm pretty sure) so I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be looking for otherwise. Is this saying that he has 100,500 shares, total, and this is solely the day change because he's not selling (which is the point)? 

And what does the ""Apr 16' 21 $12 Call"" part even mean? Does that mean by that date, he estimates the shares to drop to $12 per share in price or what? I genuinely don't get it. I thought calls were something along the lines of ""betting"" that a stock will go upwards and puts were the opposite?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm curious as to what he does does job to have so much cash to drop like that to begin with
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have made April‚Äôs Day Prank and posted a photoshopped pic of selling them all üòÜ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Missed opportunity to post April fools position of having sold everything and destroy this subreddit as we know it forever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, mind sparing a grand??"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain how the math on the calls gives him that amount of profit? I‚Äôm really struggling to make sense of it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question is how tf dfv got 2 million to invest
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take the cash for those options. Don't exercise. You deserve those tendies brother.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,SELL PLZ I DONT WANT TO YOU TO LOSE THIS
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs funny, GME has no reason to go up, the meme has died a long time ago, yet I have no doubt it‚Äôll spike up again (probably soon, too)

Why? No idea, just a hunch"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"April fools guys, don't fall for it. He sold it all..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hasn‚Äôt he closed all his options while the price is still high. I really don‚Äôt feel like GameStop is going to be trading over 180 by the time those options expire
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,gotta cash out soon i imagine.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I burrow about 59k?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Noob here! Does this mean if he sold all his shares he would get 40,000,000$? Assuming the value of shares doesn't fluctuate when someone sells so much at once.."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are the calls listed at a lower price than the shares? Shouldn't the list price be the same?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The IRS be salivating on those capital gains. I hope he exercises his options and gets share certificates to hang next to the kitty poster.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I put my heavy duty grilling tin foil helmet on & came up w idea of why not use april fools day to blatantly taunt the hedgies by alluding he was selling for 4 hrs str8 on twotter!!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should have posted a screenshot of exiting all GME positions, would be the perfect April Fools"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This cat should have edited out the 100k shares and displayed 0 as though he had sold; April Fools!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Throw the cash at ASO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So essentially, once exercised, dfv would own the entire float? Someone please correct me here.

eta: I'm a smooth brained ape.  *slinks off into a corner for time-out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So he has to sell it before April 16. I‚Äôm not sure if he will exercise his call at 190 level if he is a small value guy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Losing it all would be the most humblest of stories
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought he was going to say he sold as n April fools joke.  Decidedly this is much better

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am retarded but does the fact that his cash total keeps going up mean he's taking profits along the way?

That's what I thought was happening but everyone keeps praising him for NOT taking any profits. So I am confused because I know in one of his earlier videos he said that he rents his house etc. So I know he didn't have that 2 mill just laying around

He is a time-travelling, diamond-handed God either way üíéüôåüèΩüíØ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,post back to back and i dont have my free award to give :(

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being up not even 1% in the day and having gains of 171k. That's more than most people make in a year.

Fucking insane man

e - okay i'm young and grossly overestimated USA median income, the average *household* income is 55k (which was my guess before) and the average personal income is ~35k. this fucker just made what the average american makes in 5 years in one shitty market day. absolutely mind blowing"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way back when he signed a contract with some poor bastard who agreed to take an up front premium of 0.20 per share x 50,000 shares (500 contracts of 100 shares each) for the right, but not the obligation to buy 50,000 shares of game stop for $12 each.  The poor bastard gets his 10k premium (0.20x 50,000 shares) up front in a lump sum and now this legend will exercise his contract two weeks from now and buy 50,000 shares from this guy for $12 each when the current price is about $180?  

The poor bastard was hoping that on April 16th that the share price would be below $12 meaning that he collected a 10k premium and still got to keep his shares (because the legend wouldn't obviously exercise the contracts at a price above the current market)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cash total would be what is sat in the account as cash, not invested into shares atm.
The one below it is total inc shares, so approx what he would get if he closed everything cashing out fully.
All pre-tax though ofc."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No he sold a few a shares at the top in January, then bought double the shares in February. The cash amount is how much money he has on hand. So he can easily exercise his options, buy more, and still live as a millionaire."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I'm glad it seems like all of this might actually help change things for the average person who isn't a HF.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has the ability to execute his call options before or on that day. If he does, he has the right to buy gme shares at the price listed, I believe 50000 shares for only 12 dollars a pop"

Meaning with where the stock is today he will net over 8 million on those 500 contracts.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs only a matter of time üòÇ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those are his $12 calls that expiry April 16th. A call is a contract to buy a 100 shares at a set price, called a strike, no matter the current share price. The purchase of this contract requires payment of a premium per share in the contract, and this premium changes depending on how close to the strike the share price is, and also time to expiration and volatility of the stock. You can either exercise the contact and pay your strike price for 100 shares, or sell the contract to someone else

Basically he bought 500 $12 calls so has the right to purchase 50,000 (100 x 500) shares for only $12. 

These calls we purchased so long ago that he paid $20 for each of those 500 calls and now they‚Äôre worth $18,130 each (remember each call =100 shares). I would expect him to pay the $600k to exercise the shares and add 50,000 to his current 100,000 shares"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I C what you tried to do there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"500 contracts worth 100 shares each, so 50,000 shares"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has 100k shares, and 500 calls for april 16.

The numbers at the end are the increase in value, because GME went up, the total value of his shares and calls also went up.

The meaning of ""April 16"" means that his calls expire then. He'll either have to sell the contracts (each contract is worth 100x $181.3 atm) or exercise them and buy 100 shares per contract for $12 a share.

This means that on April 16, DFV will need to pick between buying 50k shares at a massive discount (12 per share) or selling the contracts."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he can buy 50000$ shares for 600K. Lol and they're worth 10M. 

I mean yes he'll pay exactly 12 bucks a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  He can buy at $12 a share and it doesn‚Äôt matter what the price is currently at.   So when he exercises the contract the seller is obligated to supply the shares whatever the cost to them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,U can‚Äôt tell the legend what to do.. do u seriously think u know better then him?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Check Twitter lol

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,#AprilFools!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercise them with all that cash duh!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The second line describes an options contract, or more specifically, a lot of options contracts. DFV paid a premium (.20 cents per share) to buy the *option* to purchase 500 contracts of GME at $12 a share. Options are sold in contracts of 100 shares per contract, so 500 contracts = 50,000 shares. These expire on April 16, 2021. He bought these contracts over a year ago, when the stock was almost universally seen as worthless and dying, which is why the premium is so low. Hope this helps."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," there are seven tax brackets for ordinary income ‚Äì 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% ‚Äì with the bracket determined by filers' taxable income. The federal government uses a progressive tax system, which means that filers with higher incomes pay higher tax rates. It's also graduated in such a way so that taxpayers don't pay the same rate on every dollar earned, but instead pay higher rates on each dollar that exceeds a certain threshold.


Your first 0-9.8k is taxed at 10%
Then everything from 9.8k-40.1k is taxed at 12%
Then 40k-85k at 22%
85-163k @ 24%
163-207k @ 32%
207-518k @ 35%
More than 518k @37%

So it wouldn‚Äôt be 37% of his final number. Just 37% of everything over 518k which is still a shit ton but not a full 37%. (Although in his case it will be an average of like 36.999999 hahaha) 

But yeah you don‚Äôt pay 37% off a $1000 short term gain. That‚Äôs just wrong"

Does the poor bastard just go bankrupt, and if so what happens to DFV's holding?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when he exercises these calls in two weeks,  will that cause a large price increase? Or is that large scale purchased already factored into the initial call?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This just blew my mind and I feel like I‚Äôm 30% closer to understanding options lol. But I can buy calls and puts on RH. If I buy a put, the other side of the deal is a call right? So if I don‚Äôt exercise my put but the other side exercises the call, I could be fucked? Or is it only a covered call with that kind of risk?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So hypothetically if the stock went away tomorrow he still walks away with 11 Mil?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah. So at the end of the day even if the stock went to $0 he could walk away with the cash?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a quintuplet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This comment deserves more upvotes. Majority people here have been brainwashed to think ITM call options = gamma squeeze. While partially true, market makers typically hedge options as they approach or near strike prices to prevent a gamma squeeze. Sometimes, the price climbs so fast they didn‚Äôt even have time to hedge. For example, stock price is currently at 200 and it‚Äôs a Thursday. Markets closed but after hours is pushing the stock above 300. It opens at 350 the next day which is Friday, and closes above 400. All those call options with strike prices of 250-400 will drive a gamma squeeze. Market makers are usually good at preventing a gamma squeeze from happening. But with wild volatility and unpredictable price action, it‚Äôs a little easier for market makers to get caught off guard and basically allow a gamma squeeze to happen"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It means I‚Äôm crying because he‚Äôs going to have to close his option positions ;(
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The premise of your assertion is that the new celebrity status of DFV is more important to him than ~$10M worth of profit in exercised options? Are *you* actually retarded?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,IN
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,**This** is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats like 800 shares compared to the 50k shares he has to sell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it was 500 contracts so it was likely absorbed institutionally or someone who knew what they were doing and hedged..........or maybe not - maybe they walk amongst us and we will get some amazing loss porn next week!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The brokerage handling the options contract wouldn't allow the sale of the shares in the meantime so that can't happen.  Also it's likely not just one lonely guy who wrote those 500 contracts. It was probably institutional or from a bunch of different people.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question.  I think the short answer is no.  I don't know for certain with something this large but here's my best estimate.  The shares are trading hands for $12 each but behind the scenes.  The price was previously agreed upon and in a way that already to some extent influenced price action because it has been an open interest on the options side of things which also influences the share price somewhat.  They aren't being offered to the market and aren't sitting in the order book so I don't think this side of the sale moves the price any at all.  It's just shares changing hands behind the scenes from one account to another.

On the other side of things, you now have 50,000 shares that are ripe for profit taking so you'd think that unless he truly believes that the share price can move even higher that he is going to want to unload at least some.  To get back his 610,000 cost basis (50,000 x $12 plus $10k in premiums) he'd need to unload about 3k shares but that's nothing.  Orders of that size are executed constantly and GME trades
on heavy daily volume so probably won't be noticed.

The biggest concern for pricing here will be his following.  They follow his every move.  If he's in, they are in.  If he's out and they start liquidating, I can't imagine what it will look like.

They honestly may have revived a dying company to the point that they will be able to use this influx of cash and publicity to actually flourish and it will continue on as a $150+ dollar stock based on at least some fundamentals."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me say that I am not an expert at this and only have a basic understanding.  However unless we are talking margin, in either of those scenarios you would need to already own the shares (at least 100).  

Think of it this way, if you own 100 shares of a stock that you have sitting in your account they aren‚Äôt generating you any money (aside from dividends) until you sell them.  However, if you know what you are doing you can write options contracts on them and generate lots of income over and over again on your same 100 shares.  Let‚Äôs say your cost basis is $10 per share on your 100 shares and you don‚Äôt believe that the price will go beyond $15 dollars in the next 6 months.  You can sell a ‚Äúcovered call‚Äù to someone with a strike price of let‚Äôs say $20 (remember, you don‚Äôt think the price will get that high before the expiration date of the contract).  So you sell this covered call with a strike price of $20 and an expiration of one month from now.  The contract price is 0.30 per share x 100 shares.  You collect $30 as the premium all up front when you sell the contract and get to keep it no matter what.  The other guy who just purchased a ‚Äúlong call‚Äù is hoping that the share price gets to at least the strike price plus the premium he paid just to break even.  So $20.30 per share.  If it only gets to anything below $20.30 the contract will expire worthless and neither party has to do anything.  The guy who bought the long call can only ever lose his $30 premium.  However, if that strike price get anywhere above that strike price the guy who bought the long call can have unlimited losses.  The losses aren‚Äôt out of pocket but they are on unrealized potential gains.  So if the guy who originally sold the covered call only paid $10 for his 100 shares he will still profit at contract expiration, he will net $10 per share (he paid 10 but is selling to this guy for 20, plus he got to keep that original $30 premium).  However, he is losing out on the potential to sell at the current market value.  So let‚Äôs say at expiration the stock was trading at $50, well he still has to sell at $20 to the guy on the other end of the contract.  The losses are considered ‚Äúunlimited‚Äù because forget $50, what happens if it‚Äôs trading at $180 all the sudden like GME.  Well you‚Äôve now had to sell for $20 and lost out on all that gain.  

In a perfect scenario for the guy who sold the covered call, the contract expires worthless and he will just write a new contract on those same 100 shares and make another $30 in premiums."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost certainly but that doesn't make for a great story does it!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is doing this in a Roth, so no

EDIT: yes if he withdraws some, of course, but otherwise no"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Imagine DFV withdrawing some. Guaranteed that‚Äôs going back into GME at some point. He loves the stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Expiry date for the call. Options are always for 100 shares, that call is for 500 options.

So before it expires he either sells the call on for a vast sum to someone else who wants to exercise it.

Or before it expires he has the cash to cover ( ($12 + $0.20) \* 100 \* 500) to exercise it himself netting him the 50,000 shares if its a physical settlement he can then hold, or sell for current value.

If it's a cash settlement then he'd get the difference between $12 + 0.20 per share and the current price, for 50,000 shares worth. (Pre tax) (I'm not sure cash settled style is an option here [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp) )

As he has the cash to exercise them himself, he's not likely to sell the call on.

If it expires he gets nothing, I believe some brokers would handle it for you instead though if it's in the money, as it certainly still should be on the 16th.

If I have something a bit wrong there I'll get back to chewing crayons.

^(Edit2: braces.)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As in the ticker was pulled, all GME stock became worth $0?  
The Cash Total there isn't tied to any stock, that's his not yet invested in anything wallet with that broker, so yes he'd be able to withdraw that, nearly $12 Mil (pre tax)."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Monthly options always expire third Friday of the month, April 16th is the third Friday 

Anybody who bought calls more than a few weeks ago was only able to buy 16april if they wanted options for April - so naturally you will see lots more options for these third Friday of the month dates. 

Right now there‚Äôs tons of calls and puts for the 16th, obviously this also applies to every other stock too. You will see that number a lot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls/puts contracts each hold 100 shares/contract.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A single contract covers 100 shares but may be subject to other factors like stock splits
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wicked bad idea, you‚Äôll end up divorced before you even get married."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty simple:

A call is a contract to buy 100 shares at a certain price, before a certain date. The price is called the ""strike price"", and the date the ""expiration"".

So if I buy a GME April 16 call for a strike of $12, it means I have the right to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share before April 16.

The price paid for the contract is called the premium, and is calculated on a per-share basis. This means that the price paid of $0.20 on DFV's screenshot means he paid $20 per contract, and he has 500 of those. So he bought $10k worth of calls, and since the price exploded, these calls are now worth $18k **per call** meaning you multiply that by 500 and you have close to 10 million.

The price of the contract went up a lot because since GME is now worth ~$190, anyone with a call can exercise (buy the shares) it and will directly have gains since they'd be buying shares worth $190 for only $12"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are there a bunch of bullshit DDs? Yes, of course, everyone and their mother want to do one for some reason.

I won't find links, but well, overall we're up from last month, we're up from last year, and the future looks bright. Shorts have to cover, so it will go up.

The only reason to believe it wouldn't go up would be that shorts have already covered, and I don't need DD to know they haven't, just by looking at the whole media narrative, the bots spamming, the death threats/fake suicidal intents reports and so on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah there we are, you're pissed because your brother paper handed. You can't predict shit with the day-to-day price, it's too volatile and manipulated. If you try to day-trade, you're gonna get burned, which is what happened.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hands down I'd take the shares.  No question. Is there ANY concern that this stock will be less than $12 (strike price) going forward even after a squeeze?  All signs point to a turnaround in the fundamentals of the company which means those shares he buys for $12 a piece will be worth a lot more.

Yeah, I wish I knew the secret. Trying to go to school so hopefully I can get a career job instead of these entry level positions. 

I also live in a city where in order to be able to afford the average cost of living you have to be making around $50/hr if you compare the average wage versus the average price of living here. Something like 32% higher to live here than the whole states average cost of living"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What exactly are you ""seeing""? You can't have a short squeeze without high short interest. Short interest is much lower than the first squeeze. What is your evidence that this squeeze will be (much) larger, when short interest is lower?

Another caveat - all of the previous short interest got in their positions under $20 (most well under that price). By definition, once the price is over $20, you know for certain all prior shorts are underwater. But now, the stock is down almost $300 from its January high. Even if the short interest percentage was still high in aggregate, there is simply no way to know whether they are short at $40 (in which case they are bleeding) or short at $400 (in which case they are more in the green than someone who bought GME at $1 per share).

There was a mountain of evidence for the January squeeze built over many months and in some cases more than a year. The buffoonery being bandied about as ""Quality DD"" from people who seemingly did not have any interest in the stock market prior to January 2021 is thinly-researched garbage based on hunches and confirmation bias."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is also partially why everyone got a boner over March 19th.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,100% kidding btw - some things are more precious than tendies. Your fiance likely being one of em.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lolol!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much.

Let's say stock XYZ is at $10 right now, and you think by April 16, it'll reach $15. You can buy a call for then, so you'd buy an April 16 call, with a  $10 strike (or whatever strike you want). You'd pay, say, a premium of $1 per share, meaning the contract costs you $100.

April 16 rolls around, and XYZ is indeed worth $15. You decide to sell the contracts, but this time their worth is going to be $5 (current - strike).

As for why you would want to try calls instead of stocks, it's leverage:

XYZ rose by 50%, you invested $100:

* With shares, you'd have 10 shares now worth $150. You gained $50
* With calls, you'd have 1 call (100 shares) now worth $500. You gained $400.

The big risk factor is the expiration time. If your call expires worthless, you lose your entire investment."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not ""I heard the shorts aren't covered"", it's ""I never heard anything pointing to the shorts being covered, on the contrary"". I mean, the only proof you could get would be them telling it directly.

All the evidence is more than enough, at least for me. As for DFV not giving a fuck, that's probably not true, because he's having the time of his life on Twitter. And even if it's true, too bad, doesn't change a thing.

And even if he's a millionaire already, I'm pretty sure that's a lot of money that would hurt pretty bad psychologically to lose.

In the end, if you want solid proofs, you shouldn't be betting in the stock market. Is this a bet? Of course it is, but to my eyes, it's a very good one."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. I got out at 15.95 from 4. Bought another 500 at 45 and sold majority way to low

I mean, the whole ""lemmings follow each other off a cliff"" is a complete myth, so I think you're disproving your own point while highlighting your arrogance and ignorance. That's fun.

>You even talked about ‚Äúexercised options‚Äù. Why would exercising even be on the table when he can just sell?

Because he can buy them for $12 and hold them if he believes the price will continue to climb. This is pretty basic, bud.

>He already sold a chunk of his position. He‚Äôs shitposting his holdings for fun and he‚Äôs going to pocket a huge profit either way come apr 16 since he‚Äôs so deep in the money. Between now and then, it‚Äôs all fun and games to him.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just have the extra balls.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends where you live too. Realistically, putting $200 away per month is much more reasonable for the average wage slave.

Source: am currently paid as wage slave, despite doing a 30/hr job (CNC machinist, and I mean machinist, I do my own setups, programming, etc. I have the knowhow to actually model shit too).

PS: I'm a bit of an ape in the morning and didn't make it clear, I DO NOT MAKE 30/h. I make 17/h. I do the job that SHOULD pay 30+/h. In my back pocket I also have 2 years of field service on CNC machines, which by itself is about 20-25/h minimum. I'm doing the job for that SWEET, SWEET EXP. And knowledge, you learn a fuckton in a job shop."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or a lot less if you used to be poor. I learned to live on $18K in grad school because it was that or drop out. I make more now, but anything extra I spend feels like treating myself so it‚Äôs easy to invest 30% of my paycheck."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I make about $30k after tax per year, and invest ~$800/mo. It‚Äôs definitely do able if you‚Äôre single no kids and live modestly. I can still go out/order take out like 3 times a week, I buy wine or beer for the weekends, buy new games when they interest me etc, so it‚Äôs not like I‚Äôm pinching pennies. People often don‚Äôt realize how much money they spend on things!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, quadrupling your money without having to do extra work is still pretty sexy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No you need a small loan of a million dollars
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve seen funds and ETFs that did as much as 140% last year (iShares Global Clean Energy), and big tech ones have have 20-30% average returns going back 20 years, although some years they‚Äôre negative, other years they‚Äôre much higher (the Black Rock Global Technology Fund averaged 37% a year over the past 5 years, and had a 77% return last year). This is not financial advice, because I‚Äôm not an advisor, just a risk taking crayon eater, but say you had $30k already saved, put in $2.5k per month, and chose a big tech fund (or split between a few) that averaged > 25% a year (past performance does not indicate future performance blah blah, but if I‚Äôm going to set and forget, tech is the managed fund type for me long term). So at a retirement age of 55, 15 years from now, that would be *somewhere* around $4.5m. The key is to start early with these things but if you can‚Äôt, ‚Äúriskier‚Äù investments like tech offer can get you there quicker. As an example, if when you were born your parents put just $1k into a fund that averaged 20% a year for your retirement so you never had to worry about a pension, by the time you were 55, that $1k would be something like $20m. If it averaged 25% over that time, it would be $200m."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You ain't gonna find it here.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much do you spend per month? If you can invest half your income, you can completely retire in about 10 years.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Computer programming <> CNC programming. Theoretically, you can do both if you understand the logic, but computer programming is an entirely different monster than CNC programming. Also, oversaturated market on the comp sci end, and literally no one wants to work in industry. 

Company I work for couldn't find anyone better than a druggie or a numbskull who didn't understand 'righty tighty, lefty loosey' for two years. Possibly due to low pay, but I can survive for a year or two, and find something for much more money after that, providing our industry doesn't get nuked in the meantime.

 CNC programming is a lot more... conversational, you describe an area on a workpiece that you want the machine to cut and the program you're using will do all the calculations for the moves the machine needs to make. Usually off a model you're using. It's less about the programming and more about visualising how the machine will move, and knowledge of cutting speeds and feeds for different materials. Which you can google fairly easily."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if you don‚Äôt know shit about cars. You can service lambos for much cheaper than what the stealership will charge you. For instance most of them are outfitted with Brembo brakes. If you do a quick cross reference on the part number you‚Äôll find that dodge vipers etc use the exact same parts under a different part number, for a fraction of the cost that a Lambo dealer will charge you.

The real problem is, you can leave your ice car for two weeks, and it will work alright afterwards, but if EV's charge goes to zero, battery may be damaged, so it needs to be micromanaged more. But unlike gas stations, chargers can be scaled, they already are everywhere, and they will be at every parking spot eventually. I hate Tesla's focus on suburban garages as well, duh, 99% of city-dwellers live in high-rise buildings, isn't that obvious, Elon? But I'm still getting one. ICE is finished.

brooooo, are you serious?  ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|facepalm)

Huracan revs to 8500

911 GT3 revs to 9000

Ferrari LaFerrari revs to 9250

Mclaren 720S revs to 8500

Even a Lexus LFA revs to 9000 (not sure if I consider this an exotic; probably not)

The new T.50 has a v12 and revs to 12,100  


I'm sure there are more.  Is the Lambo's v10 highly regarding as one of the best sounding engines of all time, yes?, absolutely.  But if you're a huge car guy, I'd recommend learning about some of the other high revving exotics... because there's actually many other great choices in the Huracan's price range. cheers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not saying they aren‚Äôt very good cars. They still need care and service to stay that way. I think some did read my post wrong though. The market for these items is not just super rich. The majority are probably just at the line to afford one. For example, over a decade ago there was this idea for a ‚Äúluxury tax‚Äù targeting yacht owners. They got money right? Who really has a yacht anyway? So it easily had support. Not enough yacht owners to resist it. The result was it decimated the boat building industry on the east coast. Took jobs away from countless tradesmen in the supply chain. Hurt the very politicians that championed it. Who then quickly repealed it. Turned out the bulk of buyers were just over the fence and the added tax pulled them back over the other side. That was what I was alluding to. Not knocking the cars or the buyers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Warranties don‚Äôt cover regular maintenance, typically only catastrophic failures of non wearable parts or drivetrain. A lambo is roughly 5k a year to service, even if you only drive 1,000 miles a year. If you need tires, add 2k for a set of 4. Bugattis are the most expensive to service yearly which can be $20,000 on the low end and $50,000 on the high end."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"EVs will do to fuel-powered vehicles what the internal-combustion engine did for horses. The horse was the primary power source, and was exploited as such. Once engines took over, people only rode horses for recreation and sport. (And a few specialized jobs.) We'll still have gasoline-powered vehicles, but only for fun, or applications where EVs are impractical.

I don't see electric riding mowers taking over any time soon; the cost-to-benefit ratio is still too high."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did some DD on this areas , some random sharing 
for like minded folks who r into EV 
1) Ev is the future and total addressable market is huge and it‚Äôs low hanging fruit to capture market share of ICE cars 
.Globally ‚Äúfirst world countries‚Äù
Government has announced mandatory ev by when and when seem quite determined 

2) I think EV is a technology play , re imagine how car can be 
Tesla and lucid stand out in this area has the ev / battery patents accumulated over the years shd serves them well in mid range and slightly premium market 

3) Another observation , for  pure EV play only 3 names Telsa , lucid , Arrival has set up its vertical factory and not out sourcing it . I shd think these r the key players who wants to protect their valuable IP / patents in-house 

Telsa will alway lead the industry for sure being the real Pioneer 

4) Tesla has battery storage as another revenue stream too and many more.
For lucid they have another battery storage  biz they started in 2008 to provide battery for all Formula-E race car competition 

5) EV global adoption is not in full gear yet. Stlll has plenty of upsides

I bought on dip recently for Tesla ($580) and ARVL  ($18) stonk.

They're suffering from the same thing Porsche suffers from. All their cars look the same but with slightly different proportions. I guess all the auto manufacturers do that now to some degree but Tesla could use a design overhaul. And please, nothing else resembling that cyber truck monstrosity. 

I think bring back the roadster concept but now with all their new technology and a fresh look. Make a functional large pickup truck that can be fitted with a utility bed. A sports coupe, a crossover, a jeep competitor with a solar sail to charge in remote places. I don't know but their current lineup is getting boring from a design standpoint and the cyber truck is just to far out there to be functional."

Gevo is making biofuel for airlines.  it's only a matter of time before we have a no-compromise green synthetic fuel alternative for ICE automobiles, that can be deployed via the pre-existing national gas station infrastructure.

The huracan shares its engine with the Audi R8. (though if you don't consider a gt3 exotic - you're crazy btw, you may not consider an R8 exotic either)"

For high end tires you‚Äôre looking at $2500-5000 for a set of 4. Ferrari‚Äôs 7 year maintenance package is pretty unique. Lambo‚Äôs don‚Äôt come with a maintenance package with purchase. You can purchase separate 3-year or 5-year maintenance packages for a separate charge. Lambo‚Äôs also only have 36-month unlimited mile bumper to bumper warranties and only if you buy it new.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No pretending required, you don't see it. Marie Antoinette was so oblivious to the suffering of the French people when told the peasants had no bread she responded let them eat cake.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not insulted, though I'm not fully clear on what you're trying to say. First you are saying those who buy these cars tend to be selfish, but then you say there are exceptions, so, it sounds like we are saying the same thing?  One shouldn't judge someone based on one small thing about their life.  

You are right though (even though you shouldn't have assumed), those in my circle would generally abstain from anything that flashy so I may not have met many lambo/ferrari drivers (that I know of).  Close friends have a chauffeured Mercedes, a bunch of others with Porsches, Mercedes, BMWs, Jaguars, range rovers, audis, etc, many more don't drive at all (large urban centre).  My partner and I have a Toyota Camry that we never use and have a higher net worth than most of our friends, everyone has different priorities.  A close friend of mine built a $30M house and took the subway. We also got bored during the pandemic and bought a few expensive things (art).  I try not to judge."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guy, you‚Äôre in wsb not /r/politics. Go discuss the distribution of wealth somewhere else. All we care about are tendies here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not entirely an assumption, paying attention to the way any item is marketed you can gain a broad strokes picture of the avatar of a company's target demographic. These companies marketing departments know exactly to a very high level of detail who their target client is, age, gender, other purchases made, net worth, the emotional triggers that convert a prospect into a buyer. I would also go as far as to say they have a name for this person as well (it's not a real person just a composite of the type of person who buys their products). So the fact you would assume owning this type of an exotic car doesn't make a person a douche, would lead me to believe you haven't met many of these people - big ego is a defining feature of the type of client for these products. It is understandable why someone who's dreamed their whole life about this car would get one, and how that car would be a symbol of something more than just the car. Would hope people would dream bigger dreams about the person they want to be, life they want to lead, the impact they want to have on humanity, than just acquiring nice, expensive things to flaunt as a proffering to their ego, but oh well. The material culture in America is such where there's a growing idolization of the idea of ""fuck you money,"" which is so overtly ego driven and spiritually corrosive I find it a shame at large for the society as a whole.

It's less the car, and more the idea of buying these out of boredom. Just a shame. Some people idolize this kind of behavior, I don't.

I second the sentiment on the Camry. Only car worth owning imho."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think what he was trying to say is it's one thing to buy a Lambo because you're a gearhead and appreciate the automotive excellence a car like that provides versus buying it because you just want to look flashy and make pussies drip.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This conversation ended an hour ago. Thank you for your input. Not a guy. Not a socialist. People buying lambo's ""because they're bored"" is a sad reflection of their humanity. It reminds me of someone. End."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All fair points, though I can't speak to American culture (live in Canada). I would have thought there are better cars to own if you are a 'gearhead' though admittedly I know very little about cars.  I don't drive and my partner, now with the pandemic, uses the car maybe once or twice a month.  We use Uber / taxis more than we use our own car, or just walk to the store.  Most things are delivered.  We've toyed with the idea of getting an electric Mercedes if they ever make one, but just doesn't seem worth it. 

I think idolization of money is more complicated than you make it out to be, because there are good reasons to idolize what money *could* do.  I agree it is mostly toxic, and usually tied to acquiring material things, but there is a flip side to it.  It affords freedom, freedom to explore your own life ambitions, freedom to travel/learn, freedom to give back without any material impact on your own life.  I agree that the problem is most don't idolize *that* part of it.  There are toxic people around every corner, poor and rich.  It is really hard to surround yourself with the right people sometimes, especially when it's family!"

I agree with what you're saying, and it is a smidge different in Canada (I went to UBC) in terms of the cultural appreciation of wealth. It is great for a person to aspire to a life of freedom and controlling their destiny. It is great for a person to aspire to solving large problems that impact large amounts of people and great wealth follows. But here there is this whole ""fuck you money"" shitck you'll find. It's not an idea of wealth beyond dethroning The Man and stepping into his place because ""fuck you."" Fuck you yeah I have enough money to buy a 20 car garage worth of lambo's aaaaand what? Fuck you. It's not that everyone with wealth is like this, but living in Los Angeles, it's not an anomaly either. I don't see it as something to aspire to. And the few people I've known who have gotten caught up in that approach to wealth typically are not fundamentally happy because they are externalizing their own sense of self worth on the things they have and there's always the next thing to buy and there's always someone who has something nicer etc."
2021-04-02 03:18:17,wallstreetbets,"TSLA - Cathie Wood's PT broken down in six months segment (April 2021 update). Ark Invest (Cathie Wood) released their new PT for TSLA last month.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

Based on $4,000 PT, it comes down to an average of $2.43 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).

|Date|Projected Price (Fixed $ gain)|Projected Price (Fixed % gain)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|July 1, 2021|$883.33|$745.69|
|January 1, 2022|$1,331.35|$949.34|
|July 1, 2022|$1,772.07|$1,203.87|
|January 1, 2023|$2,220.09|$1,532.66|
|July 1, 2023|$2,660.80|$1,943.58|
|January 1, 2024|$3,108.83|$2,474.39|
|July 1, 2024|$3,551.98|$3,141.91|
|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|$4,000.00|

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

My positions

* 41 shares.
* 2x $700c 4/9e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have 460 shares, if we hit 3000 by 2025 I'll be at 1.3m. If at the same time Crispr blows  up I'll probably be close to 2m or something like that. Absolutely insane. I can't believe there is a possibility of this actually happening. Not to mention that ARK is waaay undervaluing the robotaxi network. They have the robotaxi network at 50% margin, absolute nonsense. It's probably more like 80-90%. They have the tesla owned fleet at something like 10-20% or something like that, also way low. As soon as robotaxi actually launches you can forget about buying a tesla. It will all be produced for their own fleet for at least 10 years until they start saturating the cab and uber market.

Cabs and ubers are about 20m worldwide. If tesla just replaces those, they don't even need to undercut the price by much. It will be like 1.5 per mile. This will be a 20k share price easily with a 30pe (low). And we aren't even counting energy, semi, or anything else.

Someone like me would then be at about 10m net worth. Sure it sounds crazy, but nobody can explain what exactly would be wrong with that model. The only argument is ""thats crazy dude, take your meds"". Warren Redlich will be proved right eventually."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"if a $100 stock goes up 10% each day for 10 days, what will be the price?

I'm going to say $260"

TSLA is literally what got ARK to where it is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,General tech selloff plus 2 months is hardly enough time to see if an investment was good decision. Tesla was flat as fuck for 3 years plus

2021-04-02 02:49:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting on $ASO heading for a major breakout over the next two weeks after stellar earnings, high short interest, and very bullish options activity. I've done 3 DD posts and have not been wrong yet, check my post history.

* Puts on $DASH when it was at $225 it's now $133
* Buy TGT when it was $170 it's now $200
* Buy $AAPL when it was $116 it's now $122

&#x200B;

**Up next is $ASO and so far it's shaping up to be a great trade.**

There are a couple of key items regarding $ASO to understand why it's primed for a big breakout.

1. They just reported earnings this week, and the results were stellar:
   1. Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
   2. (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.
2. It has high institutional ownership (I've seen conflicting numbers, if I am to go off of yahoo data it would appear that 60mm of the 90mm shares are institutionally owned. )
3. March 15, 2021 short interest was over 39% (It's almost certain that anyone who has shorted this is under water right now...unless they opened a short at 3:53pm today, which is not likely).

April 16, 2021 options:

* The $25, $30, $35 all have more open interest than any single strike in the put column.
* 18,973 for the $30 strike is massive volume for a stock that has 93% institutional ownership.
   * The public float is 31 million
   * Outstanding shares are 90 million
* The 18,000 contracts on the $30 strike representing nearly 2 million shares is pretty significant when considering the public float is only 31 million. If every strike closes ITM this will likely have somewhere in the 40,000 - 50,000 contracts closing ITM which is 4-5mm of that 31mm shares (7%)

$ASO closed the day just over $29 / share and has moved up a little in after hours, nearly 30. We have a long weekend so once Monday rolls around there will be a lot of pressure on MM's due to the fact that 18,000+ contracts would expire ITM at the $30 strike by that Friday.

This is the way."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wife is a manager at our local Academy, they‚Äôve already beat their 5 year sales plan since 2019. Last year they beat their *single store* sales by $3m, along with another store in her district beating projected sales last year by $2m. Ammo and gun shelves are bare every time I‚Äôm in the store, which is at least once a week. People line up at the door for opening fire that shit, at 8:00 in the morning they usually have 30 of them outside."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a bit early March and plan to hold through next earnings. Background checks for guns at records levels January and March, they're paying down debt, reopening play, plus if I lived in Texas without power for a week I'd be stocking up on some emergency outdoor gear just in case. Not sure if I'll buy in again on Monday but defo looking for a buying opportunity over the next month."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love Academy Sports.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course ive been holding 20 @ $25 for a month and just sold them after earnings at 26.50 cause i was worried about the lockup the following day. Smh , a true retard right here"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. 35 calls at open. put it in for .65 hope it gets filled
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg this guy said puts at DASH when it was all time high pre lockup availability how could he have known??? Who saw that coming?? Everybody

I called dash would rise from IPO then fall after but this was all obvious

ASO rocks though been bullish on them"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even before I found this post I've said I wish I bought more of this back in November.

20 @ 16.00

My reason for buying was simple. I've given them plenty of money over the years and I've never heard anyone say anything bad about Academy. That's all. Love that place!

I was pleasantly surprised to see it close at 30.00 in after hours."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What am I missing here?  This is a mid size sporting goods chain with decent fundamentals but against dicks, maybe a little cheap but not crazy. Half the sales, similar margins  and maybe 1/3rd of market cap so some room to run.  Much of 2020 sales spike due to COVID and it will be tough to match that growth in 2021.    Maybe if they start paying a dividend.  The industry growth rate is modest at best.  ???"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,$ASO is solid. Its also a Magic Formula stock these days.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm jumping on this on Monday any advice?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks solid to me
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even though I'm new in this Option call and the way it works but I can afford to lose some little $$. I throw in $35 call 4/16 Buy. Hopefully, it pays off OP lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's April fool's.... I can't trust shit today.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginning of March invested $20K in a mix of shares and calls and am down $6K (probably $4K if we figure the price at $30 per share) as of now. Hoping this thing takes off! üöÄüöÄüöÄ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Make a YOLO play then.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"please wrinkle my brain if i seem smooth af, but i would think that a high short interest in general is bad as the only potential upside would be for them to cover (squeeze) which is extremely rare? GME![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In Dutch an ‚Äúaso‚Äù refers to a person behaving like a egotistical retard (‚Äúaso‚Äù is the abbreviation for ‚Äúasociale‚Äù meaning something like anti-social) . So I‚Äôm selling naked calls and buying puts on aso.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD. Could you share how you‚Äôre buying these options or recommend a platform someone from EU can use?

I‚Äôve only started trading a few weeks ago doing CFDs on Capital. They don‚Äôt sell ASO."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are calls too expensive or can I still jump in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still learning about options. OP could you explain why you chose a 30$ strike price expiri g on april 16 and 35$ on may 21?

What is you thesis that these dates will satisfy?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What do I need to do to make a play on Monday?  Will 5/21 calls be the way for Monday?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Think it'll hit 40-50 next week?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD. I‚Äôd feel more confident if there was updated short interest data. I‚Äôm wondering if the recent run up was shorts covering.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really wanna YOLO everything into 4/16 35c but I'm feeling kinda cautious about this. It had a great run on 4/1 but I'm afraid of a rug pull on Monday, particularly if the market decides to shit the bed and $ASO decides to follow it.

Volume on 4/1 was 3.5 mil compared to an average 1.5 mil. I've read some bearish sentiment that $ASO is likely to reject the $30-$40 range and regress to $26-$27, swing trading in a $5 spread. Every ramp has a slide so I guess everything depends on if Monday it continues the momentum rather than just getting dumped from profit takers who think $30 is the peak."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD, will load up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Want to join you but proceeding with caution. Won‚Äôt do it by selling any GME and extremely nervous about testing unknown resistance over the next two weeks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the April call and not after may? Is the earnings call no longer relevant since they pre announced?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 2 days
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should also look at $VSTO, another great play on ammo and plenty of upside"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,that wasn‚Äôt your DD on dash.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah I mean...50/50 chance if you post something that isn't GME you just get soft banned....wish I had seen your post when it was low 20's.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been watching ASO for a while was always surprised it got no volume.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember ASO DD last month too. It was solid DD then, as it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bastard. My first 10 short term options were all fucking stupid plays. I guess that‚Äôs kind of the entry price for learning. However, I‚Äôve started to get the hang of it. Made 4k (400%) on semiconductors last week and already up 100% on ASO.

This seems solid and I wish I had purchased more 10 - 30c and 10 - 35c both for 4/16. I think people really expected this to drop after shares unlocked on the 30th, but it didn‚Äôt budge. 

The 35c options were so cheap and OTM last week that they were at 0 delta - ie. MMs considered them free money and was no reason to hedge. Well, that changed fast and even those are up now. 

The earnings report wasn‚Äôt just good, it was monstrous. Record gains in sales, earnings, revenue, even an increase In e-commerce of 100%. 

The short ratio on this thing is 10 days. People keep parroting this ‚Äúnot everything is a short squeeze,‚Äù because they heard some smarter chucklefuck say it about another stock, but it absolutely plays a role in some situations. The last 3 days were massive, just look at the charts. Unless all those buyers were shorts covering (we can see that they aren‚Äôt) and none of the momentum was brought on buy the amazing earnings, there are going to be a lot of people trying to get out of this before the 4/16s print. 

Most of the company is owned by a hedge fund that isn‚Äôt going to paper hand this shit. 

I‚Äôm picking up 10 more 35c and maybe even some 40c on Monday."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, gotta learn somehow!

(if you use TD, paper trading options is how I learned + youtube)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, when the Dems are in control of the executive and legislative branches...gun / ammo sales always go up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the decisions that come after ""fuck it""....."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$2 billion of debt too and it‚Äôs basically a department store so will need to take on more to expand. Price multiple is like 7 though so arguably pretty undervalued. What‚Äôs the catalyst for this to üöÄ is my question, it‚Äôs already up like 100% since it‚Äôs IPO."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To Pluto!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just let those bags go dude. Could be 5-10 years before you see profit again in that SkyNet wannabe.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah just saw that...that means every single person who has shorted is under water right now...if that options activity triggers a gamma that triggers a margin call into the following week....could easily go north of $60.

We'll see !"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"On 4000 share volume too, not just a few"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm wondering when walmart is going to catch up!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What time is best to enter? Usually buying at the opening is the worse time, bu then again with earning like this it might not dip?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can feel my little dick getting hard already
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ez money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,good to hear!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"80 dollars is still gain money

i was able to pull 300 on calls and 200 on puts on and after earnings

idk how to feel about lockup expiry so i didn't want to keep holding. 

it ended the day at 30 tho. I'm tempted ü•µ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think this will tank....there is pretty limited downside, there is a lot of support a few dollars below. This isn't something that has run up massively already and the floor can fall out from under you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôd wait a few minutes after open. Wednesday had a tasty dip we‚Äôd where it erased the previous day‚Äôs gains before closing green.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ü§ê
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah...clearly everyone, check the comments in the post most people thought it was a stupid idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, a lot of what I've seen in the comments here is making me even more bullish on this one than I was!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well...consider how well they did during the pandemic for one...when a lot of money was not going towards team sports etc.

Then consider that the short interest is 30%

Then look at what I posted regarding the options activity. If a gamma gets triggered off of that, every single person who has shorted this is under water right now as it hit an ATH in AH at 8:00pm. The higher it goes, the more likelihood of a margin call which means those shorts need to come to the open market to buy shares to cover their position to give back to the lender."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dicks pissed on the 2nd Amendment. Rednecks will always choose Academy over Dicks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  I have seen several posts regarding ASO over the past month or so and I also don't see the catalyst for heavy growth.  But what do I know?  Good luck to the holders.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs why I picked it up. I just happened to be browsing a list of high short interest stocks and the magic formula and we got a double hit!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy high, sell higher"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is all public info
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, market has been tough...easy money is mostly over for now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I will almost certainly look at buying more shares / options on monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME was a once in a lifetime squeeze that ALREADY HAPPENED it went up 1600% in 4 weeks. It had 148+ % short interest and its under 25% now.

ASO likely still has investors in a lockup period from the spac merger, and basically 40% short interest. 

Now look at Viacom for example and sure that was slightly dif but that was a squeeze...yah it didn‚Äôt go from 14 to 518 but I think the potential for ASO is similar to that of some moves we saw in VIAC and Discovery."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"smart, buying puts on something that's got 40% SI."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would u get puts lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Let him enjoy his retirement üëè
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME Aspies are insane.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea tbh!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,they were pretty cheap at the end of the day yesteray.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was cheaper, and also if you look at the screenshot of open interest, it's where most other people have bought options. 

For may I bought a little higher (35) because it was roughly half the cost of the 30 strike."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted my positions for April 16, May is probably a safe bet. options, stock, probably all good choices."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how much larger the OTM calls grow, since it hit $30 in AH the ITM open interest is over 18,000 ....if a lot of people start buying in high volume on monday MM's will have to buy shares to cover...if shorts try to close they'll have to buy shares to get out. It could go that high, we'll see."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It hasn't gone up much at all...I don't think those who are shorting are worried right now, the days to cover was like 9, I'm sure it's not that expensive to borrow yet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well...let's say the 10 year goes to 1.8...it SHOULDN'T really matter here, bc this isn't a tech / inflation fear stock...but you never know. 

I think it's undervalued and has potential for a gamma squeeze that leads into a short squeeze. I'm not dumping my whole account in but I'm putting enough in to see a big return if all goes well."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,the options are pretty cheap...you can get in for a few hundred dollars.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"because it has 39.4% short interest and there is massive volume on the $30 strike calls for April 16th...if we get close to that date and everything is ITM, MM's have to buy more shares, pushes the price up which puts more pressure on the shorts. Anyone who has EVER opened a short position on this is at a loss right now as it hit the ATH in AH Friday. 

To cover a short, you have to buy a share on the open market and return it to whoever the lender is. 

I'm betting on this having enough interest due to it's performance / value that can help push a gamma squeeze which can lead to a short squeeze in the most bullish case possible. If that doesn't happen, due to their performance it's still a solid play."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was alot, not sure I folowed all of it but thank you for the response! So im guessing I didnt totally fumble my first call contract buys? That makes me feel slightly better about tossing another $500 into the hole that is my WSB account lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,These earnings weren't even driven by gun sales.  It was footwear and apparel for the most part.  I'm sure gun sales will help this next quarter though.  Democrats are the best gun salesmen.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right!   Then the coup is attempted on rep controlled gov.  lol  people will always be scared and stupid, that is set in stone."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They IPO that thing dirt cheap to make all the institutional investors billionaires. A PE of 7 with almost a billion in the war chest and plans to over double the number of stores. 100 dollars may be cheap for that stock just on sound investment principals. As a company that's growing and making good money it should have a PE over 15 probably in the mid 20's at a minimum. I really like this stock and wish I would have looked at it sooner.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the 35c? Why not put it all on the 30c? Wouldnt that have a greater return and itm?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have to agree. Opportunity cost is a real thing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I jumped in 1500 on shares at 28.80 before close gonna throw 1500 more monday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looking at daily trends, I usually expect a slight dip around noon (eastern time) and a rise in the last hour of trading. Of course it's not always consistent, but it's happened often enough that I tend to rely on it for a bit of extra gains."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm tempted to jump back in on Monday as well!  I may do just a couple of straight calls, we‚Äôll see.  

I love credit spreads though, if I had waited and the stock jumped to $40+ next week, my $100 play would have turned into a $4900 return!

You can‚Äôt beat that 49X dangling carrot üòÜ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did ok over the past year.  But a lot of that was just 2021 dollars spent in 2020.  No one needs another kayak once they buy the first one.  And after the gamma trade is done, things should settle back down to fair value.  2021 sales growth will be key.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,btw  GME short interest is under 25% held by insiders and 110% by institutions if you straight up just go to yahoo finance. So it‚Äôs still short af and probably even more than we puplicly know. The squeeze did NOT happen at all. Get ur facts straight literal ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking üåàüêª
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause stock market does the opposite of what you think
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem, thanks for answering. i guess i should do my own due diligence."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I should have bought more contracts instead of just 5x May 40c
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm hesitant on ASO as a long play but I did some more reading and read their earnings call, and as a short play I think the potential is good. 

This looks exactly like RKT did before it ran up 70% in that gamma/short squeeze at the beginning of March, they're just missing the special dividend.

I think I'll see how Monday's action goes then pick up some 4/16 35c. I have a good feeling about this but man, my gut is telling me ""yes"" but my brain is telling me ""NOOO"" so it'll be exciting at least, hah."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 30c it is then!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,there was DD on dash before your account was created
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 35c for 5/21 on Thursday, already up 40%. These will surely run"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 shares a couple days ago and just bought 2 call options through Robinhood. I'm brand new to this. 
I'm confused about something. Why would you wait until Monday to buy more? Can't you buy these options after hours like I just did?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a native Texan, I‚Äôve been shopping at Academy since they killed Rooster Andrews and knocked them out of business. So pretty much since 1999. OG Texans would know what Rooster Andrews used to be. Rooster was a huge sponsor for The University of Texas Athletics. Advertisements were every where when Ricky #34 was running towards his Heisman. They have a Whataburger-like loyalty.

Academy has product offerings in wellness & fitness. So gym equipment, supplements, bandages, ropes, weights etc.

They have equipment for all sports, guys and girls. Tennis, Golf, baseball, basketball and football. So rackets, clubs, golf bags, bats, rims, helmets etc.

They carry all major sporting clothing for day wear and training. Nike, UA, Addidas, and cheaper versions like Champion and Rebock.

They have shoes for all sports, guys and girls, men and women. They have fratty and dad shoes like New Balance. They have running brands like Brooks and Oasics too. 

They carry work boots and boots would that would be needed on a ranch or hiking in Big Bend NP. They have shoes for wadding and fishing, if that‚Äôs your thing.

They sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, and they will also help you get your hunting and fishing permits too. Obviously they sell fishing rods and bait and tackle. They sell hunting camo and Magellan and Columbia fat person deep sea fishing shirts too.

They sell tents for camping and tents for tailgating. They sell bikes and tires.

They sell air soft guns and paintball guns. At least they did when I was in high school.

Yeah, Academy has a shit ton of goods. Goods that are all reasonably priced. It goes without saying I‚Äôm long on these guys."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically, if the actual price is anywhere above 35, you reserve the right to buy it at 35, making the spread. Am I understanding this right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that stuff is low margin and expensive to store.  There‚Äôs a reason there aren‚Äôt dozens of sporting goods stores: it‚Äôs really tough to do well in that space.  It‚Äôs also really expensive to expand into new territory.  They are going up against giants or local stores.  If they want to grow and take market share, they‚Äôll have to expand into California and the northeast.  Or overseas."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol 10% a week man.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure Kayaks, Weights and training stands do take up space, and have low margins. But it‚Äôs a small segment of their store both in SF and revenues. Like really small. In terms is SF and layout, Fitness items are in the front left hand corner and bikes are in the back right corner. Predominantly most floor space is clothing. Shoes and other traditional sporting equipment is along the left hand wall. 

The company‚Äôs revenues are typically from Youth Sports through Varsity Sport demographics. Moms and Dads buying their sons and daughters new gear for a new season. Hunting/fishing/camping is likely for adults and families who grew up in that outdoorsy lifestyle. When I lived in Georgia I know there were more Academy‚Äôs than Dicks. Seems it‚Äôs a SE US region for now."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait please explain this tactic to me. You're saying that so many people have calls that expire OTM because they expect a squeeze, so the pricing on the flip side of the trade (puts?) is favorable and likely due to implied volatility? 

Sorry I am a noob just trying to learn."

2021-04-02 02:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Gaming and Leisure Properties ($GLPI) GLPI is an Americal real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq that focusses on aquiring real property assets leased to gaming operators.

As of now they own 48 different properties across 16 states. important to note is that the word gaming is simply a substitute for casino.

The REIT is currently trading at 43.67 dollars. The revenue of this company has been growing steadily over the last quartiles. They have a solid profit margin of 44% and a banging operating margin of 67% 

Furthermore, the company has a forward divident rate of 6% which is quite reasonable for a share. This 6% attracts so many institutions that nearly 97% is held by them.

The beta also displays that this is not a meme stock, it has a beta of 1.07 which means this company is 7% more volatile than the market.

I study architecture and simply adore REITs, so i thought maybe i'd share my find with you guys

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so a few questions for you.

1.  How do you account for the aging client base of gaming establishments.  It's been well documented that table gaming and slots are no as popular among millennials?
2. How do you account for the geographic risk of several of the properties?  Several are in areas subject to natural disasters?  None are located in the biggest hotspots for gambling Macua and Las Vegas?
3. How does the portfolio hedge against the rise of online sports book betting?
4. Why do you like a portfolio that has several Hollywood casinos which thematically pale in comparison to other properties?
5. How many of these casinos have you visited?  I can tell you that Tropicana in Atlantic City has to compete with Bally's and Caesars which happen to connect, so you get two experiences in essentially one large property.
6. Which is your favorite casino and why?  It doesn't have to be in the portfolio."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Firstly thank you for your critical response, it allows me to consider cetain aspects and ultimately improve.

1. That's a solid point you bring up, because indeed, the client base is currently lower than what it used to be, and thus a potential threath to GLPI.
2. Once again, solid point, I personally didnt look into the geographical locations with regards to natural disasters. Ultimately though, most REITs have many properties spread around the US with almost always a few of them in locations prone to natural disasters. The company was founded i 2013 which means they are still quite young therefore, it makes sense they havent yet gotten to own a casino in the gambling hotspots.
3. I guess simply by making sure the casino is always a hotel at the same time. because otherwise i would not see how they hedge against this rising change in betting behavior. And yes, for long term this is a valid threat.
4. For sure, there are many other casinos that look way better, yet how are you going to invest in those? Because im quite certain there not many other REITs focussing on casinos out there.
5. None, i live in Europe lol
6. Unfortunately i do not have a favorite, but generally speaking i like the more modern looking casinos."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For this specific REIT i do not know, but generally speaking. "" The maximum capital gains tax rate of 20% (plus the 3.8% Medicare Surtax) applies generally to the sale of REIT stock. """
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Most stock dividends meet the IRS definition of ‚Äúqualified dividends,‚Äù so they get lower long-term capital gains tax rates. Most REIT dividends don‚Äôt qualify.
So the majority of REIT distributions are classified as ordinary income, which is taxable at your marginal tax rate.
However, some of your REIT distributions could meet the definition of qualified dividends. This happens when a REIT distributes a long-term capital gain on the sale of an asset or if the REIT itself receives a qualified dividend payment.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it fairly easy to sell cover calls?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your definition of easy. Just like with any trading strategy it depends on your goals and risk tolerance.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been trading for 15 years. But I only got into options last year. It was really easy for me, but when you start selling or short selling it‚Äôs a different game. How‚Äôs the risk look and how difficult is it to set up a covered call."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Risk on a covered call is that your 100 shares are called away if your option goes ITM. I always make sure to set my strike at a price I would be willing to sell my shares at for a profit. I generally only sell 2-3 weeks out expiry as I want the option to expire worthless. The only downside to this is if your stock moons you cap your upside by being forced to sell your shares at your lower strike price. So say I buy 100 shares of stock for $25 share. I then sell a covered call two weeks out at a strike of $30. If the stock doesn‚Äôt hit $30 in that two weeks I keep all my premium and the option expires worthless. If it does hit $30 in those two weeks. I wait until it is exercised and I sell my shares at a strike of $30 making a $5 profit per share and keep all my premium. But say the stock shoots to 50 in two weeks, I am forced to sell my shares at $30 capping all my profits had I not sold the CC and I still keep all the premium. You could also buy back the contracts you sold before expiry if you didn‚Äôt want to lose your 100 shares."
2021-04-02 01:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Heath Tarbert to move from CFTC straight to Citadel Securities Heath Tarbert was a chairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) till January 21 2021, when he stepped down to continue as commissioner. Now he is going straight to Citadel Securities as Chief Legal Officer, effective April 5 2021 [as published by Bloomberg.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/citadel-securities-hires-ex-cftc-chairman-tarbert-as-legal-chief)

[Bloomberg article](https://preview.redd.it/1zijf6zcmmq61.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f0a2f83eec33f1cd53c57005cb2600fac7cd2b)

What is CFTC and what do they do? CFTC is the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission** and ""... is an **independent agency of the US government** created in 1974, that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, which includes **futures, swaps, and certain kinds of options.""** [\[wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission)

Now I don't know about you, but to me, this seems as a huge conflict of interests. And as far as I was able to find, so does to their own [Code of Conduct and Supplemental Ethics Regulations](https://www.governmentattic.org/23docs/CFTCcodeOfConduct_2016.pdf).

 

[Excerpt from the Code of Conduct](https://preview.redd.it/1z26tyamnmq61.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90657364b15e86e48dc2a79516bf34b336d407d)

Which points directly to a [law about this](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/207),

&#x200B;

[18 U.S. Code ¬ß 207 - Restrictions on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches](https://preview.redd.it/alxyqs5momq61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=181871e38c8665facf73915eca9020f13c2cd7ff)

Since the point of CFTC is to oversee and regulate the very part of market that Citadel is also part of, I would imagine, that there could be instances when these two parties meet. And quick search showed, they do. For example in September, but that's just to prove a point. 

&#x200B;

[External meeting register of CFTC](https://preview.redd.it/7tkjzpnspmq61.png?width=1113&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a04c21aedf618d793c664977fc0be5432f6aa2)

I truly am just an ape, but I would imagine, that matters of these meetings are advised by a group of lawyers prior to them (maybe even during in some instances). 

And since Tarbert is becoming the Chief of lawyers at Citadel Securities, they will all answer to him and he will lead them. That seems like a clear conflict of interest and, if I am getting it correctly, brakes the rule that prohibits this for 1-2 years after the termination and should be punishable.

Am I getting this right? Is it really enough for him to distance himself by only one level, so for example by not going to the meetings or to not directly communicate with any employee of his formal employer?

I honestly what to grasp this topic better, I'm not drawing any conclusions."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All these people calling you retarded are the true retards. My man, you were never going to be able to keep it and they were definitely going to find out. Even if you wanted to somehow move it, you wouldn‚Äôt be able to without getting a rep on the phone for that amount, who would have had to go get manager approval. You saved yourself time and a headache by letting them know, and you probably saved someone‚Äôs job too. You should feel good.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It was just a test run for the National Hedge Short Funds Broadcasting System. The NHSFBS goes into effect sometime this month. They just have to cover a lot of synthetic issues within system first.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citibank wires 500 million to Revlon by accident and didn't get it back. Was suppose to be 8 million in interest payments to the company's lenders (they acted as the loan agent ) and a judge said they get to keep it because they proved the debt although the payment was very early. I would have yolod on gme so fast lol.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Might wanna look into that. Some states, such as Texas, have laws where if money is wired to your account you do not have to give it back cause it is considered a ‚Äúgift.‚Äù In this scenario, they took it back.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a similar situation happen with $67k but when I called my credit union there was literally no transaction history with that dollar amount attached to my account. Something didn't add up when it happened and it still doesn't add up now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just dump it in GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs a lot of GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Borrow"" like the hedgies before they take it back and put it in AMC"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldve transferred the money and faked my death lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have withdrawn it. I worked for a company once who did something similar. They guy pulled the funds before they caught it and never paid it back. The company had to eat it and prevented him from opening any new accounts or products...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And I accidentally withdrew it once the funds cleared üòÜ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"truly fucked up... they should have added a note ""happy april fool's day"""

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you put it all on GME?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would go ahead and request something in writing from them about what happened just in case it was flagged or gets reported to the IRS.....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If they did it on accident you probably have legal precedent to keep it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, you might be able to get some of that back lol. I read an article about like Wells Fargo or some other large bank having accidentally sent money to the wrong account and they were fighting with the other bank to give it back and there was some rule that said they didn‚Äôt necessarily have to give it back lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had made Fidelity your bank, you could have called them and disputed the transaction and demanded a charge back.

Since you didn't, that makes you king retard.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""... but f'reals we gonna need that 1.3 mil whenever."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"this actually happens a lot with military pay. you get over/underpaid very often, and if you‚Äôre significantly overpaid the process can take a long time to get it back. a lot of people invest the extra money and take the gains off the top before they return it"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That‚Äôs how they would handle that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That sounds like felony fraud lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep losing money, why didn't I ever think to just invest in stocks going up"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when that thing you invest in drops 20% suddenly?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure a similar situation happened where chase(???) accidentally put money in someones account and the person made profit off of it and Chase TOOK both the profit and the mistake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao if it was that easy we‚Äôd all be rich
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's bigly illegal to use funds that are knowingly not yours even if it's their fuckup..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you keep the losses though?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They would absolutely not let you keep the gains on money that was never supposed to be in the account.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he was quick enough before they pulled all their cash back, he should have thrown it into 0Day GME 1000calls, let them sweat a little for their mistake and maybe they would settle down on holding the stock down and let it go up to recover their money back!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Prolly go to jail too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And this guy didn't take advantage of the situation.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If ts electric. They can get the money back
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked for a pizza joint in high school the manager sent me to the bank to get 100 singles. I gave the cashier the 100 dollars and she gave me a stack of singles with rubber bands around it as I walked out the door I flipped through it was 50 singles and 50 100 dollar bills I walked back in without a thought about taking the money and gave it back.

[That‚Äôs not how this works.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except the bank will press charges and sue for the money back.

Whether they are able to recover it or not is another story."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What would be the best way to do that? What kind of consequences were there? Asking for a friend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I wrote a wire to buy my house recently everyone told me ""you better quadruple check that shit, b because once you hit send that money is gone, doesn't matter if you made a mistake"". 

It's good to know that rule only applies to my life savings, and not faceless corps built on exploiting the system."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The same as writing a fake check worth 4.9m and cash it then spend it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,From experience. They would not allow it to happen. Very likely if you were to wire it out or send through EFT it would get caught before it leaves if you are trying to do large dollar amounts of it. If you send out a few thousand before they caught the mistake you would be required to pay it back 100%.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very. Which is why you run like hell after.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd make it a crime. Now if they accidentally withdrew that money from your account, well....that‚Äôs just an innocent mistake!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not illegal in most countries, but you will have to return it unless you have a reasonable (in a legal sense) belief that it's meant to go to you. 

I think it was Chase that fatfingered a loan repayment of like 800m making the news a few months ago. It's still being fought over, but so far, they got to keep the money because it was exactly the correct amount, and they were expecting a payment on the loan around that date... Just not that the full amount would be paid off like 30 years early."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"In general you're expected to return it if they ask for it back. Taking it isnt illegal, but if you spend it you're still obligated to pay it back. 

That said theres a funny story from like the past year where Citi accidentally paid $500MM of one of its clients loans off (Citi was acting as an intermediary between this company and the creditors) and when they asked for the money back many of the firms refused, so Citi sued and the court actually ruled that they were not obligated to give the money back."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not illegal as we just saw with Citi Bank. You'll likely just have to go to court for the rest of your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very illegal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if removing money from a customer's account without permission was illegal (clawbacks).  I'd think that mistakes like this would probably stop.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Usually.


There was a link posted somewhere in here about a transfer Citi erroneously did to creditors/bondholders but accidentally paid the full balance instead of a usual interest payment. Some of the banks returned the money to Citi but some didn't. When Citi sued, it was ruled that if you pay back a debt early by accident then that's just too bad, and the other banks got to keep the money.


So basically if someone owes you money in installments, but there exists the option to pay in full early, and they happen to pay in full early by mistake, you are entitled to keep the payment.


/e


But you are right. One company I worked for accidentally ran payroll twice and double direct deposited some people's pay check and immediately sent out emails saying not to touch the money, it's a mistake, they're gonna reverse it, etc.


I didn't get the double pay so I didn't have any chance to pull a fast one. But several of the employees were minimum wage/paycheck to paycheck types and they would probably be better off taking the double pay and leaving. Good luck getting it back."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't know and honestly don't care. I very much doubt they took this all the way to the judge and got him sentenced. They might've slapped a lien on his assets/income (for all the good that'll \[not\] do) but that'd be about all.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That can vary wildly depending. Buddy of mine got grossly overpaid once. Noticed it early, set the money aside, and notified the local comptroller squadron. He insisted he wanted to just pay the money back but they weren't hearing it. Dude's paycheck got **zeroed out for 2 freaking months**.

That kind of shit is why I always check my LES."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe in Canada, your paystubs make sense. I've never worked at a job where people fully understood theirs."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"On one hand you're not overtly wrong. US military leadership makes a point to shunt responsibility onto the individual for ensuring their pay is accurate. But our paystubs (LES) are absolute ass to try to read and when they get your pay right 9/10 it becomes easy to be complacent and forget to check until one day your pay is zeroed out due to a clerical error.

I always check mine and encourage my troops to do the same. But at the same time I can sympathize with people who put it on the backburner. Maybe if the LES wasn't written like it was trying to summon Lucifer's accountant I'd be less sympathetic about it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's mostly on DFAS being total shit from what I've been told. But no manner of bitching will fix it because some Congressman's uncle is making a killing being the single point of failure for the entire DoD getting paid correctly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, it has more to do with soldiers being terrible with their money. Like, having nothing saved."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This retard gets it......
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They would definitely call that larceny. You would probably go to prison if you lost any significant portion.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wires are slow. That's not nearly enough time for the wire to be irreversible.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Argentina is a very bad country to wire money to, especially american dollars, the government there will take them out of your hands."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Plenty of places without extradition treaties...many of them with perfect weather year round
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wire transfer take days to clear. They would of caught if when a random customer withdrew 4 mil all.of a sudden.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why argentina? argentinian asking here
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,4 bills? It‚Äôs worth at most 3 beaks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That actually makes sense. While this thread is an extreme example, it'd be a nightmare if you just allowed any party to say at any time ""wrong account, give me the money back, you're going to jail if you spent it.""

Imagine people doing that to other people they don't like, to try to bait them into spending the money and then sending them to jail. Or imagine companies doing that to each other to try and destroy them."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What? You also said you called to let them know. Something's fishy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. Not every bank requires multiple approvals, and certainly not brokerages."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They paid back their loan early. On accident.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That thought crossed my mind as well. If they can just take money out without notice like that, I don‚Äôt have much confidence with them handling my business. If I was them, I would eat the mistake instead of being labeled incompetent banker who can‚Äôt count. And receipt doesn‚Äôt mean anything to them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a teller for years. You have to balance your drawer several times throughout your shift. They caught the error. The teller didn't steal anything. There are cameras all over and they will check footage if there's a big offage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wire transfer take a few days to clear, they would‚Äôve cancelled it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,just changed mine to Hookers and Blow in hopes of getting a letter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whenever my friends and siblings transfer money between myself and them, we would always put stupid descriptions like drugs or hookers etc and then a year or two ago the biggest bank in australia said they‚Äôre not going to allow that fun shit anymore. But it turns out it was for a pretty sad reason - a ridiculous number of women were being contacted by their abusive exes via transfers of like 1c into the woman‚Äôs account from the man‚Äôs and the man would put abusive shit in the description. So terrible. But still I do miss our stupid transcription descriptions hahah but I guess it was a good time for us to stop, since one of us wants to buy a home soon and the current regulations have banks going through ALLLL hour bank statements when you go for a mortgage hahah"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you‚Äôre saying I‚Äôm gonna have $25m soon?!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How bou dat?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be more about advertising/marketing. Getting the money back would be part of some kind of torture before death. Not saying you can find that cheap.

But being able to spread stories about the guy that stole from them, ran away to a country where the law couldn't touch them. Then tragically got into a car accident. And the car had so many knives."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm it‚Äôs a international banking thing, not exclusively American. The global banking institutions are interconnected through a system called the SWIFT network and it facilitates the transfer of money on an international scale in a (what used to be incredibly) quick time. The advantage, other than speed and international access, are that it guarantees the validity of the transfer and so funds are typically available same day, typically within a couple hours. This is especially desirable for large sums of money that would typically need a couple days to verify."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is some of the worst fucking advice I‚Äôve ever seen on this board.

Imagine believing you‚Äôre going to get away with being sent paystubs every week, your pay comes out wrong, and then you try to run off with it. First thing your boss asks if you noticed, and unless you‚Äôre some ignoramus, it‚Äôs really fucking OBVIOUS to tell who‚Äôs lieing and who‚Äôs not.

Btw, trying to steal an extra weeks worth of pay is so definitely not fucking worth getting fired and losing out on a years worth of pay.

Holy fucking shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol everyone who tried to pull this lost and lost big.  Excited to see your story if you ever get the chance.  ‚ÄúI‚Äôm suing the shit out of them since it‚Äôs mine‚Äù hahahahaha don‚Äôt forget the terms and services that you didn‚Äôt read but agreed to...

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol.   Canada doesn‚Äôt have an army.   Wtf are you even on about?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Our pay stubs are emailed out to our civilian email addresses if we opt into it. They made them super easy to read and comprehend for the retarded army people. But our claims (meal reimbursement and shit) are directly deposited into our accounts without a word on the pay statement so we just gotta keep track of them to ensure we get those paid. I thought the most technologically advanced army in the world would have figured this out by now. I guess we are both full of retards
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, someone who isn't familiar with DoD Finance.

Most young servicemembers being notoriously bad with money (let's be real, they're high school students 80% of the time) does not forgive the number of times I've seen or heard of people getting pay docked because of an overpayment. Or worse yet, not getting paid at all because some buffoon forgot to update something in the system.

From what I've heard from comptrollers the problem mostly comes at the DFAS level and the usage of seriously arcane, ancient systems that are buggy as hell and nightmarish to navigate."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That is why you multi- wire- to Alabama- to Bermuda - to Cuba then Portugal!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys really need to get the banks to sort their shit out and match the 2 hour transfer windows between banks, and instant transfers in banks that we have on this side of the pond. It's kind of ridiculous at this stage."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That might work for you, you could wire half of it to Argentina, while they're dealing with the diplomatic faux-pas. You're off-shore"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TOS can easily be disputed, as it's commonly understood that no one reads them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Different situation. One company wrote a loan, the other company accidentally paid it ahead of time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a case where the people who were wired the money were owed money by the sender's client, and it was ruled that it's reasonable for them to keep and use the money because they were already expecting the transfer. It just turns out the sender sent it before they collected it from the client who owed it."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess I‚Äôll just take my six years of professional brokerage experience and go fuck off then. And considering I worked at Fidelity and can tell you what their policy is first hand, I‚Äôll go fuck off even further."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last time I made a large cash deposit they counted twice and bundled the cash with a copy of the receipt. I see now that it was so a second teller or manager could verify it. Hindsight I guess.

I am just telling you that I moved 7 figures left and right, and I don‚Äôt have to go through any approval process besides pressing a few buttons. Perhaps the first time only they called me to make sure everything was okay, after which they just increase your transfer thresholds. Not every brokerage is that strict, especially above a certain net worth."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because the money is deposited in your bank account, it doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs completed. It can easily be cancelled still and the money would leave your account."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they loan you an amount equal to the wire transfer that is then paid off a few days later when the transfer clears."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they paid through the ass for great lawyers. 

You have to keep in mind how serious stealing $5 million from a top US bank is. 

You're not getting time served with a public defender. That $5 million is going to take a large hit, especially because that firm is going to have little recourse if you stiff them because you won't have any assets left after federal prosecutors get in."

If someone who‚Äôs never had more than $30k in their account suddenly has millions and wants to wire it out, they can‚Äôt click buttons. They have to call. They have to get approval.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't believe the diversity of these degenarates that are holding gme. It starts from simpletons like myself to successful youtubers that i watch on casual evenings. It's so fucking wild

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought he was just going to pee into it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bitch, drink the scotch right from the bottle..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs simple. Take all the money you have and divide it by 1.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What did he mean by ""on GME calls""?  I was just buying shares and holding?  Is my smooth brain causing me to do this wrong?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think he means, ""half their college tuition loans"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why was that apartment empty? Did he break in there to make that cocktail?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's a life, or a saving? I'm not familiar with either"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that's what left after buying at 380
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good fucking question.  The most money I‚Äôve got was when my dad died, that went fast (wish I knew about GME stock back then -_-) now if I die my family gets a milli....I‚Äôd like to get some more tendies in between those two events!!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone hire George Russel to make a PowerPoint about the GME memes.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir .... They added salt. Alot of salt. It was an enormous amount of salt sir. My lips are chapped sir!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you like the scotch?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is my new brand, but you should absolutely try sheep dip or pigs nose if you can find them. I can't find them anymore so I now am all on board the monkey ~~train~~ üöÄ"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmm, monke"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,First whiskey I ever tried. I just can‚Äôt taste anything other than alcohol

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze,

And he said ""HOLD THE LIME""

as if that wasn't fucking genius!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He literally could have said ""next take the lime and give it a *short squeeze*"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've squeezed a citron!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Has the lemon squoze? 

No."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citron.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not very long though...just a short squeeze will do.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't that the whole point? The squeeze comes later?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait...the lemon has not been sqooze???
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And don't you fucking dare stop holding that ice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They‚Äôll but bacon in a drink, why not tendies.

Also, why the hell is my phone autocorrecting tendies to trendies? I‚Äôm just not typing it enough."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I stutter?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I came here for the Binging with Babish reference and was sorely disappointed until now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,""" Binge""?  
You spelled required wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate you sourcing me!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's the first time I've heard him talk.

What an occasion for that to happen."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the drink too!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably in his wife's boyfriend's asshole.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To give it that little kombucha feel!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,it would probably taste pretty good tbh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,‚ÄúBanana liqueur‚Äù
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah bro, it‚Äôs funny for the memes but god damn. Whiskey, banana liqueur, and high test? With a fucking chicken tender floating in it? 

Yikes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't hodl your liquor?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm sure more than a few apes will throw some parties on the moon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagining him serving me *his* cocktail
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless this is an April Fools joke for the video, personally I don't like how he blatantly steals like 90% of his format from Babish, even how he implements jokes and speaks just screams someone copying Babish. Video quality is good, just wish he felt confident enough in his work to express his own personality rather than trying to be the Babish of bartending.

Maybe its *only* in this video he does this so this opinion is purely formed off of what I see here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We need more flair!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely not a Babish impersonator.  This guy has been making cocktail videos on reddit for quite a while.  Check out /u/cocktailchem
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shame on you. Dude's been doing his thing before Babish posted his first video.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thread was actually decent for a change.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a great blended scotch for the price. I usually can find it for around $30 or less and for that price it's one the best scotches I've had. It's pretty much the go-to scotch for mixing into a cocktail. Do it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He came before Babish though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not babish, hes been around longer thn babish."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Half-life Savings. I‚Äôm still saving up for a computer fast enough to run the original version of Half-life. I‚Äôm hoping for a Pentium 2 with 64Mb RAM. Maybe someday I‚Äôll get a new VHS too.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I live out of a checking account because what fucking interest am I gonna get on $3000?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have $3.50
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's an acronym for your broker account. Don't worry about it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not anymore
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What's a life savings? I did something wrong somewhere
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,half-life savings.  it shrinks by 50% every year.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only üåàüêª stop at half.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is a half?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My smooth brain could not roll onto this idea. You must have a wrinkle. Thank you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the very definition, to YOLO half is anathema"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,'Correction.. that was a tendie sir'
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point it's all hemorrhoid treatment ads and buy gold.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That TF creme de banane is the motherfucking SHIT. I just never know how to actually mix with it because everything I put it in instantly tastes like banana bread. Then I end up craving it so I pour a glass of the stuff on the rocks and go into a diabetic coma.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oi loved your fernet episode! Keep up the good work skipper!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Highly recommend Oban 14
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out Stranahan‚Äôs Colorado Whiskey. It‚Äôs an American Single Malt so not a traditional scotch as it‚Äôs obviously not made in Scotland lol, but it‚Äôs one of my all time favorites whiskeys. And only about 60-70$ a bottle depending on where you find it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My ape... Monkey Shoulder is actually decent. I had to give up some of my scotch to buy more stocks. Budgeting is important so here is a handy guide:

Glenmorangie 10 year for cheap day drinking.  
The Glenlivet 12 year for good day drinking.  
The Balvenie Doublewood 12 year for weekends.  
OH... and Dewer's for my wife's boyfriend (if he ran out of glue to sniff).  
Half your life savings... understood. But skimping on scotch budget? THATS HARDCORE!

PS... went and got a glass of  Glenlivet 14 year  *Cognac*  finish just to type this.

\*HODL and not to be confused with financial or marital advice. Covid needs to end soon, my liquor bill is outta control."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you like the glen 12 you should really try the 14. One of the best scotches for the money you can get. Not as smooth as the 12, but a lot more flavor. I've never been a big fan of anything Macallan myself, always seemed overpriced for what it is (just decent scotch). Also want to second that guy's Stranahan shoutout. Lastly, try some grangestone, it's blended not single malt, but smooth AF for the price (I had the 18 year)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If your favorite part of camping is when the wind changes direction and blows campfire in your face may I suggest Ardbeg?  It's for people who put iodine on their smoked hams!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try some Japanese whiskeys. They are made with the same care, and excellent in their own right. Also Glengoyne."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not big into whiskey and scotch but my gf is, I got her a Balvenie 30 and it was a whole different drink"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may intrested to know Monkey Shoulder has Glennfiddich in it, then."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Glenmorangie is always nice too imo
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I highly recommend trying the Famous Grouse scotch. Super cheap and absolutely delicious. One of my all time favorites.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bowmore 12 year is definetly a good bottle of whiskey, that's not too expensive aswell."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In Spanish is limon. So the ape is right.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great content!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And then the mods removed it... seems like an odd move.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Awww... So this is what they mean by holding and diamond hands.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was grossed out at first then thought meh, bloody mary has bacon in it, why can't scotch have fried chicken."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you spelled perfection wrong. :)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I too, took this seriously

/hold"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao why did we have to witness it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you did some research you could see that they both started producing that style of content around the same time, so I'd disagree that he copied Babish. Additionally, they both have subtle jabs at each other in their videos from time to time and have even collaborated"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well not everyone can be the TipsyBartender, it could be they just have similar personalities or it could be a marketing thing. I have not really watched Babish but I can say that for a bartender Cocktail Chemistry does a good job of explaining what goes into each of his drinks and where and his content really shines in the experimental drinks. This video is quite different from other CC videos I have seen, I think because this is just a meme video. Normally he takes a drink that already exists and shows an Inexpensive (home) version, a Classic (bartender) version, and a Science-y / Experimental version that makes me think of Molecular Gastronomy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He has a youtube channel. Cocktail Chemistry I think. He does cocktails from shows like archer and simpsons and things. He is great.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Impersonator might be abit strong but I was definitely confused and came to the comments to make sure.

I still don't think he's shown his face so I thought it was odd he did now"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cant blame him, I immediately thought of Babish as well"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No he hasn't. Dude's very first video is literally 8 days before Babish's parks and Rec video, but Babish had been on YouTube for a while 9 years before him lol

And even then, it wasnt until Babish had made his format popular and been at it for a year before he suddenly switched his format to be like Babish like 16 months after his first videos."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs to be mixed with other strong flavours. Put half a shot of banana liquor and half a shot of creme de cacao in a coffee. It balances nicely and nothing is too overpowering.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're into Oban you should give Clynelish a try....both Oban and Clynelish use much longer fermentation times than most other distilleries, one byproduct of which is the formation of certain acids/esters/bacteria that affect the flavor profile in different ways than in distillates with shorter fermentation times.

Basically if you like the flavor of Oban there's a fair chance you'll enjoy Clynelish as well, and that's backed up down to the molecular level."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually did do research after making this comment. This guy started 8 days before Babish but it wasnt until 16 months later that he started producing this style content. Babish was doing it from the get go. (Obviously speaking of Babish ""starting"" as being when he started his cooking videos rather than the other 9 years worth of videos he did beforehand) Watching this guys first 3 videos and then comparing them to the ones he started making post July 2016 he suddenly becomes basically a completely different person with a huge switch up from his first videos, jokes changed, even his way of speaking changed... coincidentally becoming more like Babish.

So honestly, after doing research I am even more convinced that he 100% copied babish because he saw a similiar youtuber starting at the same time as him but with a more popular format."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, I‚Äôm confused, /u/cocktailchem shows his face every video, are you talking about babish?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,PETG is food safe. You can also print something and then coat it in something that‚Äôs food safe. First thing that comes to mind is food grade silicone but there‚Äôs gotta be much easier things than that

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very very this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean Deveron instead of Devon? There's a whiskey called Dartmoor that comes out of Devon, UK, but as far as Scottish Highland whiskey there is no Devon...there's Deveron, distilled by MacDuff, which is relatively close to the Macallan distillery. 

That being said, when recommending whiskies I personally would shy away from basing a recommendation solely on region. To use your recommendation as an example....while both Macallan and Deveron bottle 12 year single malts, Macallan is aged in Spanish sherry casks/Sherry seasoned American oak (depending which expression of the 12 you get); and Deveron 12 is aged exclusively in ex-Bourbon casks, seeing zero sherry influence. So sure they might be just down the road from each other, but the flavor profile similarities end with the content of the malt.

If you're looking for another Highland single malt with heavy sherry influence reminiscent of Macallan, I would suggest giving Glendronach 12 a try. And if location is important, the Glendronach distillery is actually closer to Macallan than MacDuff is ;)

Edit: phrasing"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All Macallan is overpriced and tastes like a watered down version of better whisky.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he's not going to say it and then violently crush it in his hand and throw the whole thing in the glass, I'm not happy"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got it for the lols but it was in fact a good drink. And I had a Slim Jim to munch on when I was done.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why u mod?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I respect the dedication to the research, I can see how you would draw that conclusion, and I kinda agree. I still find their style differs slightly but is a very similar format, I enjoy both their content regardless."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude's very first video is literally 8 days before Babish's parks and Rec video.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His content is defintely enjoyable, and there is obviously space for the both of them since they focus on two different things. My original critique is still the one I have now, the guys has charisma, a good show idea, and quality videos. I just would've enjoyed seeing him break out into his own format at some point since it would be interesting to see what he could do with it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Old Smoky moonshine I think.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Smoky Mountain Moonshine...also good for vegan car fuel and causing blindness.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the lick!

I just cant get the rest of the stuff without Amazon.

But it looks like a legit drink.

Maybe add a spritz of bannana peel as the garnish!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I cannot specify on the specific flavor he has [there are so many flavors](https://olesmoky.com/collections/moonshine) but I can guarantee it‚Äôs at least ole smoky. Their Apple pie moonshine mixed with a cider is quite dangerous though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly you can use any white whiskey there - even vodka would work in a pinch. It's basically just to cut the scotch flavor.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you were wrong for 9 years. The only thing that makes a cocktail a cocktail vs a mixed drink is having more than 2 ingredients, and even that is just a generalization; a cocktail is still a mixed drink. lol One of THE DUMBEST hills i've ever seen someone die on."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pssh. Everybody knows pizza is a fossil fuel. *Duh*

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Apple would go nice. Or maple.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would some one cut scotch flavour. 
Unless it was with a bacon wrapped tendie from Wendy‚Äôs."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That'd be one hell of a disease-ridden pp.  But thanks to Dr. Google I know its just fried chicken.  

Still, the drink looks pretty decent."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not selling, soooo.... can anyone spot me some moon drink tickets?? I‚Äôll pay you back after I sell some diamond covered calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Age being an indicator of quality/taste is quite a common misconception. Its only really an indicator of price. Older tend to be a bit smoother as the alcohol evaporates off, and they've just taken on more of the barrels characteristics, which you may or may not like depending on the barrel. You might prefer a 12 year from one distillery and an 18 from another.  I can definitely vouch for the Lagavulin 16 though, much better than the 12 in my opinion. Currently on a Glenfarclas 21 which is excellent too."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You‚Äôre dying on the hill being wrong here kid, you‚Äôre too stupid to understand what a cocktail is and the history behind it, try reading about it sometime"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You want the apeness of the banana liqueur to flex. Monkey is balanced, as blends are, but it's got some minor smoke/peat teeth (unlike lesser blends like Cutty Sark ü§Æ, Grouse, J&B, etc.), and that shit will readily take over the conversation without some room to stretch. Apes like big, roomy enclosures. We want the banana and the tendie to get a word in edgewise."

**LETS DO THIS TOGETHER:** take a look at the weighting documents and **PLEASE pm or chat me thoughts on inclusion**. We can do this.

**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**

Up too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:

>In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world‚Äôs largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    

You‚Äôre probably thinking ‚Äú...oh...um...okay. Whatever?‚Äù  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn‚Äôt been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**

So, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*

https://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg
-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.

[I found a document from SPDJI called a ‚Äúconsultation‚Äù that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. 

[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)

So, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**‚Äîthe underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**

**Investment Firm Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings‚Äîwhat BlackRock‚Äôs gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)

>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.

>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand‚Äôs Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.

>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil‚Äôs Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.

Whoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**

**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. 

**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.

**What we‚Äôre pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. 

**What we‚Äôll do**: Next week we‚Äôll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. 

****

**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I‚Äôll have more picks.

*Quick note: I actually put this in my newsletter sunday and wasn‚Äôt going to put it here, but GM is eating away at my conscience. Consider this my mea culpa.*"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently down 90% on my icln calls.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did a cursory google search and this shit checks out. 
Puts on PLUG and calls on NEE? I'm in!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dalton! I was craving one more your DD‚Äôs you son of a bitch!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm mostly following GEVO and it has dumped hard already like many others and recovered about half way. I noticed that it follows ICLN almost exactly (usually by about 2x leverage). I believe it's much more likely this has already happened and the most recent selloff in the sector was precisely because of that. Anything else would be extremely stupid, no? Why would you announce beforehand that you're buying millions of shares? Makes much more sense to activate your media and bot imperium talking shit about all the companies you want to buy in cheap. There was a lot of that at least for GEVO.

Edit: if I'm right then the stocks currently in ICLN shouldn't have recovered and the unknown ones that will be added should have. I did a quick check, plug, enph etc and it seems to kind of work out. Maybe somebody can do this in a more systematic way. Anyways put/call ratio for GEVO eg. Especially for April is basically 80% call, so I'm pretty sure it'll be added.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Where can I get your newsletter dude?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went through the US traded tickers that are proposed to be added and looks like BlackRock has enough shares on their own books to be able to meet the weighting requirements for all but the two ADRs on the list.

I dont know if they would just shuffle the shares between their funds or not, but it seems possible that they could mostly take care of ICLN and INRG in house."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"These purchases would likely be in dark pools right?  Might not see as much movement as we would hope for.  But there is some significant open interest in NEE for just outside the money calls for 4/19 and 5/21(over 10,000 for 5/21 at 75.00).  Someone might know something"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> On 4/19, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks

So does Blackrock have to reshuffle accordingly *before* April 19th, or is that just when the new additions will be official and they'll still have time after that to buy new and unwind old, heavy positions? (basically, wondering if 4/23 or some time between 4/30-5/21 is the better time to yolo some puts)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it is $CIG not $CEG based on their holdings on Ishares site for ICLN.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great analysis - NEE and VST look like solid plays.  Any updates as of today compared to what was sent out last weekend in your newsletter?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Comment for later; also well done this is the good good DD
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been bullish on VST since the winter storm dip. Sounds good. Let me look into this. I may increase my position
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a couple 4/23 $25 PLUG Puts. Last few days have been tough but this makes me feel warm inside
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bud I bought 5 calls on NEE for $105 because it was cheap as dirt (or yknow like 1 1/2 videogames). Hopefully we make some tendies!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is BE (Bloom Energy) a target at all? It's grouped up with trash companies like PLUG, but is actually completely different and already profitable. 

I expect BE to üöÄ anyway, but if these ETFs get out of the garbage green tech and into the good ones, it will be even faster."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This means that blackrock probably anticipates GME shorts to crash before this so they can roll the profits from there into this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god I already have put leaps on PLUG anyway.  Dilution as a business model and outdated tech. Add in accounting shenanigans, dubious warrant incentives to buy their product and you got yourself some hot shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad this isn't how institutions unwind their positions üòÇ Blackrock isn't entering a market sell for their entire PLUG position into an app with an interface like RH you literal smooth brain

2021-04-02 00:51:49,wallstreetbets,"HIVE as a gambling degenerate Technical Analysis play Note: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the material presented is accurate.

I won't go into detail as to what HIVE does, solely to avoid being banned, but do feel free to look it up. In short, this company ""digs for"" ""magic tokens"". However, it should be noted the environment HIVE is in is highly speculative.

At present, HIVE has a P/S of about 35, which appears quite high. However, its competitor RIOT currently has a P/S of about 319 at present levels. As a result, HIVE might have some ability to run upward like its competitor to quite high levels as well. Albeit in the long run, such high P/S levels might prove unsustainable for both stocks.

Technical Analysis of the play: HIVE recently entered into a descending triangle in which the stock just broke out a trendline to leave this pattern on the upside. This suggests HIVE has a ways to run upwards. Currently, the stock is priced at about $5.05. Based on the pattern, one might place a price target at the recent high of around $7.25, just before its spiral into a descending triangle. This would represent a gain in excess of 40%. Values are in Canadian dollars. The stock has also broken above its Ichimoku cloud, which is implicative of a long-run uptrend and might also act as a support (albeit a weaker one).

&#x200B;

[HIVE price + Ichimoku Cloud + Volume \(in bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/dgj43izmjmq61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=943dcfa7c272e4deb13884afffbf13cd46ee9180)

The stock has also broken above its 5 day (dark blue), 8 day (blue), and 13 day (light blue) moving averages, with the 5 day average crossing above its 8 day moving average. All of the moving averages are also curving upward. This is a positive sign and suggests the stock will continue to move upward. These might also contribute support levels for the stock in the future.

&#x200B;

[Moving Averages and Price](https://preview.redd.it/tlds3swzjmq61.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=44766db58be55a41a89b22373f059606a24ba55a)

TLDR; HIVE stock is an interesting, somewhat risky speculative play. The stock recently exited a descending triangle on the upside and this might suggest an opportunity for the stock to fly upward. 

Edit: clarity"

BLOK is an ETF that holds several assets that all correlate with the same magical internet money, all of which have pretty high implied volatility, and mostly go up and down together.

It's a way to either 1) collect premium from bears, or 2) buy the stock in the event the price drops as opposed to setting a limit purchase. 

For example, if price dropped to 160, he would almost certainly get assigned and have to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike price of 185. However, he wouldn't care since he sold the contract for 51.8 it makes his effective purchase price 133.2."

From what I remember, it has a healthy boomer dividend; real estate market on fire, mortgages through the roof, and they have a healthy refi business (but seems disproportionately so in the last Q to the straightforward mortgaging), and stock seems undervalued long term. 

HOWEVER: stock also trading in a downwards turn and only red for a while even on a fucking 400+ SPY day seems there are large positions exiting. Did they flunk their ultimatum deal and is RKT gonna eat their lunch, or is there room for both these bois?

TL:dr read the title you fucking retard.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> real estate market on fire, mortgages through the roof, and they have a healthy refi business 

As someone who works in the mortgage industry, I am staying away from any mortgage lender's stock. 

Since COVID, interest rates have been at an all-time low. That's not an exaggeration. Literally an all-time low. Every company across the industry has seen a record number of refis. Most lenders, including my company, started turning away self-employed people. Not because we couldn't get them qualified, but because we already had to many clients with W2 jobs who we were already working with. Self-employed takes much more man power and time to close. 

We also doubled in size this year. Our backend staff cannot keep up with the amount of business our sales staff is generating. 

Having said all that, it will not continue. Rates are already starting to go up. The mortgage industry will see a big contraction in 2021. While home purchases are going up this spring, there's not nearly enough volume to replace the record number of refis from this past year. 

Full disclosure, I had 1,000 shares of UWMC a few weeks ago. Was hoping to cash in on the Russell listing. Average cost was 8.42. Sold all when the news came out that the Russell listing wasn't happening. Sold at 8.71. 

Good luck!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC taught me noob to never ever buy overnight. buy order at market value at 9 something afterhours, then it mooned in premarket to 12 only to drop to 8 something after a few days and then going to where it is today...

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's selling calls, not buying.

Sell calls just out of range of where you think the stock could be by expiration.

Ex: if you think shares could be going for $40 maximum by the end of the month, sell 5x $50 calls and collect the premium. If the contacts don't get exercised, you keep the premium. If they do, you keep the premium and they buy your shares at $50 each

This has been an example and is not financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah I paid apprentice's premium that day, would never buy market again"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those shares are in my 401K and unfortunately options are not allowed there. I did sell some cash secured April 16th $7.5 puts in my regular account, so may end up owning 2,200 more shares in two weeks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That does improve the liquidity compared to ending the year with only 50k in cash... 

I want to point out that they also received a 800m note in November pre-spac that they burned through.

And at 5.5% interest rate doesn't show confidence by the one's who bought the notes. These are ""high yield""

Moody's assigned a credit rating of Ba3 to the notes, which is borderline junk bond.

So although securing further financing is good in the sense it keeps the lights on it doesn't change the fact that uwmc is commonly promoted on here as some type of ""value"" play instead of the high risk stock it really is.

If they improve their financial condition then they will start seeing increased shareholder value... their is significant downside risk though.

Edit to add: and borrowing money to pay a dividend that you cannot afford isn't value creating at all."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can also buy back the options once the premium has dropped enough to satisfy you. So selling one that expires a month out doesn't tie up those shares for the whole duration

&#x200B;

If you're sitting there week after week waiting for a short squeeze. holy shit you're playing this wrong. Twice a week (Monday and Friday) I daytrade the fuck out of GME. It's not uncommon for me to make a tens of thousands, or today's case, nearly 200k. The stock is stupid volatile and follows the same fucking pattern EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Do you ever wonder if all the people telling you to HODL might \_not\_ be on your side? If you, retail, lock up the float, the big boyz can also manipulate the price UP. Do you seriously think the shorts haven't managed their risk by now? For fuck's sake, you all post the DD here publicly.

My biggest regret is not selling in the January spike; my second biggest was not selling in March. I rectified all that by just dumping it all and hopping in and out constantly.

And before you say ""if he's in I'm in""--you dummy, he already sold a portion of his assets and made millions. I can't wait for a ""maybe"" short squeeze. I want money now. Wasn't that the point of this sub?

Have fun holding and getting worked up over literally nothing.

&#x200B;

EDIT regarding positions, from a comment I made below: 10M is the buying power from margin, so I have a fourth of that (3M). I started with 50k in November and grew it over the months (12 -> 20, 25 -> 40, 70 -> 210) and then started day trading positions from 2k - 10k from there. I usually mess around in the 5,000 share range, and only go 10,000+ if I need to average down. For example, if I bought 5,000 at 180, it falls to 170, I'll buy another 5,000 (putting me at 175), and then jump out at like 177. That's $20k right there. GME is so volatile in the bands and the good news is bullish so I'm usually not worried about the rug being pulled out from under me.

I had bought at 175 I think last week and then just dumped it all today at 195, got back in at 189 and then dumped it again at 194."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are the same comments that were directed towards DFV a year ago, now he's worth millions and still hasn't sold. Time. Time will prove who made the right choice. Until then, continue on as you see fit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they definitely were not (I should know - I commented in some of those threads). Even the degens of WSB thought it was mostly a dumb play and that the company would likely go bankrupt. The share price was also in the single digits at that time. His thesis was that it was severely undervalued in the single digits/under $20, and that the high short interest had a potential for a short squeeze if the price rose above $20. He would have been overjoyed at any of the prices we've seen over the last couple of months. He was not of the delusional mindset that GME would ever be worth thousands of dollars (which is ""too low to sell at"" - right?). Most of the people who wrote the original DD have exited their positions and though some have re-entered, every one of them I've spoken with does not believe another short squeeze is a likelihood. 

And DFV has sold many of his call options. Why not just exercise deep ITM calls for more shares? Because he was taking profits. He has $11M+ in cash that he could buy more shares with whenever he wants, but he hasn't. And I feel bad for him, because he will likely take less profits than he would have if he wasn't turned into this GME Messiah. He is probably concerned about prosecution or that some whacko who invested his rent money will come looking for him for ""derailing the squeeze"" if he sells. Not cool.

DFV has also already banked more profits in cash than 99.99% of GME holders will ever see in their lives. The stock could literally go to $0, the company could go bankrupt tomorrow, and he has still profited over ten million dollars. 

> Time. Time will prove who made the right choice. 

Yes. But also no. What a lot of you guys are missing right now (with the asinine posts talking about ""don't set a date!"") is that the real genius of DFV is he predicted **when** GME would spike. Its a requirement of a successful option play - the difference between an option expiring worthless and printing money. I had $30c 1/15 contracts - if they were 12/15 they would be worthless, but 1/15 they were worth thousands.

The thing about the current overarching thesis (which is, as far as I can gather, ""GME will massively spike in value at some indeterminate future date, absent any defined trigger or catalyst"") is that it is unfalsifiable; you can't disprove it or even argue against it (other than to say that most of the available evidence indicates that is not the case). Maybe it spikes tomorrow, maybe it spike in five years. Maybe it spikes when Cohen is CEO, maybe it spikes 6 months after Cohen is CEO. Maybe it spikes over $300, maybe it spikes if it crashes to $10. The stock could sit at $15 for a year, and you can still claim ""buying more shares at a discount, rocket about to launch!"" and there's nothing anyone could say against it. Because its a guess, not a thesis.

By all means, you all should do whatever you want with your money. Just keep in mind that any type of investing (/gambling) carries risk. Typically, risks and rewards are correlated. If you feel that the potential rewards are significant, all economic theory and market history indicates that the risk is also significant. When I originally invested in GME, I understood that I could lose everything I put into it, and I was OK with that level of risk."

I've had a bunch of shoulda couldas about reinvesting and quadrupling that money but that's all with hindsight.  If anything this year has shown me that even if I do throw money at it I will consistently make the wrong choices and am much more likely to lose money than make money.

So far I've taken $1,400 and turned it into $200 by:

‚Ä¢ Selling RIOT early (bought a $4.00 call that ended up an $80.00 call but I sold it at $7.50)

‚Ä¢ Playing Disney earnings

‚Ä¢ buying GME at the first top (also why I sold that RIOT call)

My parents bought their shitty small 3 bedroom for 80k in the 90s and paid it off in 20 years working average jobs 40k each. They actually determined back then that your house should cost close to your combined incomes.

If you applied the same logic today and their house is now worth 225k, my wife and I making average (in my area) 55k each would mean it would take us nearly 40 years paying the same percentage of incomes to achieve the same. That's fucked."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit. Reading the comments in that Paper trading Competition update is fucking hilarious. Read the rules summer autists.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The employment gap is still around 9.5-10 million by my estimates for what March 2021 employment would be if Covid never happened.  Keep that in mind before worrying about any doom and gloom from the CNBC/bond/bear crowd over a 900k jobs gain.

Feb 2020: total employment was 158.8 million.

Current employment as of March 2021 is 150.8 million.

We're still down a full 8 million jobs from Feb 2020 based on the household survey and that doesn't include an extra 1.5-2 million jobs from normal population growth over that 13 month span.

A lot of that gap will fill over the next 6 months, but the only way I'd turn bearish over stock pricing is if we see the gap entirely filled by October with 4+% inflation.

That's still an unlikely scenario.  Much more likely is the Feb 2020 gap being filled by December or January and still missing 2-2.5 million jobs due to population growth along with something like 3% inflation for 12 months.

Today's job report was pretty much perfect for supporting asset prices and dovish Fed policy."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.

Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this"

> Did you guys see your hair at the levels it was at before? 

You are chasing a fairy tale unless you have the funds for a Matthew McCoughney/Elon Musk style treatment - with plugs and procepia, which can make your penis stop working apparently. 

If you get plugs, you have to continue to get them - your hair doesn't just stop receding, hence the procepia and/or mixodil treatment. If you don't continue treatment your hair will recede beyond the plugs and you will have plug hair islands left behind from the transplants that will look worse than naturally balding.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope for you and I both that we can find a way out. I've been working on side projects that help temporarily, but I really only have time to do those late at night after work. It's a mixed bag with it though... Those projects make me feel fulfilled, but they usually deeply cut into the amount of sleep I'm able to get, which I feel actually makes things worse after a while.

Point of that being, as a temporary measure, If you have something or know of something you can do for fulfillment, and you're able to do it in a healthy way, go for it. It's certainly pulled me out from some spots I shouldn't linger in too long.

Long term I'm trying to educate myself in my free time on what I enjoy doing to try and make it into something I can make some money off of down the road (currently teaching myself how to use Blender, Premeire Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop). I enjoy doing it, but I don't really have a lot of time to learn it all in an efficient way.

Anyway, I've rambled a lot. I wish you the best. Maybe WSB will make us rich off a random GME like trade and we won't have to worry about a job we hate any more."

Then it happened again a few years later but for her daughter (they said she would have another boy).

Granted, this was all ~30 years ago now. Still, you're the second story I've heard about this happening to in the last week haha.

But congrats man! That's a really exciting thing! Hope that's not too much effort to get everything switched over last minute haha"

Anyway, in the Netherlands, you don't pay taxes on capital gains, only on the total amount of money you own (incl. stocks). That total amount tax only comes into effect when you own more than ~$35,000 ($40,000 might be more accurate considering conversion rates...) though, so if you spend the money you earn from stocks, you don't have to pay taxes on it either way."

Many of our greatest minds and entertainers took years to figure it out, to the general public, it merely *seems* easy.

One of my acting coaches puts it best:

""Lifes not really a race soo much as its a marathon.""

Hell I still work a 9 to 5, then try to jam in 3 hour recording sessions *and* auditions (plus look for said auditions because im what's considered an independent actor).... Exhausting dosnt cover it, but the more work it takes to get to a point, the more you'll appreciate the end results.

I now have regular clients in Indie Dev studios. I can now call myself a ""working actor"", and I *know* now that itll continue to build as long as I remember why I started doing acting: have fun.

Just dont *ever* lose the determination that made you want to change your life.

I imagine for most of the folks on here they‚Äôd lose About a 1/3 (looks avg fed income tax rate is 24% and then layer on state taxes and other stuff like SS). But yeah still closer to $20k than $10k in that case.

You also pay taxes on your total net worth, so to speak. This starts when you have around $35,000 (maybe 40,000 considering conversion rates...) collected in the bank (or in stocks/other assets). Before that, you don't have to pay additional wealth taxes, but there is a scale from that point onward. I'm not sure how much % it is, but it also sucks.

I believe you do get money back for some expenses, such as if you're studying and paying for it yourself, but really, they're basically just taking all the money you work hard for."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'm fed up with it. I'm paying almost half my income in taxes (my partner actually pays 50% of theirs) and where does the money go? To my shitty (fortunately now) ex-neighbour, who has 5 little children in a 2 bedroom house, who yell, cry, screech, scream from 6 AM - 1 AM, who play their loud, trashy music all day, and smoke weed every day, has lots of different men over all the time, throws trash every-fucking where in the grass field behind the house, in the street in front of the house, generally around the house. I used to have to every day collect cigarette butts and random trash and throw them back over the fence.

That's where my taxes go to. That bitch neighbour hasn't worked a day in her life, several of her children have already been taken away (yes, she had more than 5), she's currently neglecting a baby of 1 year old (the youngest), and threatens people with their lives if anyone talks about calling CPS.

And I don't really want to be the person who finances this. So fuck socialism. I'd love to move somewhere else, and I hope to do it in the next few years."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I got it, thank you. He bought the call option contract for  $13 a piece and then resold the contract each for $126. 

Why would someone buy the contract for $126 if all they can make is $1 per share x 100? That‚Äôs a net loss of $26."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the call was close to be in the money and there was a last day uptrend making it go from.useless to Itm. Expiring options with strike close to current price have huge volatility because they go from useless to in the money quickly.

The problem is they are risky as well because all that money can go to 0 in minutes.

But if you are right you make bank because it can easily 500% (a high risk high reward gamble)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Does he need 100 shares as collateral to resell the call option contract he bought?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you sell to close. 
Write = create option (need collateral shares/money or it is called writing naked)

Buy/sell the owned option to close= only trade the option for it's premium

Exercise = if the call is in the money, exercise the contract to buy or sell 100 shares per contract at the strike. Exercising is not an obligation. Take care because some brokers autoexercise if option expires in the money. 

Options are leverages with maximum risk (for buyers)"

2021-04-01 23:36:27,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ‚úÖ  credit to u/Rivaaal

 I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to* ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** *The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It‚Äôs not on weaker demand. It‚Äôs only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don‚Äôt quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future.

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends‚Äù. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry‚Äôs strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don‚Äôt like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it‚Äôs an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will.

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** *QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.*

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now).

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it‚Äôs funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I‚Äôm wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia.

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you‚Äôve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO.

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become?

I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (please don‚Äôt do like me).

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that‚Äôs because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

Bonus: when will the sale happen? üîÆ crystal ball said before the next ER so in a few weeks (totally random and speculative)."

I think one big way BB is currently falling short is advertising- their software is the guts for a lot of key systems and the only people that know about them as a software company are the nerds who actually work on those systems. They need to get out there more and get their story in front of key boomer decisionmakers, who from my experience, barely understand how to open a pdf file let alone the nuances of unified endpoint management or cybersecurity in general"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Uber has sold its autonomous vehicle research division to a startup named Aurora. It's a major shift for a company that once saw self-driving technology as a core investment for its future."" (NPR, 2020). True, however, but just because they gave up on their research division does not mean that in the future, they won't just buy, let's say, a fleet of self-driving Tesla's for some high tourist destination. As the tech progresses, so will $BB. At least we know that Uber is interested in that field of autonomous driving. It could just be their research division just sucked and wasn't worth keeping?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's GF2? lol

\*Edit: Godfather 2. My bad bro. Haha"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right? Everyone is mad it's dipping; I'm sad because a harder dip means I'd have more shares rn.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My smooth brain hasn't figured out much, but it has figured out that $BB is the key to my early retirement if I just keep stacking shares. Unfortunately with my wife carrying her bf's baby right now I can only afford around 200-250 shares per month so I will just continue at that rate for the foreseeable future, until she tells me I can spend more of my hard earned money at least."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Goobers gunna goob.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Rocket emoji = moon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"4/30, 5/7, 5/14 so far. Not a lot of premium to be had at the moment."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed. I don't see BB any lower than 12 by EOY.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You missed one:

Rolls Royce = luxury motorcars"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,UBER still owns 26% of Aurora and has a board seat
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is my long play. Hoard BB like a dragon and sell covered calls and cash secured puts on BB for the next 5-10 years.

Grow the pile until it can sustain me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok cool. I definitely noticed the lack of premium so I am hesitant to sell calls 6 weeks out for just 30 bucks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Iot is where it‚Äôs at, the question is whether anyone can beat Amazon/google to the punch. A couple good partnerships, and they could have an easy monopoly I think. But then again, I‚Äôm a moron, so idk. I just know Amazon‚Äôs investing a shitton of money in expanding their data processing capabilities and servers right now, and google... just seems like the next obvious choice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm just doing it for the shortest windows possible. Most of my powder is tied up, so keeping them short gives me stuff to look at.

Hell, I sold 2 on 03/31 for 12.50 4/1 and made a whopping $2. 

Who cares though? Free money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB and Amazon announced a partnership a few months back, so the more money they invest, the better. From day 1, when Chen took over, he stressed that partnerships were going to be their future, and I totally get what he's saying. All these huge name companies - Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Uber, etc. are all working on autonomous vehicles, and then BlackBerry comes in and says, ""hey, you're going to need to secure all that tech and data..."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I like the short windows too. Best return on premium and gives you some protection from a massive spike in price.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that‚Äôs a relief! That should be good for them then
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think you're looking at the covered calls wrong. I just set my strikes to where I won't be mad if they get called away. Sure it would have made me sad to have my shares called; but it would be for around $4/share more than I paid for it. Who gives a shit then? Fuckin' take that extra money, use it to buy cash secured puts with a strike price of your cost basis or lower. 

Rinse repeat."

2021-04-01 23:15:14,wallstreetbets,"$ASO and why you apes are gonna be mad you missed this one Alright let‚Äôs get right into this. $ASO known as academy sports and outdoors is a large nationally run sports equipment n shit like that store. I‚Äôm poetic I know. Academy has 259 stores nationwide but wants to see that grow to over 800.

They just report earnings this week and absolutely SMASHED earnings. EPS projected .46, actual was 1.09. They also beat revenue projections from 1.56B to 1.6B not much but still improved. Their net sales was 5.69(nice)Billion a 18% increase over the prior year. In comparison Dicks sporting goods, which has substantially more stores only improved 9.5% yoy.

Considering the fact that all of last year basically every single sport was canceled and yet they still destroyed earnings has me happier than a kid on Christmas morning. Every single team sport that was shut down last year is back for business this year baby which means more money for $ASO ü§ëü§ëü§ë. Oh they also sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, which is obviously a big deal in today‚Äôs political scenario.

Now you say, okay why‚Äôs that matter this stock has been trading for only a couple months. Well here‚Äôs where things get interesting.

This is a disclaimer, I do not care how high a company is shorted unless there is substantial evidence that would convince me that due to the high short interest and the proponents of a good run company that the price will increase. This is that scenario.

Short interest is at 39%, public float is 31M and market cap is 2B, 9.1 days to cover, read those numbers again, then wipe your ass cause you probably shit yourself.

Now I don‚Äôt want to taunt this as ‚ÄúThE nExT gMe‚Äù cause it‚Äôs not. I am simply bringing attention to a company with almost 900 MILLION CASH ON HAND, and the fact that EVERY SINGLE MOTHERFUCKING SHORT is currently underwater. Yup you read that right, every single short that has been opened in this stock is currently underwater. Unless $ASO screws up big time these shorts will have no choice but to cover.

Pos: 4/16 $30c

Edit: I forgot to mention 92% is owned by institutions

Edit: wsb mods banned me for 69 days for ‚Äúpaper trading‚Äù when I‚Äôve never paper traded a day in my life lmfao what a fucking joke, nobody like a jerkoff mod

IF ANYONE HAS QUESTIONS PLEASE MESSAGE ME THE MODS ARE FAKE AND GAY AND BANNED ME SO I CANT REPLY TO ANYTHING

Edit x3: THE SHARE LOCKUP PERIOD ENDED TWO DAYS AGO YOU SEE WHERE IT WENT FROM $27 to $24AT OPEN YA THAT WAS THE ‚Äúlockup period‚Äù people are worried about it‚Äôs already done and gone


EDIT X4: I JUST DISCOVERED THE DOLLAR VOLUME SOLD SHORT IS $309 MILLION DIVIDE THAT BY THE SHARES SHORTED OF 12.5 MILLION AND YOU FIND THE AVERAGE DOLLAR COST OF THE SHORT POSITION IS AT $25 THEY ARE SO FUCKED"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate that there's no visibility of non-GME posts. Who knows how many ASO posts I've missed over the past couple weeks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit we‚Äôre at $30 AH!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,After researching this company and their stock price since they went public. I‚Äôm hard like rock fucking hard. Like cash out my life insurance policy and put it all on ASO HARD
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck do people even find these random ass companies, damn. 

To be clear, I‚Äôm not insulting you, I‚Äôm just a jealous bitch."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought 30c yesterday after insider sell off. I bought them for .316... in 2 days they‚Äôre up to 1.48. And that was before the run up AH.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can still jump on this on Monday correct?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been holding 22 of the JUL $30s for awhile now, in at $4.20, saw it go up to $6.60and didn't sell last time they spiked to $28, rode the wave down (averaged down) and rode it back up again, finally should be back in the green on those Monday!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only retardants aint in this play
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put in an order for $200 6.666 shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wife is a manager at our local Academy. The region she‚Äôs in has good leadership and in the hot bed of the Southeast gun culture, is smashing sales right now. Probably time to get her to jump into their stock program."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought some on Monday cheap it‚Äôs going to go to moon , 46% short interest"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,End of the world was happening. Everyone and their grandma were buying guns. AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the US. Dicks stopped selling them. Explains why they had such massive gains over Dick's IMO.  I have a lot of guns and ammo. Didn't buy anything in 2020 because of this mad run to have protection from zombies or whatever they thought was gonna happen.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not sure if they‚Äôll get filled but just tried some 4/16 $30c and 5/21 $35c options with limits set for Monday. Also 10 shares at $30 limit for Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are these the same types of sporting goods that can all be bought on Amazon?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,OP has a 4mo old account.... Hmmm?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Put 1500 in stock at 28.80
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can anyone explain what‚Äôs the difference between buying options right now compared to waiting for Monday for the market to open?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 shares yesterday on Robinhood. I'm only 10 days old at investing and have a question about call options.
If the call cost is $33 for 100 shares 04/16 at a strike price of $30, how do I calculate prospective payout? I understand ""the right but not the obligation"", but I'm confused what would happen if ASO goes to $40 in this particular scenario by 04/16. 
How much would that options contract be worth?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Guns and ammo driving sales?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,what do you think the premiums on that would be for a poor boy like me??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did someone say call? I‚Äôm in
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Guns and kayaks bby
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably better if you‚Äôre buying calls which I assume you are based on which sub we‚Äôre in.  Theta over a three day weekend is diabolical especially if you‚Äôre buying short dated.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 4 days
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 theta gang
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sold me 4/16 25c and quadrupled down on the same, let‚Äôs go. Closed at $30 in aftermarket today."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">04-16  
>  
>$1.12

im gonna get some!! don't set sail without me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you buy for 35c at 4/16?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Also interested in knowing this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This a local company to many of us. Unlike Dick‚Äôs/Cabela‚Äôs. We go there for most, if not all outdoor activities.  I don‚Äôt believe this is over ammo. It only went public in Oct. I‚Äôm new to Reddit and stocks. I saw the connection on short holders. Guessed right, or lucky. Will see gains hopefully both short and long."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There‚Äôs been a ton of ASO posts over the last few weeks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought beginning of March based on posts here. The thing is my position is down about 25%, so no guarantees that getting in early means you win."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You been under the rock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm going to.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man look at my past posts, you‚Äôll see one ASO post from a month ago but I had to try 10 times because mods kept deleting."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's because you signed up for the competition, most likely"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMZN will not sell guns...EVER
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Check out optionsprofitcalculator.com
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The call would be worth $1000. You're essentially buying right to buy 100 shares at 30 for a premium of the contract. 40\*100 - 30\*100 = 1000
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôd wanna sell before that happens otherwise the contract becomes useless. You wanna sell close as possible to the strike break for max profits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I go into academy at least once a week - and they‚Äôve been out of stock on both for months, probably part of it but seems like random other shit is getting run on too - bikes, workout equipment - anything to keep people going during lockdown I guess.  I think they‚Äôll boom when shit reopens though because they‚Äôve done this well with team sports being shut down, so once those are back they‚Äôll see a jump in sales too."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Retardant. Go back to your mother‚Äôs womb
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It got to $30AH....has to be in the $2-2.50 range depending on what happens pre market on Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm it‚Äôs currently at all time high so you should be up atleast a little bit no?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they selling sporting goods or drugs?  That is a lot of $$$ in a short amount of time? (Oct 2020)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,P/E ~7 comapred to Dick's ~13?  Interesting.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for clarifying!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. That‚Äôs the exercise payout not the contract being sold payout.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there data on how many shares insiders sold?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ooga ooga me likes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks go up
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"March 2 the 4/16 $30C was about $1.3, March 8 it was at $3.8, and recently it was at $1.5. I had the misfortune to buy at the high (also bought shares then for about $26), but I had thought back then that at least once earnings comes out the stock would be on its way to $40+. I think there is a decent chance ASO moons this week so hopefully I come out nicely ahead.

Edit - Apparently I am an idiot... I am actually up on ASO... I forgot I had previously sold positions and pocketed a gain of about $9,000 (in beginning of March). So instead of being down about $5,000, I am actually up about $4,000."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO could easily hit $40 by 4/16 if shorts cover. It‚Äôs been in the top 4 most shorted stocks for months despite great earnings and being a great value.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I mean you might get like an extra $50 from the premium but not really much
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,9.1 days to cover so this will blast off latest on the 15th?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They hide SI via married puts and synthetic Long's... There's whole lotta DD out there with sources and calculations... Dyor
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep that's exactly what days to cover means. It's literally that easy to predict a short squeeze, which is why they happen all the time and retail investors frequently make easy money by playing them."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sad how AMC stock holders seem a lot happier & even support the GME movement. As where GME retards are just toxic assholes. You clowns do realize you can support both? At the end of the day it‚Äôs a war against hedge funds. So hurt them in more ways than one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so glad I sold my shares for a profit and bought more GME.

I don't see it not being at least 8 by end of year, even if they dilute it. Paying off debts and building a ton of cash will give investors a sense of security and will probably bring in bigger money from non-retail investors. You know, the ones that buy more than 1k shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, man. 

The dollar drop yesterday was enough for me to move on. It‚Äôs nice that you believe if the vote passes they won‚Äôt issue new shares.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There has been a lot of misunderstanding on AMC's dividend program. Contrary to popular belief they DO pay dividends! During 2020 AMC made negative 4.6 billion in profits, there are 175 million shares, so each shareholder on record 12/31/2020 owes AMC a dividend of $39.15 per share. AMC accepts Venmo or Payal for your dividend payments. Send to [no-reply@amc.com](mailto:no-reply@amc.com)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got my shareholders package and I voted no to those 500m.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think fair to say they will take any rout they feel will keep them alive.  how could anyone even feel slighted by that...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I never understood about $AMC is why buy them over studio tickers like $DIS or $T?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not news. This is old news but many media outlets used this yesterday as headline AGAIN. Their intention is so obvious when they have nothing bad on AMC, also how synchronized it was tells you what they are after. Hope apes not dumm enough to fall for it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't like how money hungry and full of himself uncle bruce is. But his position on AMC is spot on. It doesnt even compare to GME in the slightest. I cant think of a single metric that would make me go AMC over GME if I had a few thousand to invest
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is HF manipulation. They NEED the stock to go down and they need it to happen NOW because in a few weeks the pandemic will get its teeth knocked out and the re-opening will begin. Memorial Day weekend is coming, movies have been sitting on the shelf waiting for the re-opening, people are bored AF not being able to just go out once in a while. Once the re-opening hits there will be a string of ‚Äúgood news‚Äù numbers coming out from AMC and the stonk go up. Stonk go up then whatever short interest there is will LOSE. Yes, SI may be significantly lower now but the HF that are shorting this stock don‚Äôt care, they want to lie and cheat headlines into making you sell. If you held out this long why the hell would you sell BEFORE THE RE OPENING!?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, gme and amc bubbles are gonna pop. Dilution is real. Insiders wanna get paid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMHO, dilution of a stock worth owning is a buying opportunity..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME IS OLD news! AMC IS GOING TO BE BIGGER than GME ever thought about being!!!!! All we do is Hold Apes!!!! ü¶çüíéüöÄüåï When everything comes to light AMC will be the stock everybody wished they had invested in! GME IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS AMC‚Äôs stock! There will never be another stock that does what AMC is about to do!!!!!!!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imma wait for that dilution dip to buy back in.  Lol.  If you read the further down they‚Äôre creating 500 mil shares and they also want to use 35 mill shares to immediately raise capital the other 465mil shares goes to the board and execs to line their pockets and also maybe to negotiate off some debt. But when they trade off those shares for debt where do you think those shares go?  They‚Äôre sold off in the market.  Diluting the stock even more.  Maybe some of y‚Äôall are right they have no choice dilute or die but they‚Äôre so fucking stupid they just keep crushing the momentum of their stock cause they‚Äôre desperate paper handed pussies.  Wake up and don‚Äôt be a bag holder here.  There may be a time to buy back into this stock but the short term ain‚Äôt lookin so good for amc.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"and Im sure they wont issue more shares, the fact they are considering it after just issuing  hundreds of millions of shares in february....amirite?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha all these paper handed losers selling AMC please sell we dont need yall anyway üòÇü§£
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can do what you want, but I wouldn't hold AMC much longer if I had it. It won't skyrocket and is nowhere close to the GME situation. In a few months it will probably be around 3 to 4 dollars a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love to waste my money I used to just burn it for warmth but now that I‚Äôve found AMC my money disappears even quicker!! Dropped another $200 on this failing stock!!! ( /s for those that need it)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"May I ask a question: Everyone knows that Gme was the main game from the start. Also, Gme Doesn't introduce new shares. Why would anyone buy AMC?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is fucked. The board dumped most of their shares. Gg roll credit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares. AMC is a distraction.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You‚Äôre an idiot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme here I come
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought into the hype a month and half or so ago. Brand new to trading. Joined the amc subreddit. Said i was holding forever blah blah blah. But my gut feeling told me it was never gonna sky rocket like people were saying. Plus reading a lot of other opinions on it and the fact that has so much debt. I bought at 9.24 and when it hit 13+ I just had to bail out. No regrets there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone so desperate to tell amc holders to sell? It's my fate and my choice. Have your opinions but I'm holding and true amc holders have known about the 500 million shares and alot of cucks have tried convincing amc stock holders that they are going to issue. That is not true the ceo said for the right to issue and only at a given time. I've lost fate in wsb. Fuck your silver and fuck your opinions! If gme did worse than amc I wouldn't go bashing it and try to dishearten its investors. It's about trying to burn the shorts not the company's fundamentals at the end of this game. I agree with another amc investor it's true streaming is nice and convenient but I love going to the movies on a date or with friends. Gamestop is just a game store. It's way better and faster to buy and download games 95 percent of my ps4 library is from psn.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME seething lol U mofos sound like bitches AMC to the moon üåôüåöü§£üòÇGME RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th? Far away galaxy day? AMC is getting into the meme stuff too?!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,i sold my amc and put it into athx. i'd rather a 10 year hold than 10 months until a billion shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So I should sell my 5 shares avg $16 per or hold like gme?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted against it. Being a sharehodlr has benefits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,haha...they're shorting themselves and leaving us holding the bag.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got out of AMC in early February after riding high from sub 3. This company is shitty and its executives are just stringing the retail movement along to make themselves richer. I love the movies and enjoy specifically AMC theaters, but this move is played, and now they're potentially trying to dilute their already over-diluted stock. Pass"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a stock split does the share price stay the same?  No.  It goes down by about half but you own two shares, and overall it kinds of trends up because the company is healthy enough that they needed to split their stock.   What AMC is doing is a basically a stock split, since they're doubling their shares with dilution, but they are giving the other share to themselves. (VIAC just diluted by 5 percent and their stock tanked by 2/3 share price, but there were other factors too.)

So figure a healthy AMC is when the stock is selling for 11 bucks right now.  So after dilution if it's above 5 that would be pretty good for them.  Smooth brains here don't seem to understand the concept of dilution, when you bash AMC about the stock being overpriced they tell you the shares were 20 dollars pre-Covid, not taking into account they have quadrupled the share count(more since then and they want to double that.)   

I really know I shouldn't say this because I just sold my puts yesterday.  I just want the stock price to still be nine bucks by monday and I can get my precious puts."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The news doesn't care about the truth. They saw a chance to crater the stock today and ran with it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I‚Äôll buy more puts then. It‚Äôs gonna tank, there is no squeeze and never was gonna be one, you‚Äôd be out of your mind to hold. The diamond hand mentality has gone a little far in the case of amc"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell your shares while you can
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For people saying GME is good for a long term Investment and that it has a chance of improving, please stop! Gme has always had bad customer service, bad practices and overall shitty experiences. Gme has no chance of surviving long term. Once GME takes off I hope people sell and make some bank. Not financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold for a small profit and got far away from this corrupt company.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this bullish?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing AMC share price will drop if they introduce the 500m or will it be like a share split?

And could this vote cause a recall of share?  Forcing shorts to cover?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep getting phone calls from an 800 number and they ask me to vote.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I moved some money in degiro cuz i did not trust etoro, but I can only buy 1 gme and 5/6 amc. I did not follow amc data so I have no idea of what a possible floor could be, any good soul that could make a super recap?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in Australia- commsec
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What‚Äôs the difference introducing means it will happen CEO of AMC is taking advantage of up tic in stock price telling news outlets ‚Äúwe want more people to have access to our shares‚Äù
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Mr Cramer finished Mad Money today noting issuing some shares could be very good for AMC and shareholders.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got out AMC because there was only one logical reason for big funds and the CEO buying millions of shares. So they could rig this vote in their favor. Helping out the hedge funds is going to benefit them more in the long run than helping Joe Blow squeeze their stock.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If everyone dumped their shares it would moon off instantly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And guess what. It will pass
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not looking for financial advice. How do you place a put properly?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Multi pass!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they CAN, why would they not? Seriously, if they win the vote, is there any reason they would hold back? The date would be later but the outcome would be the same"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone thinking they're trying to get bought out by another company by lowering their stock value?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Legit surprised retards aren‚Äôt googling this shit, they flooded shares right after the GME squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And then give the CEO a fat bonus.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlike gamestop, amc is taking advantage of the situation. Gamestop is climbing out with intent to turn things around. Where as amc, they have no alternatives to changing their business model."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a ‚Äúget rich scheme‚Äù by AMC corporate executives. I am a bag holding ape like many of you. This is throwing feces in our face after we helped bail them out. We are apes, they are fucking pigs."

Would you care telling us how many AMC shares you own?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Like the 3 million dollar bonus? The ceo thanks you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. No doubt in my mind they are taking advantage at this point.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc/GME were always going to have to issue new shares eventually. 1. What kind of idiots would not when their share price is 1000000% higher 2. After everyone gets theirs, the shorts are going to eventually need the shares. More than likely, retail owns more than 100% of the float and institutions also own more than 100%"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if they use 500M (and there's no indication they will) it'll either be to do M&A (feels likely given how they keep unsubtly hinting at it) or to pay off debt cheaply (which is a drag on the share price to an equivalent amount anyway and removing that debt cheaper than letting it run is net positive).

Paper handed bi**es attitude to this is blergh, the simple fact is we don't know when they intend to use them or to what degree and how quickly. Presumably if they do the idea won't be to just dump them on the market all at once; not least because that would be a breach of their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeee boi! Anyone who looks at the actual value of amc shares knows this aint something you should yolo calls into
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i bought into the hype and had to sell my AMC at a loss, $10k USD down the chute. What broke for me was when the CEO goes out in the morning and tells everyone hell yeah, we are going to issue more shares! even if there are many steps, he's out there shouting it out at the top of his lungs. I don't care what the line of questioning was, he needed to answer it better. The wrong msg was put in his mouth and that tanked us hard."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't wait til there's 500 million more shares to short
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I cant believe people trust an organization that charges 20 dollars for popcorn and fucks over shareholders when we got Papa Cohen and friends at GME giving us deep fucking value
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen too much DD on GME to even feel worried about parking my money there. I'm happy to wait it out through spikes and dips.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already got myself into May 21 Puts before this news was even announced. Was getting a little nervous as that 10-11 dollar resistance seemed to be holding the last couple weeks. Glad I did now though!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will not force the shorts to cover but may give them an opportunity of doing so at a discount. A split would split the existing stock and its price but not give revenue to the company. This will be issuing of new stock which will bring money to the company as the seller and decrease the price and share percentage of the average shareholder. 

Lets put it in ape language. If you own 1 banana and there are 10 in existance.
Share split: you now own 2 bananas out of 20 in existance. Your value is retained even if the individual banana is just half the price.
New shares issued: You now own 1 banana out of 20 in existance and the company gets cash from the new banana sales. Your value is cut in half."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you don't. The post above is correct, and yet with that dilution in AMC share value, its still the smarter play short term than GME. GME's Cohen Thesis from January was based on 2023 revenue projections using multiples pulled from Chewey, which is about as oranges to GME's apples as you get. Even with those models and realistic market share projections, GME should only be worth about 60-80 on FORWARD EARNINGS. Even using the Chewey multiples on the March earnings you're still in the 30-40 range. There's absolutely no play above 80 that makes sense right now on GME, and all the cultists circle jerking in each others' mouths in Wendy's parking lots doesn't make the price make any more sense."

One day if GME has rumors and media attacks it, I would never be a GME basher, we are in this together.

Never realise so many clowns jump out when AMC bumps a bit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep talking, I'm almost there. 

Tell him how they quadrupled the float in the last year and I swear I'll nut like a virgin."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That‚Äôs pretty presumptuous. I presume they like to make money, on any timeline."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The person you are answering didn't say a word about GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would they do that... did they say what they want to use the money for?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"LoL ape language.  That's what I figured it was.  But it sounded like such a bad idea I thought, no way."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly how can the ceo make a statement about limiting dilution with such an announcements
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"all the meme stocks were basically manipulated at the same time GME was blowing up, you look at the 1 year chart on all of them they pretty much blew up at the same time every time. Imagine if all those meme stocks had the money focused on GME"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How will they pay off their debt without issuing shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They flooded shares around the time that all of the meme stocks squeezed. Too lazy to find the DD on it. I pulled out at that point. There‚Äôs still a short on the company, just not to the point everyone was hopping in the train for"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,its amazing how many people watch these shows where the person doing the show clearly is just some idiot who has been trading 6 months on robinhood and watching some other idiots on youtube.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I could argue GME is undervalued at 200 with their recent moves and position
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not any more after they continually fuck their shareholders. Honestly do you and I support that, but holy fuck there are way more shares and more coming. Impossible to squeeze a stonk if shares get diluted what seems like monthly at this point. 

Glad the execs got paid tho."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> But at least GME has potential to survive as a company

lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its almost like fundamentals dont matter for spmething to squeeze
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My puts, which are ITM are still losing me money. I can't win."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm dumping AMC Monday. Already down 15% with AMC so hopefully GME gets a nice dip so I can dump $2k and average down
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This. I feel like everyone is so focused on short term stock value. But if AMC raises money to pay their debts they can actually begin to reinvest in the company leading to longer term share value. Better than then going bankrupt and everyone‚Äôs share prices dropping to 0.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yall really doing this gme vs amc
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah if it ever breaks my avg price of $14 again I'm done. Don't like what management is doing but don't want to eat too much of a loss sandwich
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet, they immediately look to dilute again..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There is nothing smart short term about going into a play that is going to dilute 100's of millions of shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why in the world would I buy digital copies of a game from GameStop if the consoles already have stores Microsoft / Sony on them where you can buy games ? 
GameStop wouldn't bring anything new to the e commerce market . And that's something that defines succes"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are. Its the literal basics you lack understanding. Noone's here to hold your hand. These shit can be debunked in a 5 min google search.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, they already diluted like 2 times since january. Their float was like 100mill shares at the start of the year. Everytime there is a little runup they dilute. Now the float is 450mill and they want to double it again. They do not care about your votes lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg literally retarded lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO is trying to make AMC profitable of course. I‚Äôm not questioning his motives.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO was on CNBC talking about dilution.  There's being in this together and then there's denying reality.  You're denying reality.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker told me they have no info about a vote on AMC . 
I'm in Europe aswell . Trade Republic"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The board is doing what they can to save the company. They converted much debt to equity... And then paid themselves fat bonus because fuck the idiots in reddit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and therefor they do not want the company they are long in to go bankrupt. If they did they would have shorted it. Institutional longs will vote yes and keep a long timeframe. The ones who would have voted no sold the moment the news of possible dilution hit their bloomberg terminal."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. They don‚Äôt have to say anything about GME. it‚Äôs implied.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have accrued billions in debt over the past year. They need to stay solvent, pay off some of the debt and reduce interest fees. For the long term survival of the company this is the smart play. Issue new stock while riding a wave and get cash on hand to invest in the health of the company. For the squeeze and short term holders it's really bad."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he's stating just because they can issue stock doesn't mean they will.  But if approved I mean its kinda expected that they are going to issue quite a lot of it.  500M is more than the current float out now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not against it, they were in a bad spot due to COVID and I‚Äôm glad they got saved. People are investing with the idea it‚Äôs another squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By taking profits? Same as every other company. 

People act like AMC is going destitute. Unlike GameStop they actually stand a chance to make a lot of money in the first year after Covid to dig themselves out of a hole."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that‚Äôs a totally different point. You said no one is googling what share dilution would do. People are concerned about it for a good reason. They are voting against it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôm not sure what your point is. Yes AMC quadrupled their shares in the past year. 

The only people acting like this is news are the ones who bought into the hype in January and can‚Äôt read a 10k or understand why dilution is bad. 

That‚Äôs why everyone is voting no to authorize **another** 500m shares from being issued."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok lets hear it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol the self righteous delusion is nauseating.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC barely put a dent in their debt. In their own words, they raised enough to survive until the end of the *year*.

They still have multiple billions in debt"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Imagine being so confident and yet so wrong at the same time.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">and the movie experience isn't something that is just going to go away especially in a sector that is so consolidated nowadays.

I will likely never go to the movies again. $40 for two hours and limited, overpriced snacks? I do not miss it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but GME has new revenue streams while AMC is lucky to go back to their status quo.

Gme value is dependent on their new leadership not us apes. You are delusional"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMCs problem is the ‚Äúmovie experience‚Äù is now available to me in my living room.   And the snacks are better/cheaper and I don‚Äôt feel so ghetto for smoking weed in my car in the AMC parking lot.  I can do that shit in my garage, where weed is meant to be smoked"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme as a tech company can the shopify path.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well lenders would be over the moon if this dilution happened. And AMC is so debt leveraged that they are beholden to the lenders above all else.

If they go under lenders get paid first. If they can raise $2B from this share issuance I think amc could be around for quite a bit longer and could pay off their bonds significantly before finally dying off.

I‚Äôve heard that some have been buying the guaranteed bonds with 10% interest rates for 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. If they can be paid in full they will look like the bond kings. They also are the only organized group with enough pull to influence amc. Now that Wanda holds less that 10% and silverlake made a full exit, their largest shareholder by far is retail. Not organized, 95% not educated, not realistic. They hold no power

Equity holders are fucked in either situation. Lenders get paid and execs keep their jobs for years if they can raise this capital by issuing more shares. If they don‚Äôt issue shares they go under and lenders get scraps, shareholders get literally nothing... so what do you think will really happen? Lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper handed bitch
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man now your thinking
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I‚Äôm with you not to mention  the hedges now know there‚Äôs a chance to wait us out you‚Äôd think the ceo would have waited intill after a squeeze. Not to mention he did the announcement on one of our rivals
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was me. I went in 131 @14.33 in January. As soon as it went back up last month, I sold all @14.37. I just didn‚Äôt trust AMC. Although I am no longer in GME, I have more faith in the moves they are making and it seems like they are at least trying. AMC is just taking advantage of the situation"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Press X to doubt
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they need to do it. But being invested in them knowing this would happen and while they do it is retarded. Literally volunteering to loose value.

Elder this is a retarded response."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For a squeeze play. Any other reason given is just cognitive dissonance to avoid selling and buying GME. Self sabotage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You called it these comment smell of hedgies
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you buy AMC at $14? LOL
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope Hollywood gets everything it so richly deserves.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> AMC broke even or lost money in 2019 with the greatest money making lineup you could hope for. 

They lost money. It's in their 10-K."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go woke, go broke. 

Hollywood gotta inject politics, anti male and anti white into every thing.  You even see that in sports too.  How is it that during a pandemic where people stuck in homes but yet tv ratings for sports are tanking?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I‚Äôm convinced I could turn that shit around...go heavy into marketing on the experience side.

Buy whatever the fuck ironic shit could get people out for a date night as reopening is going on

Literally every pandemic in history commerce picked up, cities came back, economies roared...if they can‚Äôt capitalize on that they‚Äôre even stupidest than me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao but maybe as WSB we should unite to oust the CEO if it comes to it. Find someone for us all to proxy voting right to get that greedy little prick out of there
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"at this point to think either is a ""free money machine"" is a bit delusional. GME probably has a better chance than AMC at this point but its really a crapshoot right now because nobody actually know the full situation, just a bunch of retarded ""DD"" written by people who have been holding $400 bags since january which was coincidentally their first month trading."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time for wsb to go the way of the hedges and start shorting AMC?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold at 21. Bought back in multiple times and somehow now average 18. I am brilliant.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gave the answer in your statement. If you think the price is going down, short sell the stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Streaming rentals. Case closed two seconds of brainstorming. Now let‚Äôs see what Ryan Cohen does with it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You sound a bit angry like someone who owns AMC offends you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah thanks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know more about markets more than you would like to give me credit for, but hey.....good luck to you too!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it‚Äôs being pushed both ways! If the stock doesn‚Äôt go down in price how does a put make money? If it doesn‚Äôt go back up how do calls make money? A stock going sideways does nothing for both sides
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 10% of HF who have shorted the stock are just going to lose money? Or will they attempt to convince holders that they should sell? You should wake up my friend. Lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reality is CEO is talking about it as a financial plan, but it is highly likely not going to happen, we share holders decide the outcome.

That's the reality. You are bending reality.

The way the interview is constructed makes this topic inevitable. What's with all those fear spread?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,*lights a cigarette*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, go in to go bankrupt is not good. I wonder why the market is so unpredictable if institutions all do exactly what you say? weird..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not even sure why you're glad they are saved? They should go bankrupt and redesign their business. Even before COVID they were going down the gutter due to streaming. There's a reason Netflix has a market cap 10X of AMC and why AMC hasn't had a profitable year in almost a decade.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"go look up the last time AMC made profit for an entire year. take that profit and then look at how much they are paying in interest for their 5 billion in debt.

smh"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point is they already flooded shares and people are still pushing that it‚Äôs a massive short squeeze like GME. It‚Äôs an alright long term position, but WSB has been flooded with people only going for squeeze stocks. 


I already pulled out, hoping for tendies for the people still holding though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme is undervalued at 190 once the e commerce starts to move. The newly hired people offer great potential, and the apes are ensuring marketing is not an issue.

Unless they do something stupid as issuing more shares, gme should easily touch 250 and grow depending on movement, just from society's position."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,When you go against the hivemind you should expect downvotes and attacks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then you never really liked going to the movies in the first place.  if 10 bucks a ticket is too much for you, thats understandable, some people are cheap af and or dont like paying for fun.   i knew a kid who never got toys, he still played just fine."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"i guess movie experience is different for people who dont really like movies or doing activities.  people still do date nights, there are still movie buffs, and even my 75 oled with nice atmos doesnt compete to going to the movies."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate smoking in my garage man lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you man. But millions of people want the experience of going to the movies. For example KonG Godzilla is making huge profits in the movies around the world!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that's the way you feel about the ""movie theatre experience"", I feel kinda sorry for you. Of course you can get yourself a Ultima 40 system and a big screen, but hell nah that' just watching a movie, no experience there. Never took a gal to the movies? Whole different experience from Netflix&Chill, and that is what AMC lives off and will live of again once the pandemic's over"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"consoles come with  gamestop killing digital stores built into them, psn and xbox live.  they were both heading toward being obsolete.   the thing is that i think more people like going to the movies rather than buying games from 3rd party"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, people cry about why fidelity and others dont have some slick user friendly UI, its because they dont really make any money off some high school kid making a million $0 comission trades with a $500 balance in the account."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously if you have a conviction that AMC is going to return to it's pre-COVID glory, you do you.  I hope you're right and make tons of money.

I respectfully disagree that people have to be long term holders to bring value to the economy.  In my opinion, you could argue that long term holders are *worse* for the economy because they pay less taxes and make less money available to the economy by keeping their money tied up and not spending it.  

I also think you have to look at the totality of circumstances in raising capital through new equity issuance.  In my view, there is a big difference between issuing stock to raise funds to complete a strategic merger/takeover that will quantitatively benefit shareholders and issuing stock to raise money to pay debt that accumulated while no revenues were coming in.  

Sure, if AMC actually goes ahead with the issuance and uses the funds to pay off/down their debt and that ultimately keeps them out of bankruptcy, that's a long term win for a shareholder.  Their shares don't go to $0, but they're certainly going to be worth less than the are now by virtue of supply and demand.

All this to say that I think you and the poster you replied to are just looking at this from different perspectives and I don't think either of you are entirely wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes bud
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah I'm paid by hedge funds... That's why amc is issuing shares too. It's all a big conspiracy. Almost like there was a reason this company was heavily shorted ü§îü§îü§î good thing there's a ton of idiots that will buy their newly issued shares besides the hedge funds.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You clearly weren't around here in January when it was only GME and than bots flooded this place screaming AMC, Nokia, BB, RKT, UWMC!!

Doggy boins went flying that day. 

It was all a distraction from GME"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"its because they can see the writing on the wall. Major studios streaming all releases to homes the same day as theater debuts was  the final nail in the coffin. Movie theaters wont go away completely, but they probably wont ever be the same."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bcuz crayon eating Titans messing around with Apes do dumb things lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha this country is so ass backwards

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever gone to the movies in the last 10 years without knowing what movie you wanted to go see? Everyone decides they want to go see a movie, looks at the list finds one that they want to go see, and then goes. But even before the pandemic often people wouldn't find a movie they actually wanted to go see and then they wouldn't go. Right now it's a movie desert out there there's never a good movie to see, so no one goes. You can advertise all you want but if they don't have movies people won't go.

Also of note, is I've never really seen movie theaters advertise themselves. It just isn't something that's done."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have nowhere near that clout, this is a 5 to 10 billion dollar company, even if 10% of the Wall Street bets members invested that would be a million people, they would have to average 2-5,000 each. And all vote together"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol even taking the argument of the dude arguing with you, so Netflix or Amazon will pay  that much for some Oscar nominations? Yeah seems like smart business!

If anything, these threads have really opened my eyes to how conspiratorial and insular people can quickly become on the internet.  

These posts and memes are hilarious but then also you see some people that really treat dd posts on these subs as literal, written gospel. Its weird and reminiscent of religious fanaticism."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Netflix or Amazon have been rumored to looking for a brick and mortar theater chain to buy so their original productions can qualify for Oscar awards
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they actually do issue the 500 million worth of shares, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea. As an added bonus, AMC's share price getting pounded for issuing new shares and screwing over the people who propped the company up might give the GME holders more resolve to hold and it also might prevent future companies from taking similar dilutive tactics."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were in trouble long before Covid. Now studios are releasing movies to their streaming services within 5 days of premiere. It will be a smaller market so yes some will fail. AMC? Who knows but I wouldn‚Äôt want to hold diluted shares honestly, mainly because I just don‚Äôt believe in the company. If you do good for you, your the investor they are looking for. If your in it for a SS hang it up, all these share offerings fucked that idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish GME the best . I have a share . But otherwise I'm all in in AMC
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont really care what dumb shit people spend their money on, I care however that the sub is flooded with false info. I check amc threads because people being retarded amuses me at times, other times not"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It‚Äôs an American company that has existed for 100 years, most people have good memories of them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man you act like everyone holding AMC is holding till retirement. 

I bought it last year for under $4/share. Once I reach a one year mark and lower cap rate gains I‚Äôm selling. 

I‚Äôm hopeful Q2 or Q3 earnings are encouraging (which is why I‚Äôm annoyed they want to dilute further) but if it doesn‚Äôt happen I doubled my investment in a year. I‚Äôll take it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah I‚Äôve got a totally different thesis but then again I bought at under $4 last year. Annoyed about the dilution all the same though and agree there‚Äôs not enough discussion of it. 

I‚Äôm keeping it quiet though because it‚Äôs not in my best interest to push this until I exit. I‚Äôm sure others who understand the situation do the same."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah the context was a bit different. If you scroll up the first guy was saying they issued tons of shares lately and then the guy I responded to was saying that one was paying attention to it. 

My point was that no, people *are* paying attention and that dilution earlier in the year was obviously bad news for shareholders. So now they are pissed AMC wants a free reign to issue 500m more shares and are voting no."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To over simplify, GME fundamentals are still undervalued when compared to B&M competitors like bestbuy.  As they transition more to e-commerce and use tech industry multipliers, the upside is even higher.  Ref to chewy, RCs old company.  

Now tack on the free marketing campaign of the squeeze creating millions of loyal, young customers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At least use some common sense if you are going to take a stand. What you stated is factually incorrect. Doesn‚Äôt matter if there is a hive mind.

>some people are cheap af and or dont like paying for fun.

Neither apply to me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love movies but I love adult content and well thought out plots.  I don‚Äôt get excited about stamped out scripts with CGI and green screen super heroes.  That‚Äôs so played out it‚Äôs boring.

And market makers add liquidity and stability to the market, not short term investors. At most short term investors add volatility (which I guess is fine....). 

I really don't care if AMC adds shares - I never said anything about it. Just don't wine about short-term investors feelings when a company does what companies do"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I was thinking about AMC as objectively as possible, with my crayon analysis and smooth brain business acumen...there is no real innovation/transformation.

They dropped quite a bit before the pandemic."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but that's where the aforementioned vision/leadership comes in.

Granted, it's far from done and a lot of it is the hype from the short squeeze, but under the hood you can see a lot of things shifting.
AMC needs to attack deals with the major studies and try to get exclusive rights to stream/show the movies. Most studios still have to still stream through a platform as they don't have their own services. I'm sure there are many ways to approach it by people far more intelligent than me but that's a start."

GME on the other hand has more cash in reserve than debt, but their model has been to lower expenses by shuttering stores despite strongly decreasing revenues year by year with a big 21% drop over the past year. 

However the reality is AMC has tried to reinvent itself with better rewards and streaming programs more so than GME which just has way more capital right now and because of the natural pandemic related short term advantages."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy indie movies and sell cheaper tickets? That's your advertising idea?

We are in the indie movie renasance on every streaming service. You want to buy indie movies people already have had the chance to watch and then play them in theaters? Or compete with streaming services to buy new ones? Why buy a new indie movie if they will let you put it in the theater and keep a good portion of ticket sales?

Remember, theaters by and large don't have indie movies because they don't make money with them. They never have. They make money when millions of advertising dollars are spent on a movie to get people in the seats.

You have to remember, theaters are used to about 100 million a week being spent on advertising for movies to draw people into the theaters. 4.9 Billion in 2019 in the US alone.

I don't think AMC needs a few indie movies and some ad dollars."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have years of historical data on theaters. Their growth is easy to map out over the last 100 years

There is no transformation happening. They are trying to get to normal. Their normal shareprice was like 20/share before they quadrupled their float.

This is a bad investment. Full stop.

We can talk about how fundamentals dont matter but they are actively killing squeeze potential so hard that we now need to look at fundamentals.

AMC management fucked their shareholders that saved them. They didn't look big picture like GME and took the quick and easy money.

And with the dilution if the price does go to 20 we are saying AMC is coming out of the pandemic 5 times more valuable...wtf?

AMC was a recovery play. You guys are pricing it in like a transformation play."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term 5-10 seems realistic, but the price will sure go up after the pandemic for a brief period due neither transformation, fundamentals or a squeeze, but due to hype. I'm pretty confident in that, so yeah, as an ""investment"" in the sense of long term investment it's a bad idea. But it'll go up when pandemic ends, i'm quite sure about that. There will not be a lot of growth be happening, but I also think that their numbers won't drop like they did historically. Like with a car, when you get yourself that fancy new lambo, it loses a third or more of it's value over a few years, but when you buy an old polo who drives but that's it, you get it for 500 bucks and can sell it again for 500 bucks if it still drives. By now (w/o 'rona) , people only go to the movies because they want to got to the movies for the feeling and because that' s the only way to watch most productions w/o having to wait for half a year until it's released on DVD. And that won't change any time soon i think"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like archego (this part was a joke, but not really). Were as now that I look more closely at the option chains for AMC, they are not as high volume as I expected, especially when compared to GME or TSLA. I am sure there are plenty of naked shares though, even after January, with there being a big spikes in Call options at $21 and $29 per share. The problem at this point is getting that high."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">Why would AMC even offer shares if not to raise capital?

They wouldn't..... In 2019 they had ~100M shares..and the peak share price in 2016 was $35. If they sell another 500M that will bring their total to close to ~1B shares. 10x what it was at its prior peak. If a shareholders goal is to try and save the business ok. If their goal is to make a return then it sucks for the shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No. I think they're trying to raise capital to pay interest payments.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you go by yourself? Solo movie yours is a very small market. 

Are you saying that you are in the area and thought you might want to see a movie so you saw what was playing and then you decided to go to the theater? Are you saying you literally went into the theater without knowing what movie you wanted to see yet?

I guess I don't want to say that no one goes into a theater without knowing what they want to see, rarely do groups of people do that. I suppose it was fairly common for people on dates to go into the theater and then try to decide which movie they wanted to see. But that's sort of behavior is going to be very infrequent after people show up and don't have a good movie to see.

I also think that in general at least one member of the party is trying to go see a specific movie."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's literally been talked about for several years at this point. With both Amazon and Netflix being potential purchasers, Amazon almost bought Landmark theatres in 2018 but they got sold to the Cohen group instead. I never said it was happening as a certainty just that the interest in one of them buying a theatre chain historically has been there for years now. Perhaps you just haven't paid attention."

2021-04-01 21:22:20,wallstreetbets,"(DD) ASO options ladder is enticing, high short interest + good earnings This data is based off of ShortSight, paid real time short data from S3 partners.

As we can see, in the last few weeks, short interest in ASO spiked to \~44%.

https://preview.redd.it/t98kwbfwflq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c15011205d06acd072aa2d039288dad69dd71d4

ASO killing earnings on 3/30:

* All time high net income, 157% increase y/y
* 311% increases y/y on adjusted net income
* .97 EPS, for a 304% increase y/y

I see this as a reopening play + potential for a gamma squeeze.

**Gamma squeeze + pressure on shorts to close**

As we've seen w/ stocks like GME, options provide more leverage than holding shares for moving a stock's price. If there are a chain of strike prices w/ high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain (in this case, $25 was the first link, while at the time of writing it is now $28.34), it can cause a reaction where MM need to delta hedge these options by buying shares (as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums), which increase the stock's price, which lets us hit the next link in the chain, etc. etc.

Forbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to GME: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/).

As we can see, open interest is also high on options (ex: 19000 calls on 4/16 for $30).

https://preview.redd.it/2ph9enq8hlq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7105dc532cce8fc36164931e890c51656b9c65

If the stock can near/hit $30, it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by MMs. This will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43%, all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price (\~$23), shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards.

**Reopening play**

Dicks Sporting Goods no longer sells guns in Texas. As people go out more / reignite their hobbies, ASO will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns. Even as a long term hold (instead of playing the options chain) this seems like a good play.

**The play**

I think there's potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 4/16. The open interest is there, the catalyst is there (run up in stock price due to amazing earnings), and there's the additional high short interest which means if things moon, they'll moon even harder. The options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well.

**The bear case**

The earnings report isn't enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 4/16. Another catalyst doesn't come, or the market in general corrects (as we are at ATH). In this case, the call option ladder will fail to materialize.

**Positions:**

200 4/16C w/ $30 strike price."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone have a realistic PT for this if it were to trigger a lil squeeze, or an idea for its true valuation? I mean, Dick's is trading for around $79, and they don't sell guns in Texas ... Also, given the fact that it's heavily shorted and there's a ton of institutional ownership, I'm wondering if it's not too late, and if I should scoop up some 35c 4/16 on Monday. I'll probably  buy shares as well just in case. 

Currently sitting on some 30c 4/16s that I scooped up during the dip today, and I'm confident they'll print. Just don't want to get burned by the theta decay like with RKT."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A gamma ladder squeeze.... new terms every day
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There‚Äôs so many issues with this ‚ÄúDD‚Äù. Your entire thesis is based off high open interest can cause a gamma squeeze. Open interest is just a number that totals all open contracts for a stock. It doesn‚Äôt mean all those call contracts open are on the buy side. They could be on the sell side too. MM‚Äôs process both buy and sell orders for market participants.

Also, MM‚Äôs make money off the bid-ask spread. Not premiums.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You get to borrow on margin against the equity you have in your account in cash or investment up to a certain percentage.  For example if you have 1000 bucks in investments you get to borrow another 800 bucks to buy more stocks. If the price of those stocks go down and value of your investment is too small to borrow 800 you have to either deposit money or sell your stocks and pay back some of the money you borrowed until you‚Äôre back to the same ratio.  So they can force you to sell at a loss when the broker wants their money back.  They get the money they loaned no matter what and you can lose the money you started with when maybe you wanted to wait for the stock to come back up.  You can‚Äôt üíé‚úãa volatile stock on margin.

2021-04-01 21:02:09,wallstreetbets,"Why uwmc is a great buy at this price Uwmc share price has been falling ever since the Russell inclusion confusion. It sitting near its 52 week low rn at 7.83. There‚Äôs no way this stock should be this low with he good it‚Äôs financials are and how good the housing market is going rn and will continue for at least another year. They just did a 700 million note offering that was supposed to available til April 7th but had already been bought up by the largest banks with J.P. Morgan buying the biggest percentage. This is very good for uwmc. Now another reason why the stock is trading low is because of shorts and no it will not have a short squeeze. Most of the daily volume from the last 2 weeks had been shorts. My theory is they are keeping the share price lower to get a bigger dividend bc it free money. The dividend pay date is April 6th. And most analysts have a price target above 10 but we all know analysts sacks of shit but on this one they are right for once. Overall I think uwmc is a very safe investment right now bc it‚Äôs bottomed out and volume has been low for the past couple weeks and once volume picks up the price will start to increase.

My advice is to play poker online with like $100 for a couple months. It's great practice for position sizing. I always lose in the long run but i can make $20 last 2months because I only ever risk $1-2 on a poker game. TIME is actually an important but overlooked element to any betting strategy. If I have 20 bets i won't use them all on the same day, I make sure to wait 1 day if I lose $1-2. The strategy means when you win every day you are also adding profits to your cash pile. It's always better to make $1 a day for 5 days in a row, rather than risk the full $20 on a single day. Hope this makes sense, good luck.

Personally with the housing market the way it is right now where I am I might sell my house ans take all the profit and invest it and take 100% interest only loan. Keep paying the principal but instead of to the bank to my financial advisor and let that money work for me. Even at 7% over 10 years without adding anything else to it you should double your money. It has its risks and that type of loan would only be available to someone like you with enough capital in your portfolio"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earlier 20‚Äôs making 145kish.

I would ask what you do but I honestly think if I do the IRS would be on your ass like grass. Lmao

145k a year. Where you at Cali? They taxing you to death. Nah, congrats and fuck you.

But anyway. Im a scientist man. The issue with america and rental property is that those ‚Äúbumfuck‚Äù nowhere places soon become important after people in Cali government fuck shit up and people bitch.

Then instead of fixing it, they move to ‚Äúbumfuck‚Äù nowhere and suddenly your property is worth a hell of a lot more than it is now.

Texas, Florida. Look at them.

Good gov, good legislation. Boom. Property boom.

Till people fuck with it, and fuck it all up till they have nowhere to run and we end up killing each other out of pure rage and hate for dumbassery. Till then they will run, run, run like locusts. Hopefully not screwing the good things up. But if you know people, often times they fuck with shit they shouldn‚Äôt.

And nature bites them in the ass.

And it‚Äôs not even that republicans are better people either they are shit too. It‚Äôs just the fact they are better with money than dreamy spend spend spend spend democrats.

They know the money game. They plan accordingly. They fuck us. But not as hard as pulling the rug out from under us. Instead a few jabs with a knife you see coming and it‚Äôs over like that till the next time.

Honestly I don‚Äôt like politics, I stand in the middle. 

But even I can see that red states are better than the assfucked states that are blue.

They defunded police in even some cities that are blue.

DEFUNDED THE POLICE. How fucking idiotic can one be?

Oh a world without government! A world without taxes....yeah, sure. When people stop looting and shooting let me know player. Fucking hell..... what the fuck they think would happen. Mary would find her little lamb without a glock shoved up her ass?

Anyway, I‚Äôm on a tangent, point is you should look for property with the best value and potential. In states with good legislation and ideals that know what the fuck they are doing.

Me? First chance I get. Apartment complex. 1 mil.

Maybe a few side gigs.

But uh, dont fuck yourself in the ass. Do your research.

Same age as you. Not making 145. But then again IRS isn‚Äôt on my ass and I‚Äôm saving peoples lives so fuck everyone in my way. Lmao

Would also advise making 400k or less a year.

Higher tax. You want to avoid that.

And no LLC until you have more than a few houses.

The fees aren‚Äôt worth the squeeze unless your didn‚Äôt vet your renters unless they are out to fuck you with false claims.

Apartment complex? 8-20k month LLC. No shit. It‚Äôs worth the squeeze if filled.

Would also advise you consult with a lawyer and make up rules and regulations for the property and it‚Äôs fees and damages.

There‚Äôs a lot out there to help with that from real experts if you know where to look.

You want to have the legal documents and shit worked out for every scenario especially if they don‚Äôt pay.

Before you even find such people. Make a plan, plan it, find experts to help and do it.

Hell, I‚Äôd even help out but I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôd want all the income for yourself. Lol

Anyway, that‚Äôs my two cents."

The one thing your plan doesn't account for is risk.  The reason that mortgage money is available to you in the first place is because banks value loaning that money to you over just using their even better financial advisors to use it in the stock market."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't give you any advice in my comment.  I was just critiquing the idea that you presented of currency only possessing whatever power over you that you give it.  I was saying there's many circumstances where that statement wouldn't hold up, which means when you evaluate the validity of that claim (money only possessing the power you give it) it simply isn't true in many circumstances.  The power money has over your behavior is directly related to the severity/priority of what it's presence/absence will yield.  The statement is too simple to explain the relationship that people have between themselves and currency.  Currency allows people to acquire healthcare services, food and shelter, that's the baseline, when those critical aspects are threatened for themselves (and whatever they consider their family/tribe) then money has a good deal of power of the individual regardless of their choice.  This doesn't mean that they have to be unhappy, it is just that money does hold a lot of power as they have to dedicate themselves to its acquisition in some way regardless if they want to or not.

An obvious example, if you have a child who requires an expensive surgery of some form for their survival, in instances like this money has TREMENDOUS power over you without you deciding it does or not.  In scenarios like this, it would be like telling a starving person ""food only has the power over you that you give it"".  Yes it only has power over you that you give it, but often you don't have a choice how much power you give it because the result of said money and successful acquisition/loss of it could rob you of things you find to be the most important in life.  I'm just saying there's a lot of cases where you actually don't have a choice how much power it has when it no longer becomes optional.  The power money has over us is directly correlated to how much it is needed for things we consider a necessity.

I get what you're saying, the try to enjoy life regardless, money comes and goes aspect.  I'm just saying that the relationship between people and currency is much more complex than that and currency itself is a system of power which controls critical parts of our lives that are directly correlated to our survival.

&#x200B;

I don't what you mean by ""I'm guessing you've still only ever been on the one side of this feeling"".  I've struggled for long periods, done very well in others.  That isn't really relevant to what I had said either way though cause you can critique the validity of a statement by seeing if the statement remains true under differing conditions.  Doesn't have anything to do with how financially well you are/aren't doing cause I'm not really advocating for anything in my own self interest, just evaluating an abstract idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah your good, specifically?

Small cities near the big cities in Ohio, Montana, etc etc

You look at the land out there, those houses.

People moving out of cities. It‚Äôs a lucrative idea.

Especially with inflation hitting us in the next couple of years as I have researched that the gov will fuck us all to save themselves.

It‚Äôs only a matter of time, trillions of debt who can pay without inflation? Not Americans, not even musk. So property is a fail safe to that.

But yeah, to top this off. The country may have no ideal 145k or my kinda work. But.... it does have the peace and quiet so many people crave. And if the exodus continues. They will move out there close to the cities but far enough to feel safe.

Plus I‚Äôm seeing this in my own town and nearby towns. As properties rise and rise. Soon they‚Äôll fall maybe in June. Due to the mandate being up.

But they are rising to demand.

Build, build, build for the calis with big money moving here. Destroy the beautiful farm land crate a shitty city meant to crumble over time to crime and sin.

Not great to see but I learn to deal.

Just waiting for the inevitable housing crash.

I would too if I were you.
But before Biden raises capitol gains."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It‚Äôs a very real thing.  Look it up!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I dunno man. Focusing on not having 1000 bucks is probably preventing you on making stuff happen that‚Äôs worth 10000. Bs numbers I know but so is thinking money solves problems. Get your 1000 bucks and keep on the hamster wheel lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Money is quite literally a concept made up by man. I'm not looking for a philosophical debate, sorry."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I'm surviving on my disability check. Not exactly thriving. Just getting tired of sleeping on couches and not being able to tend to everyday life. I've tried trading, unsuccessfully, for the past 6 months. I'm getting a mentor and gonna figure out how to make some returns. I'm hopeful, just frustrated."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Laws were a concept made up by man as well but they also exert power we have little to no say in.  I'm just stating that the existence of and societal acceptance of currency as the primary means to acquire resources exerts varying degrees of involuntary power on everyone to some degree or another.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO. This is the funniest bullshit I've read all day.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And I'm saying it only exerts the power you have over it. At one point I was going to shoot up north and live in a forest for a year. I get your point. I am quite sure many people are stuck with that mentality. I am not. You can try to convince me to think like you again, but I much prefer it over here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I needed to read this. Got 8 gme shares cause it's all I got hope for. Rocket emotis and diamond hands.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like you didn't really get what I said because you're still asserting that I'm trying to convince YOU of having a different mentality.  I'm not saying that the sentiment can't be true for you and the conditions which you currently exist, I'm saying that said conditions vary by circumstance, that the power money holds over us fluctuates based on various conditions, which I think is a pretty reasonable assertion.  To say that a single line catch phrase without specific conditions outlined has summed up the relationship between survival, currency and the individual in all conditions is something that no person has ever been able to do except maybe for a small handful of physicists because the matters they deal in are so general.

I think you're misinterpreting me as some free market capitalist that is saying ""you must submit to the power of money"" but that's not remotely what I'm saying.  I'm a Marxist in many regards theoretically.  I dislike the current state of global capitalism and its extreme irrationality and advocate for movement towards more rational forms of production.  The idea that all power exerted by currency is voluntary is a fairytale for anyone trying to live in an ethical manner though, to deny that it has any power or impact over your behavior is false (we're literally on a gambling subreddit, if money had zero power over us, we wouldn't be here in the first place).  Someone who is having to take care of their children, sick, elderly, etc can't just ""shoot up north and live in a forest for a year"".  Again, I'm not trying to convince YOU to think differently, I'm not telling YOU not to do those things, I'm not saying anything about you and your behavior or your mindset not being true for the circumstances in which you exist.  I'm saying that your statement, when evaluated in a general non-specific sense, under certain conditions, such as where an individual has people who heavily depend on them for survival, is false because the need for resources is very real even if the goal is to reduce the need for currency (which typically requires resources to ensure initial acquisition of resources needed for an autonomous life).  In certain circumstances like that abandoning the pursuit of resources and the involuntary power it holds for their own selfish reasons means unethically abandoning others who are dependent on you which many are not willing to do because they don't view those things as optional which is often rooted in deep biological/psychological truths of our operation.  The statement is heavily dependent on certain other conditions remaining true for its validity to hold up, to say that your sentiment holds up unequivocally for all people regardless of these conditional variants is just kind of absurd.  That isn't really an opinion even, it's literally just an abstraction of the interactions between the responsibilities one has to one's self, tribe/group of loved ones and currency."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you mods. I thought the competition seemed suspiciously out of character.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So..... I just smoked a jammer outside and I dont know if this is just me but.........  Im kinda feeling this this guy is a right fucking bellend.  Correct me if wrong.   It kinda killed my high man.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I knew a paper trading competitions was too intelligent to be on this sub.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I thought the second paper trading competition was a joke and decided to join the 3rd one for some reason and I deserve it. Paper Trading is for the kids. Ain't no paper hand

Adapt and survive, don‚Äôt be the curmudgeon that just complains because ‚Äúthis seems like a bait and switch‚Äù or ‚Äúthe mods on some power trip‚Äù because that isn‚Äôt true. If you don‚Äôt want to take 5 minutes and read the DD in the comments to truly learn the lesson here, you fucking deserve to be banned."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, I fell for it. Cuz comments sent me to Mikey Millions Kamikaze Cash on YouTube, where he explains options and the Greeks, and plays.  He has a dozen videos on a $3k competition.  Thought this was legit. Whatever, The vids are good and I recommend them before trying options."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's pretty great how salty ppl are, and how many believe that guy is a mod."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How could you not know about the competition, if you been active for so long."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you knew options and finance well enough to create an algorithm you wouldn't be in GME. Theta always wins
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,there's some delicious salt in here.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You misspelled 'sexy as the days I first laid eyes on him'.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If there's one thing that should be immediately obvious to any new comers is that the people here take bets very seriously. What's even the point in paper trading?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Under a million we weren't struggling for content.  GME brought the vast majority here, but if they're only here for that, the point of this sub isn't really for them.

If you want to keep wsb the way it was, the new users need to transition to the old culture.  Which many have.  If people just want to talk about GME all day they can make their own sub.  You don't see people joining /r/carsfuckingdragons and telling them they need to change their content."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good so do the paper trading thing and fucking ban the people who arent yoloing on fds its not that fucking hard. Sounds like r/investing is a better place for u
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Read the comment and submission guide. Paper trading isn't allowed here.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Came here because I heard of GME. GME too much for my poor ass with no savings so I bought AMC then I got into NOK then weed stocks. They all went to shit. Then I saw everyone win at yolo FDs and they got 2800%+ returns and I got into option trading. They all went to shit. I'm still here 2 months later at almost breakeven. Also I got a 90% portfolio for GME now and everything else goes into option trading.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is unfair given the boom?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I‚Äôve been selling AMC options but currently too poor to get into the GME game. Next time...

Still, I feel like we've reached new heights, and those standards should be more like $20k and $100k, respectively."

GME is not the best play out there, it's already been played.  The IV is not worth the risk reward at this point.  You could've made a fortune on costco calls just this past few weeks.

The culture here is not really to help out newbies, other subreddits are better for that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since alot of retards here don‚Äôt understand the GME hype and haven‚Äôt read any DD about it, they just shit on it and have became some sort of elitist bitches. Really fucking cringe because i‚Äôve been on this sub for like 3 years and there was another vibe in here. Really sad stuff considering that it was my favorite subreddit. GME is a game changing opportunity, where rules will be changed in our favor. Shitting on it is shitting on the retail investor. Self harming ignorant elitists. It‚Äôs cool to make jokes, but now it‚Äôs time to get serious, hedgefunds are finally attacked and it was about time."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was giggling like a schoolgirl reading the thread.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can't comment or post on the sub.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh a 188er, not bad.... for an absolute retard.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought there was only r/dragonsfuckingcars !
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There is only one type of content that‚Äôs the problem. You know there are other stocks where you can make more money than GME?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own GME, so do plenty of people here. I do not want to see a million posts about GME everyday. This sub used to be a wild place where people yolo‚Äôd their life savings into totally retarded shit and the memes that came from that were gold. There was also solid DD on everything, better than you can find in most places. Now it‚Äôs just a bunch of normies saying cringey shit and posting the same regurgitated rocket memes with ape this ape that. It was funny for a month but now it‚Äôs getting old.

If y‚Äôall want to talk GME day in day out make your own sub. It has ruined the goldmine of what this sub once was."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> GME is our stock

If you weren't invested in GME or part of WSB prior to January then it isn't your stock or your sub. You're a colonist with millions of others here now, not a native. And I really don't mean to sound pretentious, but I was one of those people in since last fall, part of this sub since the March crash last year, made a killing off GME in the squeeze and moved onto other plays, which is what WSB is about - finding great plays in a market full of stocks and making very risky and leveraged trades on them, usually via options. It is not about bagholding shares in a single company and posting about it daily, chasing an exceedingly rare event which already happened.

If you want to hold GME, do so in silence. There is no reason for a million posts about one single ticker on the homepage. None. No justification outside of another squeeze. All it does is crowd out better content. There could legit be another GME play in another ticker and none of the dumb apes would know about it because to them the stock market is one stock.

I welcome newbies, but the reality is more people need to lurk. I made $140k off GME and didn't feel the need to post a thread about it. Now someone simply *buys shares*, posts a screenshot and gets thousands of upvotes.

This is how subs are killed and all the OGs which made it great flee elsewhere."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not.

It is a great play sure. But I'd rather swing trade it daily due to high volatility than chant like Retards."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao you are stupid ape ‚Äî> this is the position you take when you jerk the other apes off ü¶ß
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That chart doesnt show exact months though. But you can see at the very end of 2020 we were still under a million subs. About 8 million people showed up here strictly from gme media coverage for sure
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Massive difference in one major thing.

Options have expiration dates and cab go to zero a million times faster than shares. 

Ask yourself what was the last company to be fully deposited and go bankrupt? And how fast did it happen? Shareholders have countless opportunities to make out with even a shred of thier initial investment. 

When it comes to options, if you aint itm and it's the day of your expiration you'll be lucky to get a buck for em at best. 

When you write them you can then be responsible for the shares they allow to purchase at the price, which when assigned can make your shit go negative in an instant.  

None of this happens in the share game, options are purely gambling. 

Think of it as a casino. When you bet s hand of black jack to you get opportunities to buy your way out of the hand and still keep some money? No, you knew the risk when you got there, the casino lives on, take your lesson and share bullshit and head on out. It's time to get back to weekly otm yolos"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you didn‚Äôt read any DD just say that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you might be reading it wrong, the sub crossed a million in early 2020. By the end of 2020 it was almost 2 million."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Half these retards in here don't do research and weight their options they see a DD that looks sophisticated and buy the ticker lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually this past year I‚Äôve been betting certain stocks would not go bankrupt and beat covid, aero, cruises and theaters. It was a ‚Äúsafer‚Äù bet than options especially since I‚Äôve tried to cover the board vs trying to learn options but a huge chunk had/has the possibility of bankrupting. Gme was a bet also along those lines but I felt more confident with 3 game systems no one could get their hands on. Bets nonetheless because all were risky with no end in sight last summer."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, diamond hands became a thing when we were buying SPY puts at the bottom of the market last March and holding them into April while fighting JPow and his money printer. I lost so much being a gay bear too late into the correction, but some people made an absolute killing off SPY puts for a week or so. The diamond hand meme was about holding your position as the market moved against you, leading to a major loss. But now it's paraded around as a good thing which is sort of hilarious because the result will likely be the same."

Don‚Äôt know why GME peeps come in and shit on Blackberry or any other stock that isn‚Äôt GME. I bought 10 shares at $22 or so and sold at $115 and was happy, but I‚Äôm not touching that stock or company again, even with the awesome executives coming in. Blackberry had a lot going for it and it‚Äôs just going to keep getting better. Did I buy $12k of 2/19 and 3/19 calls when the share price was $20 that expired worthless? Sure, the brokerages fucked a ton of people. I still have 1000 shares and have bought a bunch of $30 Jan 22 calls. The prices hardly has to go up much for me to be at even and in the green. Most I bought a few Fridays ago when it dipped to the current price. That‚Äôs pretty optimistic and want to grab some $20 calls for then as well. Blackberry is a solid company and will keep adding revenue streams. Not sure if they will sell a big chunk of their patents or keep and license but either way all of the other things they have and involvement in EV.......it‚Äôs definitely going to move up in share price throughout the year and beyond. Fuck the haters, BlackBerry‚Äôs marketing should help bring people in as too many people still think of cell phones lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was kicking myself for not selling at the top, too. But how do you ever know? In the past, I've sold other stocks at the ""top"" and then watched them double the next day haha. The stock market is just one big sh!t show."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I converted all the money in my RRSP to USD. I live in California now, so it made sense to just exchange it. The annoying part is that since I'm a non-resident of Canada, I have to call in all of my trades."

People simply don't have that kind of time on their hands. Imagine it took you a half hour to fill up at a gas station because the hose to your gas tank only allowed in gas very, very slowly. Would you buy such a vehicle?

Now, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'd also note that there are some very enterprising thieves who will be cutting those batteries out of that bay and selling them as junk for drug money. Once you get outside a coercive country like China, which actually prosecutes thieves hard, this business model doesn't work.

Lastly, assume for a moment that your country gets into a military conflict with China. Do you want your car held hostage?"

Every HF would be the cokebottle glasses mafioso who's always trying to fix the fights so he can make a fortune for himself.  And of course, Jim Cramer would be the dog who eats the squeaky toy.  If for some reason you have yet to see this flick, get on that.  There will be a quiz."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think gme is going to go flat for ANOTHER DAY. I have been looking at order flow today and volume is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Like zero volume that‚Äôs ZERO with a Z. We‚Äôre used to some HF bs but this is a new low for them. Here is what I think is going on and why Ken Griffen is behind it all.

About 2600 years ago a prominent figure emerged in the world and introduced a radical book that would revolutionize the financial world, that‚Äôs right the book of exodus. In it they outlined how charging interest should be outright banned. ZERO INTEREST ON EVERYTHING. Housing loans, business loans horse loans ZERO INTEREST. This pissed off the banks as they could no longer charge interest so money was extremely hard to borrow back then. That means only people that were going to 100% pay their loans back would receive loans. The stock market was a snooze fest with relatively low volitility. Banks made no money from loans and had to rely on their steep over draft fee of 14 shekels. As time progressed banks started charging and increasing interest rates. With interest rates banks started betting against businesses hoping they would not be able to pay off their loans and their business would go under. They would borrow inventory from these businesses hoping the business would go under and they would not have to return the inventory when the business closed. Sound familiar? They got greedy until it all came to a head 600 years later when someone was born that was going to reintroduce the preaching of zero interest rates. This man started gaining a following increasing the popularity of charging zero interest. The heads of finance got worried because they were making tons of money from selling off the inventory of these closing businesses that they borrowed. As the man preaching for zero interest rates grew he gained a close following. The banks saw an opportunity and approached one of his disciples about betraying this financial revolutionist to kill the idea of zero interest loans. 2021 years ago today on a Friday their plan was set into action and with their guy on the inside they put this financial guru on a cross. LIKE FUCKING LITERALLY THE GUYS NAME WAS JESUS CHRIST. LIKE FUCK SLAP HIM WITH A 150,000 shmekel fine and ban him from finance for 5 years or something but anyway I digress different times back then. Now your thinking what does this have to do with gme today? Well I‚Äôll tell you. The man that betrayed Jesus‚Äôs name? JUDAS FUCKING GRIFFEN. Yeah that bloodline Griffen. This dumbasses plan backfired as Jesus‚Äôs following held a holiday for Jesus called Good Friday where the banks would be boring as fuck for a day. Ken Griffen and Judas Griffen both are dumb fucks who got greedy and fucked themselves.

TLDR: Ken Griffens distant relative Judas Griffen got Jesus killed and that‚Äôs why today is boring as fuck on the stock market."

And i did look at his past posts. Why the fuck are you all upvoting him? Has he ever told his floor? He seems like a retard who puts many K's into it and sells as soon as it gets to  mildly high level (10k). Im dissapointed in wsb. You support someone who will make it slightly harder to get to 1mil, shame. And if he isnt selling at 10k and not making it slightly harder for us, he sure as hell aint telling us and thats worrying me.

Like seriously do you all blindly upvote everyone who puts sone money in it now? What if he sells at 1000, then its all pointless.. 

Ive been in wsb since 2017 and i know we are fucking stupid as fuck but god damn there is a limit. And ofc there are many new retards, i guess what im saying is wsb is not wsb anymore and man do people upvote dumb shit.

And ofc i never want to hate on fellow ape but show me proof."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) **Loses money, always**: this company was $1 because it nearly went bankrupt.  it keeps losing money

2) Every one else loses money at this: they bought another company in CA for $1.  Not $1/share, ONE ACTUAL DOLLAR.  in their annual report THAT company lost $20 mil and defaulted on its loans.  BLNK picked them up by paying a dollar and assuming the loans.

**3) their chargers suck fat donkey cocks:** very few of their chargers are level 3 (super chargers).  the whole portfolio are slow ass level 2 chargers.  Takes high end skill and $$ to do level 3s.   level 2's are cheap an easy but charge a sedan at only 25-40 miles per hour.  Whose bothering to stay parked that long?  

If some one needs charging away from their home, they need level 3 or GTFO.  level 3 can charge 150+ miles per hour.  

**3) Competition: Any one can do this.** Its easy to lose money doing this, and no lack of idiots trying.

4) **EV's don't need public chargers:** When they were founded years ago, the 'affordable' evs ($30-40K) were the leaf and bolt.  80-140 mil ranges.  There were some sales of gasoline powered 'plugin hybrids' (prius prime 25 ev mil range, chevy volt 50 mi ev range).  None of these cars are for sale anymore.  New Ev's are all 200+ mil ranges.  Ev's don't need public chargers anymore

5) **They have very few Level 3 chargers:** yeah yeah, f()CK-all I'm repeating myself.  The ONLY charger an EV driver needs or wants are the fast ones (1 hour or less).  Level 2 chargers are like that busted crazy drunk girl.  You'll smash her if she's right there and an there is an easy post nut exit strategy, but the moment she mentions calling the next day its total ghost mode.

The market just had its drunked frat party night with this loose as a goose drunk 2.  Don't be the simp who's catching feelings.  She's still got the dried bakkaki crust all over her from that last offering.  Just go to the clinic and get tested already and hope you don't wind up in paternity court in 9 months."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't find any sources online but I am speculating Tesla and BYD, the BEV market leaders in the US and China market respectively.

BYD has a [partnership](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/06/WS5b909369a31033b4f4654921.html) with Baidu to mass manufacture self driving cars. These cars use Baidu's Apollo platform which is built on top of Blackberry QNX. So I wouldn't rule out the possibility of BYD switching to QNX as the connected cars and self-driving cars platforms becomes consolidated."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you are vastly overstating how critical BB is to anyone's EV or IoT operations ü§îü§î
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,bro you're going to be so rich in 2022 maybe earlier
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so f-$4$ thrill
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is very funny. If BB have been doing security and IOT since I‚Äôve been in diapers, why have they shrunk steadily over the last 10 years? That proves my point. They‚Äôre a tech company that can‚Äôt compete with other tech companies. And while almost every other company is growing rapidly, and more opportunities exist in their sector than ever before, BB finds a way to shrink. 

Their [annual revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/revenue) is 1/20 what it was 10 years ago and less than 1/3 what it was 5 years ago. 

Your ‚Äúresearch‚Äù is hype. Let me guess what other stocks you own: FSR, RIDE, SOS, ..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">p level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling poi

Yes, well put!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is my research hype when its literally what it is lol.

You're talking about ""more opportunities exist in their sector"" when literally BlackBerry is partnered with 23/25 top EV makers including Baidu, and with AWS developed a first seen marketplace for ev software development."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because of the way it is presented. As you say, BB has no contracts with Tesla. Tesla has 79% of the market share for EVs in the US now and 21% in China (that‚Äôs about doubled in 2020). So claiming they have 23/25 ‚Äútop EV auto‚Äù companies is kind of misleading. It‚Äôs likely many of the smaller EV players will fizzle out anyways. Many reports on companies like RIDE, FSR, and NKLA for example are that these companies are smoke and mirrors already. 

It‚Äôs good that BB/QNX software will be in vehicles iff (not a typo) these companies are able to compete for market share with Tesla. 

I don‚Äôt see it happening. But again, I‚Äôm rooting for you guys."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think getting bought by Apple (getting paid lots of money in the process) is *losing*? One of those companies listed is NeXT, which was founded by Steve Jobs with the main purpose be to get bought out by Apple.

You realise the main reason a large company such as Apple buys another company is because they are afraid of losing to their market share to them right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With BEV (battery EV) accounting for only 1.8% of all vehicles sold in the US in 2020, I think it's still too early to conclude that Tesla will dominate the entire EV market. 

The competition in EV market is getting very heated with Lucid Air, Mustang Mach E, Volkswagen ID4, Nissan Ariya, Rivian etc. coming to market equipped with the $7500 tax credit. Tesla will still have its place in the market for sure, but it's unlikely it will be the monopoly. The EV market will likely follow the oligopolistic market structure of ICE vehicles today with many players at different segments of the market."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"moving average convergence divergence, it's an oscillator constructed based on the distance between two different moving averages, the crossovers can be used as a signal to go long or short but because of the lagging nature of basically every indicator using them for signals is usually a losing tactic. Macd is better used to see underlying weaknesses in the current trend through the use of divergence or to assess trend strength and momentum, the thing is though all these things can be accomplished by just analysing the price itself and you can gain a better entry this way because price can't lag itself."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, how high you think this is going in the next 3 years?  If I thought the price was going to drop in the coming months before slowly rising, why wouldn‚Äôt I wait?  For example I‚Äôm bullish for gme long term, but ain‚Äôt going anywhere near the stock right now.  It‚Äôs clearly massively over inflated. It‚Äôs just not a good deal right now.  But if it dropped to 60, I‚Äôd probably start thinking about going long.  I mean even if the stock goes to 1 K in the next 3 years, I‚Äôd  have over twice the shares if I bought at 60. 

I‚Äôm mean what kind of person takes the stance. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt care what the price is, it‚Äôs going to go up, so any price is a good deal‚Äù. That‚Äôs ridiculous"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1k - 1500.  I doubt we see sub 100 again.  Good luck to wait it out
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that‚Äôs delusional.  Good luck to you too though
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look back at the history of ""Banana Tree Coin"" as I've seen it called on here before. I'd consider the early rises and falls of that to be very similar in terms of volatility as GME. Very similar battles fought over price stabilization between the FUD/FOMO, general hypes and doubts, people taking profits, etc.   


That time period was FILLED with incredibly violent price swings, because of all of those things. Despite the large number of people 'holding' through it all.   


Did it pay off for them in the long run? Clearly, as I believe GME will too, but to suggest that we'll never see sub $100 again when we've gone from $480 to $40, are sitting below $200 and price action has only been happening for 3 months seems silly to me. An assumption based on emotion imo.   


This isn't financial advice. I'm not suggesting you buy or sell. You do you, partner. What I can say, from personal experience, is that had I traded with the mindset I had now based on things I charted on banana tree coin in the beginning instead of living in a drunken state in my late teens/early 20's, I'd be sitting a lot prettier right now. Fuck, some of my friends took my advice drunkenly and have their houses paid off. Prolly fucking my ex-wife too.   


Best of luck to you out there, my guy. We all want the same thing, but need to try and think reasonably along the way to maximize the benefits."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same bro I turned $15k into $80 and then YOLOed $40k into BNGO and sold at the absolute bottom. Did I mention I bought at the top. ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è I‚Äôm down to $48k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only the 500 contracts times the price of the premium paid, $19.04. 19.04 x 500 = $9520. The reason it showed a million is that the *value* of those 500 contracts was $952 000, and that is because, by definition, option contracts trade for 100units of the underlying (1 option on VW, let's say, equals 100 shares of VW when exercised). 

Thus, 9520 x 100 = $952 000, and since the premium of the contracts he paid is now $1.20 (19.04-17.84), that means the total *value* is 1.20 x 500 x 100 = $60 000. There come his ""loss"" of 900 000. It's not a real monetary loss, since the contracts are only gonna expire worthless, meaning he only lost his initial $9520. (Unless he sells before the 16th at 1.20 x 500 = $600. He could recover $600 out of his initial 9k, but I unfortunately doubt he'd be able to sell those calls to anyone)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,india is a mess
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," Vaccines are not improving conditions, cause it's way too early, not to mention a couple of other factors:

1) They have a population of 1.4 billion people, and they only have 3-4% of the population vaccinated, of course that's way too low of a number to make any attributable claims about vaccine efficacy. 

2)  Mask compliance is pretty terrible. I've had friends tell me that after the initial decline, plenty in the country thought he pandemic is going to be over, and they opened up prematurely.

3) Their testing levels as a percentage of their population has been subpar for a while.    


That said, economic growth is tied to economic activity, and there is no way India is going to tighten the covid restrictions belt as hard as it had before; there is too much risk to livelihood. This is why they've further capped vaccine exports and accelerated vaccination efforts in the country.  Secondly: A majority of the holdings under $EPI are service based (ie workforce capable of working remotely), which explains their growth levels. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EPI/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EPI/holdings/)     


...so yes, too early to see covid recovery in India, but economic growth indicators specifically tied to the Indian stock market aren't as bad. I might scoop up some potential shares if the markets do fall."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why don‚Äôt you short GME ? It‚Äôs a no brainer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those vaccination stats don't seem very reassuring. Indias pop is 1.3 billion.
65 million vaccinated = 4.5% . 10 million per week is 0.7% of population. 

I am sure vaccination speed will increase, but to get an upper bound, going by current rate will take 2.5 years+ to complete vaccination of the country."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. It's more closer to 1% per week atm.

Also, remember that India has a very younger population than someone like us. Majority of people are in 30s/40s.

Besides, the pace would pick up massively in coming days because at the moment, it's 2 million per day for 5 days and barely anything on 2 days of the week, so I'd say India could easily double that."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The spreads on monthlies are extremely tight compared to weeklies. Look at 6/16 $60. $0.03 spread, $1.67 ask, 19661 (about $3.2MM) in daily volume. If there is a rebound, they will benefit from the bullish price movement and potentially higher IV. Time is also the most valuable asset in the market. You‚Äôre doing yourself a disservice if you think trading weeklies is a good idea by default.

Real talk, if you are trading options often, extending your expiry is the easiest way to increase your win rate and your returns. Weeklies inherently have a low probability of success, it doesn‚Äôt matter what you think. 

Do you know why weeklies are called FDs? Because people that buy them like getting fucked in the ass by market makers. If you‚Äôre into that kind of stuff, more power to you.

Wrong. When trading these total return swaps with these prime brokers, the prime brokers understand that this postion will come with credit risk. The risk managers job is to then offset this risk and this is done by having the counter party post an Initial Margin worth a percentage of the reference assest's value. That means Hwang would've had to post IM to each individual conterparty that was leveraging him ""There was no reusing the collateral"". On top of this Hwang would've had a variation/variable margin. This means that, on a daily basis, as the price of the reference value increases or decreases Hwang would've been credited or had to post the amount as additional collateral (This is known as Mark to Market)"

The mean time to blow up your account would be days, while bill won for years before blowing himself up.

Also although options have max loss of the principle, that does not make them unleveraged.

Anyone who pushes this sentiment must think the addressable market is a sliver of the traditional auto makers. This isn‚Äôt true.

Besides, does everyone forget traditional automakers will buy up these spacs once the spacs have shown proof of concept and supplied their usefulness?

In the case of $RIDE, is it not clear that GM is interested in buying them out once GM has utilized all of the carbon credit discounts they locked in?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I am with ya. Picked up VIAC 4/16 70c today at quarter to four.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am more of a fan of VIACA than VIAC, for the same reasons DISCB was preferred over DISCA. Good luck to you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well i placed the order late last night in a bit of a gambling mood, only a fifth of the order filled, and after reading a little bit more info this evening i will look into it this weekend and move accordingly.  Good luck to both of us."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Whaaaaat
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I transfered everything to Webull early this month. Fuck RH and fuck tiny dick Vlad. I deleted a lot of my earlier posts on positions when everyone suggested against it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"i appreciate your consideration! coins are overrated. all i really hope for is the rediscovery of individual freedom and personal empowerment. i always thought happy people were full of shit and stuff like the secret and the law of attraction was hippy fufu crap. i used to hate christmas, and i never celebrated it. i still don't celebrate it. it's so weird, i now say with absolute certainty it's real. if you really want to trip out, get high af and read ""the power of now"" by eckhart tolle."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hadn‚Äôt noticed so I hope this doesn‚Äôt shatter the illusion for me. We had to buy a roku for some other channels that vizio didn‚Äôt have so I guess we always have that as back-up. I do miss our roku tv

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought in at $13 and been averaging down too... if this thing is for real (and I think it is), the difference between $15, $13, $10 won't matter a whole lot.  Sure I wish I'd waited until now to buy but whatever... hope it works out for us BB ~~bag~~holders"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. üèÖ
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No. Goldman Sucks is on top because they funnel enough assholes into DC that they effectively make the rules. It‚Äôs easier to break the rules when you wrote them.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe buy an actual American company? One with licenses in New York.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,With zero licenses in New York. Ok.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn‚Äôt aware the success of these two companies revolves around having a license in New York. I should have researched all their international business ventures, the upcoming merger to become thee largest cannabis company in the world, 4 straight quarters of profitability or the fact that Aphria owns thee largest craft brewery in the US which opens the door for future distribution in the US etc ect ect.....I should have done more research on New York licensing before I commented...how narrow minded of me.....my bad."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deleted a bit because it wasn't clear, due to my own confusion over something I still consider a pain.

""selling calls"", ""selling call options"", ""call option seller"" is thrown around a lot and can mean two things depending on context,  there is a big difference between 

* selling on a call or put that you bought from someone else (your responsibility ends as soon as transferred). Your potential losses are capped at what you paid for the call/put. This was being a call holder, not a writer.
* being the writer of the call or put, you're responsible for the underlying assets, potential unlimited risks beyond the cost of the option premium, confusion arises because ""writing calls"" is also often referred to as ""selling calls""

working out actual costs/risks properly requires knowing if your talking about being just a holder, or a writer."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh alright. Sounds complicated lmao but thats a good comment for me to learn, thanks a lot. 
I ll defo read more about it in the future, but I am already certain that ""writing calls/puts"" is nothing what beginners should do. 
Thanks again and happy easter :)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA isn't about predicting the future price 100% of the time, it's just a way of reducing risk and positioning yourself in such a way to benefit from volatile moves. It allows for accurate entry points and tells you quickly when you are wrong so you can cut your losses early, this is why it works and allows for the creation of an edge."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a believer generally in not ascribing to malice what can be explained by incompetence.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oooooo. Never heard of him, but that‚Äôs now on my list!!! Thanks for the recommendation!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's kind of a naive statement but I suppose for the sake of discussion, I could assume they're burying their heads in the sand because it pays the same to do nothing as it does to do something, assuming they're not being paid on the side to have their head in the sand to begin with."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With regards to the SEC and other regulatory bodies in general, I think the lack of action is from them looking to be hired by the same groups that they're supposed to be overseeing, mixed with some incompetence. With congress not holding their own regulatory agencies accountable, I think its mostly incompetence combined with some corruption. 

Less grand plan, more grand fuckup."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the financial analysis.  I‚Äôm in deep and long but struggle to confidently say how much of a marketcap/SP Orladeyo supports.

Two points; 
1. Factor D is now officially in PH3 for PNH.  As you note, you didn‚Äôt include Factor D in your analysis.  PH3 is scheduled to start 2H 2021.  At the time it starts, early PH1 patients will have been on Factor D for 16 mos.  So, there is significant time of sustained response and no SAE entering PH3.  I fully expect that trial will move quite quickly.  Additionally, it appears to have enrolled more patients (double) than competitors when they went PH3.  

Cowen gave an off the cuff estimate that Factor D could do 1B+ each year in sales for each of the 8 indications.

Given the above...  what do you think that should add to the SP at this stage of development?  And, when do you predict the market might start adding value to BCRX for Factor D?

Actually, I so want an answer to those last two questions.  I‚Äôll just stop here.  TY."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you apes understand fundamentals.

Tell me, what were the fundamentals and general consensus for a boomer media stock to just about 3x in less than 3 months?

Word around good DD, Hwang gang caused the *overvaluation* (tf is that word!?). Now, it's up to the market to determine a new valuation. Let me give you a hint. There is no fucking way it's ""recovering"" (Some would say it has recovered from being inflated) back to $100.

Congratulations, you bought a boomer stock. Try thinking for yourself instead of following the herd like a sheep, or ape in this case."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol fundamentals don‚Äôt matter this is a casino dude. Didn‚Äôt buy shares just bought /sold options on it. The stock was oversold and there was/is opportunities to make money

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/Tight-Sort-5050 has it right.  MSOs have to be traded on the Over-the-counter markets cause the banks won't touch the Cannabis sector as long as it remains Schedule I at the federal level.  If SAFE banking gets passed that  opens up the flood gates and the whole sector can finally access traditional financial services.  The only way the Canadian LPs benefit from this is by setting up shop here in America, which the MSOs already have a huge lead because of license restrictions.  Forget about Canada exporting to the US, it'll be a while before we see interstate commerce, let alone cross border."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think the market would be so free. Maybe it‚Äôs the wild west in California and Oregon but it really isn‚Äôt in any East Coast rec state and won‚Äôt imagine 

Between taxes and startup fees most would have to pay their state. There won‚Äôt be much mom and pop competition. And with already wild success among many states, availability in nearly half the United States depite it being federally illegal, how can a company like Curaleaf be a bad buy for the long term U.S. cannabis play. I am a med card holder and if you ask ANYONE in NY where to get good legal weed, it‚Äôs Curaleaf. It‚Äôs honestly the only reason I ever thought to buy it‚Äôs stock was because of how big they already are, theres an advantage to establishing a foothold and theres definitley brand loyalty for some of these companies already.
