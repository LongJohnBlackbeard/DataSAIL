04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, big things in store for MVIS. I bought in way too high so I sold at the peak on Wednesday for a small profit, but have been buying back in slowly and averaging down before this company absolutely explodes"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m all in on MVIS with 11,000 shares. I am now looking to add more since I sold off some of my boring value stocks like Restoration Hardware and CAT that gave me extra powder. I’m more than happy to be 100% MVIS in my portfolio but I hate to ruin my $7.20 average by adding now... fuck it. Adding more Monday. April is going to be EPIC"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When a buy out is announced, it’ll be to late."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great writeup! You may want to add Russell reconstitution in May. Today MVIS isn't in any Russell indices from what I can tell -- it was below the min $1/share cutoff last year. This year, MVIS should land in several. 
-- A long, long, long-time MVIS long. Like 21 freakin years!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought...no I chased it the other day at 18 like an idiot but glad I did. Only 10 shares but I’ll average down and see what happens.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write-up. I would just change “infamous” to “famous” or even “legendary.”

“Infamous” means something bad happened but what /u/s2upid did in that video was the complete opposite of bad, which is what I’m sure you meant to say!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This was one of the stocks attacked by Hindenburg. Pisses me off. They just attacked $RIDE with a bunch of false claims. Hindenburg is literally technically incompetent. https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/instablog/47545695-high-tech-stock-review/5535965-technically-incompetent-short-seller-hindenburg-makes-false-statements-microvision
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great write-up! I recently wrote an article on LinkedIn Pulse about MicroVision's LiDAR potential and the ""famous"" teardown video.

[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-augmented-reality-one-mans-portfolio-up-10000-vanden-heuvel](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-augmented-reality-one-mans-portfolio-up-10000-vanden-heuvel)

If you read it and like it, click the Like/Comment/Share button and let's help spread the word about this cool little company and its amazing tech. They've been innovating for decades and it would be great to see them finally get the attention and recognition they deserve."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to see a fellow supporter.... I have been buying since May as well. First on the 4th... discount on the 8th... .5795/share
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I want one and as many stocks as I can buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Farhi retiring from the BoD is a huge indication that a BO is done (or close) I wouldn't stop baby sitting my 9 plus million shares with out being totally confident that my investment is secure. 

Also Oz isn't working for free!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just got in for 100 shares yesterday, and thinking about just fomoing with the rest of my small dry powder stores next week"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ARMY/IVAS contract is worth $22 BILLION. That’s one customer. A huge customer, but it shows you that this product line is worth so much more. And MVIS is the secret sauce that powers it. Here’s a quote from the hololens creator, Alex Kipman:

“Before Microsoft started using MEMS technology, some executives believed it would be many years before the company could improve the HoloLens field of view. ""It was a significant engineering problem,"" said Zulfi Alam, a general manager who worked on the displays and screens of the HoloLens

Kipman called the new approach a ""miracle.""”

Yes, they are referring to MicroVision’s MEMS Display engine. 

In simplistic, but logical terms, let’s think about the market cap. The entire company is sitting at a $2.5 Billion value. There is a $22B deal and so much more to come in future sales from HL2, that MVIS gets a percent of with zero cost of goods sold. Now on the LiDAR front, we have LAZR valued at $8B. MVIS is dropping an “Best in class” A-sample with better capabilities and specs at a very cheap cost of under $1,000 per vehicle. And with those two verticals... $MVIS still has a market cap of only $2.44 Billion. 

Not advising anything, just dropping what I know."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well done. This company is such an underdog and I love it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Life changing tech. Life changing stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,best DD I've read in a while
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you want to yolo OTM calls for a chance of making a million dollar, this is it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great writeup, summarized all the key points I knew and gave me even more that I hadn't caught.
I'm still small time, but I'm in for 140 shares, might buy more next opening because of this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"fuck it, I'm in!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great DD. Bought about 2.3k shares on Thursday @ 15.28.

I don't have much to add in terms of info, but can say if a bidding war starts between giants list Microsoft and Google, the prices it can reach is literally in the moon lol. My brother is a brilliant software engineer and even before he finished army here in Israel (in the famous 8200 unit), Google, Facebook, Apple and more were all chasing after him and the salary offers he got were crazy and was funny to see from the side, so I can only imagine how it will be with MVIS"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This was good quality DD sir. Might grab some shares on Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Been in with 3000 shares at 17.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great post 👍Summarized very well. Crisp.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on MVIS, I believe it is one of the smartest investments going into April where the A Sample Demo is expected to be announced any day... could go $40-50 by the end of month, triple digits this year or whenever the buyout takes place I believe."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. 150 @16.00
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been chasing VR as my pack horse but apparently AR was the thing.  Boy do I wish oculus had went public before the Facebook acquisition.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started buying sub 10$, wish i bought more when it was cheaper. Holding 4000 @ 15.5$ ready for takeoff."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Samuel Kang, head of total solutions North America for BYD says last week, “we believe in mvis” and comments after, they have better tech than Luminar."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actual DD flaired as DD. Well done.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,MVIS is ready to explode upwards this month. Get ready
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been doing the same DD, and have posted on r/mvis ....this is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great company with upcoming Lidar presentation soon and after that ""THE MOON"" or ""Buyout "" i will buy some at opening.  Thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in for the buyout 🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember when this was just a speculation play lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought 20 MVIS yesterday, all that I could afford right now. The future looks bright for this company."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. 100 Shares and 15.00 C for august.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Better get in there and buy Mortimer buy!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Me with 75 shares ...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"2k shares at 1.81. Sold 500 at 10$ to get my initial investment back.

Hoping this will pay off my student loans and give me a sizable chunk of change to rely on in the future."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fantastic investment thesis, I am expecting a giant green laser dildo and have all of my beans in one basket."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already in and looking to add more next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I feel bad for who miss out on this great chance of technology
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to options contracts in the event of a buyout?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This rocket is not even in the stratosphere yet, get on before it flies to the moon 🚀🌝"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought LEAPS awhile ago, working well for me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I just like this stock.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great post, this company is set to moon."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks for the details and research.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding 219 shares at an average of 13. Anything over 50$ a share and I'll have enough for a house deposit. Pipedream but fingers crossed a realistic one!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been on the fence about MVIS - but you glorious bastard convinced me, liquidating my shitty boomers for this come monday! Happy easter fuckers"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,!wsbgold
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets, Been in since sub $1
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am a student and I totally believe in MVIS, right now it‘s 100% of my „portfolio“ and I put every money I can afford into it buying the dips. 
Holding 66 shares right now since 2 months. Not that much but in case of a buyout it would be a little fortune to me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wish I knew this company existed last year. Would’ve scooped up some shares for less than a dollar each. Oh well...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Chiming in cuz ~~skynet~~ i mean palantir has their hands in everything, maybe. (Note, rehashing from a vid i watched cred goes to that ape for the seed for making my brain wrinkle)


So MVIS creates all the hardware and MSFT is the front company doing the software right. But PLTR has a hand in analyzing the data, which is already in a controlled VR environment. Imagine how easy it would be for them to utilize their scalability model to sell more programs to the military this way. 



Pos just PLTR shares no options
Liking MVIS on monday"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,remindme! 3 months
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got this at 1.92 for no other reason than it was cheap and in seattle. (Local to me) sold at 22. Really wish I had bought more than  21 shares lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The price target according to cnnmoney is 25 cents lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own some MVIS to sell ccs on and short puts when it sells off. But 2 things: 

1) Blackrock buying MVIS means literally nothing they are one of the largest asset managers in the world, primarily run passive funds, and own every single stock. (They own iShares which is IWM etc)

2) short volume doesn’t equal short interest so for fucks sake can everyone stop repeating this stupidity?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,KOPIN anyone ?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great DD my fellow ape.  This is the way 🙌🏼😎💎🚀🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gfg!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Might buy some after Gamestop MOASS
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A general counsel doesn't step down because of an incoming acquisition. They would be more important than ever. No target company is going to allow their acquirer to negotiate legal for them. What?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm Warren Buffett and this stock is overvalued.

EDIT: I'm getting downvoted for being Warren Buffett?!?!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah it’s very tempting to do that based on the Fibonacci retracement golden zone, but at this point I’m just buying the dips. I don’t want to risk being caught in transition when the A-Sample or buyout PR drops, which could literally be any day now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All in club 💎🙌💎🚀🌙
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly. Based on all signs I expect a buyout is already being negotiated and I would expect we may even see an announcement in the next few months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too late for what? It will already be priced in? It hasn’t been announced yet so now is a great time?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens to the stock if the company is bought out? Are you supposed to sell the stock before the merger?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep yep
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Great add, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In a month from now you’ll be laughing. Lots of great value increasing things on their way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Updated to legendary, thanks for the suggestion! Sometimes I use infamous in a positive connotation but you are correct it is technically a negative connotation historically. Ie I could care less vs I couldn’t care less haha... Cheers and BOL"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was channeling my love for The Three Amigos... “The Infamous El Guapo... In-Famous?... IN-FAMOUS?!?!”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hindenburg is aptly named... as they will soon go down in flames from shorting MVIS 🔥🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They're literally the reason I know they exist. Heard they attacked a company that really didn't deserve it and wanted to look into it myself. Looked at their chart and was like ""maybe they deserve it"", then looked at their company vs market cap and was like ""holy fuck!"" then bought some at 6.50 and averaged down as it consolidated further at 5.50"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing article, thanks for sharing."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great read! Thanks for sharing!  Liked :)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice! Yeah I currently hold ~13,300 shares in Roth and brokerage and 93 calls/LEAPS. LFG"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"First jumped on MVIS last year at around 0.20, been adding to my position with any available powder. The last few months have been exciting. Let’s go MVIS!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,BAFF!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomski 💥
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I fomo'd in at 22 about a month ago and have been averaging down. they have a lidar demo this month, this will cement them as the top lidar company.   


Since other lidar companies are trading at a hiring price, the MVIS community expects a big jump in stock price. There are also other verticals like their partnership with Microsoft in producing the hololens2

&#x200B;

wording is hard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m HOPING to hop in for around 2k shares Monday. As long as it stays nice and calm before then lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s crazy how undervalued they still are... my price target is $150/share... $70-100/share just for the auto LiDAR vertical (Our next closest competitor Luminar is currently valued at $8.5B and they were $10B pre-correction).
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Indeed, life changing for sure!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks. I promised myself I wouldn’t regret not buying more. 💎🙌💎
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US! ONE OF US!! ONE OF US!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true. I suspect Google is ahead in this race and may already have a deal negotiated, but it would behoove the other tech giants (Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, etc.) to not lose out on this treasure trove of IP. They could try to force a hostile takeover buy acquiring a large % of retail shares at high limit sells... who knows, whatever happens, it’s good for us :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, you’ll be glad you did!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I hear ya. I bought 3200 @ $1.50, been accumulating up to +13,000 today but would’ve have been nice to buy more back then! 💎🙌💎"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is actually an under the radar talking point. Seems kind of out of left field if you didn't know what MVIS was capable of. I LOVE this from Kang.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added, thanks brotha"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The will skyrocket based on the skyrocketing share price and can be sold for massive profit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Price share will move up to just below the buyout price and hang there until the deal closes. If your strike is below the buyout price, you make money, if it is above the buyout, you lose. As of now, the highest strike is $35. You should be rolling in it. Holding 140 May, August, and Jan 22 calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This post right here! What'll happen to call options? My understanding is that if they jump into ITM status when a buyout share price is revealed then the calls could be sold for beaucoup bucks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LFG
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LFG
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Added /u/WrathofKhaan as an approved submitter. Hey OP, mention any crypto, SPACs, or stocks under the market cap lower bound (1 billion) and this will be revoked."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice average, party on your yacht :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hindsight is 20/20. It was also a riskier investment last year as they had much less cash runway. Sumit Sharma has guided the ship beautifully. You can’t change the past but you can still benefit more by increasing position now, that’s what I’ve been doing all along the way."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Most pundits and investment research firms are either funded by institutional shorts or simply morons.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, never."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is retiring in June and will be staying on and consulting until, “ the new general counsel takes over”"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is staying on in a consulting role until June. 

From the Press Release: “I will be stepping back from my current role but will continue to provide support to the Company on a consulting basis through June as the Company **transitions to a new general counsel**.”

And read #8 in this amazing article - https://www.griproom.com/fun/10-signs-your-company-is-about-to-be-acquired"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think the OP means that the general counsel sees the writing is on the wall and he will be canned after the merger

I agree though the existing company wants the GC through the merger and would give them stock options/ bonuses etc to stay on as they all knew the GC is gone after the merger

Now if the language is already agreed upon........."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unless the deal has already been negotiated and just not yet announced...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No sir... you are Warren Broke
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP, can you clarify your valuation for this gentleman? We need clarity, your opinions don’t matter 😉"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think I’m just gonna sell like 20% at the next peak, and buy back in when it dips. That way it’s not a big risk, but should hopefully guarantee an increase in shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ride or die to the MOONKSI!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you keeping or selling upon announcements
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or few weeks, that would be nice. 🔥"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep, agree now is the time to own. Anything under 20 I believe will double"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s definitely a great time to buy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They just mean it will be too late to buy the stock and profit once a buyout is announced
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When the company or one of its verticals is acquired, the shareholders will be compensated either with stock of the acquiring company, cash, or a mix of both.  An announcement of M&A will cause the share price to moon, at which point you could either sell high or hold through the merger to get compensation. I will most likely hold depending on the situation, as there is massive value in not just the Auto LiDAR vertical, but also consumer LiDAR and AR verticals."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RemindMe! 1 Month
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Best of luck to you comrade, when one eats... we ALL eat. It’s been an insane ride but I’m bullish long term. Congrats to those who got in early... I thought I got in cheap haha."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congrats :) I tried getting in at 40ish cents but fidelity screwed me over, learned my lesson and still appreciating what is coming out of this tech! I just so wish I got in at what I was supposed to"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Note to self: get more shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Or do I yolo all my profits from a recent trade I made last week?? This is wallstreetBETS....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, and well done!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You son of a bitch I'm in
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There may be a complication if just one vertical is sold off and shareholders receive compensation in the form of a special dividend. Not entirely sure what the best strategy for maximizing option value would be in that scenario, it might just be as simple as selling the calls if a dividend is confirmed and buying back in if you’re interested in their other verticals, but it’s worth consideration."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd also add that their IP could be worth a TON if properly implemented (which it looks like they're doing), but if the company faces liquidation then it's not worth very much at all. I see that as why their stock was soooo cheap last year while still justifying a higher valuation than their current price now that they have no chance of going under with such a massive cash pile relative to their burn rate.

(also I don't think people knew about the MSFT connection back then, or at least a lot less sure)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely agree they’re morons. Just thought it was funny not saying I agreed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No stonks on the moon, good call."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bingo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Adding, thanks for this clarity."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holding for buyout compensation
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m trying to play options but options trading calc only shows me shit plays. Might as well buy shares unless I’m missing sometbing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well put man 🤙
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Any idea about tax implications for those buying now that would get compensated within one year? Curious if it is treated as short term gains.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you share with the rest of the class what lesson you learn.  So we don’t make the same mistake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No risk it no biscuit

Go big or go home

This is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When a special dividend is announced the share price would go up to include the dividend amount  plus whatever people value the company at, then on the ex dividend date the price would fall roughly the amount of the dividend."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct, some knew but not nearly as many as today. Also, the automotive LiDAR vertical wasn’t as much of a focal point back then as it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, messing with you... I love conflicting opinions and devils advocates. I see you got downvoted, I went the other direction. I admire those who speak freely."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the unfortunate situation these days. Have a great weekend!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Full retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I plan on buying MVIS stock soon, what happens when there's a buyout? Never heard of a compensation, I only started investing a few months ago, can you give me more details?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think anything below $16 is still a discount. After the msft IVAS contract though it could be argued the new floor is at least double that 😆
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the response. So it seems if you have calls and just one vertical was sold, you would have to exit your position to take advantage of a dividend once announced and just buy back in after the dividend was issued and the share price settles."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The downvote button isn’t meant to silence people for giving conflicting opinions but for weeding out low effort content that doesn’t contribute to the discussion.

If OC actually gave even a single insight as to why they think so then it may have been a worthwhile comment. But they didn’t so I see no reason to be upset over downvotes when used correctly.

Go ahead and admire bulls or admire bears, that’s how it should be, but admiring low effort junk doesn’t help anyone, including yourself."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You will get compensated with with cash, stock in the acquiring company, or both."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So buy leaps I guess? Not really asking for advice just your thoughts. I’m definitely trying to play MVIS one way or the other
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Noswad27 knows!  Hope all is well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shortly after such an announcement there would likely be a pretty big run up as shorts and naked calls have to cover and that'd likely be the best exit for calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t remember asking for any help... this forum is for free speech. Who are you to dictate what is quality and not? I know... an egomaniac who has time to write a paragraph about something that doesn’t involve him 🙌🏻 glad I got you to get emotional and waste time writing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"First of all the authorities have to give their okay w/ the buyout. After that we, the shareholders, have to vote on the offer. And after that comes the cash/stocks. So it‘ll take some time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when im holding calls like a degenerate?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I've been buying jan 2022 $35 calls with profits from may $20 calls. Haha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not dictating, I’m explaining to you what the rules of the site you are posting on are because you seem to not understand them at all. But I guess it’s only free speech if you’re right, and when someone tells you you’re wrong suddenly you make fun of them for what they write? Lol, the irony..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop trying to silence me, sweetie :P"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls with a strike price under the buyout price per share moon. Calls with a strike price over the buyout price get fukt.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can always exercise your calls and hold shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably worthless if the stock can’t be bought on expiry, but I’m not sure."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks snowflake 🙌🏻 there’s plenty of others to downvote that don’t offer quality either. None of them seem to be impacted. Also, I make fun of no one... just point out the obvious."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The exact opposite, they moon as long as the buyout price per share is higher than your strike price, which in all likelihood it will be.

It’s also not like a buyout gets announced and then you need to make your decision ASAP. First there would be an M&A report, then the share price would shoot up to around it (and potentially exceed it quite a bit as shorts get squeezed to death) and then it would still likely be months until the actual deal goes through so everyone holding shares or calls will be in a great position with time on their side no matter what."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny how the only time I ever hear the word snowflake being used is from the biggest snowflakes themselves projecting it on to others. Enjoy your weekend and learn not to take life so seriously.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that makes sense, but what happens if the strike price is after the company does not exist?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rubber vs glue scenario... I used that in elementary school too. Stick and stones may break my bones but nosy people never hurt me. You know this had zero to do with you, that’s my issue. If people worried about their own business, we’d all be better off.

PS - I’m in a room full of people and we are all laughing right now. Breathe... mind your own business.. and learn from today.

Edit: Once again stop with the ego, don’t tell me how to take life. You just dont get it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll have ample opportunity to either sell your contracts for big profit or exercise them far before you ever need to worry about that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh I’m sorry, I didn’t realize I stumbled into a private conversation, here I thought I was commenting on a public message board where I didn’t need permission on which matters I can and cannot comment on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but does that mean they stop writing options contracts after the announcement? What happens to the very last contracts?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So it went from needing quality posts, to being a public forum in the same thread... love the hypocrisy.

I love that you can’t stop responding, you’ll be thinking about this all day and night. Need to let it go."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A fraction of that money is going to roads and bridges. Plus it takes States years to plan and actually utilize these funds, like 10 years."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you think this is the biggest infrastructure bill since the new deal, I guess you didn't read it either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll take look at the charts, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, that’s why all of these (relatively) dumped after the announcement. Buy the rumour, sell the news style situation.

At least that’s what I’m telling myself after getting burned on X FDs"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"skimmed it, that fucker is long and ape no read good"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean you’re almost all the way there, only 25% more to go!"

>I bought this option a while ago what should I do?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are actually retarded for not unloading it when it was $14 last week.

At this point you might as well chase losses by selling and buying $SPY 0TDE's with what's left. Definitely don't baghold, those are 99.99% going worthless lol."

I'm looking at either $700-720 gap up to unload. There's heavy resistance at 690-700.  


What I've learned with TSLA is never become attached and hold on too long. If you see an opening, get out because there's more chance to get in lower and give you more time/room. Holding on to hope is what kills most trades"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my gourd!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The stock dropped because of uncertainty in the already-high delivery expectations. And then they beat them...

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,True
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes! Believe the stock will go lower. Hardly any short interest in the name. The delivery numbers are expected based on the annual 500,000 sales last year and the growth trajectory going forward.  So they sell 800,000 cars. They still deserve 1,000 Forward P/E .. How many cars do the other makers make .. This is just my feelin. Sell the news event."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I told you I’m retarded.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,for sure! I mean I wouldn't load up if I didn't see it going to $7xx
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It will have to reverse the downtrend. It has had all sorts of reasons to go higher. But valuation has it going lower. The move higher to $900 was fake based on WS front running the inclusion with an overnight duplicate algo trade. I watched it a few nights and it almost made me puke. My target is $420
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I meant options bro, not actual shares. When it comes to shares yea lmao hold the good ones until moon"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the beat YoY delivery numbers by 108%. Which mean with CURRENT production they'll hit 1M. Except Berlin and Shanghai is going to go online soon. 1M is almost guaranteed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think that with their new production capabilities and new factories they will break 1M this year.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 1 day trend was down.  The 5 day trend is up.  The 1 month/6 month/1 year/5 year trend is up.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You must like losing money here with that bull shit talk
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I sure hope so. How much have they spent on production facilities? Hopefully they can start turning a decent profit. When that happens, the stock will rocket again. Until then, I don't see it doing to much."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool this info dropped the Friday of a 3 day weekend and will be forgotten by Monday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stolen quote from wsb on pltr. Customized. 

The year is 2099, the longest bull market is undergoing and every household is connected to PLTR software one way or another. 

PLTR stock is at all time average $26"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,PLTR Good news?  Might be time to buy in again because itll dip to 20.  Because this stock is even weirder than GME.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,PALANTARDS ARISE!! Jk we already know this ain’t gonna do shit but maybe make me feel better on buying the dip. Lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sweet, I look forward to the 10% price drop on Monday on this news."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now if only my dream girl Cathie Wood comes out and tells us it's worth $40 the brick would fly..

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But Microsoft got over $21 billion from government...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah!! I guess I should start averaging down now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time for it to drop 5%!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe they can make a deal with NOK and both tickers will drop 30%
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This and BB get royally butt fucked after legit good news. Fucking bizarre. Oh well, buying more PLTR Monday."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,89m is a drop in the ocean to make any difference to a stock

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$89m, that’s cute"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,April fool's was yesterday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think the most interesting thing is that they won this contract in a month. Good for them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh cool! So +4%monday and then back to red for the rest of the week.  Yaay!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So load up on puts at open. Got it

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So palantir trades at 40x revenues, so this contract should be good for another $10billion in market cap right?  Did I do my maths right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not financial advice, it's a fact: 
If it's good enough for the CIA, it's good enough for you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Going all in after GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh shit. I'm more in than I was before!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So at max potential value it's $18mil per year over 5 years....for a supposed $40 billion company. Not exactly game changing news.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Baby money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why is this even a thread? It’s an $89 million contract *ceiling*.

Why does palantir trade more like google than Leidos or SAIC? It’s a government contractor"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR stock keeps dipping because insiders including the CEO, Alex Karp, are exercising their options. They need to sell some shares to cover taxes which is putting a downward pressure on the stock.

This is good news for any long term bulls on PLTR as we can buy the dips.

Edit: I'm not a finance or investment advisor."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love how WSB and r/stocks has the exact same reaction to this: PLTR announced good news, guess the stock is going down.

It's like the anti-YOLO. If you're in PLTR, you need to be in for a long time, not for a good time. **Slowest. Orgasm. Ever.**"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR has a ridiculous market cap of 40B. This would be huge news if it was appropriately valued. 

So this contract is worth 0.2% of their market cap...the value is only in the headline news."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Let fucking go maybe these bags will actually start profiting
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I whopping $89M contract?!  That's unbelievable money!

I'm long in PLTR with a bunch of worthless ass bags."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like a $1-$2 dip based on this news.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why there was a sec filing for 200 mil revolving credit. LFG!

You spelled 8% dip wrong"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think this might just mean a full implosion. At least the CC’s getter better with the volatility.

The only thing that will move the stonk is big news (like this) or quarterly results."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If this PLTR Meme action is true, I think I will finally jump in if it does dip! Before GME, PLTR was the first stock I saw WSB blowing up over like ""is that a plantain/banana company ticker or something"".

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally found some commonsense. 90mil to a 42 bil market cap is a drop in the ocean.

One contractor is 500k a year billing at $250 an hour so that's like 180 people over one year, or more likely 60 people over 3 or like 40 over 5.

Its actually a pretty small contract compared to other IT projects I've seen."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m going to assume you are either self employed or a low level associate. 

I’ve been blessed to have RSOs and a good amount.

when you execute the RSO you have to pay taxes immediately on them like your paycheck you get from your job. 

You also have a date you must execute the RSO so he can’t sit on them for ever.  The media didn’t report how many shares he got but all he did was this.

1. Executed RSO’s, got a fuck ton of shares in pltr.  He owed taxes, instead of going to his bank account, he sold the exact amount of shares needed to cover the taxes and he KEPT the rest of the shares as shares.  If he paid 10m for taxes, he executed around 30m worth of shares. 

It already came out from PLTR Karps sale was to offset taxes for executing RSO.  

You learned something new today, maybe one day you will get high enough in a compant to get RSO and understand them from a financial point."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Stupid question but will Wall Street always screw with PLTR’s price because of this? I’m assuming it won’t matter at a certain point?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is not big news. 89mil is peanuts
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha, imagine thinking people cares anything but profit. Also assuming this is “big news” for company with market cap over 40B. What is the margin from this contract?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It might actually have something to do with their own projections of 5B revenue by 2025 versus the current market cap of 42B.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nobody hates it it’s just fully valued. $40B market cap is very high based on their revenue and growth projections. Not sure why people can’t understand that. Valuation didn’t matter last year, now it does."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They ""hate it"" so much that it has a $40 BILLION valuation on $0 of profit, ever."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we get a list of the bad words?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What could possibly go wrong? Lets expand into banning expressions of opinion that aren't popular while we are at it. Nothing more Anti-Evil than that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DPO - Direct Public Offering...take the stonk directly to the people...don’t pay Wall St to structure/launch an IPO.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Direct price offering banks and hedges didn’t get to buy in at massive discounts compared to retail, typical IPO can be $20 but banks bought in $14 and instantly shoots up to $30 on buy orders and banks are up handsomely dpo it gets listed same price for everyone besides people who may have bought OTC or worked there 

PLTR opened at $10 wsb bought in, hate campaign to keep it sub $15 till the banks and hedges could buy in then it soared but basically price is set by retail demand RBLX is another recent DPO"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For Palantir? Yeah. They closed out 2020 with nearly $150M in new government contracts. Their army contract is worth $460M... this is not about the size, it's about the client diversification. Think that PLTR does not spend a cent in comertials or public comunication, they just go and win contracts or get clients from other client's recomendation. It's not a big deal... but it's still a deal."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Brother can you spare 89mil peanuts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Perhaps today you think it is fairly valued.

Palantir is currently taking 5% of the global market in 2020. I think."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You are absolutely right I haven't followed PLTR at all and have no idea what a dip looks like I am a GME retard exclusively. I just saw the gov't contract news and people memeing about a dip and I wanna FOMO in

Then Karp decided to not IPO yet.  There value is plenty fine, if they were not showing crazy growth it would be concerning but 30-40% projected growth over the next 5 years is solid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We have the hottest HR manager I’ve ever seen.  She just oozes sex.  I told her I’m gonna marry her some day.  It’s not harassment if we’re married. *taps head*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You cant just compare revenues though what were both the companies net income after costs?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet she's a sadist since she works in HR.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Then put where your mouth is and bet against it. 😉 Let see who will come up on top.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically you have losses but don’t wanna post that..and instead post gains that you don’t actually have, is that right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wym by “this post does well”?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the hell are you using Robinhood?!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Please note that I did not post up to date graph because I have friends and family follow my account and they can go fuck themselves. I dont want them to know exactly how stupid I am.

Edit: I realized it's not clear but I sold. Realized the gains at 16$ a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Way to diversify 😉
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have the gains I just moved money out of robinhood and didn't save a screenshot of the big pp graph at the time. Just like the screenshot here the numbers are off because I didn't hold onto my plays I realized them. 


I also have losses too with screenshots. But for the full gains/losses I'd have to post buy sell history which looks ugly to me. 

The only thing I don't want to post is my YTD because of f&f. They bug me about wasting my money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Money is just paper. Real wealth is in Karma apparently.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"These were taken during the January thing. I am now a member of the highly exclusive gigachad fidelity gang. 

Only use robinhood when I want to try options because it's easy to look at."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's wrong with robinhood? I've always had really good fills, really good UI, really good options menus, etc. Is the only problem that one time they blocked people from buying meme stocks because their clearing House got overloaded? You realize almost every other broker also had to block it except for like 2 brokers world wide?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you’re showing selective screenshots to limit the amount of backlash you’d receive from friends and family while also trying to maximize the amount of validation and updoots you can get from a bunch of retards?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How the fuck do they ""follow"" your account?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yep money doesn't make me happy. But karma makes pp hard.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RH first to start the wave. First to call back margin orders on it and last to remove restrictions on buying. I had some issues back with RH during March/April last year but January was the last straw. There’s plenty they’ve done wrong before that if you wanna do a quick Google search.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats basically it. I dont want f&f to know exactly how much money i have.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reddit has a follow button, did you not know that? 

You can see when a person posts while scrolling if you follow them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why wouldn’t you just make a burner account and post it then? Do you so badly need the karma to show up on your actual account?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last I heard new accounts can't post. Eventually I plan to turn this account into a ""play"" account so no I just need the post here to track progress.

By play account I mean have all my plays posted."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Saving to perform more dd on this later.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep here in Canada 🇨🇦the price of a 2x4 has increased from a toonie and a quarter ($2.25) to over $12 Were seriously looking at metal fucking studs over wood which are $6. Why is metal cheaper than wood 🤷‍♀️

*math is hard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the type of random play I’ve been looking for. Canadian Lumber who would’ve thought lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a builder, can confirm. Lumber prices are doing prison sex to profit margins."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s great and like a breath of fresh air reading more diverse, niche DD here (again) on WSB."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Investing in well-managed companies that produce in-demand commodities and make a profit is such a boomer mentality.

I prefer to invest in nebulous tech companies with no discernible product or profit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Best way to make money on lumber right now is to be a commissioned sales person. 2.5% is a hell of a lot more on a $40 sheet of 7/16 OSB then it was when selling for under $8 in Feb 2020. 😏
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice DD, lumber near all time highs with low housing inventory"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait for someone to do some DD on the Beetle Squeeze that's also pushing prices up. Both in Canada & Europe
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,canadian lumberjack here and i approve of this message
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like how responsible boomer stocks like lumber and steel get hyped here now and then. It's the yin to the wsb yang
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not just lumber. Building materials period. Builders are struggling to keep up with demand for new homes because it's harder and harder to get these supplies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since we are talking Canadian Lumber, what are your takes on Western Forest Products Inc. ($WEF.TO)?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One thing I'd like to point out as a Canadian is that we pay ridiculous prices for the shittiest quality lumber that we cut and produce here at home, we take all the good stuff and sell it abroad. Also if you want to dig deeper look into 'J grade' lumber, it's wood we sell exclusively to Japan because they demand the highest quality and are willing to pay top price."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In my town a sheet of ½ inch plywood used to be around $25-$30... Now they are $70....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmmm, I've been thinking of getting into lumber recently based on some articles I've been reading but they are in the US. Do you have any thoughts on US lumber stocks?

So you are not worried lumber supply will go back to normal once mills open back up and people are taking on less projects?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I drive on the canfor roads from time

Constant stream of lumber

And the piles they have 👅💵"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is r/vitards material you should post there aswell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How can someone in the US get in on this action? I own a bunch of Canadian stocks- not on the TSX or whatever but their American equivalents. Cant seem to find this one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good find and DD. Worth looking into. What are you thinking fair value is?

Is there a bear thesis at all? I did a quick skim on the interwebs and didn't see many people talking about this anywhere. The ones that are talking about it are bullish."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought lumber prices were high be because the wood was being diverted into disposable masks and other COVID PPE?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"my 2 cents:

1. are growth expectations not included in current price?
2. as summer comes and these corporations use futures/forward contracts, isn't the price going to drop in the next months (- check out seasonality). i'd pick up in October maybe? or at least wait a couple months?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Canfor looks good. Unfortunately no options since it’s Canadian
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been looking at UFI. Not sure if good or not.  🤔
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Saved
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully your wife’s boyfriend can help and lend you all the money you need.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just dropped out of forestry school to cook tendies. Let's get it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"same, who wouldve thought. canadian fucking lumber haha i love this sub"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"hoping to see some Shakes and Shingles points.  WFG just acquired Norbord in US. So much room to grow in US when the rail deals start flying.

If something is eased on CVD/Antidumping rates, expect wood to get hard for the bulls.

edit: and paid off a bunch of Norbord debt."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Isn't this inflation? It's not like they're buying lumbar cheaper than anyone else?

Or is this  a hedge against inflation?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lots of lumberjacks in Canada.... or so the rumor goes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ya, I'm holding off on wood for a deck project, which leads me to another opportunity this summer may be TREX.

It just bounced off 88 support and all this talk of wood prices skyrocketing, nobody is looking at the premium alt products being more in line with wood prices, maybe more affordable???"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,shower bad or bunk bed bad?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can agree that these are boomer stocks but they did extremely well 2020 and they’re offering a lot of growth for 2021 and there’s lots of money to be made off of these. You gotta go with the sector that has a lot of momentum right now and it’s lumber imo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">	prefer to invest in nebulous tech companies with no discernible product or profit.

And offer clients booze, coke and escorts"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. Brother in law is a lumber salesman. Husband is a truss salesman. Their commissions right now are obscene. They are the ones asking me and my sister to look into construction stocks to invest in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,i literally am one of the crews out there surveying these beetles =D
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are very late to that game.  That just eats into profits, not drive up prices."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,this would make quality DD.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I can’t speak on it because it’s < 1 billion market cap, but check my post history I made a DD on that stock as well"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it’ll last for at least 2021 cause a lot of these companies are booked and have work all through the summer. Even with supply meeting demand it’ll take a while for things to get back to normal and for lumber prices to retreat to their normal levels. Keep in mind Q2 and Q3 lumber companies are doing the best in terms of revenue as that’s peak season. US lumber companies are seeing and will see the same growth as well imo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What motherfucker is wearing a wooden mask?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought Aluminium prices were high because of the tin foil hats being worn by members of this Sub
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,interesting angle. I think the institutions are waiting for changes to CVD rates before taking an interest.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's *iron* mask bro 😋
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I would have the price of lumber is jacked to the tits , am Canadian ape."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Demand versus supply actually. The demand is going up since home mortgages have cheap rates. On top of it, the wood supply is not catching up fast enough. A 10 dollar piece of wood now costs 7 times that"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We’ve switched almost fully to ICF builds, as they’re beating wood on cost, and offering a bunch of benefits. 

Trex could be a good play but unfortunately it’s reserved to deck boards and etc."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,don't forget to pay 5x too much for the property to build on.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm just teasing. Commodities are exactly where you should be looking when you're expecting a downturn. I've had an eye on lumber myself but figured I already missed the boat.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am being serious though. Bark Beetles 
 have infested pine forrests & make huge areas unusable. It's a known issue in Canada but its started spreading in Europe as well 🪲🪲"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will do, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Any US lumber companies to recommend? I will be looking into the ones you mentioned this weekend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can not get through a single thread of WSB without laughing. Thanks.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was being serious too. I know the Beatles are invasive species. You can't even bring in your own firewood to campgrounds without someone asking you about the Beatles.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haven’t looked deeply into them tbh so i can’t recommend any but lumber as a whole is doing good so US companies should follow. Canada is known for their lumber though, and railways and oil."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can look at RFP. They've been on a solid uptrend for the last year. I think there's some DD floating around one or two of the subs in it. Probably have to look back a month or so which is when I first saw it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, someone else to hold BLNK with me  !"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe making profits are not for you, throwaway. Holding TSLA for years (great community in CA) sold shares after 5:1, reloaded and will sell share after the next 5:1 split.  For family, friends and paying it forward."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Volkswagen will beat Tesla
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly it should continue lower still. I think OP will regret not selling those up 240 percent
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm almost certain it heads lower. If the stock market works like I think it does. Hardly anyone is short this stock. You can't squeeze a dry lemon. Sleep well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your gonna be broke
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,As soon as you’re good with your Tesla calls he’ll call another diver a pedophile

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You are not missing out as it is likely heading lower.. $420!  Kimbal keeps selling his shares. All insiders are selling ! Go take a look. This delivery report plus the jobs report may just be the fuel needed for it to crack $600 lower.  Patience.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly my smooth ape brain reasoning
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,what? its like less than 1% of global cars produced
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much, they sold 180k cars 1st quarter basically tying Ford. In 10 years Tesla will be the most popular vehicles i think."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you tell me things that will print mr seer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It definitely could go either way, but there is a lot of sentiment behind it currently. I personally hope it moves up pretty well Monday."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t understand this post was from 3 hours ago, but they are only around $8 and I dunno think the downtrend continues next week with the good jobs report"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d bet during the big dip last month. Those are some juicy gains good job OP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I drive Wolfsburg, and will continue to make profits with TSLA selling shares.  Let’s see, maybe .5M or M TSLA trade. Don’t see your point, VW, because money talks and bullshit walks."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"New traders...Exhibit A

Be careful with phrases such as ""I'm almost certain"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well as long as charge point continues it's run I should be pretty well flat I was close to selling tesla but was just praying for a little more of a drop.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So buying a shit load of shares and a shit load of calls with no shorts is gonna make the stock drop? HOW do you think the stock market works?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah I was up close to 50 percent and I've got more in msft calls and charge point. Worst case I'm looking at a 75 percent loss and that doesn't leave me down enough to kill me.

 Plus I've seen great reports a thousand times on a stock and watched it go red. Or trade flat. Granted if I knew the reports were coming out I would have sold just wanted a quick play but you win some and lose some."

Screenings of old movies and TV series will become more common since most new releases will be available online. Alcohol and GANJA will become huge sources of revenue.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The near/mid term cinema won't be making money sure, but the streaming argument gonna end up just like printer in the start of the internet, people tough they are gonna be worthless because with email and electronic document you won't need to print and send by post, but in the end it just made the use of printer even more intensive.

Same thing happened with radio and tv. I thing movie theater will make a huge comeback after covid, because even if you can watch anything on stream many people will still want the experience in a huge screen with surround sound and with other people just like music concert are always fully booked even though you can listen to the music anywhere anytime."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What leads you to believe they will likely dilute? There was a bunch of FUD and shitty headlines released yesterday but Aron acknowledged that retail owns the stock and the vote doesnt even take place until May 4th. Then another vote/shareholder meeting would be needed to actually distribute those shares.

&#x200B;

Edit i didnt do any of my own research, im just deep into AMC And need the confirmation bias this am with my crayon/coffee combo"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god this post didn't mention AMC then, huh."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,>i agree with you about their dispute resolution; also would be curious to see how many people here that bashed paypal consistently use venmo. i've noticed a lot of people forget pypl owns venmo...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thought ER was pre-released. Seems there was a run up and it will back some to maybe 16.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already started....cliffs gonna be big all year
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is the SNDL of reopening stocks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is seeking approval from shareholders to have the authority to issue 500m shares if needed. I doubt shareholders will vote yes for this. And even if they do it doesn’t mean they dilute ASAP. They have the ability if they need capital. In all honestly it was probably a ploy to get a share recount done to see exactly where the stock stands in regards to synthetic shares.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why do you think they are better positioned than other airlines?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I used PayPal for everything online for the ""protections"" , over the years crazy amounts of money. I had one situation of fraud for like $600 and they couldn't be bothered to respond to me properly through the tickets, just auto rejections and stone walls and then eventually after me jumping through hoops just said no.  Did a chargeback on the credit card and haven't used them since, never plan on it again."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy the dip
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, and personally really miss the cinema, nothing beats a cinema night, popcorn etc but there will be competition from streaming and the big impact that has IMO is not on direct ticket sales but on the fees (not sure what they're called) payed by movie makers to cinemas, cinemas may end up with less of the profit pie."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is why, while my investing strategy is nothing like the 'WSB vibe' (I wish everyone the best but I visit here mainly for the lols), my portfolio is pretty much 100% CNK/CINE/CGX/IMAX right now.

I'll go back to incredibly broad ETFs, but when I see an opportunity I want to seize it.

1. Going to the cinema is another experience of watching a movie

2. It's also an excuse to go out and meet friends - that's not gonna change

3. Even if some millennials have changed their viewing habits, there are still a bunch of parents that take their smaller children there

4. There are a bunch of hit releases coming up

5. This is one of the last industries to not ""fix"" itself post-corona. JETS is already pre-pandemic levels. With vaccines I believe we're at the end of this and it's just a matter of time.

* I am not suggesting betting on any one chain, but on the whole industry (excluding AMC which correlates with the GME craziness - personally not for me). Also, you may need to hold it for a year or more.

** Not advice, just my mindset."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I admit I may be a victim of FUD.. the truth is an alusive tendie. But, I think AMC will need more capital to see them to post pandemic times."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Indeed.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Partial ER was pre-released. Full ER and guidance on 4/22. But ya, some of the hype was already priced in this past week. The SP might dip a bit to around $17-$18, but with today's jobs report and yesterday's ISM report, chances are outlook for CLF will be positive."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s rough dude. Sold stuff through eBay for a long time. Got fucked over by two buyers in one week.

Finally got another person and they said ok we got you. Let me get your refund started. I’m gonna transfer you to our escalation specialist so they can finish it. It was the SAME LADY and she told me NO AGAIN even after the last agent said he was gonna refund me. I lost it. Never again.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"its okay, we all just apes trying our best. That is probably true though in regards to capital. I guess only time will tell, until then im gunna just buy and HODL cuz idk what else to do with all my nanners.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah. I was curious as to if there was a unexpected catalyst which could see a big jump in the current trading price since you commented on it being a Top Pick. So, nothing out of the ordinary growth then."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yah, don't have any unexpected catalyst for you if we disregard higher than expected hiring data. 

Except for maybe TSLA, I don't see any unexpected catalysts for OP's top picks either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure, TSLA and GME. Didn’t see anything yet about the others. Just asked about it since you mentioned it and thought I should look into it for some unusual options activity on when there may be a surge of buying."

It has just been a month of pain... down 15k. I know it can run up fast though and if they get more institutional investment things will ramp fast. I also think the GME mania will be good for signups in Q1.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What exactly is PLTR working on AWS?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok - so here's what this may mean for PLTR stock.

When a company announces they partner with AWS, it means 1 of 2 things:

1 - they are going to host their product on AWS. Contractually this means that they are signing up multi year contract to spend x number of $$$ for a period of time on the platform, typically called an EDP (enterprise discount program). These EDPs can be very custom, and can include free consulting, credits to offset their eventual bill, and other offers along with a certain negotiated discount off of any aws service monthly. Depending on the size of the contract this discount could well be into 20% or more off. I've seen credits easily mid 7 figures before. This contract essentially says - you will spend this much money and at the end of the term or at annual periods in the contract if you have not spent, you get a bill for the difference. And also depending on accounting rules - this contract could be considered Capex.

Minimum eligible spend to be able to get an EDP? 500k a year (used to be $1M until recently). Think about how many companies use AWS and would hit this threshold....alot. aws reps also get paid on signing EDPs, so they love them too.

2 - they are going to sell their product on the aws marketplace. The marketplace and having ISVs (which PLTR would be in this case) is relatively new, like within the last 2 years. Only recently (last few months) aws has allowed professional services - not specifically tied to a product offering on the marketplace, to also be sold. The sale process for items on the marketplace can happen several different ways: user finds it and clicks buy, ISV directs customers who come through other sales channels to buy on  AWS (I've seen some offer discounts to do so), or Marketplace specific ISV reps go and specifically sell the product to aws customers and partners (these reps make no money unless someone buys the product). Aws essentially is turning into a software and services disti (comparable distis include SHI, techdata, arrow, cdw).


Now - based on the 5 seconds I used ducksduckgo (fuck google) before I started typing this post up, my hunch is the article is referencing PLTR going the way of my #2 meaning. They would be dumb if they were also not under an EDP too though.


How are #1 and #2 related?

Let's say I'm a company who has an EDP, and I didn't know what I was doing when I made the initial commitment and I'm projecting to come up short at the end of my next EDP term. There are a couple ways to fill the gap without spinning up EC2 instances for fun - one of them is spending money on the marketplace (product, professional services). 50% of the value of these spends count against the commitment of an EDP. So, if you are projecting a 50k shortfall on your EDP term - you could spend 100k on the marketplace to cover it and avoid the 50k bill from aws (for nothing). 

That said - companies are moving alot of their transactions to the aws marketplace because of this EDP benefit. Ideally you don't suck and take into account marketplace spend in your analysis for your EDP spend, but alot of companies dont.


What does this all mean for PLTR stock?

Nothing yet. However there are some future indicators to look out for:

Job postings for Marketplace ISV positions, specifically in the ERP space.

PLTR showing up at an aws event in the future (summits or specifically reInvent)

Announcements of large companies entering agreements to buy/use PLTR who also use AWS

PLTR Announcing professional services/consulting 

PLTR professional services/consulting offers on the marketplace


If one or more of the above happen, it should increase the share value of the stock.

I write this long post as someone who pretty much doesn't own stock (fidelity just puts my money places), doesn't hold any PLTR, and used to negotiate EDPs and was employed by an early adopter of the aws marketplace.

BTW- contino is far from what I'd consider reputable in the sense of using it for any DD. Lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So wait is AWS partnership with PLTR a new deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such brilliant move by PLTR , springboard from government clients to global enterprise Via AWS ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like PLTR for the long-term benefits of integrating with a giant like AWS. I have built systems on AWS for almost a decade now.

My only concern with PLTR is that it's still overvalued today.  Maybe if we could get some real-time demos on PLTR tech I could change my mind short-term."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good DD other than it all being useless and not having a clue how AWS works, yes AWS is big and used by many companies. But what is the announcement about? They are just offering their solution to AWS users in an AWS optimized way, it is not becoming a core AWS service. Go to AWS Marketplace and you can find thousands of AWS optimized solutions by many companies that want you to integrate their product with your cloud solution and that are created in collaboration with AWS teams. This is like saying just because somebody posts their sudoku app on a Google/Apple store they have a a potential to make billions as app marketplaces are so widely used and bringing in so much revenue."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So puts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a good pitch for AWS, but can't find that ticker. I guess I'll just buy AWSL, has Solar in the name."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What does PLTR actually do?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The information is misleading. You can buy one PLTR module on AWS, it's not an integrated partnership. Even if your company is an AWS shop, the full suite of products aren't available. There's no simple conversion or integration."

next is on PLTR  on azure ? Alibaba cloud ? Google cloud?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"42B Market Cap. to give you an idea that is almost X2 the value of VIAC with revenues of 25B compared to PLTRs 1B.

I don't think you need the smooth brains to figure out PLTR is all speculation, marketing, and spectacle right now.

give it 5 years and we'll see how well these comments age."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, what's the day? do you have to be registered?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How do you know this?

AWS wouldn’t offer PLTR if it isn’t a seamless client experience."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry if it sounds arrogant but reading the topic as somebody who works with AWS daily and has gone through some of their certifications it makes me cringe badly how severely you are misinterpreting what has been announced so far and what that means for PLTR. I like PLTR and I've held it for quite some time I think they have some amazing talent with some throat cutting hiring procedures to take only the best. But that does not change the fact that they will be one of thousands of vendors to offer their product for easy integration and licensing in AWS and taking it as some major milestone and they capturing 5% of AWS customers is beyond silly
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"what is that, internet for ants?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ERP...likely expanding to other data intensive applications...Finance, Marketing, Industrial Design, Production"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"bruh compare PLTR to other SAAS companies, not a media conglomerate lmao."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait wait. Viac as in viacom?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would you compare two companies in two entirely different industries to prove your point?  Tech and growth companies tend to get higher valuations than a media company that has existed in some form or fashion since 1952.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And snowflake has been consistently trading at 200x+ TTM. These numbers mean nothing. If I’m honest, Palantir should trade at a higher premium than snowflake."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m not sure about registering but it’s April 14
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://palantir.events/doubleclick

yes you need to register"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'll add that I am bullish on PLTR for their ability to win government data science contracts consistently and their partnership with IBM. A lot of companies use IBM consultants to advise on purchasing decisions and they clearly have some secret sauce that wins over government contracts that I don't have insight to.  


I should clarify that I'm not an IBM employee either."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I work in the industry and have seen a PLTR demo while consulting for a customer. I am not a PLTR employee so this information may not be 100% accurate. How familiar are you with AWS and their offerings? My understanding is that:

  
PLTR is an AWS partner and uses AWS hardware for Foundry, but that is still purchased directly through PLTR and not instantiable in a private AWS instance

PLTR does have an S3 based ERP offering you can stand up on AWS. That's the extent of the partnership.

If you're an existing AWS customer, there's no new change to the adoption cost for palantir for anything other than ERP."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I also work with as quite a bit. Came here to find someone like you speaking some sense.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know business development.

This seems like a smart way to turbocharge PLTR’s Business Development Pipeline.

I don’t think this will drive revenue in 2021...but I’m still in PLTR 🐷💎🖐."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To oversimplify things, you pay to use Amazon's servers. They maintain the servers and you just worry about the software that you need to run on them. It's often cheaper than running your own data center."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m all for hearing counter arguments, but that did seem like an extra smooth brained comparison."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Palantir does exactly what snowflake does ++++ both are tech, both are growth. Why shouldn’t they be compared?

Edit: I’m slightly retarded disregard this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I looked at a very similar company, Glencore, which is worth £38b on £142b in revenue, so on this basis PLTR should be worth $270m and my price target is $0.15. I have bought puts accordingly.

/sarcasm"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"PLTR was DPO so wallstreet is spreading hate and FUD meanwhile SNOW is okay at this valuation? Such bullshit and that's why I am long on PLTR, it's about time for it to explode to the moon ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may work in the industry and have AWS insights.

But, this is about a Business Development pipeline.

I know business development...and this is exactly how you turn prospects into long-term clients."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,u talk good for an ant
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow you're right! VIAC and PLTR have been very volatile recently therefore they must deserve to trade at exactly the same revenue multiples. Margins they earn and expected CAGR be damned!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""a little bit"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Considering Palantir is a monopoly and trading at 40x TTM. While any college dropout can do what snowflake does and it’s trading at a mind numbing 220x TTM I would assume [Wyckoff’s thesis is true for Palantir ](https://financialpost.com/investing/the-secret-trading-strategy-from-the-1930s-that-hedge-funders-dont-want-you-to-know-about)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"💯

Wall St definitely hates any company that doesn’t pay tribute."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for sharing that. I understood that concept in principle but that article really spells it out.

So you're proposing we're being played down between 27 and 21. Eventually it'll jump up (too high) and down to some level above 27 while they play both sides.

I'll be on the lookout, thanks"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubled down on VIAC yesterday.

25 x 4/16 85c (-3000)

15 x 4/16 45c (-850)

The 85c is leftover buys from credit spreads I was doing on the way to the basement.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,VIAC is my top play right now but I am selling calls and puts with the stock until the selling is done. It should go at least into the 50's after that.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yo if you have any other yolos let us boys know. I lost all my money (50k) on gme calls that went south. I need a yolo with the pennies I have left to pay taxes lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got VIAC call too. It better rebounce like Discovery!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm all in on viacom too, but I'm not ballsy enough to go in on options. I think the stock price will eventually return to the $100/share levels, but it'll probably take months to get there based on the rate of growth for the share price in the last 6 months. I'm not expecting a quick pop. I think the stock price has reached its floor, +/- $4, so it'll start to renormalize to previous levels over time. The theta decay for short term options may not be good for a longer term payout...  


What am I missing that you guys see? Why aim for a 4/16 expiration date?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s so weird to see a yolo Viacom post
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares man or ITM or slightly OTM calls(that have good chance of becoming ITM)! This helps the stock

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think its news cause a mainstream reporter helped with insider trading. They should do a congressional hearing on this instead of picking on regular apes trying to make some tendies on GME.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I drove for 12 hours and made it to the hotel just around market open on Thursday. I was so tired, I didn’t care if I lost a little from the contracts being sold at a random time so I just went to bed. Woke up around 4 pm EST and realized I accidentally YOLO’d $37,000 which is not what I wanted to do even though I fully support the stock and the future it has. This is not “fuck you money” that I intended to play with..

But I guess I’m the newest ape waiting to get some nanners from those bitch hedge funds. 

**GME to the moon** 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: Alright, I was already planning to transfer my Robin Hood account to Fidelity but was worried about some Robin Hood fuckery while I have open positions. But a lot of you brought up the point that I’m risking even more fuckery by staying with them. So I’m looking at how to transfer my account right now. Fuck Robin Hood, they deserve jail time. So do the Hedgies. 

Now, as much as I love receiving your free Reddit rewards let’s not spend any actual greenbacks in celebration of my stupidity. Spend it on something more worthwhile like shares or options. Let’s earn some real money here. Not financial advice, I just slipped and fell in a stock I like.

Edit 2: Transfer request complete. Puts on Robin Hood after their IPO. They can rot in hell."

I sold a $75 put when GME was $300.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry u lost the intrinsic value on the contracts!! You will really like this stock 🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the most organic transformation to Ape that I’ve ever seen. Can’t wait for his final form.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,exercising options is the recipe for gamma squeeeeeze.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,May the odds be ever in your favor??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GOOD JOB!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"congratulations sir, how do you feel?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I may have sold you one of those 185's. Treat'em well!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Still a win in my book
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For those too retarded to understand options... pls explain
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,the universe is clearly sending you messages here my friend now hold tight to your tendies and never let go
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably not the worst thing that could of happened to you lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought Robinhood would sell your option on the last day? Or I guess if your ahead they sell instead? Or they only sell if you don’t have enough $ to exercise?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unbeknownst baller status. That’s the real real
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No sell. Only buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A mistake with a big payout
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have 150 shares at average 140 and you by far have the better deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a good deal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, much like my birth this is a ""happy accident"".."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You gon be rich
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 60 days

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You truly belong here
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You sir are the epitome of retard. Many loves ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don’t worry, will be here when you post your gain porn 🦍💪🏻🙌🏻💎"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah whoops....why on earth would you want more 🍌
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just when I thought you couldn’t get any dumber, you go and do something like this........AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!!! 🦍🍌🦍🍌🦍🍌"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally, a screenshot with the battery fully charged!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are only closer to being an apeillionaire, don’t worry!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even when you don’t want to buy and hold, you still buy and hold"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I see this as an absolute win
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome aboard retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, you've already made money!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything under 200 is a bargain.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I could have afford to forget I have $40K of cash in my account too @.@. THis is the way!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So big dumb stupid ape here. They expired and robinhood automatically made you close them with funds you had available? Is that just how it works? I'm dumb but I thought options expired and thats that. What would happen if you didn't have the money?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Next you’re gonna trip and fall into some 10/10 pussy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I have 5k, and I’m extremely confident a stock will show significant gains by EOY, can I buy options in that stock that will either make a Dick load of money or lose my 5k if it doesn’t work?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We’re all learning... it’s fine. 

Ok we’re not learning, but that’s also fine."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re average cost is still less than mine daddy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Better than the guy the other day who accidentally bought $4m of SPY on margin by forgetting to sell/cancel his calls that were barely in the money.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cool I don’t know shit about options, but I swear I read a highly upvoted comment that basically says you have the option to buy the shares, but you don’t have to, so if you don’t buy them the contract just goes away. Does it always just forces an exercise for buy/sell the shares at the end?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,*Oops*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oops 😁
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"same here bruh..

my afternoon naps have saved my ass more than once... not to mention ....my naps have also been more than once had me waking up to me dancing like a school girl lol. One might say that my afternoon naps are goodluck ...lol

we do weird shit when we'r sleepy lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"200 shares, if you sell them for a million each, you’ll have a trillion dollars!!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's like saying,  I just tripped and my d**k happened to find it's way into that woman....🚀✋💎"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Week done!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like a good problem to have.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What was the cost of the premiums?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Silverback ape! 🦍
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oof
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nothing wrong with that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Whaaaaaaaaaaat?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way 😂😂😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I read it backwards and was like--how did you get 185 shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope you make some tendies, cuz when your wifes boyfriend finds out ,  The only ass your touching is going to be purchased upfront"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hate when that happens
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Help, I just accidentally a GameStop"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re in, I’m in"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Test
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a great deal for you even if it was a mistake?  You are deep ITM
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lol I'd now start selling CCs against them. morons will practically donate the shit to you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Guh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can we do an off exchange trade like the hedgie fuckers?  I will buy some offa  u at this price;)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yall really have been on WSB for less than 2 months huh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They would be exercised anyway if you had a real broker, and you would merely be on warned about a regulation T until you sell the shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been selling covered calls and puts and it’s been earning me several Gs these past months. I used to own 100 shares at $40
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just a smooth brain but I’d at least cover up your positions. They are collecting this shit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe if you call Robinhood they will be cool about it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the group GME.. So u sold out contract earlier?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It will all be worth it when GME crosses $200 and you make a FAT $3000 profit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry to hear that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You had the funds to exercise?  Clearly you are new to options trading. You will learn, just give it time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ey bro, what's your number? My wife keeps fucking nagging me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh wow what would happen if you had insufficient funds to exercise them?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The classic Bart Simpson head pattern
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The benefits of not being that wealthy yet. My broke ass would have had them auto sell lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oof. Dw, Ill take them if you don't want them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You're lucky as fuck it didn't close below 185 🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations. 200 tickets to the moon.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now sell calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,HODL!!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is something like $1500 ""fuck you"" money if I literally could have burned it and not cared...too much. Is that how it works or does it need to be a certain amount?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cries in one share.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong sub, going to be down voted... but this is a good opportunity to sell calls!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,can we hang out or something maybe I can just like do your laundry as you go about your business?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Accidentally one of us
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s ok.    Will be 485$ soon.    Retard.   🙌💎
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Sweeeet""...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Technically speaking, if you let your option contract expire without funds to exercise, you have not met the requirements to fulfill the contract, and the broker defaults on filling your contract."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Boo hoo"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Even the computer likes the stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You probably lucked out with that bungle.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here! Also...you’ll look back at this as an amazing event to have happened
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the Ape-est thing I've ever read. Congrats OP.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean you forgot lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you can get about $2k/week writing weekly covered calls around your basis of 205
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Task failed successfully?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to theta gang. Juicy premiums to be made.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your subconscious ape brain knocked itself out so your paper hands couldn’t sell, truly a smooth ape brain 6 head move"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice price though
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Jokes on them 😂

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ONE OF US
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Casually made 3.5% gain in one day by simply forgetting. Respect.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome 🙏 ape since Jan 14th
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many shares of GME are you holding?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do ppl say hodl instead of hold? I’ve missed that point entirely. Also YOLO LIFE BRUH hold!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"so this is what happens when an option expires, good to know"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Best mistake ever!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait what’s the point of the option if you exercise it and have to pay the strike price? Am intarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You say that like it’s a bad thing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell calls on half and let the other half ride.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls and get that cost basis down to 0 😄
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dam
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very nice. If only you used a broker that actually purchased the shares so the stock price would reflect it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tfw your wife dumps her bf for this guy (feels good tbh)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Happy accident if I ever saw one
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He accidentally the whole thing...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," you'll most likely be able to sell a deep ITM call to cash out, don't sweat it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m so sad I don’t understand this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Either you got a ticket to the moon, or you wind up with a lot of losses to offset future gains. 

Good job!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for doing your part


Edit: good smooth brain moves you have"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dope!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I had this happen last week with some NOK  calls i had. Didnt lose any money but i was scratching my head wondering why i had 400 shares lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t sell!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is like reverse pin risk..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,my 1. 185.00 share purchase appreciates you...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually at market average you are doing pretty damn good

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"“I didn’t realize my contracts would be exercised but just happen to have $37,000 available in cash” classic"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just jump in pre market and off them, you’ll do ok"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have one contract 100 4/16 and I’m considering exercising but have little ways to go yet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Barley a yolo, 94.76% smh"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Christ almighty! I wish i had nearly $40,000 just sitting around"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here. Pull up a chair and enjoy some 🖍s the blue ones taste like purple.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck robinhood with a capital FUCK 🖕

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be worse. Far worse. Hold.

💎

🤌"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job, retard. 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Correct me if I’m wrong, but even if the stock moves up just a little bit after exercising you make more profit than selling the contracts back at close."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bruh you have 37k in an investment acct, betting on the GUARANTEED play. Don't trip you're gonna be rich af if you aren't already."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you're up why not just sale some off if you're not willing to risk that amount. Don't be peer pressure to hold for no reason.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now get out of RH and move to a real broker.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Total noob here, can I ask what app you use to trade or what broker is the best."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, now transfer out of RH so you actually have those shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LOLOL WHOOPS PRAY ITS 186 ON MONDAY
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,initiated my transfer out of robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dudes gonna sell next week. He didn’t plan on doing it. Just karma farming.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real atrocity here is that you have 30k in robin hood my friend.

If your trading 500$ worth go ahead use RH but if you got thousands in get a real broker better execution priority etc if your investing a decent amount its well worth having a real broker not rh who will limit you to selling or buying only when there hedge customers are getting railed by a squeeze etc

At the very least go with TD ameritrade there think and swim platform is good and miles ahead RH"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Congratulations, you're a billionaire 🍾"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you don’t really own any shares because you’re still on Robinhood for some reason
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood is no good.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Me stupid. What the hell happened
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Going YOLO on $GME is the safest and best YOLO you could and will ever make in your life.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you still using robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Now, just get them transfered out of rh so they count and make money on them !"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Considering its RH, it is highly likely you don't own the shares.  

I would move to Fidelity ASAP.  RH fucking with GME shares in more ways than one."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happened to Nokia
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,to the mooonnnnn
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So is this good or bad?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Best dumb mistake you ever made
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This makes me want to start investing in stocks. How do I do it?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ooooo baby
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way. Buy and hold.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"stop posting positions for GME

we all gave robinhood shit for selling our data but then we post it here for free?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can somebody explain how this happened to a newbie?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What a steal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Booo for using robinhood. They have been known to prevent these shares from mooning, should you decide to keep them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the club. The big penis club.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,STOP POSTING POSITIONS ugh.... python scripts running these threads and subs and giving hedgies knowledge. we all know they're fucked anyway but stop giving them information.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"But Robinhood tho.... 

That’s a no for me dawg"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you retards still on robinhood
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the millionaire family!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That tracks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha congrats ape with decent funds. How does it feel to be smooth brain like some of us smaller apes. Now we are all apes. Ape like ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,💎👐
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to start selling weekly covered calls for dumb otm strikes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question for you. Can I buy 4 call contracts at $200 of gme, wait till gme hits 1k, sell my 80 shares, than excercise my contracts with the 80k to have 400 shares?
Edit. Missed a 0"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Am still learning could someone please explain this to me. A guy buys a contract and guesses the price of the stock eg will be $185 (& pays for this) if he guesses right & wants to buy the stock what does he pay? Can’t be $185 each for the 100 shares as that’s normal value. What’s the plus side discount? Cheers
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So basically you're saying you had no intention of owning GME.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered puts and calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Serendipity, it seems..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"“Forgot” don’t lie to yourself man, you never knew"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Who cares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,#so you put non-FU money in RH?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How did you buy half a call?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I can use the “I accidentally fell in it” excuse properly now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Purposefully didn’t post yesterday because I didn’t want it to be mistaken for a joke.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape real fools
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape real fool
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All of you are missing the boat on the OTC stock of the year EEENF. If you guys put 1 share of GME into this you are going to make more money off of it in the short term and possibly even long term and then you can come back to GME. Take your blinders off!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Easy money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to r/thetagang
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Until the squeeze happens then you wish wouldn't have

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well.... that’s a nice way to slip into the moon and become an accidental millionaire.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This might be the greatest accident you ever make.  That and your wife.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I fully support the stock"" = only owns the shares he accidentally bought.

Well now you're stuck with us"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Immediately sell 2 covered calls on Monday for your strike price. Do it over and over until it gets exercised and pocket the premium
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be more kind to you, at least you got them at $185 and not $385. You could likely dump them at $200 first thing Monday before the weekly 100 point dip."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just accidentally made the best buy of your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll still never understand why someone with the capital to ‘yolo’ $37,000 is using Robinhood out of all trading platforms"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""This is not ""fuck you money i intend to play with""' 

Purchases GME contracts

Pick one 🦍🦍🦍🦍"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls against your shares to lower your costs basis. You're good.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,extremely new dumb ape here and this helped me understand what not to do with call options!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My, what big balls and diamond hands you have"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's meant to be..
🚀🚀🚀"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Smoothest of brains I’ve seen!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy negligently fucks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the stock goes down in the market open, we will know you sold"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re going to want to change this story around to make you a badass stonk god once your family is set for generations to come.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell covered calls against your newly owned shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love you, you fucking monkey"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's $191.64 right now.  You could unload at open; trouser $1300 and wait for a price you like better.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"OP it's meant to be !!! Now if you sell, the stock will moon the next day, if you hold, it'll stay same price for 3 more months"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I will not cast even a sliver of shade your direction should you decide to sell some shares & get back to a risk level you are comfortable at.

Until then, good luck, good humor, and godspeed with your unintentional YOLO! To paraphrase an Irish blessing, May the HFs always lose in your favor, and the $GME always rise to meet your feet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Accidental billionaire.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Accidentally became an absolute legend, we wont let you down ❤️"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now run a wheel on it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s just fucking casually
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the best accidental investment of your life. You’ve just made £200million, min."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Unintentional yolo is the way!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just start selling OTM weekly covered calls!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,now sell covered calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,👏 get 👏 off 👏 Robinhood 👏
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"HODL!

Welcome to the jungle fellow Ape."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welcome to the club mate
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn man.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats rtard!!  🎈🎈
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the best thing I've seen online this year and I've seen a lot of things in the last three months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wish I had 37,000 mistake dollars. I'd gladly mistake all 37,000 to the stonk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hero
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How much did you pay for the contracts??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wishing you 10x returns my fellow Ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep holding. It will be a happy accident soon enough.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I Love You Sir!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's the spirit!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get off Robinhood with contracts. They take so much commission compared to anyone else.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I laughed a lot! Thank you for that! I’m sure everything will be okay when you’re rich!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I accidentally bot 500 shares when it was 49 a share, and realized my mistake after the chart started clicking away...I was shocked my account had enough in it to let me fuck up like that. At that time , I just decided to yolo it and let it sit. Best decision I ever made. On Feb 24, I was happiest ape alive. Still holding , won't sell. But...I do have them with a real broker ..not RH"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can try to sell some weekly OTM options to recoup some of the premium you dished out... Just be mindful when you get cucked because the stock moves
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How can they force you to exercise? Did you Buy a Call? I thought it gave you the ""right"" not the ""obligation""?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a matter of interest, what were you saving the money for?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you my gfs bf?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't this just mean you exercised options worth 37k with 37k of cash and then owned 37k in shares?

What's the problem here? As far as I can tell you are in a more stable position now without the options and lost no value.

Am I missing something?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well you could se...... no actually we don’t do that round here 💎🙌
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t mean to be mean, but your story is confusing to say the least. You play with money that aren’t ’fuck you’ but you ~~spend it~~ gamble it on extremely expensive options of a VERY volatile stock, that you ‘support’, but would rather sell this stock that you support rather then own it. Yeah... you belong here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If/when this works you're going to be extremely rich. Good luck, to all of us apes!   💎🙌💎🙌💎"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mistakenly YOLO, best YOLO there is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you have failed options 101
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Paperhands and I will roast your parents on a spit. This is not financial advice... Unless you want it to be.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,5Ge is not 5G..... FYI
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"please explain to a stupid non-ape:  barring fees/commissions, wouldn't you realize the same amount of gains by immediately selling the stock after the exercise of the call if the stock doesn't fall in the meantime?  It was my understanding that ITM options  eventually would be exercised by someone, most people just don't bother and instead will sell the option itself for profit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Started as a hope to make some ""fuck you"" spending money... turned into ""fuck myself"" that cost a lot of money, but it comes with a ticket to ride. If you can afford it, the new game is to hold until share value eclipses the call gains you were looking at. If you believed in it enough to bet on it for short term gains the only thing that changed is the timeline until gains?  


If you can't afford to hold, at least you helped the stock by making your call writer buy 200 shares... I think I have no idea how this works (not trying to play up the dumb persona of the sub), I truly have no idea how options work and who is on the hook for your shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know this isn’t the way, but if this isn’t fuck you money, or it’s not an amount you’re comfortable losing, sell off your position or a portion of it. You’re still profiting. BUT if you are able to hold, diamond hands fellow ape 💎🙌🏼"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there a way you could reverse this mistake if you absolutely needed to?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’ll be happy once these shares are $37,000 each"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No more using this term plz. I dont wanna be a partypooper but its ammo for the media to screw us. Even though we use it in another way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you 👍
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got my comment removed and got a ""anti hate warning"" from admins for using the same word you just did in the same subreddit???

Wtf are the rules do I have to use the word ape too or did I not have enough 💎👋 emojis? Lmao"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What are you gonna do with it?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I were looking for a word to describe call prices on GME, ""low"" would not be at the top of my list."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I started with $4.5k mid November 2020 and was fortunate/lucky enough to make around $60-70k in three months. That’s why it’s just sitting there, and this is not money I want to be playing with."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I try and have 10% of my mortgage in cash just in case of emergencies. I also try and have one year of dividend income from my yielding portfolio which I keep as a ‘in case of global pandemic and dividends stop being issued, break glass’ fund. So this amounts to about 60k. It took a lot of work but I’m glad I’ve got it set up since I no longer really have to worry. 

Plus I can dip into the dividend fund for fun plays, like GME."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"“I didn’t want to be born with this massive dong, but there it is. Help me roll it back up.”"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you sell a put when the stock was at/around a peak?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And now you have enough to turn around and sell weekly covered calls on those babies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Once that happened to me when I was in a highway rest stop. Luckily I didn’t not get turbo AIDS, but I was not very excited in that moment."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I averaged down to $256, you are welcome Ape-holes! There is no way algorithms and hedges could possibly understand this Stock with all this apes trading GME.  💎🙌 best option"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But his premium pad was close to $20/share. His effective cost is closer to $205 but still not a horrible place to be
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you 🚀💎
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the app
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because this is RH, I doubt he actually owns those shares"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the easiest way to transfer?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I just started my transfer yesterday from RH to Fidelity. Holding my jacked tits for a week or so.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's 'could have', never 'could of'.

Rejoice, for you have been blessed by CouldWouldShouldBot!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Around $4k for the both
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hi
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would have sold my contracts for whatever price, would have been a loss of about $2k I think"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"From as early as I saw, someone bought a billboard for GME saying something like **”$GME 🚀HODL”** instead of ‘HOLD’"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes that's true. Believe it or not, contracts actually serve a purpose besides giving you leverage on their extrinsic value."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll be selling most of it Monday for sure, I believe in the squeeze but I can’t be playing with this much money haha."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fidelity or TD Ameritrade are good, don’t use RobinHood"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I await with my pinkies up in style
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, except you're going to need at least $20k to buy 4 200c"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not $37,000 worth"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Not at all](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/min4s7/i_forgot_my_contracts_would_be_exercised_instead/gt5hr7b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3), just haven’t transferred my account yet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,? I didn’t
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Watch out the water in the toilet bowl is cold
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DRE: Wait! What if there's a good explanation for this shit?

EMINEM: What? He tripped? Fell? Landed balls deep in $GME?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Flair
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That should be your new flair
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,nobody gets a huge penis on purpose.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just when I thought you couldn’t get any dumber, you go and do something like this......AND TOTALLY REDEEM YOURSELF!!!!🦍🍌🦍🍌"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape can read the mod warnings!  Wrinkles there:)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The only joke is that you have >30k in a Robinhood account. Get a real broker
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You act like this is a bad thing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh good, now you won't be mistaken!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,how much did it cost you initally
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His intended play was to hold onto the money as cash, so he is still less disappointed if the squeeze happens"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think my wife just found her new boyfriend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only guy to slip and fall in it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck. This comment floored me to hell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey you over there with the massive cock!! Your a beast!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This guy Fucks...**by accident!!!**

 😆👏💎🚀🌚"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""oh, hey, you are cute. Oh, yo, wtf..., you put my dick in you. Guess I'll just leave it there."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bahahahhhahahaha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A fucksident if you will
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whoops, you just Blew your load inside. Make sure you Take care of that baby."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Accidentally autisticly fucks 🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""I swear, officer, it was an accident!

I slipped and fell, and as I was hurtling towards the ground, my pants came undone and my fully-erect penis tunneled its way out. Upon impact, my throbbing member thrust itself directly into her gaping wet vagina, with neither warning nor deliberation."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this comment.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He slipped and fell dick first into an open pussy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what my wife said when I first found out about her boyfriend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They just slipped and fell on my dick....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I once accidentally tripped and fell into a whorehouse in Terlingua, Mexico... I’m not saying it was the best mistake, but I’m not saying it’s the worst...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've actually done this and there is literature on the matter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much haha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Or are we stuck with him?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's gamestop, not best buy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve explained why I haven’t transferred yet in a couple other comments, but basically I have positions open and don’t want RH fucking me on my way out somehow."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,muh free trades
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen if you are extremely new to calls it's extremely unlikely your account will have $38k of pocket change to cover contracts you forgot about lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re welcome 👍
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, he's definitely helped someone make that. It's just not him."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wut
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Once I can close out of my longer positions I’ll be transferring everything to my Fidelity account. Didn’t want to run into the troubles other people were reporting trying to transfer out.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,About $4k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Starting a business.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"[Started with 4.5k](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/min4s7/i_forgot_my_contracts_would_be_exercised_instead/gt5hr7b/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) and made it to the point I’m at now. Also, I don’t need to have skin in the game to support it. But I’m in it now, so."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They bought two call options, for a total of $4,000. At market close, the option value would have been about $13,000. Now their exposure to GME is $40,000. 

$4,000 may be ""fuck you"" money but depending on the size of their portfolio, adding a zero could be a problem."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just said sell and I will murder your parents.  This seems like a great thing to have on record.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Markets closed before he noticed.  He could sell Monday at open if he wanted though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, he can sell the shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It might still be within the timeframe to request a 30 day refund.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I am but a humble retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I highly doubt it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gorillianare is perfect wdym. We donated to a gorilla fund its pretty self-explanatory
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Would honestly be hilarious to see grown men and women say gorilianaire on tv. It stays
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gonna be a great story for the grand apes, we are millionaires because it was a short week and I was tired"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe more 🍌 emojis needed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait... since when can I not call someone  a retard on wsb? It's a huge part of our culture...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Reporting a comment as hate will get it automatically removed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd get a bunch of desperately needed dental work done personally..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well if I had it of course it would be GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job! What plays did you make to go from $4.5K to $60K in the 3 months? Can you share, pls? Thanks"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You could just sell first thing monday and get your money back (and maybe some more). I wouldn't sweat about losing it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,leave RH now!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My thought it was free money. Premiums were insane. No way it would go back down to $75.

But if it did go down $75 isn’t a bad entry anyway."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he though $75 was a good price and he's willing to buy at that price, selling a put lets him lower his cost basis or pocket a premium. Premiums on GME puts were insane around then so not a bad strategy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,>didn't not get Turbo AIDS
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you not learned that a double negative makes an HIV positive?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,😆😆😆😆😆turbo aids!!😆😆😆😆
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is what everyone is missing, it shows he in the positive but that doesnt take into account the premium he has already paid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Welp, time to average down on those morning dips! 💁"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you initiated through fidelity instead of rH the transfer will be faster
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh thank you! It was actually more of a legitimate question for my personal knowledge lol. So you can go negative in your balance but it'll still execute and you do have ownership of the shares and can sell them to bring the account back to positive? I'm a dumb ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, not that I know anything about it personally, but rumor has it if you don’t sell back your options you can actually make more money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At least you still make a good profit. I don’t know enough to mess around with options yet but exercising them should be worth more than the contracts themselves right?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha. Appreciate you giving me a wrinkle.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nvmd see the 200. Don’t know where I thought I saw 50
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not mine I ran the hot water to the toilet on accident.  Though it feels much better when it splashes my butthole now.  No more puckering every flush.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not once you get past the first bend in the pipe, then it warms up"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And deep...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DRE: Alright Shady, maybe he's right Finite, but think about the HF men before you get all crazy

EMINEM: Okay! Thought about it, still wanna hodl them?  Grab the HFs by their nuts, trip their short shares and diamond-hand them? 

EMINEM: That's what I did, be smart, don't be a retard. You gonna take financial advice from somebody who went down with Enron?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would carry that flair with pride
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir those are my testicles
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, sir. His brain is as smooth as glass."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Although this is true. Every share counts right? Let him have this win! APE shall not kill APE.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No only 30k, but 30k cash. Op knew damn well that his options would execute if itm"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like Robinhood a commission free options though. I can get like $10/15 per option and I don't feel like option fees are killing me every week.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To what? Day trade?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That. 

Is not the way."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well now, when he transfers RH actually has to buy the shares to move them to the new broker."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RH is easy to use APE use rh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Entirely by accident!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He slipped, he tripped, his dick went into your wife?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"*It was an accident, right? You tripped, slipped on the floor and accidentally stuck your dick in my wife.*"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm in the same boat. I'll wait until gme settles down and hope to the old gods and the new that robinhood doesn't fuck me if/when there is a squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can keep your dead robinhood account after transfer, it'll show your trade histroy and cost basis still.  Then you can manually punch them in Fidelity.

You can also keep a list on robinhood too, if you are attached to the app.  I switched to Fidelity, love their desktop app and can tolerate the android app."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’re just gonna fuck you while you’re still in, so lose lose"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like they fucked you on the way in
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good on ya for taking one for the team. ;)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What did you pay for the calls?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take your time, shit is volatile and you don't want to miss out on gains. I set up options level two and added cash prior to transferring to Fidelity and they took it all. Thank you for voting with your wallet. Fuck Robinhood"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now you have a new position you might not want to close out
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"sorry i'm dumb. so did you pay $4k for $37k worth of GME, or did you pay an additional $4k (for..?) and then buy $37k worth of GME?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty sure the SEC frowns on that sort of thing.  And the FBI, for that matter."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Metaphorically speaking, of course!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ahh, thanks. so all he's really worried about is something funky happening with the price over the weekend?     
Edit: I'm gonna say it because it's not my money:  What could go wrong in 72 hours?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhh, the 30-day refund . . ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sad to see how far this community has fallen (in the 2 months I've been here 🤡🤡🤡)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,New car and pay off student loans. I’d maybe even have 1-2k left to invest back.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well timed Apple, Tesla, and GME call options. Usually slightly OTM weeklies except for the Apple call which was a month long contract."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I’m considering my options, although now that I have the shares I will likely hold some."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I am happy it worked out for you on this one; be careful chasing premiums though. Have fun and have a good weekend!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I agree but he didn’t want to be assigned
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,oh fuck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That I did.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't believe you, they accidentally did this for my bathroom at one point and the mold/fungus/whatever that starts building up on the inside sides when it's warm in there is *awful*. Closing the lid is basically creating the perfect environment for it.

0/10, the warmer toilet seat was not worth it 👎"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That must make for some steamy stinky shits
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Flush 1 purges the cold water from the pipe, 2 fills the tank with hot water, and 3 dumps it in the bowl. Are you triple flushing *before* you shit or what?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is a Wendy's. Put them away."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not kill, but definitely throw poo at..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Robinhood don't even own the shares soo
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,When you buy shares on Robinhood you never physically own your shares. They do. Get your money out ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe it's 78 I believe that now is the appropriate time to throw poop

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there any way in which you say that to a dude doing poorly and the other person doesn't assume you're their friend?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"when I am President, I will allow a step-up in basis when you change brokerages!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Happened to me. On TD it looks like the transferred shares were free
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Around $4k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Funny. I love em. From experience not hearing fucky fuck things about them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paid $4K for options. 

Executed the options by mistake and paid $37k for 200 shares. 

His 200 shares are up $1.3k, but he’s still overall down $2.7k cause the options cost him $4k. Ergo his GameStop shares have to be worth a total of $41k to break even, or a share price of $205. 

So he’ll roughly make $215 a share when he cashes out at $420 per share, cause he’s no paper handed little bitch.

Edit: easier way of putting it- he’s $41k invested but currently it’s only worth $38k."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you not seen what happens in AH on GME?

I could literally drop or gain 40% by Monday. It's incredibly finicky."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market was hot and you capitalized, good work. Solid choices"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude sell some CCs way OTM weeklies for these expensive ass premiums. Risk them getting exercised when it actually moons, but this seems to be within your risk tolerance profiled above"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You could also sell contracts for some sweet premiums.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Could just sell what money you put in and let the profits ride out on their own if you really wanna be safe. Your average is still lower than mine and ive been holding since the first week of January so 🤷‍♂️
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">considering my options

nice. it's ironic considering you not considering them got you into this place, and a decent pun, and i think unintentional as well. 

very nice. this comment is the 69 of comments in this thread."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well any time you buy a put you know there's a chance you're going to get assigned whether you want to or not
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, never thought of that. Gross"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,mmm hot poo water
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You think this ape closes the lid!?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you not clean your toilet? Like dafuq man. Clean your bathroom once a week you weirdo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And the tank and bowl would be all sweaty
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Everything makes so much more sense now.  But it is very cold here and it also keeps the toilet from sweating.  Although now my ass sweats a little more.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The casino around the corner has no policies regarding testicular display
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn't that a sign of affection?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No kill, only wound or maime"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man. I just made a simple Planet of The Apes reference. I’m about to eat this Potbelly’s. I’ll let you guys duke it out over the semantics. APE SHALL NOT KILL APE.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why do you say this?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait so if I’m using something like SoFi what does that mean? I don’t own my shares?😐 like if it were to hit 50k per share I wouldn’t be able to sell? Cause if that’s not the case then I aint worried
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah like everyone else i think hes more concerned with making money. Robinhood does have that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I do not use Robinhood any longer thankfully, it has been awhile. I just refuse to bash another Ape for using that platform without at least giving them the courtesy of an explanation. We all agree that Robinhood isn’t the best(fucking sucks), but It’s up to us to show them the way with out pushing them away. Dig?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just put ur cash/stocks somewhere like Webull. Its a Chinese company but hey its more trustworthy than RH right!?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fidelity is garbage
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Etrade lends shares out and doesnt tell me. Whats the difference theyre ALL doing these “shady” practices. Dont think theyre not. RH is no diff than any other brokerage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He suuuure does. Look at him go!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or take it out, I don’t care; but please stop moving it *like that*."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My favorite pickup line is ""AYO GURR! WHATCHO BOOTYHOLE LOOK LIKE?"" Screamed across the room."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Parasomnia is the result of your brain being caught between sleep stages. This in-between phase may make you act like you're awake when you're still asleep. People with sexsomnia experience sleep-related sexual behavior. These behaviors range from masturbation to sexual intercourse.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,One time I woke up in a cramped room with my dick in my hand to the sound of my dad screaming. That's when I found out that I could walk *and* piss in my sleep.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been on the other side of this. Felt bad tbh! Like, sorry, I legit thought you were conscious and consenting...?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My last GF said I constantly reach over to play with her in the middle of the night. 

I didn't believe her and asked why she never wakes me up. 
She said she has but I always just go straight back to sleep. 

So I told her to make sure I don't go back to sleep. Finally she got me to stay awake and not only did I remember that time I remembered a few seconds leading upto the moment she woke me up. I was wondering how my hands found her goodies if I was asleep. I could see in my mind where she was without looking. Like I was aware of her orientation in space. Almost like psychic but probably more like a memory. 

I've kicked and punched girlfriends in my sleep thinking that I was in a fight with someone as well as kicking and punching walls. I have had a few other girlfriends and even my ex wife said I grope them in my sleep and I have even had a couple one night stands accuse me of knowingly groping them in THIER sleep. My policy now is to just warn any women sleeping in my bed of the inherent risks of either getting randomly groped, kicked or punched in the middle of the night."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, if two people who both have this condition have sleep sex who is the one that raped the other? We need to ask the humanities majors..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The guy you were “sleep” fucking confused?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check the actual webpage for the cost basis. 
They'll stay at zero forever on thinkorswim, even after i transferred from fidelity, and you'll have to contact customer service to sync the prices (TOS customer service,  through the in app chat thing basically, not ameritrade customer service), but at least if they prices show up in your account on td ameritrade then you'll be good for tax purposes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,thanks so much for explaining!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He could gain even more!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re welcome, and same for you!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucky you have two lots. Sell ccs on one and hodl the other.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Listen to this guy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The premium for even the April 16 300 is $615/contract 🤤
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You do mean selling the put correct? Comment OP admitted he was chasing premiums. The reason I asked my question is because put premiums are often the lowest when price is at a peak
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't clean it every few hours, no.

....do you?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We also have full ownership of that casino
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Grunt. Fling poop. Then eat banana. Do again.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape see Ape do
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"APE NOT KILL APE

but RH shares might not help ape..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Say what? That they don't own your shares? Maybe because they do CFD trading
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their app design is, not them, themselves"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh.  That's a Tuesday over here.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But what are the odds both my wife And her new boyfriend both have the same affliction?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I woke up one night while jerking off in a fridge
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Had my fiancee inarguably initiate foreplay, and the next day she mentioned that it was me who started it. She definitely did it while half asleep."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make the question two lesbians, otherwise it's too easy for the resulting mental short circuit to be resolved with ""the man because men bad."" (for a straight pair) or ""whoever pitched"" (for 2 gay men)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Awesome, thanks!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No worries at all, glad I could help. The math behind options tends to confuse cause the true cost per share here was: 

Price per contract (option) plus cost of shares at contract price. 

Ergo- each contract cost about $20. It allowed him to purchase shares at $185. Thereby break even is $205 per share. 

However, Robinhood and other platforms won’t factor the option price into the cost basis, cause an option is its own commodity. 

Anybody else have input? I think I’m right but if I’m not I invite elaboration :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,holy shit this is going to make you so much money and will be a LEGENDARY story for your family for generations!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your portfolio balance is probs higher than mine
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually I'd consider buying at that price.. i was watchin the 4/16 $290 right around when the stock jumped down to $150. It was around $600 and later that day $2.4k or something stupid (I was like 10min late on taking the shot). That call will be $2k the second we get any big movement, which at this point could be literally any day"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would I clean your toilet, let alone every few hours?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"uh, yeah? I mean I clean out my bathroom at least like, twice a day. Once after I have my coffee and once before bed."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the type of stuff that makes people paper hand. I didn’t mean for any friction or animosity. How do we know this Ape didn’t start trading days ago? Yes, Robinhood is dookie, but let’s explain these things rationally instead of “throwing poop” or simply ridiculing beginners. Best of luck though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,CFD trading isn’t allowed in The US.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,agreed

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm hurt, why won't you clean my toilet bb?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whenever my bathroom gets too dirty I just throw it out and get a new one.

I'm riiiiich, bitch."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not day, hours.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Any major words of wisdom? I bought 100 UWMC & BB throught previous plays and figured I'd start trying running the CC gang. Down 90% on OTM options, figured I'd try getting on the other side of the gang 😂"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The fumes from your gas powered shits?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, man! Literally! We can probably save the earth or do some other science shit with bacteria that moves that quick! At least solve some petri dish Sudoku or some shit!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If I'm honest some days it's only once. I make sure to eat more beans when that happens though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Grab her by the throat get your daughter kidnap her
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely always write/sell calls on your shares if possible but be okay with potentially losing them. You can even do an aggressive CC strategy where you choose a closer strike near at the money for quick in and out plays more short term. Or if you want to be safe do 2 standard deviations strike from current average. Consider writing puts too if you want to go for premium too but wouldn’t mind owning the stock. Thetagang won’t make wsb front page but it’ll get you consistent revenue if done decently. Both styles covered, I do not do naked calls/puts lol and I don’t buy calls/puts at the moment maybe in future"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I pretty much suck at picking these too. My only current play are jan/22 LEAPs on XOM.
2021-04-02 19:52:29,wallstreetbets,One of these days I will buy calls... ASO 🚀 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thetagang makes me horny... Well done sir.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Better to buy shares or options to help the squeeze?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk if I should buy $35 4/16 or $40 5/21 or both 🤔
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Reminder to everyone that we aren't even close to peak. Still a great play to jump in on now IMO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But already exited my calls I bought. I never hold those well. Just need more practice.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Curious and yea I can Google. But why do 60 calls and 3 puts. The hedge? What’s top line reason on this In ur opinion.  I’m a fairly new options trader so trying to absorb as much input from diff angles of strategies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought my calls 3 @ .316 4/16 30c and 10 shares @ 24.93 Wednesday morning after the sell off. I’m a doofus and didn’t believe in my own DD enough to put in more money. I’ve done this twice now in the last two weeks... I believe ASO still has a TON of room to run. So I’ll be buying again Monday morning.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Apr 16 $30c here!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You jerk off?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cool with getting shares called away?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold the 30 and bought the 35. It was at $27 when I sold the calls two weeks ago and bought the $35 when it was $25.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,People will tell you conflicting points on this matter. Shares are the best for helping the squeeze but options provide better profits. I do 90-95% shares and 5-10% calls. I sell calls and then use that to buy calls at a higher price typically.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Close OTM calls can help by forcing MMs to buy shares to delta hedge. If all I could afford was $45c, I'd just buy shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You won’t help the squeeze. You are a microcosmic atom in the cells of institutions and hedge funds. Buy what maximizes your profits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I’m on my fucking way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pulling the trigger for a call on Monday!  LET'S DO THIS!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you buy on a weekend?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it dropped it $24 I sold a bunch of puts at the $20 strike because it was free money. I do a lot of covered call straddles and strangles.

Edit: I exited out of a bunch of the puts I sold at 80-90% profit to free up capital"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably will buy the highest call for May just in case it pops. Will be alright if it gets called away.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why buy calls higher than you sold? Were the 35s further out?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do calls provide any weight to drive a stock up? Or purely buying shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I get that GME is the main focus right now, but it would be great if this got some exposure"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Interest and good move! Gonna look up the straddling. I’m at best using the wheel strategy on covered calls/puts.  But thx for info and DD. Serious thoughts on hopping on the choo choo with ya! ✊🏼
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I always struggle with picking a strike. How far otm was it when you sold?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Calls do provide weight to drive up the stock. Market movers have to be delta neutral. Option chains and open interest drives activity and awareness

Edit: there are some good articles on gamma squeezes and stuff like that on here"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just like RKT. When it pops it will get the exposure and then it’s time to sell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m balls deep in GME, but the rest of powder went to ASO this week. A double GME ASO mooning in the next two weeks would be spectacular."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is over, just bagholders now"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Most people suggest a 0.3 delta. But a potential squeeze makes it even more uncertain. I simply sell whatever call I’m comfortable taking profits on.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just let one of my written RKT puts get assigned yesterday.
2021-04-02 19:23:36,wallstreetbets,"Heavy Sack Update April 2: Happy Easter, you damned dirty apes "
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,weird how RKT feels like the worst bet out of all of these
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You walk around with all that?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,One of those things is not the others...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Luckily RKT has been finding hard resistance at 23 lately and it should shoot up back above that level on open Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fellow RKTer here with my baby dick 104 shares.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Big balls man
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is junk bond status and I believe that one day the stock will be worth $0 when the debt collectors take over the chain.  RKT is a way better choice despite the wave of people not paying Mortgages.  GME is solid compared to these two.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yet its the most sound bet because they are actually worth more than what the stock price is at
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's a great entry price though. Someday it will be worth more than double that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. I think it's A longer play then I care for though. Might drop what I have (@$26)

This is a debt mountain and will likely chip away until its down to very little.  I have a position on AMC, but definitely not convinced it will do anything."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Boomer logic.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bad ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So naked short sell then?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Aren't they getting rid of alot of debt by these offerings?  It sucks for shareholders but I think they are paying down debt. That and the insiders getting rich by unloading in retail lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they decide to use it for debt, yes. There is plenty of good that can come from having capital. The business has been operating lean and avoiding running out of cash, those practices will really reflect when the consumers start coming back. Collecting a lot more cash doesn't seem reasonable at the moment, but I'm sure they want to capitalize on the stock price while they can."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Smart ape 🦧
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get Ryan cohens dick out your mouth you retard. amc is going to the moon. They really need to change the name of WSB to gme.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They did that for a pile of debt from silver lake earlier.  500M debt was converted to stock then sold to pay off the debt of I read the article correctly.  I would assume is it isn't going to nefarious reasons they would pay off more debt.  Not sure what else they can be doing with a mountain of cash.  Unless they remodel their theaters to try to create a new movie going experience.  The business model is not good currently and they don't make enough from ticket sales.  Maybe they can drive more profit by making it more like studio movie grill with higher end food and alcohol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao imagine being this guy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC is an actual meme. Enjoy getting diluted over and over, paying for more bonuses"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Could be. There are plenty of ways they could spend and really increase the experience. Not sure why they haven't been doing that over the past several years, but it's a reasonable way to spend. Not saying raising money would be for nefarious reasons, but as a shareholder I would love to know exactly where they'll be putting the money is going. Right now, they're just trying to survive to a post-pandemic state."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice to see MVIS at the end lol

They are neck and neck folks! here they come down the home stretch, this is going to be a close one!"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ASO is such a dark horse. It didn’t even make the top 10 this week yet it might be one of the best bets I’ve found here in recent weeks.

Short squeeze potential aside (that honestly may or may not even come to fruition) the company is just straight up undervalued based on its fundamentals.

You only find the true WSB gems if you are sorting by “new”. By the time shit becomes “hot”, you might be too late."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have. Big time.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The mods always delete anything about AMC.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The mods delete AMC posts they think it brings down gme. This should be gme bets just saying

So I'll get $23 a share, in which the aftermarket right now is $22.97 for me to buy back in. That's okay with me! 
I sold the $23.50's for .13¢ each 
Bought them back for .02¢
And then sold the $23s for .07¢
X's 1000 shares or 10 Contracts 
So I took in $130 bought them back for $20
Then sold for another $70 all in all for a profit of $180 in one day. Buy back on Monday,

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh alright
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"the divide and conquer strategy worked so well this time with amc. with silver they timed it really well, but it was debunked quickly as a community (no one really fell for it anyways). this amc thing has tons of people fooled and it really is a shame"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everywhere I look says p/e is 8-11, not sure where you are looking but if we look at the last four quarters there’s EPS of about 2.70 and the stock is at $30 giving it a P/E of about 11, that’s trailing EPS as well so the stock seems undervalued."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s funny that people downvote you. It seems like you know a lot more than me (and probably others) but because you are against confirmation bias... you feel the wrath! Stay true to yourself and keep trying to shine light where it needs to be shined. Even if people hate on you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh look another salty r GME regular lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like this bag
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market cap is what you want to look at it, for example tilray earns 5x the revenue as sndl but only worth double as a company. Compare the market cap numbers, which is the number of all shares that exist multiplied by the share price. Then you can look into earnings too like how much money they make or lose per quarter"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I felt that way the entire time, but didn’t want to rain on anyone’s parade. AMC seems like it’s the ugly sister of GME... Sorry, not sorry. 💎🙌🚀🪐"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea my mistake. I was only considering earnings for the 2 public quarters.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh alright cool thank you!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"agreed. 1 thing I've seen recently was cnbc had a headline that went something like: ""next stocks with potential to short squeeze"" and listed were a couple random stocks along with AMC. And to me that mirrors the silver fiasco. I saw the picture on here, discord, or somewhere else on reddit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Havent all the GME holders started saying the same exact thing? Hold forever until it moons because y'all think you can name your price or whatever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also SNDL's shares are sooo diluted, it has 1.65 Billion shares float. They gotta make around 14 million profit to make the share price move by a penny. Look at their Financials and see what a long shot that is. Plenty of other cannabis companies where your money won't be a proverbial 'hot dog down a hallway'."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve replaced the word “bullshit” in my vocabulary with “silver.”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of them, yes, believe there are still millions of outstanding (counterfeit) shares that will need to be covered and that they will be forced to liquidate as the price reaches a certain threshold (this theory is where some GME holders believe the MOASS will stem from). Others, like DFV himself, believe the stock will simply rise to its ATH again just through fundamentals (from the e-commerce transformation).

Meanwhile Palantards think a $50 or $100 million dollar contract means it’s MC should be $10 billion higher... while ignoring the millions of shares being dumped by insiders. While ignoring the CEO himself saying he doesn’t care about short term share price."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1 billion per share could be accepted if it is this month(fire sale). In may the floor is 10 billion.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Whose Kenny?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Kenny is just gonna file for bankruptcy and his prime brokers ain't gonna pay you for shares they technically already own. They're just gonna write the lost shares off as a loss and no one is gonna buy them off you for a retarded make believe price.

I'm all for Gabe and Kenny getting boyfriends in jail but you won't gonna receive the payday you're dreaming of.

The truth hurts but all these new ""apes"" are just the next generation of wsb bagholders. Just ask SPY200p 4/17 bear gang and look at all the other full retard plays where retards got too greedy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Eyy a fellow Wells Fargo dude.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do we still have proof that hedge funds are super shorted in GME? The stock got down to 40 dollars after the initial run. Surely if they needed to buy cheap stock that bad they would have taken advantage of that back when it was 40, maybe not ALL of the position, but at least enough to the point they're not desperately trying to get cheaper prices right now. The fact it's been $100+ for nearly a month now makes me think that's case, as if they still needed to cover they'd be doing more ladder attacks and such"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's b/c they're too big to fail and they've gotten away w/ it for so long why would they stop now? 

Diamond hands will show them why this time around. Patiently waiting..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Definitely both. Even if they tries to cover at 40, they were so over shorted, it probably woulda caused lift off. Bottom line is - they never planned on covering and just kept shorting and shorting pre-January spoke and post spike. They wanted to bankrupt the company so they would have gotten tax free tendies."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"NuH uH! tHaT’s NoT hOw It WoRks!

Am I doing it right? Ken, where do I collect my check?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are clueless when it comes to this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know that when they file for bankruptcy there will be no one left to buy GME at inflated prices? The lenders aren't gonna pay for shares they lent out. It's cheaper to write off those losses.

Mr. Goldman isn't gonna pay 10bn for shares he lent out at 20 bucks. He's gonna send someone to break Kenny's legs."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh? Don't worry. It's a very light shade of red. Nothing to be scared about...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it means you sell some, buy some mc'd tendies for children's hospitals with a side of gamestop devices and games."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha we are a rare breed of 🦍

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jim, is that you? Also, I have a question. I will call you on your show next week, so please pick me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Theres a theory that its a whales doing. That he is purposely doing this as to harm the hedgefunds to make maximum profit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Personally I am confident they’ve shorted over 100% of the float and I continue to buy shares. There’s tons of amazing DD that outlines why this is the case but there’s no way to “prove” it right now based on short reporting.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty much. Their intention was never to cover. Like Mark Cuban said.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then they will have to file BK on every single person they owe money to. That will take down the entire market, unless the Feds will start bailing corps out. 

They are much bigger than that Archegos Capital blowout. Plus, it’s more than just Citadel."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was genuinely asking, I haven't seen any posts about amount of short lately. And considering how much stuff including media misinformation was going on during the first run it definitely seemed like there were drastic attempts at lowering the stocks value compared to the past month"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The loss on the GME shares is capped at the share price they were lent out to Citadel and other shorts.

The GME position itself is the least worrisome for the banks and actually a much smaller risk than Archegos.

If all the shorts blow up it will crash the market but GME price will not moon beyond the ability to pay (of all the shorts combined). If GME moons, there's a finite price to moon to and people need to stop making up numbers that are more than the entire market cap or aum of the involved shorts."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Porsche didn't have to, they willing did to help the shorts."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your account says 1 year. Mine says 10 months. 
I don’t comment a lot, I mainly read. I don’t farm karma."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t have the ability to pay the asking price you don’t get the commodity. If you don’t have enough to pay, it’s time to take out some loans. If people have to go into debt to survive, financial corps can go into debt to cover their horrible decisions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Porsche did have to as they basically bankrupted their own ass with their takeover approach. They were on the brink of defaulting on the loans they used to buy up those shares in the first place.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My account is from 2016.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They don't have to get the commodity once they file for bankruptcy and the lenders aren't forced to get it anyway. If the shorts fail to pay for it, the lenders won't pay for it themselves on the shorts' behalf. That would be more expensive than to write off the losses on the initial sales."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know you can’t file BK selectively? Once you file, you file it on all assets to everyone you owe. That means all of the people they serve will get hit. Is it hard to understand?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can you read? I wrote that it's gonna tank the market. But it won't moon GME beyond the short's ability to pay because the lenders don't actually have to buy what they're owed.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sure. Though none of us have a crystal ball to tell the future. At what price would they eventually say “oh well, we fked up.

This week's top stock and its DD: Taiwan Semiconductor ($TSM) **Preamble:** One of the main questions that I had and I see recurring on this sub is how to identify and invest in emerging stocks before it becomes mainstream news. I did not have the time to actively track social media and decided to build a program that does it for me.

**How it works:** The program is built using Python and uses both Twitter and Reddit API to stream comments and tweets and spot tickers that are exhibiting accelerated growth. I added sentiment analysis to the findings so as to check the general sentiment (whether what is being talked about the stock is positive or negative).

Here is the stock picked by the program and my DD

**Stock:**   **Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company ($TSM)**

Week on Week increase in mentions: **130%**

Month on Month increase in mentions: **324%**

Average sentiment across mentions: **+29.5%**

**DD**

**Core Product**

TSMC was founded in 1987 by Morris Chang, who previously had worked in Texas Instruments. TSMC can be considered as possibly the most important company in the world that few people have heard of. This is because it is practically a chokepoint of the $470 Billion semiconductor industry and is instrumental in supplying chips to almost all the major players. Currently, the company supplies to Apple for their A14 chips and ARM-based chips for their Mac products, Qualcomm, MediaTek, AMD, Intel, and Nvidia.

The company is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry. They are in the pure-play foundry business. This means that they do not produce any processors for their own products but they manufacture and sell chips to companies such as AMD, Intel, and Apple. The main reason for which companies such as Apple and AMD source chips from TSMC is that they do not have to build their own expensive silicon fabrication plants (the CapEx of the plans run into 10s of billions of dollars and it takes an extremely long time to set up) to manufacture their chips. TSMC is currently the world’s 11th largest company by market capitalization ($554 B).

[TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market ](https://preview.redd.it/qx1btw29krq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=61ce94bf883480c99f5e74a43bdea79bbf9d4d9f)

As you can see from the above chart, TSMC absolutely dominates the advanced chip market (<10nm, think phone processors) which also has the highest margins. The company effectively controls more than half (54% to be exact) of the world’s made-to-order chip market.

**Financials**

TSMC posted its best-ever quarter in Q4’20 with revenues jumping 22% to a record $12.68 Billion and profits increasing 23% to $5.1 Billion. They are also expected to invest heavily this year with capital expenditure for production and development of advanced chips to be between $25-$28 Billion. (60% higher than the amount TSMC spend in 2020)

They also have a very strong financial position with $23 Billion in cash vs a long-term liability of only $10 billion (YE 2020). The company has also predicted a record first-quarter revenue between $12.7 Billion and $13 Billion, which is almost a 30% growth from the same period last year. We do have to note that their share price has jumped more than 140% over the past 12 months giving it the current valuation of $554 Billion.

**Potential and Hype Factors**

**Technology moat:** Compared to peers, TSMC is easily the leader in chip production technology. The company has delivered over 1 Billion 7nm chips by 2020 whereas Intel is still trying to master its 7nm development process. For those who are unaware of chip manufacturing, in general, the smaller the node size (measured in nanometer (nm)), the better the performance and power management. This is why the companies making the top-end chips want the smallest node size available.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/w6mw9ehakrq61.png?width=624&format=png&auto=webp&s=a70944796b31b7b971e743f497854c29d9b797d1

TSMC is currently in the process of producing 5nm chips (20% of their total wafer revenue) and is already ramping up for 3nm production by the end of 2022. It takes a long time to spin up a new silicon fabrication factory (3-4 years is the average time it takes for a factory to go from planning to production).

This leadership in technology would be one of the key drivers for growth in the coming years. The $28 Billion Capex spending also reflects on the management’s confidence about the long-term demand for the advanced chips.

**Strong long-term demand:** Even though the current shortage faced by automakers is mainly due to a supply chain issue, cars, in general, are getting more and more complicated and EV’s tend to need better hardware and chips. This will force the automakers to rush to lock in future supply. Even though the margins produced from the auto-chips are not as high as the phones/laptops, the producers of the chips are definitely going to benefit in the long run.

**Risk and Competition**

There are multiple risks associated with TSMC. First and foremost, at the current valuation, the stock is definitely not cheap. The current PE ratio is 33 which puts them in the same bucket as Apple and AMD. While this might be representative of their future growth potential, it is on the higher side for a manufacturing company.

The company might face a short-term crisis in production as Taiwan is currently facing its most severe water shortage in 56 years. Taiwan’s chipmakers have begun stocking up on truckloads of water to prepare for shortages. During a similar drought in 2015, Taiwan was forced to implement water restrictions for industrial companies. This can cause a significant impact on the top and bottom line as TSMC is currently producing at 100% capacity. A weakening USD can also have a significant impact on TSMC’s EPS as \~99% of their sales are in US dollars whereas only 15% of its COGS is in US dollars.

A long-term risk for TSMC is that their increasingly dominant position in chip manufacturing is starting to attract political attention. The current shock from the auto chip shortage is forcing governments to bring vital supply chains back into their countries in order to make them less vulnerable to disruption. In the US, lawmakers are citing the chip shortage as proof that the country needs to revive more semiconductor manufacturing at home. This has forced TSMC to build a $12 billion plant in Arizona. This political climate can be beneficial for Intel, given their current foray into fabrication. (I do not think Intel can effectively compete with TSMC in fabrication without significant help in trade restrictions. As we can see from the process roadmap, Intel is currently years behind TSMC in the manufacturing process and they could not make their products work even when they had the best process technology years back)

**Conclusion**

TSMC is currently one of the world’s largest companies and they are definitely not resting on their laurels. They have been continuously working on building more capacity and advancing their nodes. Even though there are some short-term and long-term risks in terms of their exposure to the US dollar, rising geopolitical tensions, etc., I believe TSMC’s current technological moat, a monopoly level market share in advanced chips, and the rising use of smartphones and IoT devices put TSMC in a very strong position over the long term!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice post.  Thank you for taking the time to do it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hello, just swinging by and saw one of my favorite topics mentioned, fabrication strengths.

For those not into tech, you may not realize that 10nm/7nm is more or less a marketing number - it only measures the distance between transistors in one dimension.  What actually matters is the *transistor density*, which measures transistors/sq mm (two dimensions) instead of just one.  Intel's 10nm has slightly better transistor density than TSMC 7nm, and Intel 7nm will be slightly better than TSMC 5nm, so in reality **if both company's timelines hold** Intel is only one process node behind TSMC.

Although Intel is definitely behind TSMC as far as fabrication is concerned it doesn't actually matter that much.  This is because typically TSMC's leading generation is sold out to Apple, which means that for third parties, the difference in choice of fabrication technology is negligible.  Of course, this part only applies once Intel starts accepting orders from external companies (currently Intel only produces its own products in its own fabs).

**TLDR**: Intel being behind on process node doesn't really matter because 1) at the moment they only make their own products and 2) their only products in need of a cutting edge node are in their CPU division, which are still remaining competitive for now.  

Please note that anything written above not already released by their respective companies may change without notice, and OP's financial disclaimer still applies here too.  Overall, I do agree with OP (also, nice post!), but I wanted to point out that the difference in fabrication technology is closer than the layperson might tell.  Finally, fuck this tiny window to write text in.

Edit: In case if process node is a new term to anyone, if someone is referring to Intel 10nm, that's a process node, while a process node advancement would be moving from Intel 10nm to Intel 7nm (Or TSMC 7nm to 5nm, but you get the point)."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is a really great idea! It'd be interesting to run your program on historical data. For example, see what it would come up based on January sentiment, then track how that stock performed in Feb and March (or even go back a few years and track long term growth).  I'd have to believe that the data is out there. It would help you refine your models if you didn't find good correlation in the sentiment and price.  In fact, you could look at the data in reverse. Find what stocks had good movement in 2020, then analyze the trends in sentiment for an X-week period before their big jumps."

Single core performance matters in virtualized environments, licensing per core is typical. If I pay per core, every core should perform.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The US government will not allow the Chinese (Taiwan’s bullying neighbor) to overtake the US in tech. The amount of chips in our military industrial complex is staggering. There is no way in hell we will ever rely on a foreign company for the defense of our nation. We spend more than the next ten-twenty nations combined on our defense. Our government routinely lets Intel look over its shoulders at our national research labs such as Los Alamos etc. Intel knows the future in Chip design will be in neural multi dimensional design layouts. It’s already partnered with the national lab in Chicago to study neural AI chips. Look up the size differences of Nano Meters. It’s stupid to even fuss over. Density is much more important at that scale. And greater density will only be achieved at that shrinking scale by using 3 dimensions or more.

1. Do you have some sources for the transistor density part? (not that I doubt your expertise, but why would all the companies prefer a lower nm if it's just for marketing? They can just as well go with the higher ones and save the cost right!) 
2. Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing? TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup?

TSM will have advantage in <5nm once 2022,23 factories come up but that should last only 1-2 years until competition catches up 

TSM also just announced 100 billion in factory spending to catch up with chip demand market is reacting bullish and that is why it is trending I agree with this

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amd is God for processors bruh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Intel is only shipping *their* 10nm (the ""fixed"" one, their 3rd shot at a decent 10nm process) in a meaningful way in client CPUs, only laptops.

Their 10nm Ice Lake SP server CPU is probably going to be a train wreck, hopefully they deliver something useful with the follow-up Sapphire Rapids later this year.

Meanwhile AMD's TSMC 7nm servers were launched in summer of *2019*. This time to market gap is more likely to increase as AMD's financial position improves, allowing it to invest in bleeding edge processes the way Apple does.

INTC warrants a shitload of skepticism for having lost such a commanding process lead over the span of just a few years, and then boldly claiming that they're going to retake a leadership position after they already paid their key people to retire, and TSM is planning something like 2-3x INTC's planned CAPEX.

Not even talking about the plan for INTC to work as third party foundry because that's gonna be a shitshow.

The reality is that Intel is locked into a course of about 2 more years of collapsing gross margins due to the current state of affairs, and the only reason their market share loss won't be catastrophic is AMD doesn't have enough capacity to take more. After that we'll talk again about whether INTC is a good value play. The inertia of the business is in the completely wrong direction."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not just that but Intel is more vertically integrated, almost as much as Samsung.  
AMD, Nvidia, and Apple all depend on TSMC/Samsung to make their CPU/GPU chips.  


Intel is also about to announce their GPUs made by TSMC that will compete with AMD and Nvidia in the Gaming/AI/Machine Learning space.  


As you pointed out, when they're on the same node Intel CPUs outperform AMD CPUs by a wide margin. As it stands their 14nm are still pretty competitive with AMD's 7nm. Also from a physics stand point to go below 3nm will be quantum computing (some argue 2nm will be achievable but it's unlikely).  


And once Intel hits 3nm it's going to wipe the floor with the competition. In 15 years Intel will be the leader with a market cap nearly as large as AMD, Nvidia, and TSMC combined. The fact that their P/E ratios are 35-80 while Intel is at 13 shows me the markets are not efficient.  


I'm extremely bullish long-term (10-15 years out) on Intel and it makes up 35% of my portfolio. If the stock price hits the 40s again it will for sure be 50% of my portfolio. Not investment advice."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Do you have some sources for the transistor density part?

It's not a great read, but [this article](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/525/iedm-2017-isscc-2018-intels-10nm-switching-to-cobalt-interconnects/6/) has a good image that shows a comparison between gate sizes.  Also it corrects my poor explanation of how transistor density and nm are measured!  Turns out it doesn't move from one dimension to two, but factors in the distance between transistors.

>a lower nm if it's just for marketing

Basically nm is a far easier metric to put on a slide instead of MTr/mmÂ².  At the end of the day, the consumer will always figure out which process is best, so it's not really a case of nm is completely incorrect (because comparing 10nm and 7nm in the same company is still perfectly fine) as much as it is an issue of being incredibly confusing for those who aren't knowledgeable about the space.

> Why do you think Intel fell behind TMC in manufacturing?

They put a financial guy in charge.  It didn't help that they had a technology lead at the time, which made the decision to cut research spending on new processes easier.

> TSMC is also investing heavily in Capex. do you think intel can catchup? 

Intel can definitely catch up, it just depends on how many of the lessons learned on 10 and 7nm can be applied to 3nm.  I think I forgot to mention there are rumors Intel will just jump from 7 to 3nm...  Which to be fair, they would have to do to reach par with TSMC.  As for capex, I wouldn't read too much into it for now.  Aside from reinforcing the idea that Intel will continue to own fabrication facilities, TSMC is at 100% capacity, and Intel near 100% with their existing fabs.  At the moment it just looks like a ""you have to spend money to make money"" thing."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait that seems really biased I mean do you not hear yourself? I owned a lot of Intel stock but AWS is moving to Arm Graviton chips and Apple left Intel for AMD’s M1 arm chips. 

They’re hemorrhaging say center marketshare to AMD and this is before those Arm chips are even out. Same with Nvidia whose acquiring Arm and is going heavy on data centers as well.

Intel is extremely important to the American government and military but at best that makes them IBM. If Intel doesn’t start manufacturing low energy chips to compete with Arm they could be in serious trouble years down the line don’t you think?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh i see. Thanks for clarifying!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has no idea what he’s talking about. Many problems including:

1- 7nm and 14nm and whatnot are just marketing terms, there’s a lot more until we reach quantum barriers.

2-  Even if we do get to minimum gate size, doesn’t mean there won’t be any progress in fabrication, everyone is going 3d stacking soon.

3- Intel is not even close to competitive in high-end productivity or server applications.


Also FYI, M1 is not AMD’s its designed by Apple itself."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re right. Let’s hope AMD keeps innovating
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean short term, yeah. Benchmarks for their most recent release (their first ""10nm hybrid"" release) are worse than their previous gen. The 10900 is actually better than the 11900 in pretty much every substantial way."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It actually costs more to be in the lead. You can reverse engineer what someone else is doing if you're behind, or rely on equipment companies to provide key process development information to catch you up.  I know because I saw TSMC do exactly this all during 2010-2015 to gain on Intel.  I spent all that time helping them (probably 12 trips to Taiwan), and now the last few years my time is towards helping Intel more (roughly 10 trips to Portland).

Both Intel and TSMC are both spending a ton on fabs in Phoenix now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Intel spending 20b in 4 years. TSMC spending 100b in 3 years.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those chips are nothing to intel though, it's their relationship with enterprise and laptop manufacturers that makes the big boy bucks. High end desktop cpus like that are mostly just for mindshare, though I totally agree the 11900k is a travesty. Also alder lake is looking genuinely pretty good, I fully suspect intel to come roaring back next year, though AMD should bring it as well, it's gonna be an interesting period for chip makers!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The markets are closed 🤷🏽‍♂️
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey that’s really fascinating as a fan of both Intel and TSMC.

Do you personally think Intel needs to come out with an Arm style low power consumption chip as AWS moves to Arm based Graviton chips and Apple to their M1 arm chips? If so can Intel keep using their x86 architecture?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The difference is Intel already secured the $20B, TSMC hasn't."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10 because more bigger more better
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Relationships that are quickly deteriorating. You'd have to be insane to go with Xeons over the Milan Epyc cpus, and given the partnership list AMD rolled out on release, it looks like many new server farms are going with AMD. Same with laptop releases, the 5000 series AMD chips are faster, and MUCH more power efficient than anything Intel can offer. I'd honestly be shocked if intel can compete at all within 2 years."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they open in 3 days? I was just making a joke about how you’re saying 3 days was too far out, so I assumed you’d only invest in a 1-2 day timeline, like day-trading."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Admittedly I'm not super knowledgeable about the full integration flows/architecture, so I'm totally the wrong person to ask.  You likely know far more than me on that topic :)

My knowledge is more about some of the thinnest films that are required when creating the chips (the transistor-level); our processes are called ALD (Atomic Layer Deposition), so it's putting down atom-by-atom thick layers of various atomic elements.  Most of my specific work is designing the right experiments to better characterize/optimize the properties in that atomic growth across the entire wafer.  

At the transistor level, soon there will be a migration to a GAA (Gate-All-Around) structure.  We've already been working on helping the big boys with that for a few years now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TSMC spent 28b, this year. Spending slightly more for the next 3 years doesn't seem like it'll be a problem."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Intel still holds over 90% server market share and about 80% laptop share. I'm not disagreeing with you over amd making better products but Intel is a much much larger company with still vastly greater mindshare and market share in the profitable areas of the industry. If AMD can turn itself around after the FX days while in a massive amount of debt I'm confident that intel can do the same. Have you been following alderlake at all? I feel like that will be their first interesting release since skylake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They'll fire something out as and when they need to. Then AMD will sit on its heels in 2nd place for a few years and decide intel has been on top for too long and bring something else out.. on and on and on. You can't really go wrong with either company... The only thing is intel are completely in house which makes them more attractive as an investment for me. As a consumer I would pick AMD right now but that's only because I do my research.... Most don't.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, I didn't want to think about the market because I have been grinding since January and need this short break. 

Probably a selfish comment but with good intentions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's just more profit margin to lose for intel though. Last gen AMD was slightly below intel in some areas and slightly better in others. Milan and the 5000 series desktop/laptop cpus absolutely blow intel out of the water. I see intel losing lots of ground over the next year in both server and laptop segments. Intel is going to have to price its products next to dirt in order to retain anything. I'm not saying intel is done or over by any means, but a new/old CEO isn't going to fix their problems overnight. I think the speed of the intel ""comeback"" is vastly exaggerated. And from what I've seen so far, I'm not confident in the direction they're taking. I also reserve judgment of any new cpus until I see 3rd party reviews and benchmarks. You can't trust ANY marketing slide or internal claims, especially from intel."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I held out for months till I could get an AMD laptop. The AMD cpus have far better integrated graphics than intel. It's actually capable of light gaming and the entire CPU is more powerful.

AMD cpus also produce a little less heat and use a little less energy than Intel which is YUGE for data centers. Power and cooling is about more important than the actual CPU in terms of cost."

> The private goods-producing sector also added back jobs on net in March after shedding payrolls in February as inclement weather impacted hiring.

> Earlier this week, ADP&#039;s March private payrolls report showed the most jobs added back since September, and the Institute for Supply Management&#039;s manufacturing index pointed to rising employment trends in the goods-producing sector.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10y yield quickly rose after the report.. that ain't good for the Nasdaq. Anyone look at a 25 year chart of the NASDAQ lately?... it's pretty funny.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,PPP ends on May 31st. Afterwards business can start layoffs in haste.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Crazy that they don't count PUA/PEUC continuing claims when that is the real amount of continuing claims. only counting claims in the 1st 6 months (state benefit period) gives you an idea of the 6 month rolling # of new claims but not total outstanding. Total unemployment rate is well above 6% still. 

This will bump treasuries up but I still believe any inflation will be transient; I think the Fed is correct in this case and not necessarily just jawboning. Short term there are supply constraints increasing prices combined with an influx of 1 time fiscal stimulus. However, over the long term you cannot really have sustained inflation without an increase in wages and/or a decrease in taxes. Wages account for at least 70% of total inflation. There can be a number of factors leading to inflation in the short term as rates rise such as low margin unprofitable companies like UBER being forced to increase prices as it becomes more difficult to borrow. Companies increasing prices as adspend costs continue to rise. The problem is there needs to be an equilibrium and if these prices increase while there is only a constant pool of money available to be spent, there will be less total sales, putting pressure on those prices.

I also see no evidence that the economic outlook going forward is really any stronger than it was in 2019 despite that being the narrative. I see people talking about a reversal of the tech/globalism induced deflationary trend of the last 20 years but other than a potential decoupling from China (which I don't believe will happen) I don't have reason to believe this is the case."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The stock market is like a stream. The amount of money flowing in is based off of how good the options are for where the money should go. For a year, stocks were the place, so the stream was going to stocks and not as much to bonds and other options. If other options become more attractive, the stream will slow down. If lots of 401k contributing jobs are cut, the stream will slow down as well, but right now, we are at the tail end of a that stream being a roaring river. Surely, we are at the point other options start to take some of the water away from the stream, but we have reset expectations and what a stock is worth relative to earnings. We have done this in the past too. Metrics change over time and right now there is a lot of confidence in stocks, and people are willing to pay more for earnings than previously. Will this hold? Or will it settle back down? We don’t know, but history shows that metrics are great in a snapshot, but over a long period of time, expectations and what we look for in metrics changes.  The stream metaphor works even further if you think of companies as farms using the river for irrigation."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn’t see much with tech but here is a CNBC article about the jobs report this morning. 

Leisure and hospitality, a sector critical to restoring the jobs market to its former strength, showed the strongest gains for the month with 280,000 new hires. Bars and restaurants added 176,000, while arts, entertainment and recreation contributed 64,000 to the total.

Even with the continued gains, the sector remains 3.1 million below its pre-pandemic total in February 2020.

With students heading back into schools, education hiring boomed during the month as well. Local, state and private education institutions combined to hire 190,000 more employees for the month.

Construction also saw a healthy gain of 110,000 new jobs, while professional and business services added 66,000 and manufacturing increased by 53,000. For construction, it was the strongest month of hiring since June 2020.

In addition to the powerful gains for March, previous months also were revised considerably higher. The January total increased 67,000 to 233,000, while February's revisions brought the total up by 89,000 to 468,000.

A slew of other industries also added jobs: Transportation and warehousing (48,000), other services (42,000), social assistance (25,000), wholesale trade (24,000), retail (23,000), mining (21,000), and financial activities (16,000) contributed to the strong month.

Within the other services category, personal and laundry services, which serves as a proxy for general business activity, saw an increase of 19,000."

Student Loans have been on interest free deferment this whole time.  That's a lot of extra money for those with student loans, as much as 10% of your income if you are using the income based repayment plan.

The interest rates you can refinance your mortgage into are unreal, enabling renters to become homeowners ahead of schedule, and homeowners to refinance into incredible interest rates.

Telework arrangements have enabled a lot families to not use child care, and also eliminated the need for pre and after school programs."

Are you looking to exercise because those contracts would be expensive to do so?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's actually money printing, btw. 

The only technical difference between printing money and QE is that the Fed claims that, one day, the money will be sucked out of the system. So, wink wink, it's not printing money if they're gonna take it back.

Except when they started to taper the balance sheet in 2018, the stock market tanked 20% and JPow said nvm, we're gonna not taper. 

And so the printing continued. And then Corona happened. 

There has never been a single central bank where they unwound QE. 

Therefore, it's all money printing."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, JPOW had the right idea in 2018. Honestly who cares that the market dipped 20%. If businesses cant handle a 2.25% interest rate or whatever it was, they shouldnt exist.

QE is such a scam to the poor and middle class. It's like a drug that the system has become dependent on, but the side effects are terrible."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Central banking was a mistake.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"its not money printing. the fed deposits reserves into commercial banks to force them to lend. the commercial banks are refusing to lend except to highly qualified borrowers, who dont want to borrow. outside of the us there is HUUUUUGE demand for us dollars, which the fed can do nothing about (fed mandate literally stops at the us border), so these foreign entities are forced to get dollars through bonds or deal with our commercial banks (repo insanity that keeps happening). its not money printing, they only say it is because it makes the markets content. look at credit data, all lending keeps collapsing despite idiots in the media reporting ""good numbers."" QE is really more like large asset purchases (treasuries), this money never actually touches the economy unless a bank decides to lend"

This is why we are fucked
 The Fed has created an economy that needs unbelievably low interest rates to remain solvent. Take a good look at Japan because that's gonna be the US in 10 years.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit, that's a huge beat! If they scale production **BY ZERO** in the remainder of the year they will still beat 2021 expectations. With COVID ending, the huge expansion in Shanghai and two new factories still expected to be completed this year, seems like they're actually on track to deliver around 1 MILLION cars this year, or a 100% production growth YoY.

- Consumer enthusiasm towards product
- Ties to energy industry
- Ties to auto insurance industry
- Data mining giant - collects data on every single tesla owner
- Democratic Administration bodes well for EV/renewables category

Reasons to be bearish:

- Competition ramping up EVs
- Supply chain issues, costs as competition bids for resources
- Outsized valuation
- Democratic Administration poses risk of burdensome regulation on SD tech and data collection"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I honestly can't see any other car company catching up with them. Conventional car makers are going all in on being pro electric in their PR but they're not making big enough moves to abandon internal combustion. They are still treating EV as a niche, and are strategically trying to suppress customers from migrating from gas burning cars to EV. The 'Voltswagen' joke really is a joke. Old car manufacturers have to completely abandon gas burning engines if they want to get close to Tesla yet all they want to do is protect the billions they previously invested in now obsolete technology."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Man time to fomo into Tesla calls on Monday knowing this shit is about to rally for at least a week straight

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,$1000 pending

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yolo calls a cumith
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I might suspect production numbers won't move  the price significantly. There needs to be news on autonomous and the semi. As all the bears like to say the PE is too high for a car company... So we need to hear about non car company news.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Counting cars sold, then returned, then sold again as 2 I bet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For comparison GM does about 770,000 per quarter.  Not bad Mr Musk."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,With refreshed model S/X line firing up and gigas Berlin and Austin coming online this year a million cars is theoretically achievable. 👍😀

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its called shorting
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The real question is what they counted as deliveries this quarter. Tesla loves moving the goalpost, other OEMs have a defined and consistent event.  Tesla out there reporting deliveries to subsidiaries."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,YOLOing in on 4/30 $800Cs thanks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I need $900 by July to print 💰
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Toyota sold more than that in March alone in North America. No way TSLA is worth 3x the value of TM.  Eventually sales will plateau and it will turn into a pitched battle with established companies.  Maybe it will win or maybe not but none of that is priced into the stock.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lately their earnings are usually 3rd or 4th Wednesday of the month after market close. So 21st or 28th

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or down to 500... Seems stagnant growth to me, Ford at the other hand double the number of MACH-E deliveries month by month"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Monday or Tuesday?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla up to $1500... If the market supports it of course...

Yeah, no. I love TSLA, I love Musk, but I love making money more. And TSLA is not going to make me money. TSLA is MAYBE worth $100bn, if it can fend off competition from rivals. That's an 84% drop from its current valuation. I'm not a fan of losing 84% of my investment."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One of your bear reasons is a bull case for Tesla. Tesla and VW are the only companies in the western world taking huge steps to secure their own battery supply chain. The rest of the automakers rely on outside companies, and will compete over the same insufficient battery share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla and Musk got a lot of snide comments for talking about their factories and manufacturing in general. When they talk about an ""alien dreadnaught"" or ""the machine that makes the machine"", it's very easy to dismiss them or make fun of them being ignorant or ignoring the experts, etc.

But these kinds of results mean we should probably take the idea that Tesla could be a global manufacturing expert somewhat seriously. They built their Shanghai factory in record time, started production much faster than almost anyone predicted and have been increasing output at an impressive pace. In Fremont they completely redesigned a core product (Model Y) to use a completely new manufacturing technique, and then rolled that knowledge in to a new factory in Shanghai, again at a pace much faster than anyone would've predicted.

And they've got two more factories in progress, which are huge, and going up extremely quickly. With plans for battery factories and apparently new factories in Shanghai, and they're making huge investments in cutting edge manufacturing and vertical integration. I think a big uncertainty in their future valuation is how well they can pull off big, incredibly ambitious, projects like that.

If they can keep making improvements in manufacturing the way they've been improving recently, then that starts to create a trend for them to really be a leader in automotive (or really any kind of) manufacturing in the next 5-10 years.

They've still got a long ways to go to prove they can actually hit those goal, but these kinds of surprises in quarterly numbers are the kinds of things that might give people confidence they've got the ability to pull it off."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla will be first to market with a compelling ev at a $25k price point. I also think all their models will stay best price/performance for years to come.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"well put. I give more weight right now to the loftly valuation and the competition ramping up so I'm bearish at these prices. But the ties wirh the renewable sectors and the huge head start in the EV are a great reason imo to keep holding shares. They really need to start churning cars, tho."

Ford also makes the legacy and dying products and Tesla current standard.

Its price factors in the likely hood to survive the death of ICE and who do you think is in the best position to do that? The company making EV with basically no debt and no legacy plants or the company making loads of legacy out of loads of legacy plants with a massive debt.

Without looking at any of the other industries tesla is in they are in a better risk position for the death of ICE as a car maker"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't you know, once Tesla starts making more cars, Ford, GM and every other car maker in the world is going to just quit making cars because they can't compete...  edit: /s duh"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many batteries did Ford make? And what about solar panels installed? What kind of move is Ford making into the HVAC market? How many grid tied energy reserves has Ford installed? How fast is the mustang compared to a Tesla? What smart home products does Ford have on the horizon? How’s fords foreign market penetration? How many manufacturing facilities has Ford Closed in foreign markets and how does that compare to the amount of new facilities for Tesla?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,its all about the growth my dude
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But how many pure EVs they sold? A lot of people keep saying other Automakers made/sold more cars. EV is different from ICE cause they gotta secure batteries and Tesla the biggest EV producer still having battery constraints.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ford is also TRASH!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should buy Ford because of 213k sales per month and going bankrupt over 180k per month with higher increasing margins and poised to become the biggest automaker on the planet. Got ya!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Others have pointed out some key differences between the two, but another large point (to me) is the comparison of electric Semis. Hard to compare now since they aren't in production, but Teslas Semi blew Ford out of the water. If EV is the future, investors are going to see that Ford already doesnt have what it takes. 

\-Eval still crazy though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just to be clear I am bearish on Tesla too, however:

Average sale price - Ford $30k rev per car; Tesla $60k.

YOY growth - Ford 0%, Tesla 30-50%

Charging/gas stations: Ford 0, Tesla 20,000

Dealerships owned: Ford 0, Tesla all

Solar/battery argument.

All of this is moot though, as Ford is a typewriter manufacturer in an age when Tesla is a computer manufacturer and 15 years from now Typewriters will be banned. Xerox, like GM, had the lead on computers (GM - EVs) and watched upstarts reinvent it. 

The market cap is still ridiculous when you consider Tesla is nearly the market cap of the ENTIRE auto industry (around $700bn vs around $1T)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And tesla was founded 100 years after ford. For a company to scale production that quick is impressive. Short sellers have all but disappeared.

Also, one is changing a market and 2 years ahead of the competition the other is playing catch up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is room, practically speaking it will take time, hopefully they don't fizzle out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lucid is a 0
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Won't be able to scale to compete at a meaningful level for a while. The Model S and 4680 cells ramping up next year is almost a death knell for Lucid's current technology. 

There are three aspects that buyers care about in electric car quality(looks, interior, fit and finish, driving capability), range(how far), and infrastructure. Right now lucid can compete on quality and range however when 4680s are starting mass production that range advantage goes away with structural battery and 15% boost in battery capacity. Combined with the supercharger network allowing a much better infrastructure that ""just works"" it becomes hard to compete. 

Lucid is aiming for a significantly higher end market. The profitability per car should be there but battery constraints and using CCS which is reliant on the electrify America network isn't exactly a good thing for the next 2 years. The problem with CCS is that there aren't as many stations and the stations don't have as many stalls as VW only builds the bare minimum. 

Tesla has the first mover advantage with charging, economies of scale with new factories/giga press/battery factory, and the kinks mostly figured out.

Lucid can compete however they'll need to ramp production quickly(difficult look at Ford delaying delivery of Mach-E) while simultaneously maintaining a technological edge and getting their cars out quickly to keep up. 

TLDR: another competitor trying to catch up but lacking the secret sauce"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is room for more competitors.

However, Lucid lying about production in the recent past leaves a bad taste in the mouth. Plus, their projected revenue numbers are pure fantasy. Add to it the Saudi investment and the strings attached and I pulled my investment in them."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Though the quality of the cars they produced in 2020 is unarguably terrible.

The one danger OP forgot in the long term is recalls. I mean, it is already a threat as they are recalling in local markets left and right due to motor vehicle authorities clamping down on obvious defects (Germany, KBA, 12k recalls on 5 year old models due to adhesive issues), but the real consequences will be seen in 4-5 years when the less obvious defects on the 2020 models will start getting reported in large numbers. 

These kind of defects will be more similar to the eMMC issue in their ""~~media~~ vehicle control units"". That is a direct consequence of being a disruptive tech innovator in a space that is dominated by safety ratings and 
 automotive standards that limit your ability to innovate for some good reasons. 

They simply don't have the institutional expertise (as it is new factories and new manufacturing engineers) to ramp up their production numbers in a safe manner while also featuring unique solutions in their vehicles. Companies like Magna might sometimes make you wonder if they are retarded when they try to innovate in ADAS, but then Tesla fucks up 100k vehicles on some shitty decision and you realise why Magna is contracted by everybody else to make parts and assemble the damn things."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another important factor of why TSLA ""deserves"" a higher multiple for their stock is growth.  TSLA has been showing 50% growth with potential of 100% growth this year.  ICE companies had mostly plateaued and taking share from each other.  Also, TSLA has potential to make much more income not just from auto but solar, energy, insurance, etc.. in the future and I don't think analysts are really counting on that at all right now.  There's also optimism about TSLA owning the robo-taxi business."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM was making EV's 25 years ago. All ICE companies are working on (MUCH simpler) electric drivetrains. Add in competition from smaller companies like NIO and Workhorse.

I appreciate that you are the first person to make a real argument (debt levels and legacy costs) as to why the valuation of TSLA is not directly comparable to Ford. Thanks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Most of that debt is from their credit arm to their customers. Which is to say that debt is actually revenue generating.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,wouldn't call tesla the current standard whenthere are still more ICE cars sold than electric
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So if one were to just look at it roughly and only factor in the debt load, the question is whether TSLA is worth 3x of F. (600B vs 200B).

In that light most people would say most definitely it is worth 3x."

The carryover can increase or decrease as it is going to be affected by anything towards the end of the Q that could affect deliveries.  Such as if the end of the month is a weekday vs weekend, weather, delivery rejects, people tending to buy cars more or less based on the time of the year, daily production rates, etc.

Uneven buying patterns for cars by consumers over the calendar year by itself will help ensure deliveries vs total made always varies.  As long as the numbers are small, it doesn't really matter.  You just don't want to see tesla building up surplus, that would be bad."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As I answered somewhere else:


Tesla isn't going to be EV only. Their EV innovation started out **years** ago and it panned out into reality and changed the market. But we're at today, not then. Tesla is in the business of pushing for **innovation** around **grand**(iose) ideas. What could this idea be then?

I believe their plan is to be the first to realize the **SMART (autonomous) CAR**, together with a broad-scale **DISTRIBUTED and SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE**.

And that's why it's focusing on energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities by selling batteries and roofs here and there. It's the start to GROWING into something groundbreakingly different as a company.

Pretty much like the back then *""overpriced""* Amazon who *""couldn't generate their stock price revenue if they sold all the books in the world""* as any short-sighted ""pro analyst"" would tell.

I'm not saying it will necessarily work out for Tesla. I'm saying though, that it's one of the bets you **HAVE** to take because if it does work, it's going to change the world. Simple as that.

(And I'm also saying that looking at P/E and projecting to EV car sales only is plain retarded. Just as it was projecting book sales with AMAZN back in the day.)"

Yes, might have little effect on the price on Monday, but I really see TSLA going up over the next years  and not as a product of any meme army, but due to the innovation they push to bring to the market and their spirit for fast paced expansion."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except VW have just swiped away the European market from TSLA with their new range of electric SUVs. 

Tesla has taken too long to get to where it is, and only delivering 180k cars means people are having to wait to buy one. Especially when so many are in the USA and China. Europe will embrace European manufacturers as the EU will likely be protectionist over their home grown brands. 

I don't see TSLA taking market share from any European manufacturer.  They just can't produce cars fast enough, and have allowed the other manufacturers to catch up. 

TSLA is only going to drop in price over the next 5 years unless they make some massive changes to their operation."

lol wut?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, the assumption was always that manufacturing was really hard, and EVs were easy. So the legacy companies would have a huge advantage because they just had to learn how to make an EV.

But I suspect the truth is that they're both really hard? Tesla learned how to make great EVs, and it turns out that might be a really difficult thing to do. So, when they turn towards learning to be a great manufacturer, it gives them a little more credibility. They've got a ton of very talented and very motivated engineers working for them. I wouldn't want to be against that kind of potential."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Though the quality of the cars they produced in 2020 is unarguably terrible.

That's definitely not true. The overwhelming majority of cars that came off the line in 2020 were perfect. They might have a higher rate of cosmetic issues than other cars, things like trim or panel gaps misaligned. Or a lot of times when you see people's issues it's things like not understanding the infotainment or door handles or something.

But the quality of an automaker's cars isn't just defined by a few issues like that. And implying that there's something wrong with all or most of the cars, when we're talking about small differences percentages of visual flaws. 

> The one danger OP forgot in the long term is recalls. I mean, it is already a threat as they are recalling in local markets left and right due to motor vehicle authorities clamping down on obvious defects (Germany, KBA, 12k recalls on 5 year old models due to adhesive issues), but the real consequences will be seen in 4-5 years when the less obvious defects on the 2020 models will start getting reported in large numbers.

There's zero evidence that Tesla is anymore likely to have a recall than other automakers. All automakers have recalls, many of them extremely serious, some of them caused by deaths, and occasionally they've been covered up or fought for years. Compared the industry average there's nothing about Tesla's recall history that stands out as unusually bad.

And there's even less evidence for imaginary recalls that you claim are definitely going to happen in the future."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm at peace either way it's not too hard to switch over to calls and make your money back with tesla. I've rode this whore every way I could think of and made tons more than I've lost.

/u/ragewind isn't the 1st person to be saying this. Maybe that you've heard but us TSLA bulls have been saying this for going on 2 years now. ICE has to chew its own leg off to get out of the bear trap they're caught in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How do they make them simpler? Teslas are RC cars on steroids. I'm not sure GM making EVs 25 years ago will help them much. tech has evolved and engineers from that era are moving on. If they use their 25 year old knowledge it isn't going to be better than Tesla.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe you need to look into those other companies and try harder too.

All your examples are of companies that are a magnitude less of EV production than Tesla.

Mustang EV?  Maybe 50k in 2021

Ford EV?  They’ll be lucky to hit 50k in 2021

NIO?  Won’t ever take foot in places outside of China (which is fine and WILL likely become the main Tesla competition in China)

Workhorse?  They are losing that USPS contract, almost 100%.  They will be bankrupt by 2025.

The ONLY company even close to Tesla numbers is VW.

But all these things forget how big an advantage Tesla has in raw material production AND their modular / “clean room” designed assembly line."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"While the other revenue streams are small you discounting totally is an error. They are revenue streams that ICE auto don’t have at all and they are revenue streams that will grow. So while small now and worth only a tiny bit it will become sizably relevant.

Take energy, it’s just been found that Tesla is the source for the batteries at the apple energy project. It’s a massive project that’s been contracted for a year with no PR and even now its due to a member of the public finding out and making public. The markets and pros don’t factor in energy at all but there it is slowly growing on grid level projects, not exciting as its boring infrastructure but infrastructure is large in $$ the more it gets deployed.

FSD is another one, now it’s a cost but once its working it will be a saving. The majority are hoping mobileye works it out for them, they then hope mobileye don’t screw them by just upping the monthly charge.

Tesla can also just sell FSD to others for the same fee mobileye will be taking. The EV network is also a future revenue stream that looks like it’s moving in to commercial reality soon.

Nio is a real competitor as they have the backing of the Chinese government do debt is only a problem if they are politically an issue for the government. So no debt, rapid R&D and massive market.

Workhorse seems to deliver less than Tesla does Vs its hope. So they may be a risk in the future but they seem to be in the same value to risk/potential as tesla but with less deliveries 

VW stands a chance as they seem to have seen the light but they have the same level of debt and the legacy plants to kill off. Engine and gearbox plants are often separate, small and utterly unneeded for EV’s so they have contaminated sites that cant offload without doing massive cleaning of the earth.

You said this;

>The hopes that TSLA will ""grow into their share price"" is a gamble, not an investment.

I would say;

Investing in ICE auto is not an investment but a gamble that they can survive the death of ICE without going broke. Are they solvent enough to do this and can they develop and produce R&D fast enough and can they convert this to production quickly enough?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you trust Sandy Munro's evaluation of electric motors from different companies, he has said that TSLA's are not only simpler (cheaper to make), but more efficient, and more powerful.  I believe most ICE companies are sourcing EV motors from suppliers and not actually designing and building them themselves (Porsche may be an exception).  You need to provide a source for your statement."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"EVs from ICE-age car makers have generally failed to impress. Certainly failed to de-thrown Tesla as the technological leader. 

It would appear Tesla is the Apple of smartphones. Yes, there is Samsung, and many others. But there is only one Apple.

Most importantly, Tesla is way ahead of the pack in battery procurement and production. The number of EVs you can sell depends on the number of batteries you can source. Ford, GM and others are trying to scale-up, but they woke up late, and will trail Tesla in number of EVs sold for the foreseeable future, because they will trail Tesla in the number of batteries they can get their hands on. 

As EVs become more common place, the Osborne effect will likely hit ICE-age car makers very very hard. Given they already have significant debt, a sales network that stands to lose from the EV transition (far less maintenance), less-then-stellar software expertise (and I'm being very kind here) in a market that is more and more heavily impacted by software - all this doesn't bode well for the incumbents.

The car industry is in the early stages of a technological revolution. In such cases the new players often become dominant, and the few incumbents that survive lose their position of dominance.

And we haven't started talking about autonomous driving. Should this become a reality, we're talking about an even bigger revolution, hitting an already embattled industry."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When it’s paid off yes but it’s still a risk should economic situations change. On the small scale we have seen this with Covid the only segment of cars that held up through a pandemic was EV and Tesla.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ICE have 4 years before they start getting banned.

There is no questionability on that that’s the policies and laws of the country’s leading this.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A debt is still a debt and always a risk. They may be financing the cars but that’s one financial crash away from being a big problem. The pandemic showed how external world events impact companies. Ford and ICE firms suffered badly and has governments all over not been propping up people with one for or other of stimulus there would have been loads of defaults.

On the flip side though Tesla was able to maintain their sales as their products are a moat with more demand and supply. They will too face the same risk as Ford has when they are selling at the lower price points and the risk of national and global financial events happen.

But just keep focusing on single issue rather than the whole work out for everyone so far who said tesla had nothing. Ford has to dispose of so many ICE assets to convert that that will be major financial anchor on them that they will not recoup the capital from"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually, the fact they are so exposed to their customer’s credit as well as the resale value of their vehicles means they have an existential risk tied to legacy ICE products."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford basically has one EV that they don’t want to sell, everything else has an ICE powering it that is legacy and dying tech

Competitors are biting their own heels too. Legacy OEM’s are retooling existing factories, cannibalizing their ICE sales, and having to fight with their legacy dealership models at the same time.

That being said, trade Tesla all you want, I can’t judge for making the most of the volatility, just wanted to point out the above."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, if you were invested in Tesla a year ago and it balloons to today’s valuation and you make several times the money. I think that seems like a great investment.

Should GME be at $190, and reach an ATH on $483? Yet, here we are. Isn’t the point of an investment to put your money somewhere where you can make money? The best investment is the one that makes you money and that’s not something you can determine with a simple numbers/logic comparison."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""200k cars = stock go up from 600B"" is delusion."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The miss at expected 162k cars is currently priced into the stock. There was an anticipated shortage of chips that was supposed to impact deliveries. Street estimates without the shortage shortfall were 172k. To come in higher by this many percent means that the growth model that the share price is currently discounted to match may be fundamentally flawed as a 10% increase over expectations at this point on a growth curve is significantly compounded years down the line. New projections then need to be discounted back to a current valuation. This leads the share price increasing to match the new undervalued status.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they are selling $200-300/month partial or full self driving subscriptions with high take rates? Yes, they will be worth quite a bit.

Unlike Ford or VW, they also get 100% of the profits from service, used car sales, and most of them from public charging. 

And this is still ignoring their other business lines, with utility storage pulling in profits and similar high growing revenue."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"More like 3 trillion maybe, who knows. Ridiculous, but no more than what they're at now.

They're still making tons of new crazy plans, as long as they keep doing that and not totally fucking up then I'm very sorry to the people who care about numbers making sense, but that line will go up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No idea but your lack of thinking outside the box will make you miss a lot of opportunities....thinking like that you would have easily missed Apple and Amazon smfh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Their valuation is partially based on expected growth and future earnings.  As they achieve that growth, their growth rate will slow.  The stock will not include as much of the future value, since it won't be there.  We'll probably see that as a lowering in the growth rate of the stock, which is entirely reasonable and expected.

Tesla is on track to double their production this year, and there's a good chance they'll double it again next year.  They also have a ton of promising business in other areas-- battery design, full self driving, solar and energy, etc.  They're a big name with a high valuation for a reason. They're disrupting multiple spaces, and the one they're deepest in (auto) has a bunch of poorly competitive giants stumbling around trying to actually compete."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just out of curiosity, have you driven a Tesla?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey guys! I found a retard
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude. Ford makes the car. Tesla makes the car, gives you the insurance, runs the stores and the service centers, makes most of the spare parts, runs the charger network, and in the near future will sell the autodrive as a monthly service subscription if you don't want to buy the full self driving package. Then a robot taxi fleet. Then the battery and solar to charge it at home. And the semi monthly leasing subscriptions. And quite possibly a software, games or media store. You are actually comparing Ford with something that will compete face to face with an entire tenth of S&P500. Aunt Cathie calls for 3000 USD the share? I'm actually fearing it will double it. They can wake up in the morning and decide to buy all of Toyota any of this days just for the memes, at the current pace..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are so many manufacturers that already offer decent ev suvs with great mileage and 0-60s, can't really see other manufacturers standing idle while Tesla sucks in the market share for every car brand in the world."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s what I’m always wondering.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. Tesla is the dumbest stock to own. Everyone's going to be shocked when it tanks and the evaluations become realistic. Tesla should not be worth more than most of all the automakers combined. Nobody should buy Tesla stock unless they think they will destroy every automaker and become a monopoly for the entire car industry, because that's what their evaluation means. Oh, and here comes Rivian backed by Amazon too. Don't forget China's new F-150 competitor that is far superior In technology, cheaper, and is selling well in Australia and South America. They will be exporting it to more countries soon. Tesla is not that edgy, they have fierce competition, and they're going to get squeezed out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> times 

What you fail to understand is each Tesla vehicle, long term, will displace ~10x fossil vehicles.

This is not a vehicle market. It is an PTM (personal travel miles) market. When tesla produces cars in Ford or VW range, it will capture 10x as much PTM."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,can't reason with the tsla stans
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually they grew to 1.5 million customers from 1 million almost as fast as they did from 100k to 150k. They will easily continue fast growth for years to come especially when they release their 25k model in a couple of years.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha. U bouta learn what an exponential growth curve is
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe they'll make it work, maybe they won't.

But it's also pretty impressive how far out on a limb they've gone with Autopilot / FSD without it totally blowing up in their face.

Now, I'm half convinced it *will* blow up in their face at some point. Car runs over a family, jury trial, [compromising audio of Musk](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D94QEVsXYAAaw0m.jpg) shows up or whatever, gazillion dollar settlement, pitchforks, torches, etc.

But if it doesn't, I reckon their Autopilot R&D was able to move 2x, 3x faster than competitors because they are just totally okay with managing this level of risk.

And yes, risk includes failing to deliver year after year without actually taking the L."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have fsd in my model y. I would not trust it to fsd, the tech just isn’t there yet. So in part, you’re right. 

On the other hand, I have no regrets having paid for it if it never gets past its current form. It’s a super nice driver assistance tool that provides genuine value right now. Just because I can’t get in the car drunk and take a nap doesn’t mean it’s not fucking rad *right this minute*

I think that gets overlooked a lot. I didn’t pay for fsd because I think the car is going to have fsd in a year, I paid for it because the tech is awesome right now, and it is going to get constant updates for the lifespan of the car. I don’t feel bamboozled by any stretch. 

Food for thought as a Tesla owner who does not own Tesla stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Average, over multiple years. Leaving themselves some breathing room to evaluate and improve designs before building even more factories imo.

Musk supposedly called 1 million this year achievable in recent company wide communication, so it's far from crazy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They are building a factory in Berlin using German labor .  German labor = German car
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You are seriously trying to say that the cyber truck (or future Tesla trucks) is going to eat a meaningful percentage of market share from GM and Ford. Have you not seen the massive pivot of investment towards EVs from all major manufacturers?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who the hell cares if Tesla is overvalued? You trade Tesla, don't own it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right? I think it is so puffed up because it is the only catalyst TSLA has had for a while now, so everyone is acting like it is magnificent. A 10% beat? It's not a fundamental difference."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> so much more than Q1x4=2021 

[erases my notes]"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"But that’s also Q1 production. Tesla isn’t some amazing lean manufacturing company that MTO, they are making every single last vehicle they can and finding an order that fits its specs. They have to increase production 52% starting yesterday over the next 9 months to hit 1M. Assuming they ramp up, and get a 25% increase next month that’s 405k produced end of q2. Leaving them 300k left a Q for the back half. Not impossible, but I don’t get why you are projecting them to be making a milly rather than their target. They aren’t even close."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk if you are saying I’m the smooth brain or them. I’ll take the under on 1M. I’ve worked across the street from their factory for years and get forced into socializing with heir engineers.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"to be fair the other car brands just dropped the ball hard for the most part because they are old brands with loads of people who focused on petrol powered cars their whole live for 30-40 years and with a really slow moving hierachy. that is what fucks them really hard.

building a car in that sense is way easier for tesla then it is for example for bmw and others.
which obviously is simplifying it because tesla is just really good at what they are doing but tesla started from scratch with their EVs while the others still try to make it work with the parts they already are producing, have to please old customers and still need to fit in that company design language and values. Most of them half assed the first generation EVs because of those reasons in times where EV sales are still only really starting. 

bmw for example probably will need a rebranding down the line because their slogan ""sheer driving pleasure"" doesn't work anymore when people don't drive the car anymore. :D"

Permanent magnet electric drivetrains are as simple as the thing that makes your clothes go brrr in the dryer.

Tesla already uses permanent magnet motors outside of performance cars, the early cars and high performance cars used more complex electro magnets instead."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Electric motors are wires wrapped around metal making electromagnets that spin. One moving part. There are also no gears to shift to maintain RPM's in a narrow band. Internal combustion engine drivetrains are much more complex.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It honestly wouldn't surprise me to see a few of the big car manufacturers go under. However, it also wouldn't surprise me to see other, new car manufacturers start up. Hundai and Kia were nothing in the 80's. 90's they were crap. By 2010 they were winning awards for quality. I think automotive manufacturing is a VERY competitive market with deep pockets for R&D. TSLA got off to an early lead, but we'll see if they can maintain. Good luck to you in your investment though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Electric motors are much simpler than internal combustion engines.

GM didn't stop R&D on electric cars. They continued. My point is TSLA wasn't a revolutionary concept that nobody thought of. They just did it at a time when battery technology and government subsidies supported it. There is no reason other companies will not be successful in the EV space."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't disagree with anything you say. I only say that absolutely everything would have to go perfectly for TSLA and they would have to get about 80% of the auto market just to justify TODAY'S stock price. Forget about appreciation. However, I'm not saying the STOCK can't go up (it's not tied to reality), just that the business isn't worth what it's trading at."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> It would appear Tesla is the Apple of smartphones.

You must have missed the part where Apple enters the game."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA giving birth to the autonomous car could also be the legacy that kills/hurts them? i.e. If all vehicles are autonomous you only need to make 5-10% of the vehicles you need to make now i.e. before vehicle sharing? The average household car only gets used a very small percentage of the time?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, since you make no critiques of any of my statements, it's hard to have an adult discussion. Makes me think that you are still at the kids table at Christmas."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Another way to say it is TSLAs price is based on hopes and dreams.


And I want TSLA to succeed, but I have to be realistic about the probability that they actually succeed... And even if they do, that success is ALREADY priced in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point that I have made multiple times is that the amount of growth that TSLA would have to have to justify TODAY'S valuation is impossible.

1/3 of the revenue, 10x the valuation. So TESLA would have to sell 30 times more cars than they do now to be worth what they are trading at today. Basically every car on the road would have to be a TSLA to justify TODAY'S stock price. If every car on the road is a TSLA (for today's price) where is further growth going to come from to justify any increase in the stock price? This thing is priced beyond perfection. Might be a great underlying business, but it isn't worth today's valuation even with impossible growth."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"why do you think a miss is priced in? that doesn't seem coherent at all. tesla is currently priced for its potential value 10+ years down the road, so trying to project a growth function that far into the future is going to be fruitless."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,are YOU willing to spend $300 / month on a car in addition to the cost you already have?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Self-driving is going to become ubiquitous across all vehicle manufacturers as time passes.

Even if Tesla is first past the post on the tech, eventually that feature will not be able to command a premium and subscription revenue from that would drop.

If every single one of the cars they delivered this quarter signed up for a $200/month self driving subscription, that only contributes $432M to annual revenue. If you think $432M of ARR supports a $650B valuation, I have a bridge to sell you. Heck, let's say that they get the $300/month, that is about $650M of ARR if a full 25% of buyers sign up annually. Let's say they 5x that over the next year, that's still just $4B annually. 

I don't think you realize just how much $650B is. You're just looking at the share price, not the market cap."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know and understand an exponential growth curve, I also understand that exponential growth curves can become linear over time. Exponential growth at the minute is possible because there are far more consumers looking to purchase electric vehicles than there is supply, hence why the Mach-E flew off the shelves.

If they were serious they would have brought in engineering, sold a vision, and sent the dividend to future growth. They didn’t do any of those things.

Around the same time the cyber truck will come out at $70k with better specs. Or you could go for a $40k version with similar specs.

The cheapest version of the GM ev truck won't come out until 2024 (if all goes according to plan). And it will be $80k with about the same specs as the $40k cyber truck.

So that is why people are blown away by the numbers and are looking at 1m+ deliveries for the whole year. Maybe with Giga Berlin & Giga Austin coming online this summer, they've got a shot.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The entire thing is absolutely ignorant and not worth my time. I’m only replying because I’m enjoying it. There is a gigantic amount of information available and you don’t seem to have any idea about any of it but want to “spit hot takes”.

Go do your dd. You don’t have to like tesla, or any other company or stock, but coming out fully retarded is what it is, bull or bear.

You’re arguing about a stock many people have put TONS of time into, bull and bear, and your take is terrible. Deal with it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some companies and businesses *are* different. I think Elon Musk is absolutely the next visionary and Tesla is going to not only grow into it's current valuation, but surpass it multiple times if it continues to be led by Elon Musk. 

I would have gladly overpaid for other companies led by visionaries if I had the ability. And by visionaries, I mean guys like Thomas Edison, Henry Ford, Rockefeller, Steve Jobs, Jeff Bezos - etc.

The difference to me between Musk's level of ability to shape our future and these other leaders, is that I think Musk is **MORE** of a visionary. I think anyone not able to see that of course is going to think TSLA is overvalued. Especially if you see TSLA as just a car company that is currently not producing the profits to justify it's current valuation."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> If you think China is going to ban the internal combustion engine, you are out of your mind.

Apparently you haven’t paid any attention to China then. They are the biggest threat to Tesla because the Chinese government is going all in on EV’s they have complete cities that are zero emission vehicles only, they are already banning the ICE.


As for Texas they have bigger issues at hand than trying to be the only place propping up ICE, try creating an electric grid fit for the 20th century for a start, then you can try getting it to modern standards"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is still higher the either ford or GM by ~5%, and many foreign govts won't subsidize their cost like Europe and the US..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We've been hearing the same ""the competition is coming"" since 2013. No car manufacturer has the vertical integration that Tesla has. OEMs would have to gut their whole revune syrram to even have a shot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ford is only managing to make around 50k Mach-E’s in the first year due to cell supply constraints. Even that is only contribution margin positive... not gross margin positive. That means they lose money on each one they make on a gross margin basis.

Hey can’t scale if they don’t have the parts to scale. In the meantime, their ICE business will die.

They can introduce all the models they want, they can’t get any decent volume due to cell supply constraints. Plus they are behind in costs and technology."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"YEHA and of those 21 models how many will they produce in 2021?

I’m betting 50k max.


They can’t even shore up purchasing enough batteries for fucks sake.

Let’s also not ignore that making 21 “EV models” is a fools run meant to get PR.  The idea that they can sustain the design and production of 21 different EVs (even with their cool new “EV platform frame or whatever), is ludicrous.

Not to mention your entire premise that making 21 different models is a GOOD thing is completely upside down."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How many bridges are on sale on this thread
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"21 models. Wow. How many actual units? Didn't MachE get capped at 50k units?  


IF they were as efficient as Tesla they would be able to make \~55k units with the same battery supply. But they're not. They're made in Mexico, their kwh / $$$ ratio sucks vs Tesla, and so much more."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GM said the same thing 2-3 years ago. You know what they have now? A Bigger Chevy Bolt (with same siz battery) the only new feature is driver assist cruise control with pre-mapped LIDAR.

Still waiting on the 20+ electrified vehicles from GM. I was waiting for GM to release something compelling when I owned the Volt."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously man? You think Ford is going to have 21 EVs in 2022? I've got a bridge to sell you...

I trust Volkswagen can scale better than either Ford or GM and look how they've fared in their pivot so far. They've also been way more proactive in preparing for said pivot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think they will have an issue with sourcing a large battery supply.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How? They have to shut production of the most popular vehicle in the world. The f150. . Their losses are in the billions already this year. Ford is dropping below 11$ before may.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"21 models, i hope that's a joke"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not without tax credits they're not. The real answer here is no. Fucky accounting is the norm at Tesla.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are completely ignoring TSLA lack of debt.

You are completely ignoring Ford and legacy OEMs huge debt.

You are completely ignoring TSLA 100% YOY growth.

You are completely ignoring that legacy OEM need to destroy their current business to truly compete in BEVs.

You are completely ignoring TSLA industry leading margins with their economy of scale only now kicking in.

At this point maybe we could introduce the idea of FSD and the rest of their battery and solar business.

It is people like you that have cause me to tamp down my risk tolerance regarding TSLA.  Because of you I have only made eight figures instead of nine figures in profit.

Eh, I will live with it...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahh so you're saying ""in 2016 the stock was bad and I stayed away"" and it's up 1800% since then. Sounds like your 18x an idiot and you lost out. Go fuck off"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You're thinking about it the wrong way. 

All the people who are very bullish on Tesla now buying at 600-800 aren't going to turn into dollar and cents traders overnight once Tesla materializes its future success.

The future expectation is built in and future success will add on to that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can't look at value just based on competitors laterally at the one to one value. Tesla is not your standard car company.

Not all car companies are deep into autonomous driving like Tesla. Apple just bought 50 million dollars worth of batteries from Tesla. What if Tesla starts selling batteries to homeowners for their solar panels as part of Biden's green legislation?

You're looking at Tesla way too narrowly."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your valuation is fundamentally based on a comp with legacy automakers that have a Kodak moment coming up. It is like valuing a new house built to the latest standards with houses that have to first be demolished and rebuilt.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s what matters. I made money when it WAS a good investment. The point being it WAS - hence how money was made from it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just because the price of something goes up doesnt mean its justified. Same for the reverse.  It's just that company that would take 1000 years to earn enough money to justify its value seems like it might be slightly overvalued
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"right, how could i forget that stocks only move in one direction? all of those bears should have learned their lesson from shorting intel in 1999."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck that. Self driving sounds cool that plus a car payment is pretty much a full mortgage where I live
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Taxi companies/Uber, transport companies etc... certainly are. $300 a month is way cheaper than paying the driver."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If I get to drink and drive home at the same time all legal? Fuck yea! Lots of people gonna buy TSLA just for the self-driving. No more fucking paying attention in fucking traffic jams. And Tsla is just scratching the surface of how impactful self-driving will be.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,By the time they bring that to scale the price would be considerably lower.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on how rich you are and what you commute. $300 a month to not need to deal with traffic cause your car does it for you sounds like a small price to pay in major metros.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"would I spend 300/month for a robotaxi that will earn $10K or more/month?  Hell yes.

Of course by that time Tesla will be charging much more than 300/mo for the software... 

and actually then they won't have to sell cars... just roll them out of the factory to immediately start picking up fares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What if you had no insurance premiums. Would YOU pay $300 a month for a self driving car?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For self driving? For someone who's already buying a tesla? Seems like a no brainer.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah. But I throw more money away on a daily Basis on SPY FDs. Money ain’t going with me when I’m dead.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean, I own the full self driving capability package on my car. That covers many, many years of a $200-300 subscription.

So yes, I'm already doing it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No. But is Uber?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes. Once to try it out. But not again. If I like it, I'll say ""cool, on my next Tesla in 5-10 years, maybe I'll add in self driving"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I go hundreds of miles out of my way and spend thousands of extra dollars to get a manual transmission. However, I'm probably not Teslas target audience for this feature."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I disagree in the manner in which you arrived at today's market cap. Essentially, you are basing Tesla's latest deliveries (180K) as a future metric. It doesn't work like this bc you're neglecting future cash flows (future deliveries). So add a multiple to your $432M. 

Also, this ""revenue"" is essentially camouflaged as pure profit. How? Bc FSD is a recurring revenue stream with **very** little ongoing cost. Think Facebook, AWS, Azure, CRM, etc, and Tesla will probably be even better bc FSD is a real utility. I envision dedicated highway lanes for FSD as a start."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What you are not taking into account is Tesla is the only one putting robotaxis in the field *now*.

Fossil companies are scrambling to catch up just on EVs, let alone the AI necessary for robotaxis. Maybe they'll be getting somewhere by 2025.

By that time Tesla will have ~20M live robotaxies out there, and each robotaxi displaces around 10 fossil cars.  If half of Tesla's sales are in the U.S. they will be capable of fulfilling ~100% of the PTMM (personal travel mileage market) cheaper and more conveniently than owning personal vehicles & driving yourself.

Any competition will be fighting over scraps."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA no where close to lvl 5
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How are they going to make money with gps when google maps is free? Make it better? How do you improve a near perfect product that has been in development for decades? Google Maps already perfectly fills its role. Also auto insurance margins are terrible, and unless Tesla is offering insanely low rates nobody will use their insurance, meaning even worse margins. Auto insurance providers now usually make money through bundles with other insurance. Is Tesla going to offer home insurance too?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You know Amazon has had a 1000 p/e several times right?  Not that long ago.  But I guess it was overvalued then right?  LOL
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wash your Hands

And don't bet against Elon Musk.

People are investing in Tesla with the hindsight of what Apple and Amazon achieved.  Nobody is investing based on their current p/e ratio. People are investing for 2024 or 2028."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmfao, yeah keep talking crap. While I’m laughing all the way to the bank, thanks Papa Elon!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazon had a pretty high pe for some time before it came back to where it is now. Combined with FOMO, the Tesla pe makes sense somewhat right now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazon's peak P/E ratio was 3732.43. Sit down boy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You would have shit on Amazon as a fad and an overpriced stock. There was a time where their P/E made Tesla’s look like a boomer stock, in the neighborhood of 3000 at one point."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like lot of people comparing Tesla to other OEMs have never experienced the product. I might be wrong. But go for a test drive. I think it’s a game changer. Tesla has so much opportunity in terms of software whether and energy. Whether it’s selling apps someday to selling FSD. When I used the iPhone first time, it felt like the next step and that’s what Tesla feels like. Just my 2 cents"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Orujo de hierbas and queso manchego. You learn to see the bright side of life... xDDD

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Teslas will last a good 2x-4x longer, but that's not why.

All Tesla are robotaxies, just waiting for the software update.

A robotaxi can go all day, where fossil cars just sit parked doing nothing 95% of the time.

A robotaxi will supply the PTM of 10 fossil vehicles.

By 2026 Tesla sales to private owners will not matter. They will sell to fleets or just roll cars right out of the factory to start picking up fares and printing money.

Nobody is in a position to catch up. By 2030 Tesla will capture 1/3 to 1/2 of TPM with insane profit margins. Maybe more if they are licensing their AI and other tech to the other surviving auto makers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Actually they potentially are. Electric cars are superior to ice cars ever single way except charging atm. They have less parts that could potentially fail.

Are there going to be competitors to Tesla when they achieve full self driving and there are Tesla robo taxis all over the world?

And yes, the cyber truck does look weird and will attract only niche customers. I'd wager in ten years time, the all electric versions of the F-150 will be the best selling trucks on the market. Not everyone wants a Tesla."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Overvalued would mean that it is selling for more than people are willing to pay. I bought into Tesla when I read about their solar roofing concepts and have never looked back. I have tripled my portfolio since then and will not sell my Tesla shares until I retire. These boomers really don't understand that they don't control anything anymore. Most of them have even lost control of their bladder.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are WAY mistaken. Tesla wasnt added until December 21st 2020 at around 640 and was, after factoring in the stock split, 81 the previous December 21st. YoY it exploded WAY before it was included or even announced to be included. I rode that wave all the way up proud that I had done my DD on a company that is NOT overvalued as its self driving maps and technology alone will be worth more than most current car companies. Tesla will likely be the next trillion dollar company and could become the most valuable company before all is said and done. They are constantly looking for ways to build, expand and explore and are not grandpa's GM or GE. Profits are a side effect of Tesla, their primary concern is growing and advancing current tech. This is the direction the world has needed for years and as soon as other companies follow the world will be a much better place. Could you imagine if Amazon worked on actually improving the world?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Starlink baby, that shit is going to put tesla over $1k."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Beat 850k, I can see it. I’m a chemical manufacturing guy, which is fairly straightforward to scale up. Automobiles on the other hand are very labor intensive. Do you know how many people work at that factory?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is a joke right? Elon is shit with deadlines
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fair enough, but your major increases are also YOY. 2019, 63k q1 to yearly 367, 88.5 2020 q1 to 500, it’s going to be tough to get to 1M. That said, I’m in investor."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My comment was that companies who make much more complicated drivetrains (ICE) are not going to have any issue figuring out how to make much simpler (electric) drivetrains. I just worded it bad. Sorry.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think it MIGHT actually be worth what it is trading at today, ten years from now. In the meantime I'm going to invest my money in a company that is valued in such a way that if the business grows, ten years from now the share price will be higher than it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually predict China reverse engineering their battery tech, improving it, and then selling them for half the price.  Tesla is a disruptor with little or no competition, and govt assistance.  Both of those will change soon."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you think tesla is going to 20x its sales in the next 10 years? And also that none of the the legacy are going to be nearly fully EV by then while also getting ICE sales? You're delusional.

CAFE GHG credits continue and there are various carbon trading credits that continue, like the Chinese ones that Tesla is selling to VW.

So Tesla is actually profitable from the cars."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cars are profitable. Setting up 2 multi billion factories in one year is not profitable without credits. If no credits they will expand slower. By the time credits go away in any case they will be large enough to be able to expand without hitting profitability
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take a look at their quarterly reports.  You can clearly see the profit margins on their vehicle sales (sans ZEV credit sales which they break out).  Where ZEV credits have helped is Elon's stock compensation as he continues to hit company targets.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is your fundamental analysis telling you a fair price for tesla should be?

Here's mine. Price/Earnings should equal their growth rate (as a percentage). So for a company growing at 20% per year their P/E ratio should be 20.

(Google PEG ratio)

Tesla's P/E ratio is over 1000, which means they would have to increase in size by 10 teslas every year..... That's how highly valued they are on a fudamental basis."

Everyone and their mother expects a correction here and there, and especially for stocks that run very high, but being on the perma-bear side in this environment kinda means you'd have to make very big money during one of your 10 crash predictions to make up for the other 9.

MOST IMPORTANTLY THOUGH:

Speaking of environment, historically speaking I don't think tech and its potential for transformation of humanity's socioeconomic activities is similar today to what was possible back then. Making faster computers is much much different than making them accessible at the palm of your hand (see smartphone boom).

Tesla is going for similar groundbreaking level of innovation with a SMART CAR + a SUSTAINABLE SUPPORTING INFRASTRUCTURE.

And that's why it's focusing on energy storage + solar too, I'm sorry if nobody can see that but it'not just to expand their commercial activities."

That’s designed for taxis, not the Everyman."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There are a fixed number of automobiles that everyone in the world will ever acquire. This is not an advertisement, or a consumer electronic device, or anything like that. Eventually, the number of vehicles Tesla delivers will plateau because human beings don't buy ten cars annually. 

My math is actually correct. 180,000 vehicles * $200 = $36M/month of FSD subscription revenue. $36M * 12 = $432M annual revenue.

You are treating cars like a growth industry. It is simply not."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If COVID is driving work remote and pushing people out of the cities and into the suburbs/rural areas, robot taxis are not where you want to be.

Unless you fancy buying a new car twice a year."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In regards to the person saying FSD will not work. My Tesla only has enhanced autopilot not FSD and it’s self highway driving is impressive. Using summon (no one in car) in a crowded parking lot is awesome. If the car can self drive in an environment as complex as a Walmart parking lot I’m convinced Elon will have FSD working on the highway.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If all cars they are selling are eventually autopilot and they have people data of driving then they can calculate risks sell insurance at minimum to people using their cars. I also forgot about robotaxi othervtransport business even cargo truck transport business. The potiential is immense and they are right on track. Google map doesnt hve the car mechanics driving data testa can predict more accurately in real time driving conditions etc which goigle gps lacks.

They're a tiny car company, to be fair in my original comment I should've clarified that I was talking annual production, but the point still stands. It's easier to grow from a small company to a mid-sized company than a mid-sized company to a global conglomerate. In order to compete with VW Group in annual production of automobiles they'd have to achieve an increase of 1860% based on last years numbers. It's a huge gap, and it's hard to achieve those types of gains exponentially.

That isn't a goal they'll have achieved anytime soon. If they manage to achieve self-driving vehicle technology to the extent which they have promised, then I'll re-evaluate my position.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol this is so far from the truth. ICE manufacturers have fallen so far behind Tesla that it's pretty much impossible to catch up. EVs are a totally different ball game. ICE manufacturers are gonna have trouble even getting the batteries to produce their vehicles.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s a fair point I think. However, I want to echo the point made by the previous commenter; OEM’s love to publicize how many different models they will offer but say *very little to nothing* about how many EVs they will produce.

To me, that’s a warning signal. I always ask, how many electric (not “electrified”) vehicles will these manufacturers sell and I have only gotten one response which is VW (the group, not just VW) guidance for 1M EV’s in 2021 while in 2020 they produced around 230k. I’ll be extremely and pleasantly surprised if they pull that off and would love to hear that other manufacturers were planning to transition as quickly."

As far as future growth is concerned storage is going to explode. Auto will be a relatively sedate 40x in that time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"P/E ratio is difficult to use with high growth stocks. Tesla, like many high growth companies are managed for the highest growth possible within their ability to maintain liquidity. Basically, they are managed for cash rather than profits. So if you use a metric that primarily measures historical profit, you miss out on growth stocks.

Enterprise value to revenue is another metric to consider. TSLA is around 13x 2021 estimates and under 10x for 2022 estimates. That is pretty much in line with tech companies like Microsoft, but Tesla is growing faster. NVDA trades at a higher multiple.

If and when the story changes, then the multiples will also change."

Many people also work long hours AND have a one hour drive both ways, using that time to relax and sleep instead to also pay attention to the road after a boring as shit office workday.   


In the end people that have the money and can get more comfort than before will do it, quality of life > a few extra bucks saved."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is your math in 5 years?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Running a robotaxi network is just software. It is (relatively speaking) easy compared to designing, building & running factories, neural networks for AI, and the logistics of selling & delivering cars to customers. It is far easier and more profitable to just run the network themselves than to worry about selling to millions of individual customers.

They could sell to a fleet, but even there why let some fleet operator capture that portion of the profit when it is so easy to do yourself?

It does not matter where people live, robotaxis will be cheaper and more convenient for almost everyone.

COVID is on the way out by end of year and does not mean much for th 5 or 10 year horizon. That said, even as working remotely becomes ever more common, the need or desire to go from point A to point B will, if anything, increase as people have more free/flexible time. If you can work remotely, you can work from anywhere... so why not travel and work? Or work from coffeeshop, or whatever? It's like paper. We use more paper now than ever, even though it has been obsolete for 2 decades. BUT paper only handles about .00001% of the information storage/transmission market.

Plus if people do stay home, then that vastly increases the need for on-demand last-mail delivery, whether it's lunch, your monthly Rx, or whatever the overall mileage market is going to grow, not shrink."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I drove a BMW with lane assist 7 years ago and what I'm seeing now bearly looks more impressive. 

And ARK sees what, a 30% probability of an operational robotaxi network by 2025? I give it exactly a 0% probability.

Nothing against TSLA otherwise."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Everything Tesla is doing seems to center on Autopilot yet they don't even have the most reliable system anymore, and without LIDAR it may not even be possible to achieve full self driving. Also risk inclusive insurance is already a thing and many people refuse to use it due to the tracking. Also also you still didn't say how they will monetize the gps system."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly.  PE means very little with a high-growth-potential company
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"YEHA about, 5 million Tesla’s produced a year..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know how fast tesla is growing? Not only their car business but their energy business as well. Their margins will likely be very good as well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am not saying it is right. I am just saying that is why people are buying at these prices.

Amazon had a P/E ratio of 1000 in 2013/2014"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would have to be earnings, not necessarily production. I will also add that Tesla made more profits by investing in that decentralized electronic nickels than by selling cars or carbon credits. Food for thought. And you are right, even with such a growth, you would just start to get a somewhat justifiable market cap."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tesla was such a stupidly easy investment to make after they fixed the model 3 ramp issues. It was a crystal clear AWS or iPhone 4 moment, but unlike those two companies people were completely ignoring it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just so I'm clear, does earnings include all the money they reinvest in themselves in the form of enormous new factories and R&D of revolutionary technologies? If not, P/E doesn't seem like a terribly relevant metric in the case of this company."

If we assume that every single vehicle sold in the US is a Tesla, and further assume that every single vehicle subscribes to the $200/month self driving subscription, that still only leads to annual revenue of $40.8B. 

The maximum amount of ARR one can expect is that figure. Even if they captured that entire number, you are still talking about a 15 P/S at the current valuation. 

Also keep in mind that the largest companies in the world by revenue are Amazon and Walmart. They do like $350B and $550B revenue respectively. Tesla sells a single product, one which has an absolute ceiling in terms of volume. Sure, they have power walls and solar roofs and shit (in the same way that Ford started selling Kingsford charcoal), but those are not their bread and butter."

That's delusional. 

""Anal-ysts have been preaching for ur years how about how the competition is coming... they’ve been wrong about virtually everything regarding Tesla and will continue to be wrong""

And there has been competition, the favoured eco-friendly car of the last decade was the hybrid, not the fully electric vehicle. The competition has officially arrived and Tesla's come third place in Europe, a vital market if their valuation has to be justified. My argument isn't that Tesla is going to fail, it's that it's valuation is unjustified. Speculation and investment aren't 0 sum games. 

"" If u don’t believe autonomous driving is coming and coming soon - it’s prob because u don’t have enough knowledge about machine learning and neural nets.""

Do you care to share your information on these technologies? I'm not a techie. However, I do have a few highly qualified friends that I can share your arguments with and see what they have to say. 

""’m sure some EV competitors will do alright - but many EV companies emerging now are outright scams (cough cough nkla and lordestown). Be very careful about which EV companies u put ur money into (not financial advice, do whatever u want, I don’t care)""

Lordestown and Nikola aren't companies that I care about, the big competitors against Tesla are going to be the companies are going to be Peugeot, Volkswagen, the Mitsubishi alliance (I.e Mitsubishi/Nissan/Renault), Hyundai and General Motors. The first four represent 4/5 of the major players in Europe's EV market (the other being Tesla) and two of which (VW and RNM) are ahead in European market share and one of which is just 0.4% behind Tesla. All of these companies have diverse EV models either on the market or coming to the market. All will continue to make inroads into Tesla's market share in different markets. VW's going to start outproducing them in China starting next year, and McKinsey's research showed that German brands are favoured to American in that market. VW's also going to start hitting Tesla in their American market which Ford has already begun to process of doing (but Ford's a bit of a dud ngl, zombie company).

I'm not denying Tesla's a great company, it's just not the road to global dominance. It'll be a powerful player in the EV market from here on but it's not going to be the biggest, and it's valuation is ridiculous."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Comparing a commodity and a company isn’t exactly apples to apples. The price of a stock is what someone is willing to pay for it. There are very specific metrics on how to evaluate a company and Tesla is overvalued on every one.

People are buying the parts with the hope to sell the parts for more money because they have identified a company that has a high chance of growth (or to receive dividends in lieu of growth).

I know exactly 0 people who are investing in stocks hoping they shrink or take dividends away. (Not here to discuss short selling mechanisms)

The vast majority of dollars do not end up in the stock market because of what -has- happened, they are there because of what -will- happen. 

Past performance is only (an important) one indicator of future performance. 

This is why growth companies are valued much different than non-growth companies. This is why non-growth companies often pay dividends to attract investors. This is why a company that makes 25% the product of another company can be valued 500 times the bigger one - because of the future.

They just started in Germany & growing to other EU countries soon. All of EU will have exclusivity.

They are using MIAS Pharma to speed up the distribution process in the EU market

Plus they are in a study called PREPARE-IT, that looks at a possible COVID drug use. Info on that could be coming out in the next possible months.

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460651](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04460651)

Earlier this year they got into Hainan China's medical hub. Later this year they should be getting approved for Mainland China with exclusivity.

**Downsides.**

1. They have an ongoing case against generics in the US. But that only affects the US market, and only a fraction of the purpose of the drug which only affects less than 10% of sales in US market. They will have exclusivity for the rest of the world.
2. Big money is purposefully holding this down until what I believe will be a buyout later this year. Looking at options, in my opnion the buyout will be between $27-$35 by Jan22. If you can ✋[💎](https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone/)[💎](https://emojipedia.org/gem-stone/)✋ while selling deep OTM calls to buy more shares, you will be good. But you would need patience.

**Update**

Forgot to mention, they recently paid off all long-term debt all at once. A sign in my opnion

a buyout is in the works by years end.**🚀🌕**

Guarantee you a lot of so called ""pharmacists"" ""pharmaceutical workers"" & ""bag holders"" will come out of the wood work to say BS, not happening, worth less than zero. Personally I wonder if they work for **Citadel, Goldman Sachs, or Melvin?** All I can say is use your own judgement. Use the info I've always provided. If you believe like I do that this stock will be between $27-$35 in a year's time, and that only big money is holding it down to acquire cheap shares stay **🤟💎💎🤟 GL.**

**Update1: You will also see a lot of people with low karma points going against this.**

**Update 2: Every first half hour of trading days, big money drop it hard to take out stop loss positions. Use that to acquire shares if you feel like.** 

**Update 3: I want as many people to take away shares form big money. Screw those guys!**"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too lazy to post your positions?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve been bagholding this stock for over a year… good luck! It never turns out to be anything but a turd
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I had bought this years ago before FDA AdCom those criminals screwed me over hard, do I dare try to buy back in?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Marks first and only EC-approved treatment to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk, statin-treated adult patients who have elevated triglycerides (≥150 mg/dL) and other risk characteristics as studied in REDUCE-IT® 1, 2""

VAZKEPA I'm sure has therapeutic value but does not get my dick hard because the arsenal of options to treat cardiovascular conditions is HUGE (competition), many are CHEAP and this one only helps a small subset of patients. This isn't groundbreaking, and it's not going to become a household name like Prilosec. I'm out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The only reason this stock is so low is because it didn’t get approval for VAZKEPA in US, before this they had great growth and stock was headed to $30 until approval got denied. I’ll be watching this one like I have for a while, thanks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,pretty much
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too many catalysts. Cheap shares for people getting in now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro. I had this at 3 dollars a share 3 years ago. It ain't bag holding. It's good pharma that hurts big pharma
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Life is short YOLO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in it to make lots of tendies. They have multiple citations by cardiovascular organizations from Canada to the EU. What you are saying is basically like don't invest in Apple cause plenty of people make phones and computers already.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't understand what you mean. Vascepa is the US name of Vazkepa. It's already approved and selling in US, Canada, & Hainan China."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was literally in it from before it took off with approval.. the too many catalysts have been around since then and look at it.. those catalysts never pan out and they screw up and shareholders get f’d.

I had faith in this company, but now I’m just holding in the chance I breakeven"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amarin is not equivalent to Apple here.. Amarin is equivalent to a startup, and their competitors are equivalent to Apple.

Its not guaranteed tendies to invest in an unknown 3rd party phone company because Apple and Samsung already have the market covered and this phone is not sufficiently disruptive innovation to claw market share away. There will certainly be bumps in $ as it gains approvals (which it will as long as it does not cause harm because doctors never say no to more tools to fight disease) and I hope you make $ on that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read up on it a little bit more, so actually the issue is that a generic company was approved and that’s why it tanked?? I’m slightly confused"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel for you. But for newcomers, too many good news in the pipe this year. EU approval and build up. Billions in revenue from that alone. China later this year. Billions more from that. Possible Covid drug once results come in a couple of months Etc... For you that sucks, but for newcomers they can hold sell deep OTM calls in Jan22 and wait for the buyout that will most likely happen. They don't have to wait that long."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"ok dude. How about you don't invest in it, while me and my wife's bf make like bandits for the cheap shares and options. This will be the next GME."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's the crazy part. The generic only covers 10% of the patent in the US and that's it. Nothing more. Everything outside US if fully 100% Amarin with exclusivity. I will not be surprised if it's bought out by year's end in the high +$30 once China is fully approved and online. In my opinion, this is being held down on purpose to scare weak hand and build up positions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh wow, this could be a great opportunity I’ve been watching this for a long time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Next money maker here selling for far less. More people will be in on this once word gets out.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks like I will be playing TSLA again next week. At this point I’m almost a full-time TSLA trader. This thing prints money up and down.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Glad I saved 1 of my TSLA calls.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Finally Tesla posts are back. All is right in the wsb.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TSLA to $1000 by EOY
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1m sales fy possibly!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this real?! Tell me this isn’t an April fools joke?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't wait for Monday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,im gonna cum
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deliveries seem above expectations but what about product mix?

I would assume that margins are better on the higher priced models, S and X."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why would you bet against Elon, this guy is putting shit in space. He can execute"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Think my TSLA 750C 4-9-21 will print?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg yes it is legit omg tendies await for us in Valhalla!!!! Thank you 🙏
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way the market has reacted to good news lately, might be better off buying puts.  I swear, every time I invest in a stock that has positive news, it drops.  Buy the rumor , sell the news, right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing news today, and yet the market is closed. Seems about right."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10 year will be up on Monday and may counteract this good news
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My cock is harder then it’s ever been these calls are going to print money next week!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wow
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully this causes NIO to rocket this week. I’m tryna sell my $38c’s this week!!!! Then hop on the tsla train
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I saw that although they delivered Models S/X they didn’t produce any. Whys that so?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't buy.. Bad Friday!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I added +3 to those numbers, thank you me TSLA call holders"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think 420 people should post this ... that is my price target
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its the best mini game in the casino
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sell call as it runs up (700 has been strong resistance), close when it sinks. Rinse and repeat."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What strategies do you play on Tesla?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't be modest. When FSD is complete we'll see an AAPL valuation.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes it's on ir.tesla.com
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla 🙌🙌🙌🙌thank you god
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They are. However, they just started adjusting the production line of models X and S for the refreshed models. The 2.000 or so delivered models have been retrofitted with the 2021 standard. I guess, from Q2 onwards the production line of the S and X will start ramping up again."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Swing of 15percent in 1 week? That sounds like like a tesla stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yer except tsla has been on a down trend for months. This could actually be a buy the news situation. We will see.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"10 yr already priced in, doesn't seem to matter anymore."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 10 yr is fake now
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Model refresh and chip shortages. The sales came from the earlier model’s in inventory.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,it's GOOD FRIDAY bro. Jesus sacrificed himself for our calls come Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn straight brother
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy TSLA.

Repeat."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Intraday movements almost exclusively, week horizon maximum.  Scalping options.  On the intraday, buy calls one to two strikes OTM when oversold on low volume, and puts when overbought for more than 10 minutes.  (Obviously there are other factors that I account for and other indicators I use, but I’m putting it simply). Most days there are at least 1-2 excellent opportunities to do this, sometimes 3 or 4.  This thing *moves* when it moves so grabbing 10-100 contracts at a time and doing this is very profitable.  It’s also fun."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,true
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s much higher then expectations am I right?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cheers. I get the impression that S and X haven’t been in much demand for the past year or so. Do you foresee these slowly fading away and Tesla shifting only to 3 and Y?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just do opposite of what I do and it will work out very well for you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"100% agree - as long we we don't see a big gain all at once.  If it's slow and gradual, it will be fine."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's bad if I can't put any in today!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been trading TSLA since last year, took me a month after I was playing options on small stonks that I had no idea how they moved. Doing 1000+ contracts on names like eBay and etsy.

The May 1 Elon tweet was what got me in. I paperhanded TSLA puts and a minute later Elon tweeted, I rode the wave down then rode it back up and been chasing that high ever since.  


Found it again during the July run up and looks like I'll be getting another dose this month"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s my strategy too, 700% gains even when way below ATH."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally someone who fucking understands.  


TSLA is a game of hot potatoes, especially with options. Do not hold the fucking thing for longer than 2-3 days. My most profitable TSLA plays were ones thats literally within 30 minutes or next day like buy the close, sell the open plays.

  
I've been cautious with puts since I always get punished lmao.  


Another thing I'll add is start journaling time stamps on big dips and big rips, overtime you find something useful"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,like 10k more than highest expectations
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can’t we all just give Tesla credit when it’s do?!! Good vibes on these deliveries
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They made nearly 500k cars last year. At this rate 180x4= 720k in 2021 isn't good. With Tesla's valuation, I expect a much bigger ramp up.


Of course they will have more production capacity coming online this year, so I expect this number to accelerate for the remaining 3 quarters."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is their first refresh in years, all previous models just had very small changes. This refresh will generate a lot more sales, espacially the new model S plaid +. Top speed <1.9 sec, range of 840 km... That is game changing, for the higher end market."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So what are you going to do
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"But the market does that to me, too. So if we do the opposite of each other, will that be like the cat with buttered bread tied to its back??"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Make $2k on a TSLA call or put in 20 minutes, I fucking love TSLA.  The first and last hour of trading TSLA is always so much fun/dangerous."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes with gigs press catching on fire and a chip shortage that shut lost of competitors down. the quarter also being 2 days shorter this year...  well done
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Q1 is always weakest quarter, that coupled with supply shortages, a shut down and giga press fire alone with production ramping 900k+ is on the table"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love people that still try to valuate tesla as just a car company 😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, are you joking? 720k is around the average expectation on the street. With COVID ending, Shanghai expanding massively and two more factories coming online this year they're looking on track to reach over 1 million cars a year. That's a 100% increase YoY and could even get close to a 100% earnings expectations beat."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro u are so retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"/u/mcoclegendary is right in that when the 3 came out S/X sales fell. But now with Plaid coming and a refresh it will drive them back up. I expect 2021 to deliver more S/X than 2020. Maybe back to 2019 numbers. I doubt we'll have them back to 2018 numbers though.

[https://hypercharts.co/tsla?frequency=annual](https://hypercharts.co/tsla?frequency=annual)

They're 2 totally different markets and I don't think have much overlap."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bull spread.   I do think it goes up.   But I’m stupid too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta entered the chat
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"An interesting analogy.   One I can respect.  I agree, it is just like that.   Two negatives equal a positive.  So we have that one too.  :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Tell it to Tesla, they made the announcement"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Fuck the street and their analysts.


Tesla said they're aiming for 50% annual growth. Where do you get 100% from?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah of course model Y and model will outsell both model S and X. No doubt about that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Got it bear spread it is
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"500k delivered in 2020, without scaling up they'll be at 720k this year already, after a Q1 that is always the weakest quarter in the industry and was still hindered by COVID, 1-2 days shorter than the other quarters, and while they still have a massive expansion in Shanghai as well as two new factories coming online this year. Last year they ramped over 100% from Q1 to Q4, although Q1 then was affected by a factory shutdown due to COVID, ramping 78% this year with everything that's going on seems very feasible."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Elon's internal conversations saying that 1M units in 2021 are within reach.    They provided guidance for an average 50% growth for 10 years. Some years will be higher, some will be lower. 2021 and 2022 will be HIGHER for sure. 20M / year by 2030-32."
2021-04-02 16:21:11,wallstreetbets,"It's a solid play... Ok, this is gonna be a very simple bit of DD...

The subject is our favourite stonk... You know the one...

Now, there's a lot of very optimistic DD out there, and sometimes I feel that does more harm than good... So here is a simple pessimist DD from the point of view of someone who does believe in the squeeze...

Now essentially every stonk play is gambling... The key to successful gambling is balancing risk vs reward... The ultimate example of this is if you imagine a standard, fair, coin toss. If someone said: ""for every dollar you bet on the coin toss, if you guess right you get 1.1 dollars and if you guess wrong you lose your dollar"", then in that situation the right play would be to take that bet over and over again for guaranteed infinite money in the long run...

So that's what successful gambling is all about. Making these probabilistically sound bets over and over and over...

Now let's apply that to the stonk in question... In a very simplified yet reasonable, though pessimistic, way...

Let's take a conservative top for the short squeeze to be $1000 and a conservative likelyhood for that outcome, given that you believe it is a serious possibility, of 25% chance of that squeeze happening.

Let's also take a pessimist worst case of $0 price for this stock without the squeeze happening at all, and a pessimistic probability of that happening of 25%...

And let's take a conservative case of the stock simply drifting down to it's price target of $170 and staying there, with a remaining likelihood of 50%...

Let's then assume that the average buy in price was an expensive $200 dollars...

So the total expected value of the play is as follows:

TEV = (1000 - 200) * 0.25 + (170 - 200) * 0.5 + (0 - 200) * 0.25 = 160.

SO THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE PLAY FOR EVERY $200 INVESTED IS $160 *PROFIT* ON AVERAGE...

Now that's a damn good play...

End of DD.

---

*Edit:*

It has been brought to my attention that good DD should be more informative. So I will include some, again, simplistic data points to inform and back the probabilistic analysis above...

1. Late January FTDs were in the millions. Ryan Cohen and BlackRock buy a lot of stock. Short squeeze ensued.

2. Short squeeze was artificially halted, and immediately collapsed, therefore the full short squeeze was not squoze

3. Late February, FTD data was underwhelming yet we had a gamma squeeze all the same continuing to early March.

4. Lots of calls at 800. Short squeeze halted at 450. Top of 1000 is a serious possibility.

5. Early March the stock was agressively shorted. Shares available are at zero practically.

6. Retail is buying and holding. Price has stabilized at an unexpectedly high 190

7. Points 2 to 5 and 9 below strongly suggest there is significant remaining hidden short interest that has not been covered

8. We know HFs and whales have mechanisms and leverage to massively manipulate the market

9. A lot of data is hidden to us the average Joe's

10. Points above support a significant chance of a short squeeze eventually, yet point 8 tempers that by a lot...

Given the above information the intial probabilistic analysis in the OP is very reasonable"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I use to go by the simple strategy - *high risk high retard*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read the everything short DD. This is a bigger problem than GME. Citadel have shorted the treasury bond market using repo. Once they get margin called they will have to buy GME at any price, 1000 will be nothing.

The scarier thing is the dollar losing its value so our tendies may become as valuable as Monopoly money"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The ""conservative top"" for a short squeeze is generally 10x the price of the stock when the squeeze begins. 

GME the shorts kept doubling, tripling, quadrupling down which is why it kept going up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This isn't DD
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But i was assured each of my shares will be worth $1 million bananas 🍌🦍🙌💎
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This has been my argument to everyone, currently I have spent 500$ with a possibility of racking in 5000$ as a high if it goes to a 50000$ profit then very cool anything 6 figures and I'm talking about life changing money for me and my family so it's worth 500$ to put in now while I have the money to play with"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here’s why your DD is flawed. You forgot one simple fact,  Wall Street doesn’t obey laws. Not the laws put forth by our government, laws of averages, laws of statistics, it kind of obeys the laws of nature but just kind of."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do the same risk reward with buying the lotto. I bet you still get the same confirmation bias that you should put all your money into lotto tickets
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry OP

with all that has been published in DD etc. -whether you agree or not-  your statement is simplifying too much"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not sure why this is getting buried but ok... 🤷🏻‍♂️

I guess it pleases no one... Believers will feels it's too FUDdy and non believers will think it's too optimistic... 🤣"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lost me at ""1k conservative""."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't think it's going to happen. I bought at $19 and I am still holding just in case but I think the shorts had PLENTY of time to cover when the price dipped to $45 and anyone who thinks they didn't is a fool. I don't see a short squeeze as a possibility after a dip that far. I just like the stock long term so i am holding but anyone who thinks a squeeze is imminent is kidding themselves IMO.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You're mathematically illiterate
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Marijuana is a market performance enhancer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. There is a bigger problem than GME. When they get margin called for shorting the treasury bond market they might have to, or be forced to use all their money to rectify that, at the expense of all other stock. Meanwhile GME shares price stops dead in its tracks, or worse. Given the choice, I’m sure the government bodies will demand the bond market gets made right before anything else. I’m genuinely concerned by this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, I'm giving a very conservative estimate based mainly on the massive number of 800 calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you also borrow money from your drug dealer?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wall Street doesn’t obey laws and the SEC is complicit by giving small fines. 

However, even Wall Street is scared of litigation in federal court houses and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. We have to be willing to fight with everything we have to get our money if after the squeeze Wall Street doesn’t want to pay us."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, but that is why the downside probability is at 75% and the upside only at 25%..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s an opinion so....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Because it’s overly overly simplistic and pretty much garbage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So how come it squeezed at the end of February if they covered at 40?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I second this motion. All in favor say “I”.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s doesn’t stop the GME situation though. Someone is on the hook for that in any case.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes but isn't everything with regards to stock? Unless you have acces to stock market manipulation, or insider trading, or fresh data (which generally is not available to the public or average 9to5 joe), isn't even the best, most throughly researched DD, no more than an opinion?... Aren't we all just gambling here?..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It didn't? What do you even think a squeeze is/looks like??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For starters, your expected value calculation assumes only three possible values for GME: $1000, $170, and $0.

Google ""discrete vs continuous probability distributions."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All in favor stay ""High"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"True, they didn’t borrow those shares from nobody"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I completely agree, but if they are not covering our shorts because they have to cover the bond market shorts how would our shares moon to where we want them to? What would increase the price of ours? I’m seriously dying to know."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"DD is informative, someone’s guesstimating is an opinion. I don’t have an issue with it but it’s not groundbreaking stuff."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sir, this is OTB"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"People that really understand a business know how to break down a balance sheet, income statement, statement of cash flows, bond ratings, debt covenants, etc....real business stuff that can tell you if a company has real value. This...this ain’t that. So no, real valuations are not gambling."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm simplifying to extremes. Would probably work out similarly with a continuous distribution.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All the flavors taste high.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citadel’s broker and the DTCC are legally obligated to cover for them. Meaning they have to buy our shares if Citadel can’t.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don’t think you understand the basic concept of supply and demand. This is not to chastise you, but consider the following:

In the stock market what makes a stock go up? People continuing to buy at whatever price the stock is sold for even if it continues to rise. Now imagine that there are a bunch of people not selling, but someone on the other side is **forced** to buy. 

In this simple exercise, the price will continue to rise until they no longer have to buy. What’s happening elsewhere doesn’t matter, if this scenario plays out. If shorts get margin called and are not forced to cover... well why would anyone ever invest in the US market again?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By your own logic this is DD. Traditional stock DD? No. But, as far as explaining the gambling side of this through a probabilistic or statistical matter, yes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yes, fair enough...

However, I would argue that sensible probabilistic analysis is DD... 🤷🏻‍♂️

But I will edit the post to include data points to back up the analysis thus make it more informative.

Cheers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir this is a Wendy's
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh my sweet summer child... Go pick up a stats textbook, open it up to some later chapters—I mean beyond chapter 3 where you learn about Expected Value of coin tosses and marbles pickings—and try your hand at some more realistic problems using this kind of simplifying intuition.

But no, to be honest, most of the people being critical of you here are only that way because we've all been there and gotten our asses kicked. I have a degree in math / econ so I had to take courses like econometrics. I passed but at times I almost quit for the same reason I quit physics once I got to QM: Intuition stopped working and ""nonsense"" stopped being fun for me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, OK, I understand that completely. We must get paid for our shares. The question I am asking is how much is a share worth? If the shorters don't cover the shares ie buying them in multiples of each other and causing a short squeeze, how will the share price increase? I don't want the DTCC or anybody else buying my shares from me at the price they are just now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re forgetting that they haven’t been playing by the rules at all since this began, so why would they follow any rule in the future. That is to say, they will not be buying en masse market orders because they “have to”... That is a guaranteed way to lose all money and crash economy. At the best, they will liquidate the shorts and cover at a slow enough pace and through dark pools so that the price barely increases and they are able to minimize losses as much as possible. That time frame could take years. But that’s normal for hedge funds and big money to take years for returns anyways. 

We saw the same with Bill Hwang’s liquidation. The margin loans were split among 4-5 banks who decided to slowly liquidate across a scheduled time table so as not to drastically rock the market. Their downfall was one firm decided to frontrun and get out ASAP. However, the rest of the 4 banks are still slowly liquidating at this point, barely affected the market prices in order to maintain stability. I see this as the de facto method for handling large liquidation and covering efforts. 

For all we know, the shorts have already been margin called. And the lenders have been slowly covering for the past 2 months with blocks of buy orders. This may be the reason we see so much buy pressure (rather than there being “hero whales on our side”). And the lenders will continue doing so for god knows how long. Given that this is the Wall Street establishment and banking backbone, they can drag this on for years no sweat."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sorry but you pulled all your numbers and probabilities straight out of your ass and didn’t even bother to really source any of the extra points you added. The only information this post provides is that you personally think GME is a buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"pulling probability numbers out of your ass is not ""sensible probabilistic analysis"" tho"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they get margin called by their brokers or if DTCC says enough is enough find the shares to account for naked shorts with the new settlement rules coming in force, they will have to start buying at market price, as the market dries up the price will keep increasing, supply and demand. Eventually there will be very few shares left and the price will keep increasing as take profits are executed at various prices.
But they have so many naked shorts that the price will just shoot straight up"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will be tricky. There might be court cases on how shares are valued but it probably involves large owners not retail owners. 

I guess I found a weekend project to add to my long to do list for whenever I have a free weekend. Hopefully we don’t need to go that route."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They were selling shares not buying shares when there aren’t enough to buy.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm assuming that the data points are provided are common knowledge by now, hence no sourcing. What is new is not the data points, that would be impossible by now. What is original here is the analysis which I have not seen anyone else do yet... Please correct me if I'm wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Please see edit with data points as DD for probabilistic analysis. I'm being pessimistic about the upside and also on the downside risk. Further any one claiming to have probabilistic analysis that is anything more than a very rough estimate would be very disingenuous... I honestly believe this is as solid DD as it gets regarding this play...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Uh, no it’s not solid at all."
2021-04-02 14:14:38,wallstreetbets,I bought on the way down and on the way up. Does that count as diversification? 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bought in Oct after seeing the dds here, quite a few options at different prices. started with around 15k.

Bought more options and stocks on the way up and closed a few positions at 350 and 400+ upon seeing them do away with the buy button.

As it went down ... I just kept buying back.

Enough money for me to retire I guess; just a dumb ape so I decided to continue holding this stock I really really like. Not financial advice of course, whos dumb enough to buy so much?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,15k to 1.4M astounding
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I only buy at the tip so I don't have all the effort climping to the top.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd really love to know how many millionaires has the GME squeeze made around the world. I think I've seen like ten different people here who have posted about it. Must be in the hundreds at least around the world?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it does!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish I was as smart as you. Started with about 7k in November. Bought shares and options and then used margin to buy more as it started climbing into the 30s. Sold a few shares at 350 to cover the margin. Sold all the options at the worst time and sitting at an account value of $100k instead of $500k+
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Could I have $20k please to pay off my college debt so I can become a trader too

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, most certainly yeah."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can someone please explain stocks to me. I know, I’m that guy, and I’m sorry. I’ve been trying to learn about them but I don’t know what anything means. Everybody just says “google it/YouTube it” like man I’ve tried but that doesn’t tell me what I need to know or I’m just clicking on the wrong links. I’m not sure what’s going on but I feel like something great is passing right by me and I’m just ignorantly smiling as y’all take advantage of it. I want to be apart of that. I hate that I see friends and family working/struggling around me when I know I don’t have to if I can just play this right. I want to help my mom. I know, I’m probably gonna get shit for this, but if anyone has a little extra time today I would really appreciate it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost, you also need to buy GME from several different(get it) brokers. That is diversification."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, that’s dollar cost averaging/reducing your cost basis

The important thing is do you like the stock?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wtf how much money yall have? Is that  infinite money glitch?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Almost 6,000 shares. GFC! You will be able to  do some amazing things with all those bananas"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s called dollar cost averaging. It’s not “diversifying“ but it is the correct way to keep adding to an investment
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you're diversifying autism with idiocy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You didn't buy on way down or way up, you just bought lol.  ""Oh is there air to breath? Better buy GME."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like you're winning
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dont post anything related to gme 🤨
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is Gme gonna bounce again then? Looked at it $50 a share and didn’t bother. Wish I had now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You made the right choice fellow ape. Congrats!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginning to realize these aren’t apes but rather stupid sheep
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's called cost averaging. Diversification requires a variety of investments to reduce risk. Gme is more of a trade stock at the moment but you are treating it like a long term buy and hold investment.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The way I started was unfortunately like what you were recommended; to google around, but to google on the right things i suppose.

Start looking into some investopedia sites on some of the terms going around; everytime there's a word you don't understand, just keep reading until you make some sense of it.

Download a balance sheet from a random company, and google the terms to slowly comprehend what everything means in the grand scheme of things.

I'll suggest reading into stocks first and ignoring anything options related; read into the different way people analyze stocks e.g discounted cashflow model.

Go take a looking at morningstar and look at the ratios, and google what they mean and at what numbers people perceive to be cheap and expensive. Start small from there. 

Various subreddits here other than WSB has many guides and introductions on valuations and what stocks are; you can start there.

Once you have learned how to value stocks and buy stocks, profit and then throw that money into options and flush it down the toilet, WSB style.

Obviously not financial advice."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just remember for every guy like this that turns 15k into 1M+ there are WAY WAY more that don't even come close or even lose some if not all their investment. This guy made this amount of money mostly through Option contracts so not only did he have to get the price direction right but he's on a time crunch too. What if GME didn't make this move until later this year or next year? He potentially would have taken a large loss.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not financial advice, I literally poopoo and peepee onto my crayon drawings for the thrill of the sport. 

I will explain to you what I wish someone explained to me when I first started trading stocks. Don't throw your money into the market without going to a brokerage like TD Ameritrade or Fidelity, and download their trading software (Thinkorswim for TD, or Active Trader for Fidelity) and look up tutorials. These softwares usually have ""paper trading"", or the ability to make trades without real money for the sake of practice. The bottom line, is to learn your respective software (which one really doesn't matter), and read as much as you can about the different styles people have for interacting with the market. Using paper money for a few years is the best bet, as you'll get to know your own trading strategy and observe the market's behavior over a long period of time. You'll quickly find that a trading strategy might work in a certain market condition, but will completely fall flat in another condition. This is because no matter what you read on Reddit, or Motley Fool, or Seeking Alpha, or even Finviz, ZERO PEOPLE other than the market makers on Wall Street that have access to the real-time order flows have any idea whether or not a stock will go up or down. This is why it's so important to do what another user said and download a balance sheet for a random company, since these numbers are part of the ""fundamentals"" of a company and are pretty much all you're going to get in determining how well their stock price will do. Even then, it's flirting with divination. 

If you really want to help your family, consider investing in an index fund (look up tickers $VTI, $VOO, $QQQ). Index funds (and ETFs) are baskets of stocks that are bought by an investment bank that track a certain index. They allow you to invest in a highly diversified collection of stocks that track a certain part of the market or even a particular industry. $VTI, for example, is an index fund that tracks the total stock market, and moves up or down with the general trends of the market (the general trend historically, of which, is up). It even pays a dividend, which is basically a quarterly/monthly payment YOU receive for holding a stock. Index funds, since they are tracking a large, diversified basket of stocks, allow you to reap the benefits of diversification, without the need to learn how to be a star stock-picker or applied portfolio management. In fact, the returns you will get from investing in an index fund, over long periods of time, will almost always (by a large margin) beat stock-picking. Active managers simply do not make better returns over long periods of time than the overall index. That said, a few grand tossed into just $TSLA a few years ago would've made you a millionaire. It's a crap shoot, so if you don't have the money to lose, focus on saving and investing in safe bets as you build up your war chest. Being fiscally responsible and productive will help those around you more than picking the next $GME."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're looking for investment advice you need to go to /r/investing or /r/stocks. This is not a sub to learn the basics it is instead a place for fairly knowledgeable people to make risky, but often calculated, bets.   

But the short of it is that a stock is a portion of a company that is worth a certain value based (theoretically) on that companies fundamentals. The better a company performs or its future outlook, the more likely the price of that stock is to rise. The flip side is true and the worse (theoretically) a company performs the more likely the stock is to drop.  

A companies value on the stock market is the number of shares outstanding x the current trading price. A company like Apple (ticker $AAPL) has a market cap of $2.06 trillion with 16.79 billion shares available, which puts the price of a single share of Apple at $123. Check the stock value and look https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL?p=AAPL it costs $123 to buy one share.   

So although a company may have a smaller market value, its number of shares available for trade could be less so it trades at a higher price.   

This is why some companies like Tesla ($TSLA) which is a $635 billion company trades at a stock price of (currently) $658 as they only have a total stock outstanding of 959.85 million.   

This is basic supply and demand.   

Buying a share is a Long position because you're usually buying it now expecting it to increase at a later date.   

Some companies pay dividends which is a payment to you from the company for a certain percentage specified by the company as a reward for investing in them. Your money makes you money but its return is smaller than your initial investment to get those shares in the first place.   

That is the absolute bare minimum to understand what a stock is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I feel like something great is passing right by me and I’m just ignorantly smiling as y’all take advantage of it

That sort of thinking will ruin you. There's even a name for it (FOMO). For every million dollar post you see, there are thousands losing money they can't afford to lose buying stocks on a hunch. 

People make or lose money based on the conviction they have on a particular stock. Something great will ALWAYS pass right by you but you don't have to dive in if you don't understand it. Not making money is a lot better than losing what little you have."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is exactly what I was wanting. That's a lot of info, thank you. 

The section about index funds really interested me. If they almost always beat stock-picking, and if you're receiving dividends from the companies you're investing in, is the only reason to invest in a single company is for the hopes of what happened to OP here? And I'm sure it depends on how much you have invested in said index fund, but how much can you receive monthly by having those dividends be sent to you? It doesn't seem like there's much risk when it comes to index funds."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for such a detailed reply, doc. 

I’ll go and spend some time browsing those Reddit’s. I kinda have a grasp on the basics but not necessarily an understanding of them. It seems like I have a lot of reading to do. 

It’s interesting to know that it depends on the number of shares available within the company that dictates the price and not just how big a corporation is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for calling me out. I didn't even know I was really thinking like that so to say. I've been having a hunch for MONTHS to invest in GME and others that apparently are ""going to the moon"" but I agree, you don't have to dive in if you don't understand it. So I haven't. And thankfully because of that I haven't lost anything, but nor have I gained. I'll be patient. I'm young and I like to think I'm smart. I guess the reason I haven't invested in GME yet is because I want to save and be ready for the next one."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The platform use is good, except their prices aren't live their 15mins delayed. Opening an account plus transferring money is pretty simple. The platform has lost of neat tools. I don't know about an ISA account with Saxo."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read this http://i.investopedia.com/inv/pdf/tutorials/stock_basics.pdf

And, this is only a drop in the ocean. If you knew how much there is to learn, you'd already give up. So, learn not because you want to just make money but because this interests you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It seems like there isn't a lot of risk, because there isn't. Especially when investing in a fund with a large net like VTI (it has 3,500+ stocks in it). Side note: you do not receive dividends from the companies in the fund's holdings, you just receive the dividend from the index fund itself (in VTI's case, 1.38% yield which comes out to about ~$0.70 per quarter, per share). VTI, like most dividend yielding stocks, distribute dividends four times per year at the end of each fiscal quarter, rather than monthly. Beware of stocks with high monthly dividend distributions, because that means they are prioritizing shareholder payments rather than reinvesting shareholder money into the company/fund to improve it. In the market, if it's too good to be true, it usually is. That said, even if you're holding an index fund, a market crash a la 2008, 2018, or 2020 will still affect you, there is no running from the market crashing. That is the inherent risk with putting money into ANYTHING in the stock market.

The reason to invest in a single company is if you have high conviction in the company. For example, a popular growth stock is Apple, since they have an incredibly strong innovation track record. Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google account for a full third of the stocks tracked in the entire NASDAQ, so Wall Street in general has a high conviction on these particular companies. Warren Buffett's largest holding in his Berkshire Hathaway portfolio is Apple. 

Many people find themselves in a position where they are largely invested in a single company when they work for said company and have company stock that is granted to employees (many companies will offer employees stock in the company as part of or instead of a pay raise). For example, I've heard of someone that has $1.2 million in AT&T stock since he worked as an engineer for them since the 80s. AT&T pays a great dividend, and his retirement is fully funded by AT&T dividends that he reinvested into fixed-income bonds. He never has to work again a day in his life."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"One small advice. There will be days where it will feel like there is no chance for you to understand a concept because everything about it sounds like Latin. Sleep on it, but don't give up. Some ape was able to learn it, so you too can. Document things as you learn, especially when you don't fully understand. Document it the way you understand it, and also what you don't understand. Days later (or even weeks later), if you continue striving to learn, things will start coming together.

The other thing is that Google Search is only as good as the keywords you feed it. Some days, you will search and search and find nothing. But when you finally discover the right word you needed to search, you will get the result you wanted to see.

Finally, some concepts are just simply harder than others. Accept it and be mentally prepared. This is very true as you transition from equities to derivatives (options, etc.)."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No offense but if you’ve actually been seeing stuff about it for months, it would take literally a couple days to understand what’s happening

Realistically you probably heard about this when it first blew up like a lot of new investors and it’s good you didn’t yolo a bunch of money in. People are still down 40-50% on a stupid easy money making opp

As for understanding stocks, it’s not that complicated. Making good plays is hard ofc but there’s not much to it. You think a company will be worth more? Buy. What affects this value? Their sales/revenue and people’s opinions on them 

If you want to learn basic take a couple hundred bucks and put it into big name companies or ETFs and see how they do"

You and the other few that have reached out have shared quite a bit and honestly I'm surprised from such detailed explanations. I'm going to look into Fidelity, and download Active Trader. There I can practice paper trading and just try to get used to that process. 

The question that I'm expecting not a clear answer to is: how do you know? If the  only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do? I know you can study the history of the company and the history of the stock price but is that all you have to go off of? It is as simple as seeing the line graph go down like it has before, buy, and then sell when you feel its reached a climax and before it goes down again?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its 10 dollars commission per trade and id say their commisions is on the higher end of brokers im sure their cheaper brokers out there but Saxo markets is what my bank uses when want to trade in foreign stocks. The premium accounts have access to more things like AH trading and live pricing for fees.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">how do you know? If the only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do?   

You don't is the simple answer. Market makers don't either. 

The first thing to understand is that a stock is only worth what people think it's worth; and what they think it is worth is what they're willing to pay for it.   

How do you determine that? Well like you've said you look into the fundamentals of a company. What do they offer? What is the demand of that service or product? Is there a place for it? What growth have they shown to improve our expand? Are they getting rid of dead weight in the company? Are they early in their market and in your opinion completely under valued based on what they're offering? Are they hiring known people with a history of massive returns. Etc etc for a million other reasons and possibilities.   

We call this doing your Due Diligence, or DD for short. It's making sure that before you decide to go long on a company that you have done as much research as possible and have a very high certainity that it is going to plan out as you see. It's a risk, it's always a risk, because going back to what I said although you may be ""right"" if the majority don't agree on your valuation then you're out of luck. But if you're early and it sky rockets then congratulations you've hit gold, enjoy your tendies.   

Selling is purely when you feel its the right time to do it. There's a saying on this sub if it's good enough to screen shot it's good enough to realise (sell). But people are greedy and usually hang on for more and more and lose out as the market corrects itself.   

Some companies are seen as ""safe"" due to their consistent year on year profits, like Coca-Cola, but because of this your investment is unlikely to make any substantial growth in the short term, because its expected to perform very high, so it has a slow trend up and tends to trade sideways.   

But it all boils down to doing your research, having a great understanding of the product and its application, and trying to spot future trends etc. Then making sure youre not blinded by your own research and challenge it to make sure you're right.   

There are things like ETFs that exist that are basically a group of companies all put into one ""stock"", and they're fairly reliable because even if only one company fails to perform the other companies in that ETF can make up for it.   

The most common one I expect you to know of is $SPY. Which is a group of the top performing companies in America. SPY 100 = Top 100. SPY 500 = Top 500 etc. But that's another topic."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> how do you know? If the only people that know are the ""market makers on Wall Street"" when a stock will go up and down, why do you invest when you do?

You invest based on probabilities. There's a reason why a lot of poker players are good at trading. Trading is all about probabilities. You form a strategy, test it with small amounts repeatedly until you have confidence in it. Even then you can be wrong. A good trade can lose money. And a horrible one can make you lots of money. The hard part is knowing the difference. 

Everybody gets it wrong but the key to trading is risk management. So, even if you lose half the number of times, you can still come ahead if you have a 1:3 (risk:reward) strategy. Look up position sizing to learn more."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣 Imagine paying $13.04 for 64 AMC shares back in January like me. Oh well. 😂😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't say so. You could very well see a spike up to 12 or maybe over by the time may comes around. Just keep up with your alerts.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All it needs is one good run day to be able to recover. I dont think AMC spikes are done yet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was disappointed when I heard the news pre-market about shares and considered buying puts.  Ill just keep selling calls and collecting that premium until they get called. Fux it now
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You better hope amc goes above 12 and stays there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Iir greeks right the Delta is saying you have a 44% chance of it being in the money. But I'm not bumpy brain.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With that high of IV you need to be worried about theta decay. This is not a lost bet tho, you still have a lot of time on the contracts still and AMC is now starting to show movies again. If AMC doesn’t start moving your way in the next two weeks, lighten the load or dump"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk if people here just haven’t figured out how options work but you can very well be ITM and still at a loss. Learn your gawd damn Greeks, I feel like my dad saying this shit but , I been in this game for 1 year & - 60k later trading options without knowing what the fuck I was doing... I finally learned the Greeks & stopped buying shit like this & bag holding like a retard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"21st of May? Might be cutting it close, but I think it'll print if AMC releases these new 500m shares and they recover within April."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Such a shame with AMC they had to do that shit with the 500,000,000 new shares. I can see it going badly now, the holders ( I was one of them before that ) had a massive opportunity, and I believe people in the boardroom were paid to fuck us by the hedgefund. I moved everything to GME the day they proposed this ‘vote’."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, you keep fuckin with AMC. Stop wasting money on anything other than GME. Hell, I'm eating ice for dinner."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yes

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yikes you shoulda looked to see what amc does every Friday, it always takes a large dip in the last hours and pushes more strikes to otm and leaves them expiring worthless. Still a lot of time on that tho so I wish you luck it could definitely happen it was at 20 not too long ago for a week or so"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your wife & her boyfriend have each other, so yeah, it's probably just you screwing yourself now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just another retard but isn’t 500millon share 50,000 more than what is in circulation now, that is outrageous if correct. What will the share be worth on paper $3 ?????"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I did 90 Shares at about the same and I'm averaging down on shares.  I'm just going to hold onto this one for awhile.  Once theaters open again people will go back.  When 11% of frequent moviegoers (defined as once a month or more) make up 47% of tickets sold  in the US. (2019)  It's just a matter of time until this goes back.  It may take a year or two to pay off some of the debt incurred by COVID, maintaining empty theaters, next to no revenue, but it will come back. 

 I don't buy the digital sky is falling talk, the way attendance.  Watching Godzilla v Kong was painful on my 75 incher.  I need that in fucking IMAX."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You understand that the share dilution still has yet to be voted on right? And that the CEO himself said that it wouldn’t be utilized right away even if it does get approved.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually 13.5 is his break even, js"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You obviously don’t know how options work doesn’t need to hit 12 to be in profit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This isn't bag holding. This is wall street BETS. and this moron BET that AMC will pop up. If it pops to $14 a share any time before mid May, then this guy is allowed to whip out his wang and slap you with it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm leaning on voting against. There are better ways of raising money. If they want to help Melvin out of a squeeze they can do it with fewer shares.  


Edit: I just submitted my vote against authorization for issuing new shares. Everything else I went with board recommendations."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think that’s how it works but I’m just an ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Coulda just voted no
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are they issuing those or did they just vote to have them available? Expect they might release some, but if they dump that many they might be in penny stock range soon. Know they need the cash, but... damn."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn't it be a split for current holders? Not just add?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's what I'm saying. They're only trying to get authorization to issue 500M shares. Keyword: authorization. Doesn't necessarily mean they'll issue every one.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The better ways are revenue (which will take a while) or debt (which they are up to their eyeballs in). Issuing new capital should be a last resort and ideally have a plan behind it on how to put money to use so it benefits shareholders long run even if in the short run they are disadvantaged.

To me seems like lose/lose: not sure if the new share issue would solve their issues, and not sure what their plan is if/when it gets voted down. Given the size and sentiment or retail I can see that happening."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I also agree, no new shares. They literally just made new shares a few months ago, if even that long.

Where do I vote?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The call is for May 21st, so, if the price goes up over $12 by then, then he can at least exercise the call and sell the shares for profit....

Why even comment then.... ""I don't think"", yeah, we know"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t believe our vote will matter. I’ll wait until the outcome to decide if I invest or not
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if the vote passes, there has to be another vote to release them. There are also SEC rules where you can't just do one big dump of them. It would be incremental. You're looking at the very least a couple years before all shares would be on the market."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME is doing everything you're just too stupid to figure it out
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That 90% dip in AMC/GME made many of us immune to FUD.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, don’t discount the possibility of a Christmas miracle"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This probably is another last ditch effort tbh.

They paid of a stack of debt, but still have billions to repay.

They would ideally sell chunks of stock for 10k a pop, with something like a 1% discount to raise temporary money, against share price... They already have so many goddamn shares it might not even hurt price. 

It looks like even just the sentiment of dilution hurt their price today... Maybe they can drop their stock price enough to incest in themselves tho? 

There are literally hundreds of technical possibilities"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TD Ameritrade sent out an email with the subject starting ""Vote now!"" in mid march.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don’t think these calls are going to print if they sell 500 million more shares is what I meant.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you just making up the shit about another vote to release them? What sec rule about “where you can’t just do one big dump of them”?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME's 10-K didn't look much better than AMC's if we're being completely honest:

\--Under earnings estimate

\--Closure of almost 700 locations

\--No real estimates for growth in the 10-K. None of Cohen's ambitions were outlined

\--Talks of their own dilution with the ATM program expansion

People really want to pretend fundamentals don't matter for GME, but expect everyone to pull out the magnifying glass for AMC. Cohen could announce tomorrow that they plan to open a Gamestop on the moon, even though it is absolutely not in their budget to do so, and people here would believe it, lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What like buy calls and puts like months out , with about 50 bucks between each and the actual  stock price ? Than just wait for the swings and sell ?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"100%, there's not even a guarantee that just because they have the right to issue the shares they will, but:
1) I don't see how else they can get themselves out of the situation they're in
2) 500m shares seems like a shitload, that's like 100% of outstanding shares. My company is asking for approx 10% to further expand our commercial capabilities and even that is not a sure thing whether it gets accepted by shareholders. I can't imagine them getting the rights to this and somehow leaving the authorized capital on the back burner, ESPECIALLY if they feel like the current price is temporary due to some stuff on message boards they don't fully understand but they think it can go down as fast as it went up
3) self fulfilling prophecy as the temporary influx from retail was predominantly there to get them some tendies. Having the value of their investment halved overnight with no guarantee of a squeeze beyond the gammas of the past few weeks may be enough for a significant amount of them to cash in now, expecting others to do the same

There's a number of reasons why I am more bullish on GME than AMC (debt situation, SI etc) but the biggest difference in my opinion is that Ryan Cohen seems to be arriving with a vision and has already dramatically altered the management team with the BoD to follow, you feel like things are being completely transformed over there. Regardless of your stance on either stonk, surely AMC holders would love it if they too had some kind of vision and transformation driving the fundamentals regardless of the fuckery with the stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh that's right, I already voted then"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That is because you don't understand how it works. Lets say consensus is for the 500,000,000 shares, they still have to have an ADDITIONAL shareholder vote to release them. Finally, according to SEC rules, they would only be able to introduce a certain number of shares per quarter out of the pool.

&#x200B;

It is exactly why companies with already large share prices don't dilute all the time for infinity money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was common knowledge:

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme is not dropping 20% every other day, that I can tell you for sure. They're not putting news destroying the rep by putting share dilution to a vote, I can tell you that.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent analysis, my man"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is the issuing company here so rule 144 doesn’t apply. Did you actually read that link? Also waiting for your support that the ceo would need another vote to “release” shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I bought a call and a put , had to double down on the put once and made about 7k most recently"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And? People are making money on amc by doing puts for the past several weeks. People made money today on puts because amc keeps dropping way more than gme.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Talk about it after the share dilution vote.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm sure people make money everyday , as long as they are smart about it . And gme did have 20% swings every other day except the last week and a half maybe 2 weeks but there was a swing like 2 days ago so I have no idea why you're being a little retarded asshole . I'm just here because I like the stock. Prick ."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You made a statement and gave me anecdotals and try to invalidate my info without giving any supportive proof (granted I didn't give proof neither and i recognize that) and then you called me names because you didn't agree with me which makes whatever info you just give out invalid because you got emotionally defensive on the internet.. But you're right you're not a financial advisor.. you're just a asshat whom got upset and became a keyboard warrior on Reddit.. you lame. 😂😂😂😂😂😂
2021-04-02 08:40:03,wallstreetbets,"NFPs tomorrow and the treasuries market (TLT, GOVT, AGG) While everyone has their grand day off (including me, even though honestly I should be at the desk because the mortgage/TBA market is still trading), we have the currently most important piece of data to come out of the United States. 

(as an aside, right now NFPs are 1st, even though I can see CPI inflation becoming the most watched in the next couple of months)

Those are the non-farm payrolls. Basically employment numbers, or how many of our fellow apes have finally hit 0.00 on the account and now gainfully employed and contributing to society through manning the Wendy's counter. The more wagecucks, the more spending. The more spending, the more companies have to hire wagecucks and so on. 

https://preview.redd.it/v8svd5o9soq61.png?width=1146&format=png&auto=webp&s=6f1d0fb1341907cc26729ba79b968c4eb6a39698

I fully expect a blowout number, well above the 647k which is what we're playing with (expectations are set at 650k, so the higher it is, the more unexpectedly bearish for fixed income, and the lower it is below 650k, the more bids there will be for fixed income). 

Why? March takes into account the massive jump in vaccinations. This also plays into the fact that in March, around 20 states have increasingly lowered their age restrictions for vaccines. Every reasonable business owner sees this, and because there is a certain 1-2 week or so lag between interviews. Remember in March 2020 when everyone is trying to front-run the dips, June/July front-run the recovery, and now Citadel trying to front-run the RH GME Diamond Hand Apes? This is the same thing but now in the employment market. 

And this time, all the job gains are in the service industry, the same industry that vomited jobs as we entered the lockdowns. Do you need someone with skills to flip burgers? No. This is all low-hanging (easy to train, no need for previous experience) fruit that's about to get harvested not by hand, but with an industrial thresher that will make your mom blush. Companies are able to hire truckloads of these $7.25/hr minwagecucks because they're cheap, and this time they're needed. In every economic cycle, low-wage service sector jobs are the first to get dumped off the cliff, and first to get shoveled back in. We're just seeing the start of this.

**What does this mean for:**

**Equities**: all these boomer/doomers need to STFU and go suck Cramer's ass hair. A rising yield is good for equities because if a treasury is pulling in 2%/yr RISKFREE, equities need to go higher. Why did tech do a 10% correction during the last 10yr jump from 1.5% to 1.75%? Because no one expected it to go that high. Now my fellow retards at the office and I are expecting 2% to hit as early as June, and so is every other person I'm talking to (mostly my mom). 2% is as good as priced in right now, and because everyone is expecting it, I do not expect an equities tantrum... unless we somehow cross that line and go straight into 2.5%

**Bonds**: this has what I've been mostly doing, apart from some ag and metals. Simple as that - yields go up, bond prices go down. No need to worry about blah blah how this will translate into growth. From basically the realization that the US is going to lead the way with vaccinations, this thing has been going straight down.

&#x200B;

Why tomorrow? Equity markets are closed. The treasuries market will be open, but extremely light in volume. Any blowout number, coupled with no one to trade may lead to a vaccum, amplifying single direction moves. Perhaps we might even get a [rare circuit breaker](https://www.cmegroup.com/trading/price-limits.html#interestRates) in the treasuries futures markets. 

Good luck all. Positions below. A lot of 129 Puts for June, which I don't expect to go ITM.

Also you guys buying TLT puts are kinda throwing money away. IV for Puts of the May chain are like 15%. Similar IV for Puts of the June chain (also 50 days to exp) on /ZN (10yr treasury futures) is around 5%. I know it's 20yr vs 10yr but srsly the duration should not mean you're paying 3x as much for volatility. Larry Fink or whoever is writing these is laughing to the bank.

**Current Business Situation**

* Last year, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO made $9.04 Billion in revenue.
* They spend more than $-14 Billion with a loss of $-3.0 Billion.
* Investors lost $-5.4 per share.

**Future Projections**

* If they stop growing, the company will be worth $14.8 per share.
* Based on Wall Street forecasts, the company will grow at 18.1% a year for the next 5 years. That means SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO will be worth $50.4, which represents a **-17.5%** downside from the current price.

If you assume by 2025 LUV goes back to pre-pandemic earnings and P/E - then the stock is **overvalued** by 17.5% ...

Disclosure: I do not long or short LUV"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir positions or ban
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love bear DD for airlines
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep. People all think LUV will bounce back the quickest because it has the least corporate travel and the worry is corporate travel isn’t coming back as quickly / may have permanently changed. So folks bought in hard and now it’s super overvalued IMO.

I like UAL more, but it does have a good chunk of corporate clients. Alaskan was another good one but has recently gone the same way as LUV.

AAL has legitimate operating issues and a ton of debt so I’m not touching that one."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Went long 155 shares under $30. Still long 100 shares. Trimmed it back 55 shares at about $40. Got a short call for September at $57.50 since that’ll be LTCG. I’m happy to sell at that price.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My preferred airline is IAG - during pandemic they brought up competition in multiple regions. Post-pandemic their stock will go higher than it was and it’s still cheap imo. Price will hike when London/NY route re opens
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wall Street growth forecasts are too low with GDP set to grow 6-10%
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"A lot of people skip over JetBlue ($6B-market) but it’s a good candidate to be merged into someone larger like Delta or Southwest. It’s also a good looking candidate because it’s only $20 now (wishing I held my $14 shares from Nov!) and it’s one of the few airlines that specialize flights to the Caribbean and Puerto Rico (Puerto Ricans love seeing their families back home!! Trust me, my grandma still flies every 2-3 years and she’s in her mid 80s!)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m with you on UAL. Like LUV, but see more upside with UAL. Already own BA, though, so probably won’t go into an airline."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I'm surprised but glad to be wrong :D. Insane numbers considering all the slowdowns this quarter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tesla leaps. Sure they’re great if you have 25k for one for damn contract or go so far otm even Cathie wouldn’t buy it. I hope he hits Monday am!! Then hope aboard the SPY train. It’s the only option worth doing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I just buy shares, use margin if I want leverage."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idiot.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, they are pretty expensive. I have 5 360 calls, 3 400c and 2 600c all purchased last year. The 360 calls started as 1 call for 10k pre split. 360's expire June 2022 the rest are Jan 2023. Right now is great time to buy AG leaps 12 or 15 strike imo. I'm just some retard on the internet though so invest at your own risk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can buy vertical spreads for as cheap as you want. Just capped profits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hopefully you get good margin rates.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Those sound great to me! Timing is everything
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think 1.9% on IB.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, nice. IB is the best for margin but I hate the platform."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah the desktop app is like msdos. Its not user friendly at all. And if you ask the support they basically tell you RTFM. But it seems to be a solid broker overall. They have all kinds of intruments. I never thought I would need margin for example but now that I need it I am glad I am already on the right platform.
2021-04-02 07:20:30,wallstreetbets,412k QQQJ YOLO - April 1st 2021 - Rumors of my paper handed death have been greatly exaggerated. 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh my God.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro I have played QQQJ options and made out well. But after playing them for several months, I don't want to be in your position. What makes QQQJ great is it's a steady climber. Hardly had any downside until just recently. But an $8 upside move in just a couple months, I really do hope for your sake it makes it's first hard move to the upside. I'll be watching it and rooting for you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ive been suffering from an infection (Not Covid-19 that, I've already had twice) and have been totally out of it most days this week. A mod also reached out and recommended that I should probably switch over to a weekly vs daily update until I get closer to Expiration"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is the horrible hopeless retarded shit I came here to see!

Edit: I genuinely hope this shit hits 40+ and you can tell us all to go to hell"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Your trading career looks bright!!!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"been holding a few $35C 6/18 since december, was +100% at one point and now I'm down 60% but still holding"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember it's only money just numbers on a screen I lost 100k on a stupid weekly and my life is no different then it was before. After this if it doesn't print then you could say you took the shot which isn't something most people could say. I'm rooting for you.

I think the good thing is we are almost topped out on interest rate increases, probably be done end of May or June. Once interest rate stops increasing then it going go up.

And if the fed announces yield curve control then the qqq going skyrocket."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Holy shit he lives, i thought your blood pressure or longing $rope finally got you"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets, Love you daddy. hmmm 🤔
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nothing to see here people, just a guy who’s lost a whole house 😂"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dude this is hopeless the nasdaq jump over 200 points today and you still lost money 🤦‍♂️ you already lost more than half your investment that -81% is getting close to -100% you better pray for miracle to happen this month

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What's funny is if this is real (which I'm not saying it isn't) if he actually hit on this play he would have the SEC so far up his ass. There's no way they would believe this wasn't some sorta insider info
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And I thought I was an idiot with my 1 9/17 35C... when did you buy these ? Probably around the same time as me before it corrected

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this one of them high Q plays?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shoulda just bought GME calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,is all your money gone?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I will pray for you!!! but why did you buy an OTM call so far out?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"2.5 months for this one to go up 25%. Probably not going to happen. But good luck, this is a true gamble."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well.. no more Warhammer for you.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed holy shit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was wondering why this is flaired as *YOLO* instead of *Loss* ... then I realized that it's only a loss if you sell.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QQQJ did do a $8 upside in 4 months. Nasdaq also crashed alongside it then. I think it wont go up vertically but it will start to curve the arc up closer to the summer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Selling my QQQJ calls in January gave me nearly triple my initial investment, which I then YOLO’d into GME calls right before the January liftoff.  Super happy that I went through with that decision after seeing QQQJ performance lately."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro I actually am praying for u. Good luck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope you get better soon.  I like seeing your updates. Your yolo is so crazy it might just work.  But I’m too smooth brain to understand options.  Good luck. 🙌💎

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I know. I got a bathing suit for the winter on the Siberian Front
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dollar Cost Averaging down is a thing
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,HEES ALIVE! Yeah my BP has been anywhere from 83/55/62 to 146/93/104 this week. $ROPE hasnt gotten me yet
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So far*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its the Bid Ask spread that fucked me. Take a look at the $35's
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I dont want to become a legend. But if it happens it happens
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,YOGAIN
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> gone down bigly and i'm in the hole like $600 

Damn. Don't know if you're gonna get a lot of sympathy from someone down $336k"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You could always Dollar Cost Average down.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think not Dr. Watson
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its Military Aviation History's video on how the Germans planned to bring down the B-17
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup once the weather warms up. Otherwise he is gonna get sick
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ha ha funny man. I see what you did there
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet that an ETF is gonna be above 40.  So far im very wrong
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Problem for the SEC is that I'm betting that an ETF of 100 stocks is gonna go up. I would love to have them worm their heads up my ass and see them fail
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right at the peak. If I had waited a month I would have been able tl grab the 35s for even less than these.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes Inquisitors right above us. Yes this man has committed heresy and needs a blamming. *Bolt pistol is readied* *BLAM*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nope up several times what I put in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They're cheap and are likely to become ITM.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,20% $35 is easy to get back to.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What about my bunny futures?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pray harder
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I gotta be honest. I really enjoyed that haha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why do i like this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah I have no doubt it will climb. The issue is theta burn with the rate of climb. I've had weeks where it was a wash even though the stock price climbed. If it picks up pace in the summer like you anticipate you'll be sitting well.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It doubled my initial investment. Which I then YOLOd into AMC options
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So far prayers have been working. But I gotta pray harder and hodl more.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol DCA a dying position has always led to me to more death
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope you hit buddy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll pray for us (mainly you )
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,do i buy in now
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What prompted you to yolo into this?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe try the vaccine?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, you're my hero.

5000 contracts, you're a fucking market maker ! We're gonna see you on CNBC soon 😂"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exit plan? What are they. 


In all seriousness if the market goes up next week pretty well I will HODL on for dear life."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so too. You only need to be right a few times in order to never work another day in your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not likely a dying position though. He probably paid somewhere like $1.30-1.65 for those contracts depending when he bought assuming it was in December when there was the hype for those contracts. 

The 6/18 35c were as low as like .35 per contract just a few days ago and are already back to .60. It's a gamble but he could easily bring his average under $1, even close to .6 if he wanted, and would have 2.5 months for profits"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope so too.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That is a decision for you to make.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Market only goes up
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,in most countries you cant just snap a finger and get it.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I might bite
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,it is a buy bc it has fortnite
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would need to wait till mid june anyways cause I had Covid for the 2nd time last month
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In NZ we have to wait until unless you're frontline. Then elderly ans sick will be next.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond balls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I regret (at least for now) not buying more contracts at .35-.55. I've taken some big losses lately though and am in this deep so wasn't ready to risk it fully but I could've had a nice cost average going. 

I still might do it lol since I'm up decent on another ticker"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"hope you feel better soon. i just get worked up by people saying ""jUsT gEt ThE sHoTs bRo"". its not like i can just go out and get it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Best part is my mother gave me 25k to YOLO for her in a seperate account as well. Past few days she was the one to convince me not to paper hand
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean you can in some places.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No wonder ! 
Diamond ovaries."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whatever happens, make sure you stay in the market."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Assuming im right about this being over 40 I might buy some DIA and SPY calls depending on how things are in June.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What i see is a head and shoulders pattern. Very obvious. Keep it up, but remember that 75k is a lot of money. Go with QS calls. That bitch always shoots up like a rocket."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QS? Also what do you mean by Head and Shoulder's pattern?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Quantum scape. It's a EV battery stock.
Head and shoulders is when you look on a 6 month stock price history. 
Just Google it in the context of stocks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,QQQJ has been out only 6 months. Im fairly certain almost every stock and etf has gone down their first few months.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All you want is for this bitch to get to 42,  and i pray for you my guy.


 edit : That's a 24% move, with all it's components having run up already the past year, it's tough. 
Since it was created in 6 months it went up 20%."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Im fairly certain that it will hit 35 within 5-10 days and could hit 40 by EOM
2021-04-02 07:09:45,wallstreetbets,Can someone with math skills tell me how much will I lose if we open flat Monday? Theta $1.09 x 7 contracts 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You shouldn’t be dabbling with options if you can’t figure this out yourself. Not trying to be an ass, but going off of this, and a few of your last posts, you might be a bit in over your head with option trading."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personal experience tells me your going to learn all about options very quick.  Im a newb and am learning as I make mistakes along the way.  Consider it your tuition for learning the game. Good luck and it’s ok brotha.  Next time.  Don’t be too hard on yourself... people gonna do that for you on here no charge. Be a boss, take the loss and to the next."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And now, a poem: Roses are red 💎👐 are for shares Sell those contracts asap Cuz theta gang bout to fuck you up *bows*"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,-$1.09 x 7 x 100 = -$763.  This of course assumes no change in the underlying.  If it opens and closes at the same price you'll still lose $763. And it will be worse the following day.  Best of luck Ape.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All of it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Math is that hard?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’ll be down about 55% if it opens flat.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have a look at the Greeks. If it stays flat then you’ll lose close to the theta
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ll make this easy for you, no math. If it opens flat you’re down another $2000; you’ll be able to sell the contracts around $10.50 or so, bid will be around $10 and ask will be around $11.  

Note: it’s highly unlikely that it will open flat. More likely that it opens up or down some.  For your options to remain flat you’ll want to see an open around $195, and you’ll lose more than $2500 on the open if it opens around $190. Good luck; you never know anymore when the GME army will push it up more or if the shorts and day traders will rule the day."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you going be jumping into furnace after losing all that RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In layman’s terms.. you is fucked
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends on where GME opens on Monday. I figured these are the 4/9 $200 Calls. Simple theta calculation is $109 per contract x 7 contracts but you should go on optionsprofitcalculator.com and check out the price vs date calculation. There are a lot of other Greeks in play but OPC should give you a better idea.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro stop buying options. You said you lost $200k? Imagine your gains if you bought $200k worth of shares at even a share price of $100. 


Just buy stock, man. Hold some long term for growth, bet on some short term for returns, buy dividend stock for value."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low iv= good

High iv= bad

You= retarded"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The last week theta will eat you alive. You can ride it out hoping for a jump (would have to jump well abivr call yo be green), or accept the loss, sell, and move on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🪦
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There is a simple calculator that will show you what it will be worth at what day and what price.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just exercise those bad boys. What's the worst that can happen... ..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks good to me!  Should be some big money coming your way... thinking very optimistically of course!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Does RH not show you theta?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Also man, you should really not be buying extremely overpriced GME options with retarded implied volatility. The difference between the realized and implied volatility for GME recently has been astronomical. 

There are simply better plays and investments out there than GME at the moment"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They just added an interactive sliding scale for this exact reason. It's retard proof...well at least I thought it was
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Homeboy posted the same thing twice.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I totally agree, I recommend cutting losses asap"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pffft .. i win gambling craps and i dont fully understand that .. whats the difference here 🤷‍♂️
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should probably start with something a little smaller than 7-packs of $2,000 contracts though unless you are just rich and have money to burn"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,763 per day \* 3 day weekend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn that means over 210 just to break even at this point on Monday alone. It’s over for me
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ve seen that site recommended a lot. I’m also new to options trading and the GUH factor is real. Options trading calc should give a rough idea of the relationship between the underlying and the options?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Winning big or going back to the basement of wife's boyfriend. This is the WSB ways.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,High IV is actually good for him as long as it’s higher than when he bought the call. If it goes down then IV and theta are going to rip those calls to shreds
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m talking about theta.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m already fucked, selling Monday I will lose another 3k. Might as well hold through the week"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,99% Loss next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Let this be a lesson to all of you to buy shares instead
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Play pot limit Omaha (plo) without fully understanding it and see how you do. Actively investing in stocks without knowing what you're doing much more like playing plo than shooting craps.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,your mom
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Priced in already

Edit: the age old debate. Does theta decay over the weekend? My research points to no but feel free to look into it."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When people say roll them, they are saying that if you’re ok with the gambling aspect, there isn’t much wrong with selling and then repurchasing the same strike with a bit more time on it. You might end up with less contracts by rolling but you’re still in the game for a pop.  And if it doesn’t pop then you’ve still lost the money but the arcade game quarter lasts a bit longer.

I personally only buy LEAPS options. I really want the long term capital gains advantage on my winners so I hold just about everything for a full year or more. And the only way to do that with options is to get expirations more than a year out. That’s all LEAP means, the L is for long - an option with more than a year to work with. But they have horrible thetas and that’s why most people want shorter terms."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🤦‍♂️ you are more retarded than him
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, so move the date on the calculator forward. It calculates the estimated value on that date by using theta."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only a true Boom could pull off a catchphrase like that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"High IV makes them worth more.

If the IV goes up after he buys, then the thing he just bought is worth more.

If IV goes down, it's worth less.

Which part don't you understand about this? I'm in a nice mood so I'll genuinely help explain."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do you know what extrinsic value is?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The latest cheat used by the hedge funds is to sell calls and collect premium to keep them alive longer. GME calls are the highest manipulated tools in the market right now

Edit for you telling me to educate myself 🙄:

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is wrong, at least lately. There is a ton of decay on the weekend. 

For example; I was holding spy puts during the last 3 day weekend (/es trading may cause these to have more decay than a single stock, but point stands) and they incurred at least 2.5 days of full theta burn. This was adjusted for any $ changes due to vega/delta etc. 

There is no way you open a contract Friday at close and it opens up Monday morning without incurring any theta decay. That would be a gamma freeroll because even though shares might not trade, information is flowing and that can easily lead to gaps at open."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Read about the Black Scholes Model of Options Strategy. And see if you can make sense of how based upon given conditions options work. Then get into the theory that explains Volatility and Implied Volatility. Unless you understand this commenting about options trading in general for you will be unfruitful. The more you learn the better you can see because we see the world exactly as we are within my friend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s what market makers do, how else are we supposed to buy calls if no one is selling them"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He's lost about 16K
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what's he going to do? Sell to get $300 out of his original $16K? Might as well hold until it expires and hope something happens.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh ya
2021-04-02 06:18:49,wallstreetbets,Theta killed me whole week. How much will I lose by Monday? Theta -1.09 a day 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a total loss bro. That's probably the real answer you are looking for.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"u should be more scared of IV tbh, next time buy shares instead of options on GME. theta gang wins 😳"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me chime in. You can make money if the stock jumps to $200 early in the week and then climbs consistently towards $215 and above. All perfectly feasible. The issue is that it might not do that and you will quickly lose 90% of your investment. Once you lose 90%, you are better off gambling the remainder value to expiration. Well, that's what I would do given the situation. 

But if the stock jumps dramatically, you'll make some nice money and that's the risk/reward decision to be made. If you are OK vaporizing your investment for the possible reward, go for it. If not, you can get out of those calls asap and buy the shares instead. Another option is to exit the calls and sell short a GME put. If you get assigned you'll own the shares at a lower price, if not, then you would be taking GME bears' money and recoup the portion lost from those calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe a lot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For starters, IV on 🔥. You overpaid to begin with. Theta at -1.09, so it’ll drop by ~$1.09/day.


But this is the way"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea theta and delta on this call sucked to begin with, not worth the premium. That same premium would’ve had u way ITM elsewhere."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you're actually retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"1.09 a day is what you lose plus a little extra cause theta increases as it gets closer to opex.

IV on that contract seems really low for gme. People saying watch for the IV crush, IV is kind of low right now cause we traded relatively flat last week. Expect it to be higher next week.

Learn options before you start trading them.

I can't see what strike and expiration they are. 

Also, you have probably lost less then u think you did.

Bid/ask spread on that is super wide, it's probably worth more then what crappy rh is showing.

Never use market orders to buy options and never use market orders to sell options. Rh is always going steal..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can only lose what you paid for the contract
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For the love of god sell and by shares you dipshit
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You times that by 100 and it’s 109 per day you’re losing to theta
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"“If it’s in the news, you lose.” Find a better, less followed stock. GME trading — especially short-term options — are too hard to predict. Sentiment and momentum money moves in and out very quickly. MEME stock trading is gambling — you may make money or lose money. Trading stats don’t tell you anything about being right or wrong."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Optionsprofitcalculator.com
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,$694.20 based on the theta squeeze theory. This assumes inverse gamma behavior which is likely on this ticker.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep same boat. I think it’s a strategy the hedgies are playing. Just kill the theta on all these call options (and also kill the momentum on the stock) then make some sort of desperation move to try and tank it. They’re running out of plays here tbh

Edit: lol misunderstandings on this comment... I don’t even have a lot of options and overall I’ve done very well on options. All it takes is one day and it’s green again, don’t forget it!"

You guys really want that 10 bagger then stop wasting all your money and just buy in a hole it’s literally the easiest money anybody can make. Step one, buy.  Step two, set a price alert for 1000.  Step three, dont look at your account and enjoy your personal life until said alert. How hard is it"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It looks like they paid about $14k. So I’d wager they will lose $14k.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Per day too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And don’t forget about where it opens come Monday. We praying for a higher open. But if it opens flat or lower, price drop will be on 🔥"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Low volume options like that the bid ask is rarely accurate

BIDX1 meaning there is 1 person out there willing to buy the option from you for 12.60

ASKX1 meaning there is 1 person out there willing to sell you the option for 14.

If I was to go in and put in a limit buy for 13 and it didn't fill all of a sudden your options would be worth more...

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Explain for monke pls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So by Monday these are down 99.99?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How much would I lose if we open flat Monday?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It would have to hit 220+ next week
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes next Friday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If everything remains true, you will be down $109 per contract x 7 = -$763....per day**** (most people think theta stops on the weekends for some reason, this is false, the truth, TVOM and decay stop for no one, not even long weekends) then add in the dip that kills ur positions more at around 9am est for an additional x2 loss so give or take -$1500"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, I don't mean to be an asshole but if you're buying options you should know all this already. Use that link below next time and be prepared instead of going in blind.

https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"200c right? If you hold to opex it's going be worth 1$ for every 1$ over 200 at expiration times 100 times 7.

Depends upon how bullish you are about next week in particular and what your risk taking is like.

If it is even a penny less then 200 next week going be completely worthless.

But if u sell just remember you already paid theta for a long weekend and going take a haircut cause no one is buying/selling with frequency it has a wide bid ask."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok, but to answer your question yes it’s per contract. r/thetagang is killing it in GME. I stay away from these options."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So I will have 1500 left by Monday from 9k?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Theta doesn’t decay much over weekends. Market closures (holidays and weekends) are priced into the option.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you need to be an asshole. OP is why hedge funds get away with the traunch options they write. If you can bag shit and someone buys it, why not?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lmao, bro you are losing $110 (let’s round) per day each contract. Friday/Saturday/Sunday, is -$330 per contract x 7 contracts is -$2310. When Monday open comes if you don’t close, theta will be even higher, as it’s also growing while the market is closed due to TVOM, the theta will hit harder and harder.

On Monday, expect theta to be more, so that’s also an additional $-770 bare min if you hold and the stonk goes left to the right.

Today you closed on your contracts total investment return* of -$4000 (rounded).

Friday it will be -$4770

Saturday it will be -$5540

Sunday it will be -$6310

Monday EOD it will be -$7080, for your total investment return.

Tuesday -$7850

Wednesday -$8620

Thursday -$9390

Friday -$10,160 bare min..

Lastly, and don’t forget, MY FAVORITE way to lose $, factor In theta kill by the market makers churning the stock....and it expires worthless.**

One again this is all things staying equal and constant, and pending a godsend prayer from the stonk gods.

Also, if the stock stays constant, the contract theta will also increase causing bigger losses than just the $770 per day due to TVOM!

TLDR: Get Rekt

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,....so you’re saying there’s a chance 🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling on Monday I would have around 7k depending on if the stock drops or not
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know all that sounds scary and hoping lessons were learned but if it helps you sleep this weekend.. also know that even though theta is bleeding you heavily, there’s a decent chance a fair amount of that is countered by an initial raise in IV upon open which could help fluff the contract price a bit"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, I’ve made 450% on my 4/16 30 calls. I bought Wednesday right after opening dip, bought them for .316 a piece. Lol. Best play I’ve made so far this year other than getting GME at a decent price."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Damn. Nice.
2021-04-02 05:39:16,wallstreetbets,"DD: Boomer Edition round 2 - Construction 🚧🏗️ Stock - 🦅 Eagle Materials EXP Looking for an undervalued company filled with hard workers and actual physical products?  Tired of stocks focused digital things and imaginary future technology that might exist someday?!  Well my second 🥈 round of boomer deep dives is for you.  Last time we talked about 🚂 this time 🧰🔨👷🚧

So out in Dallas Texas there is great Dividend giving company called Eagle Materials 🦅🇺🇲

Let's look at their profile compared to competitors in the construction materials field.

Eagles Materials
Revenue: $1.2 billion
Revenue growth: 15%
Profit Margins: 20%
Employees: 2200
PE 16.37

Martin Marietta Materials 
Revenue: $4 billion
Revenue growth: 3%
Profit Margins: 12%
Employees:  8800
PE: 28.92

Summit Materials
Revenue: 2.33 Billion
Revenue Growth: 5%
Profit Margins: 6%
Employees: 6,000
PE: 23.28

Looks like they have far lower price to earnings with better growth and better profits.  They also get a bit more out per employee.  

Effecient and growing 🪴.  This is what we want in companies!

Now for one of the key points on why this is a 2x buy check their financial filings: http://ir.eaglematerials.com/investor-relations

In their annual report they reiterate the intention of the company to separate their heavy and light materials divisions into entirely independent publically traded stocks.    Why are they doing this?  Because the board and CEO know their stocks are undervalued and a major shareholders they are tired of it.  Splitting the company means you get two stocks with an undervalued PE ratio in more concise markets.  Easier to prove value and easier to get investor intention with a big move.  Those two stocks aren't staying down and even if they evaluate close to properly compared to their competition you are already close to a 2x deal!

But that's not all.  It isn't just that Eagle is in a good position now, the market puts them in a good position long term to succeed.

1. Materials🧱 are scarce🔎 across the board right now.  Everyone is behind on deliverys due to COVID related disruptions and the economy reving up too fast.  There is no fast solution to the backlog which means guaranteed revenue stream for over a year AND efficient companies benefit the most by having room to gain market share.  On top of that material suppliers are getting the opportunity to line their pockets with a bit of extra revenue since there really isn't competition for customers in this market.  Many companies aren't even taking on new customers right now because they are already stuck managing allocations for their existing base.

2. Commercial Real Estate is going down hard.  🗄️🖇️📉Office space in major cities is coming to an end and nothing can stop it.  Companies now know they need less office space and less people in the office so they aren't going to fork out anywhere near as much leasing space in expensive locations like NYC, LA, Chicago, etc.   The restructuring🏗️ needed to account for this will require materials and materials you need for these conversions are the exact types of Products Eagle offers🧱.  Clear case of forward looking demand.

Boomer Points:

1. While it is true that millennials probably couldn't hang dry wall if their lives depended on it 😴Joe is going let 🇲🇽🌮 back in and they can definitely help with all the labor shortages in the construction industry.  We may soon be back to the days where you can pay they nice gentlemen outside home depot to come help you finish a project no questions asked.  Don't have to worry about shithead contractors not showing up for quote.  

2. 🦅 is a legimate company that offers their employees pensions, stock options, and solid wages.  People who work there want to work there.  It isn't like my job at Wendy's.  This is a company where talent stays.

3. Dividends 🤩!!!! You can grow your shares more by having shares!

Cons: 

1. Commercial Real Estate crash might bring down everything in the real estate and construction market for a while.  Depends on how much bag holding the commercial landlords insist on doing.  If they don't recalibrate quickly or decide to beg for bailouts we might see a mini recession in that market with lots of empty spaces and no activity to refresh or maintain.  

2. Lots of upside for construction materials is priced in and Eagle has already beat market growth for the year.  However PE still says they don't meet the competition so this probably not substantial.

Warning: This Dick Dipping was performed by my permanently flaccid dicklet that contributed to my eventual divorce and shouldn't be counted as sound financial advice or a means of contributing pleasure to anyone's life.  

Positions:  Wendy's salary only lets me buy a handful of shares and the options are way too expensive but I like the stock!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’re at52 week high man.  

I don’t see how they’re under valued."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends what’s in Bidens infrastructure bill and if it actually gets done. 

I would be hitting raw materials:

- tools (hire/sellers)
- bricks, concrete and sand (stables of building)
- steel


But if it doesn’t get signed off and if it does, doesn’t get done... doesn’t make any of it worth while"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it has the benefit of getting fat finger buys from EXPI ticker (realty) as well.

&#x200B;

speaking from experience."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Let’s all buy stocks and pre-pay for our grave plots while we’re at it. Fuck this shit I’m all in PLTR FD’s come Monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like Boomer Points: Section 1 😂😂😂

Skilled labor will be a valuable commodity going forward for real"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Downvoting this for rasists remarks, political remarks and ageism, I'm a millennial could hang circles around you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You are better off buying Starbuck.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't he come here with DD 52 weeks ago
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol code for please save me
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lots of things are at 52 week highs or near it right now.  They are technically $4 below.

They are undervalued because other stocks in the same sector have more value assigned comparatively.  Better financials than their competitors and worse valuation.

Main thing is they don't have a reason to have any large up coming dips and the trend will likely continue with the strong positive growth."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s true, a plumber will be more costly than an attorney fee, quality over quantity all day, drywall is easy as fuck, being skilled at drywalling is a diff story, go build something pussies"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dry wall doesn't come in circles honey.  And it isn't political to observe what likely actions are in the market 🥱 by the active leaders of the country it is just good investing sense.   I know that gets confusing with all the sensitive twitter crowd but you need to buy based on how things are not on how you wish them to be.

For instance I would like to be able to have the family over for the holiday but my fat ex-wifes restraining order limits my ability to do that so there isn't a reason to splurge on a bigger place."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Starbuck is a gen x stock.  We ignore them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Baxter... bark twice if you’re in Milwaukee
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the number 6 valuation meal at Wendy’s, spicy chicken deluxe."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I need more margin of safety if this is a value play
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, More proof you can't hang drywall, you've never seen a circular column or archway? Think magic made the drywall curve? 🙄"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone say margin?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Margin of safety? What's that?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Drywall still don’t come in circles you gotta get the 🇲🇽🌮to bend it.
2021-04-02 05:00:34,wallstreetbets,$BB YOLO update: Bought more of that yummy dip! 😋 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out this price prediction on stock site. Lol.

With a 90% probability hold a price between $5.30 and $23.32 at the end of this 3-month period.

A retarded ape could predict that price. That’s like saying Tesla will be from $400 to $1200 in the next 3 months."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,right there with you! BB🚀🚀🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good luck and thank you for supporting a Canadian business, sir."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Picked up 200 shares this AM, unsure if I’ll continue to invest but my gut tells me this will be 300% return over the next decade, or more.

I bought AMD when it was $1.00 a share, and I have the same feeling about BB."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I’ve been averaging down so much I’m about to hit zero...BB could announce wireless 10G and they would go down...best of luck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Timing is perfect-20k shares increase, nice!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Added 1k shares today 🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Me too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,BB is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right there with you! I added 2,000 more shares in the 8.40-8.60 range the past two days. Can't say I'm sitting at 70,000 shares but I'm happy with a low 5 digits. Cheers!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Been dipping my toe in this as well recently
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy the dips!!! Goes great with chips, poker chips since this is gambling."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Godspeed young pandawan
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes baby I’m here with you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With that much money you could have bought a quadruplex rent all 4 units and get cash every month, instead of dumping all in BB"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It keeps dipping, but it feels like it will explode soon as a cyber security. Goodluck"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Chen said that they would probably be eating a shit sandwich for the next 3 quarters
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. That's a lot.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I've been looking at $BB but I don't see the potential, what am I missing? I'm diamond handing $AMC because I can't afford $GME. I'm just a broke retarded Chimp wishing Jane would come back and scratch my back."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What does blackberry even do anymore?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like them odds
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Real Clay Davis Hours.......

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, I can see a case for 400 and a case for 1200 . I agree"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait it's from Canada? Fuck, sell"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At least it's not french canadian.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,remindme! ten years
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 3x?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"3X over 10 years??? You better hope it does more than that if you’re gonna leave your money parked there for 10 years. 

You can find a lot of stocks that will do that in under a year."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It still feels to soon for BB, I think it will decline before it's rise. With that said I would like to be wrong. 105s @8.86"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1.5k... From assigned puts
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you see potential in amc over bb then you need some dd
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you don’t see potential, you’re not looking very hard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,bb not a phone company anymore bro lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,they are the Canadian PLTR company. buzzwordy software & security plays now

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe. 3x gains in under a year isn’t something reliably done, otherwise we’d all be billionaires."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At what price lol?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was going to say this... AMC is hemorrhaging money and very likely will BK. Unless a miracle happens and people stop streaming movies at home now. Black Widow... from the comfort of my house. Yes please. BB currently is a great time to enter.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not that I see the potential in AMC I was in the Ape mentality. DD is the sound I hear when I beat my chest. If you were an Ape you would know this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they developed the QNX OS for smart cars as well as an app store called IVY for those very vehicles. They are also in military contracts across the world (UK, Canada, US, Australia to name a few) that include hardware and software (shipyards in the NorthEast US know BB well).

BB is no longer a phone company. In 7 years, they transformed completely into a security and IoT company (Internet of Things - connecting appliances and vehicles / drones to the internet with good security software). They also have a security AI (a real AI, not code that people pass off as an AI as is the case with 99% of companies) and machine learning R&D department that will see revenues start in 2023.

Also, they have a lot of patents that generate money which lessens the need for funding their projects through dilution or debt. The latest patent was 2 weeks ago ([https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=10948920](https://pdfpiw.uspto.gov/.piw?PageNum=0&docid=10948920)), the self refueling AV patent!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And change the world as we know it!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That doesn’t even make sense
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We’re not buying, friend!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Come on there are many more examples of stocks that do 3X in under 10 years than relying on BB. BB hasn’t done shit in 15 years. You act like it’s some sort of monster stock that’s been ignored.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yup. And as much as I like going to the theater and feel it could be a solid spike post covid (briefly) from all the stuff I've read about BB they've actually evolved and are doing things that could lead to it being a really solid hold for the next few years
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes thats what I mean. they are like PLTR but software and security focused.

The problem is that they are completely under appreciated and their portfolio has sure gotten them to become core in current cars...but what has that led to? I'm not sure it's crazy good revenue. I don't see QNX being dramatically better then it is right now. 

There are many other ISO level security options and the BB moat isn't what it once was. I saw alot of their senior leaders sell when the stock moved up recently. I'm of the opinion that leaders that sell stock signal bad things for companies.

I am a fan of BB but at this point, I think it's more of a hope for acquisition then dramatic shopify jump. Their portfolio is just not sexy enough."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re interpreting way too much into my reply. I’m not the OP. I only bought 200 shares - clearly I don’t think this is a monster stock. I’ve got 500k in the market, only $1200 is with BB."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a little shocked that they weren't just an old dying phone company anymore. When I read that and saw todays price. I jumped in some option calls
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">I'm of the opinion that leaders that sell stock signal bad things for companies.

There are many reasons why insiders sell, but only one reason why they would buy. A few insiders selling alone is not an indication of anything. Also, Chen's compensation is heavily geared towards equity, so it is in his best interest to make it work.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't read too much into it TBH. The exit in January was pretty damn attractive especially if you needed liquidity."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,CFO sold a tiny portion of their stock options. Completely overblown
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gotcha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I played BB once on the run. Took profit already. Wasn't going to go back in until better value
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,CFO's have a clear view of their guidance. Its an indicator for me.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's where I made a mistake. I always poorly time my exit. Not as bad in this case since I wanted to hold anyway but it just means I have to wait longer with less ammo.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah i had similar issue with AMC and UWMC. I was too greedy. Took a 10k loss of amc and now relying on div for uwmc.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amazing 💎🚀🦍

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know. Every since 2008, things seemed bleak. This whole Gamestop thing has been very profitable to me, but it’s more meaningful than that. This resembles resilience and the power of the people. For years, wall street traders revolted against hedge funds and market manipulators who seemed to always get away with something, or manage to workaround and manipulate some weird law, only to twist into their own perspective and make the middle class’s wallets bleed. For years, many have suffered. Some prosperous of course, but there was and always will be that greater force that could drain a man’s life savings in mere seconds.

u/deepfuckingvalue, jokes aside, all memes aside, I appreciate the fact that you’ve empowered people, and that you inspired people to put their foot down. Enough is enough, just was enough in 2008. Never in my 28 years of life have I ever witnessed such desperation from multi millionaires and billionaires. But that isn’t even what’s crazy about all of this. Besides the charts and technical analysis and the DD and the memes and the widespread media coverage, all anyone and every has been doing and has done is...well, 

THEY HELD THE MOTHERFUCKING STOCK. but why? BECAUSE WE LIKE THE STOCK? why do we like the stock? BECAUSE IT APPEALS TO US AND BECAUSE THAT’S WHAT INVESTING IS ALL ABOUT. It’s about INVESTING into the future, into something you want to see grow, into something you wish to profit off of after commitments and sacrifices.

That’s what’s so interesting about all of this. Just buy and hold. They created this fucked up system and we played them at their very own game. I’ve made a lot of fucking money from this and I truly wish to find ways to donate or bring back that money to my community. To be really honest with you, after seeing what money can do to a person at this level, I rather bring someone at the lowest level up, because that’s what truly makes you in the end. When we all die, we can die knowing that we helped someone else get to the top, whatever their top may be. 

It’s not great being at your low. GME, all jokes aside, brought back the fire in people’s eyes, the hatred for the years of sheer market manipulation and unlawful acts of robbery on a marketing level.

Fuck wallstreet, fuck them hard. Fuck these fucked up systems that allow the rich to steal from the poor but do not allow the poor to profit off of the rich. I was a poor man and I’m a wealthy man. At 18 I lived inna ln a one bedroom apartment as a full-time college student working 40 hours a week. That’s not cool. That’s not acceptable. Not everyone is capable of that, and I wasn’t either, because it took me a couple tries just to finish college and get through my growing pains.

There’s no room for mercy here. I want to watch these hedge funds suffer. I want them to bleed. Let their wallets feel as empty as their souls. Let their children know that their parents were manipulators. Let everyone know that these people aren’t your friends. I am not inciting violence, but let it be known that you have the ability to do something and make a change and now is THAT FUCKING TIME PUSSY


BUY AND HODL THE STOCK YOU MOTHERFUCKER and drink aqua 💦"

And if you're not planning on holding after the 16th, does it make more sense to just sell the option beforehand?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this in a Roth IRA? 

It appears like the only cash movement in Q1 was related to selling to close options, exercising calls and then buying more shares (i.e., no money taken out to prepay taxes).

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If I’m reading this right he has 100,050 shares of GME, right? But the numbers at the end, is he making money without selling stocks or is a potential gain in case he sells? 

Also, what’s the meaning of April 16? What happens then?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You should have doctored it to make it look like you sold everything as an April Fool's. That would have been all-time. Lmao

Nonetheless, just wanted to thank you for opening our eyes to the fuckery that is the GME fiasco. 

I'm HODL to see this whole thing through!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Will he buy even more, on April 17th, from the call money?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What was our Diamond King’s original investment? I’ve been wondering that for a while. Fuck it’s wholesome watching this guy crush ass. I heard his wife doesn’t even have a boyfriend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Two weeks left on his calls.. what will he do?!?! the suspense!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been sitting on that cash, seems like you should beef up your position"

(nfa)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay I need to ask. 
I don't understand how trade works yet. 
I'm paid minimum wage and even winning 200€ would be a plus. It could help my family since we have health issues. I could breath for a while and find a better job. 
Does that mean that if I buy one stock, I would gain much more right now? Should I buy one? Could it work in Europe? Does someone have a video to recommend to get started please? 
Sorry, I'm new to this and don't know how to read it yet."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Every chance I get I want to tell you I love you. I don’t even say that to my wife very often. But her boyfriend does which may explain some things.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY!!! DFV IS GODLIKE
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Does anyone know when DFV bought his GME shares? When will his gains be considered long term capital gains (20% tax) instead of ordinary income (37% tax)? Not that he would ever sell GME of course. Diamond hands 5ever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Diamond hands and diamond balls. This man has it all. We love you!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We are not worthy....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Legend has it he still holds
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can anyone ELI5 some parts of this, as I'm still new to figuring it all out so I'm not entirely sure what I'm looking at. 

It's especially confusing as I've looked at the past several of these he's posted and I see the quantity of 100,000 and 500 never changing (I'm pretty sure) so I'm not entirely sure what I'm supposed to be looking for otherwise. Is this saying that he has 100,500 shares, total, and this is solely the day change because he's not selling (which is the point)? 

And what does the ""Apr 16' 21 $12 Call"" part even mean? Does that mean by that date, he estimates the shares to drop to $12 per share in price or what? I genuinely don't get it. I thought calls were something along the lines of ""betting"" that a stock will go upwards and puts were the opposite?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m curious as to what he does does job to have so much cash to drop like that to begin with
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have made April’s Day Prank and posted a photoshopped pic of selling them all 😆
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Missed opportunity to post April fools position of having sold everything and destroy this subreddit as we know it forever.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yo, mind sparing a grand??"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can someone explain how the math on the calls gives him that amount of profit? I’m really struggling to make sense of it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The real question is how tf dfv got 2 million to invest
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just take the cash for those options. Don't exercise. You deserve those tendies brother.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cmon send 50k my way you won't even notice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME is utter rubbish, everyone here knows it and everyone is pretending that is not just because they're invested in. Give it few weeks more and it will be worth nothing."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Memes aside, this guy has to have some sort of gambling addiction or something. He's sitting on 20+ million dollars that could tank on any given day"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,SELL PLZ I DONT WANT TO YOU TO LOSE THIS
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s funny, GME has no reason to go up, the meme has died a long time ago, yet I have no doubt it’ll spike up again (probably soon, too)

Why? No idea, just a hunch"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"April fools guys, don't fall for it. He sold it all..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why hasn’t he closed all his options while the price is still high. I really don’t feel like GameStop is going to be trading over 180 by the time those options expire
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,gotta cash out soon i imagine.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can I burrow about 59k?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,April fools he sold

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Noob here! Does this mean if he sold all his shares he would get 40,000,000$? Assuming the value of shares doesn't fluctuate when someone sells so much at once.."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are the calls listed at a lower price than the shares? Shouldn't the list price be the same?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The IRS be salivating on those capital gains. I hope he exercises his options and gets share certificates to hang next to the kitty poster.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,BIG DICK DEEP FUCKING VALUE WITH THE DIAMOND BALL SACKS CUCKING OUR WIVES ONCE AGAIN WHILE WE ASK FOR MORE 🥱

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just when I was about to buy more, DFV convinces me to buy even more"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should have posted a screenshot of exiting all GME positions, would be the perfect April Fools"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This cat should have edited out the 100k shares and displayed 0 as though he had sold; April Fools!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Throw the cash at ASO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So essentially, once exercised, dfv would own the entire float? Someone please correct me here.

eta: I'm a smooth brained ape.  *slinks off into a corner for time-out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So he has to sell it before April 16. I’m not sure if he will exercise his call at 190 level if he is a small value guy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Losing it all would be the most humblest of stories
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought he was going to say he sold as n April fools joke.  Decidedly this is much better

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What a madman
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am retarded but does the fact that his cash total keeps going up mean he's taking profits along the way?

That's what I thought was happening but everyone keeps praising him for NOT taking any profits. So I am confused because I know in one of his earlier videos he said that he rents his house etc. So I know he didn't have that 2 mill just laying around

He is a time-travelling, diamond-handed God either way 💎🙌🏽💯"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,post back to back and i dont have my free award to give :(

Then once the stock normalises down, he might just throw in some 10 Millions for some deep fucking value. Its gonna be history."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but I wanna see DFV buy one more share to make share quantity 100,001 and then set back and watch Reddit lose their shit!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Apr 16, 21 is coming near."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Never ever, forever never? 

Never ever"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It never gets old
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe you stand corrected as 4/17 seems to be old.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It never will. That's deep fkn value.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Never ever
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s like seeing Aurora Borealis
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Old never gets money back billionaire
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's because he was trolling on twitter all day implying that he sold
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Rearrange the letters in ""trader""... it can't be unseen"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Samezies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dead fucking same, it’s a sign!!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously the second I get naked I see this, it has to be substantial with his calls, a new floor ~$180, and it’s EOW! Next week is going to be fun"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same. Holding 18 💎🙌
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This might be because of his tweet that had Paper hands in it.  Some people might have taken it as him selling, but I think he’s posting this to make it clear that he didn’t."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote for being stoned. Right there with you. GMO for the win!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a sign there's a 3 day weekend coming up, lol."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His options are really close to expiration. Wonder if he’s going to exercise, that would really be something to make someone market order 50,000 shares at these prices. Could still be another squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too! Always, actually."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree with you, I'm totally stoned too."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Market closed on Friday so soak it in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Open Chrome, login, Inspect, update price/balance, snip, Reddit, post 🍿"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you go back and look each time he’s posted 2 days in a row before it was when there was super low volume followed by a big spike. Last two days had super low volume.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Was Randy Johnson the one throwing the stones?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe he's updating everyday until 04/16?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My body is ready
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I watched that 4 times before I realized it was looping.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That guy Roaring Kitty must know DFV
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But is he a cat?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,this guy is such a fucking legend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I fucking love this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I just love watching his videos. Just the sound of his voice 🥰
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The best Rick roll of the year!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The slushing in that 8ball was orgasmic!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine being up not even 1% in the day and having gains of 171k. That's more than most people make in a year.

Fucking insane man

e - okay i'm young and grossly overestimated USA median income, the average *household* income is 55k (which was my guess before) and the average personal income is ~35k. this fucker just made what the average american makes in 5 years in one shitty market day. absolutely mind blowing"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Underrated edit lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'd be happy with literally making 20k a year. I live off $12,000 and it's garbage. Good on DFV for doing what I can't"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The option pricing is inaccurate. The actual price of his call options should have went up roughly the same amount ($ per share), so the more accurate gain should be closer to $240k for the day’s gain. Baller."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I remember a couple weeks ago on a Monday he made 8m
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Science Bitch
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is a Billionaire!! Do you think he cares about that 171K, you filthy Millionaire?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m very retarded, could he take out 170k today and just be back to the amount yesterday but with 170k in his bank account?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He didn't make 171k, he's up 171k, on other days he's down 1mil and in other days he's up 2mil, you don't make it money until you sell it lol this is the most retarded place ive ever been in its my home"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Go where?

This is the way! 3 months of stonk learning taught me the 401k was doing shittier than it should've been in the market at the time but I had no idea when I pulled it for GME.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"if i've learned anything from losing a fuck ton on the clean energy pullback, don't yolo it all at once. if u still wanna be balls to the wall throw in half to start, but save some of that bitch and BUY THE FUCKING DIPS! i can't believe the amount of literal retards i've seen with a average cost of $190 a share on their life's savings because they were too impatient for a dip. like fucks sake it dipped to $120 on earnings!!! dollar cost averaging, learn it ya 🦍"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Frankly the fact you didn't yolo sooner means you need to go do some reading.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don’t ...let this opportunity slip past you! YOLO

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Here, I'll talk you out of it. Kinda.

Don't get it when you first wake up. It has a history of spiking then dropping shortly after opening. Buy an hour after opening 💎🚀

Looking forward to your YOLO update"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ehh... If that's all your gambling money I would start quite a bit lower.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,tbh i think you should try to catch another 120-150 dip. we're most likely gonna hang out here until liftoff

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No. Do it, ape."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Id say pour half in at open, save the other 35k for the dips. I panic much less when I know I have enough spare cash to average down if things go south"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just do your DD. There's evidence the squeeze is over, but there's also evidence that at it's current market cap there's still value. If you're prepared to throw your money in and trust GME successfully transitions to digital or gets bought by Amazon, go for it. Just don't go in expecting it to go off overnight."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A whole new meaning to tendies
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nice, you’re now below the Mendoza line. 👏"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way back when he signed a contract with some poor bastard who agreed to take an up front premium of 0.20 per share x 50,000 shares (500 contracts of 100 shares each) for the right, but not the obligation to buy 50,000 shares of game stop for $12 each.  The poor bastard gets his 10k premium (0.20x 50,000 shares) up front in a lump sum and now this legend will exercise his contract two weeks from now and buy 50,000 shares from this guy for $12 each when the current price is about $180?  

The poor bastard was hoping that on April 16th that the share price would be below $12 meaning that he collected a 10k premium and still got to keep his shares (because the legend wouldn't obviously exercise the contracts at a price above the current market)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cash total would be what is sat in the account as cash, not invested into shares atm.
The one below it is total inc shares, so approx what he would get if he closed everything cashing out fully.
All pre-tax though ofc."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No he sold a few a shares at the top in January, then bought double the shares in February. The cash amount is how much money he has on hand. So he can easily exercise his options, buy more, and still live as a millionaire."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> I'm glad it seems like all of this might actually help change things for the average person who isn't a HF. 

This isn't true. It's some weird David vs Goliath narrative people like to bandy about."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bro, it takes big dick energy to hodl... you holding, right?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What does the winky frowny face mean..?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The Euro apes might know something about doing just that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s not a retard. He already sold a portion of his position. He’s just holding now because the cult-like following he’s gained is too valuable
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has the ability to execute his call options before or on that day. If he does, he has the right to buy gme shares at the price listed, I believe 50000 shares for only 12 dollars a pop"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Way back when he paid some sucker .20 per share (in actuality it's a $20 contract for 100 shares) for the option to (on April 16th)buy 50,000 (he bought 500 contracts) shares for $12 each.  Meaning with where the stock is today he will net over 8 million on those 500 contracts. 

TLDR  He turned 10k into 9million this year"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's going to make a shit ton of money with them, that's what. Buy the shares is most likely."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The poor bastard

Trade volume was 9M on Thursday. What do you think his 50,000 shares will do? He's not literally jesus."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang out here a BS?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s only a matter of time 😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those are his $12 calls that expiry April 16th. A call is a contract to buy a 100 shares at a set price, called a strike, no matter the current share price. The purchase of this contract requires payment of a premium per share in the contract, and this premium changes depending on how close to the strike the share price is, and also time to expiration and volatility of the stock. You can either exercise the contact and pay your strike price for 100 shares, or sell the contract to someone else

Basically he bought 500 $12 calls so has the right to purchase 50,000 (100 x 500) shares for only $12. 

These calls we purchased so long ago that he paid $20 for each of those 500 calls and now they’re worth $18,130 each (remember each call =100 shares). I would expect him to pay the $600k to exercise the shares and add 50,000 to his current 100,000 shares"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I C what you tried to do there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"500 contracts worth 100 shares each, so 50,000 shares"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s the thing. This situation won’t even put a dent in the system, if anything it’ll create a Golden Age. People think the government won’t let it happen. The government needs this to happen but isn’t in their control to begin with. If I punched your wife’s boyfriend to gain dominance, it’s not your wife’s problem. So what I’m trying to say is... How much are you worth? Do you care more about yourself than the opinions of others? Buy and hold, this is the easiest game ever possible yet 90% of people have no clue how to even think for themselves.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ask again Later
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude he could have and made a double fucking fortune with puts, although I’m sure Congress would lose their fucking minds."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not today it won’t
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He knows that some of us are actually retarded and might believe it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seems like it's still there in the account. He seems like a humble guy anyways. Not a big flexer.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,More shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That someone is me. It’s a casino
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He tried to inform us longgggg ago! We weren‘t listening. So yeah, we have to buy for more than $5 each."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean he’s sitting on over 11mil in cash just from GME. No matter how it plays out, he is ahead of any ape that has their whole portfolio in shares and refusing to ever sell."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate what this sub has become... spam shitposts and bullshit memes about the same shit. And they're all the same now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,he should have a while ago i think he was up 50 mill at one point... and this all started off like $50k lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You belong here!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He's been doing that all day on Twitter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That went over people's head lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Please don’t do that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He has 100k shares, and 500 calls for april 16.

The numbers at the end are the increase in value, because GME went up, the total value of his shares and calls also went up.

The meaning of ""April 16"" means that his calls expire then. He'll either have to sell the contracts (each contract is worth 100x $181.3 atm) or exercise them and buy 100 shares per contract for $12 a share.

This means that on April 16, DFV will need to pick between buying 50k shares at a massive discount (12 per share) or selling the contracts."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME might have crashed yesterday if the legend did that..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao DFV isn’t dumb enough to pay $190 a share
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe because he's aiming for more than being set for life? Building companies and shit? What do I know?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His gains are from a year worth of holding, not just 'a couple of weeks'"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you tried reasoning with her boyfriend instead?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To exercise options
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, he can buy 50000$ shares for 600K. Lol and they're worth 10M. 

I mean yes he'll pay exactly 12 bucks a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No.  He can buy at $12 a share and it doesn’t matter what the price is currently at.   So when he exercises the contract the seller is obligated to supply the shares whatever the cost to them.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,U can’t tell the legend what to do.. do u seriously think u know better then him?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Check Twitter lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He does. Like 14k awards I think

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exercise them with all that cash duh!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The second line describes an options contract, or more specifically, a lot of options contracts. DFV paid a premium (.20 cents per share) to buy the *option* to purchase 500 contracts of GME at $12 a share. Options are sold in contracts of 100 shares per contract, so 500 contracts = 50,000 shares. These expire on April 16, 2021. He bought these contracts over a year ago, when the stock was almost universally seen as worthless and dying, which is why the premium is so low. Hope this helps."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," there are seven tax brackets for ordinary income – 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37% – with the bracket determined by filers' taxable income. The federal government uses a progressive tax system, which means that filers with higher incomes pay higher tax rates. It's also graduated in such a way so that taxpayers don't pay the same rate on every dollar earned, but instead pay higher rates on each dollar that exceeds a certain threshold.


Your first 0-9.8k is taxed at 10%
Then everything from 9.8k-40.1k is taxed at 12%
Then 40k-85k at 22%
85-163k @ 24%
163-207k @ 32%
207-518k @ 35%
More than 518k @37%

So it wouldn’t be 37% of his final number. Just 37% of everything over 518k which is still a shit ton but not a full 37%. (Although in his case it will be an average of like 36.999999 hahaha) 

But yeah you don’t pay 37% off a $1000 short term gain. That’s just wrong"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It looks like he had Calls way back in June 2019. So maybe first shares were purchased June 2019?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can look into it, he answered that already. It wasn't ""so much cash"" to begin with, but it was still YOLO."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That would have made a ton of others sell hurting everything.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Each call is worth 100 shares

500 calls @ 0.2 = $10 000
500 calls @ 181.3 = $9 065 000

Not sure where the 116k discrepancy comes in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh gee, I guess you're right, and the dozens of DD with detailed analysis are wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He didn’t.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Concentrate again.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I prefer to think he was just reminding everyone of the glory that is Cliffhanger.  I just wish he’d used the SEGA CD game instead.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I though for sure he would pretend he sold for April Fools.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, those positios are already taken by paper portnoy and kenny G, you can join the board though"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He lives pretty close to me and i would love nothing more than to pull a barstool up next to him and just shoot the shit. Unfortunately I would nut in my shorts damn near instantly and forget how to be normal.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like his memes/gifs, they're pretty funny."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That's more than most people make in three years*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,~171k per year would put you just about in the top 5% in America.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's over double my pay
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's what I would make in 28.5 years in my current job which is considered ""decent"" pay here.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Imagine working for a living lmao. Just be rich, idiot!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why the rich get richer 101.

Takes money to make money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bruh imagine studying your ass off for 6+ years to get a medical degree then work for 10 to 15+ more years to get enough experience to get a consultant level job and barely make that amount a year here comes a smooth brain ape marking that amount in a single day and that wasn’t even a good day at the market.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Now imagine how much hedge funds make 🤔
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I know a guy who bet 50 grand on one spin at the roulette table.  He won.  Sometimes your ship comes in.  Sometimes the bar eats you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That is more then 97% of all other humans on the planet ever make in a year.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Over double...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldn't make that in four years if I hit everyone of my bonuses and I'm the second highest up at the restaurant I work at.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He has lost in one day more than I will make in my lifetime
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I make that in 10 years so.....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,As young poor Bulgarian boy I can admit I make 12k per year 😂😂.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It would take me 22 years to make 171k at my current job, Thanks Greece!

This is so fucking sad and people here say thats how much they make in a year or double that..thats still really fucking good my guys be happy with what you have cause there are always worse cases."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Would it be a WSB comment if I didnt fuck the math up?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How do you only make 12k a year? Isn't that less than minimum wage?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What makes you think it’s inaccurate?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, taxes."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You do know that the markets are closed tomorrow right?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I actually doubled down today. I’m just taking so much confirmation bias in at this point that I simply just couldn’t.

Oh please, do go on with a mountain of evidence that contradicts everything we are seeing."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can’t wait for the downvote bots and beeches on this one. I think we’d all be very foolish to think that Ryan Cohen is not going to sell us all up the river when the price is right. Hell he will probably have the announcement with Cramer before market open just like they did with Adam This morning. Literally I feel like dfv is just going nuts out yolo to keep the movement alive, I mean he hit 11 million cash guys with a 50k yolo what’s a degenerate retard have to lose at this point embed already changed his life and so many others. 
Btw I was holding calls pretty much since this start of this shit and kept entering and exiting because well wall st is scum and to play in the game they all have mud on them at the end of the day. 

Read this dudes comment again, and don’t go throwing all you have on this just to grab some pennys on the tracks because the train will come it always does"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What if.............. he bought 10k worth of GME with that premium?

Would he be a Legend who is obliged to THE Legend?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If the poor bastard hedged and bought the shares for less than $12, he didn't lose money, just missed out on massive gains. If he didn't..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the fucking way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Question: if that poor bastard doesn't own 50,000 hedged shares from back when they originally sold the contract, and doesn't have the capital to buy the shares at market price to settle the contract, what happens? 

Does the poor bastard just go bankrupt, and if so what happens to DFV's holding?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So when he exercises these calls in two weeks,  will that cause a large price increase? Or is that large scale purchased already factored into the initial call?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This just blew my mind and I feel like I’m 30% closer to understanding options lol. But I can buy calls and puts on RH. If I buy a put, the other side of the deal is a call right? So if I don’t exercise my put but the other side exercises the call, I could be fucked? Or is it only a covered call with that kind of risk?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wouldn’t it be more likely to be 500 contracts that are split amongst multiple people selling the same calls at the same price point than 1 dude selling 500 contracts?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He will most definitely have to pay estimated taxes come mid april on his realized gains. Well, unless he wants to pay up to a 5% late fee. I hope ppl don't freak out if he withdraws some"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So what happens on April 16th?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So hypothetically if the stock went away tomorrow he still walks away with 11 Mil?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ah. So at the end of the day even if the stock went to $0 he could walk away with the cash?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Any stocks get fucked.  From partial to our diamond blessed brethren.  Apes in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a quintuplet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This comment deserves more upvotes. Majority people here have been brainwashed to think ITM call options = gamma squeeze. While partially true, market makers typically hedge options as they approach or near strike prices to prevent a gamma squeeze. Sometimes, the price climbs so fast they didn’t even have time to hedge. For example, stock price is currently at 200 and it’s a Thursday. Markets closed but after hours is pushing the stock above 300. It opens at 350 the next day which is Friday, and closes above 400. All those call options with strike prices of 250-400 will drive a gamma squeeze. Market makers are usually good at preventing a gamma squeeze from happening. But with wild volatility and unpredictable price action, it’s a little easier for market makers to get caught off guard and basically allow a gamma squeeze to happen"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It means I’m crying because he’s going to have to close his option positions ;(
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The premise of your assertion is that the new celebrity status of DFV is more important to him than ~$10M worth of profit in exercised options? Are *you* actually retarded?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the MF way!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s just insane.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you so much. I knew some of that but not the way u explained it. But what I’m saying is I’ve seen the exact number in other post in a diff way.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deep ITM calls have a delta close to 1, either 0.999 if not 1, meaning if the stock moves by $1.63, then the option price moves by $1.63. His 500 call options represents 50k shares, which is half his share position, so if the gain from 100k shares was $160k, then his options should have gained $80k.

Deep ITM options are very illiquid, so the last trade price wouldn’t reflect its true value at market close today.

All this to say DFV’s true gain for the day is even more impressive than what we see here!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,IN
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,**This** is the way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats like 800 shares compared to the 50k shares he has to sell
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah it was 500 contracts so it was likely absorbed institutionally or someone who knew what they were doing and hedged..........or maybe not - maybe they walk amongst us and we will get some amazing loss porn next week!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The brokerage handling the options contract wouldn't allow the sale of the shares in the meantime so that can't happen.  Also it's likely not just one lonely guy who wrote those 500 contracts. It was probably institutional or from a bunch of different people.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good question.  I think the short answer is no.  I don't know for certain with something this large but here's my best estimate.  The shares are trading hands for $12 each but behind the scenes.  The price was previously agreed upon and in a way that already to some extent influenced price action because it has been an open interest on the options side of things which also influences the share price somewhat.  They aren't being offered to the market and aren't sitting in the order book so I don't think this side of the sale moves the price any at all.  It's just shares changing hands behind the scenes from one account to another.

On the other side of things, you now have 50,000 shares that are ripe for profit taking so you'd think that unless he truly believes that the share price can move even higher that he is going to want to unload at least some.  To get back his 610,000 cost basis (50,000 x $12 plus $10k in premiums) he'd need to unload about 3k shares but that's nothing.  Orders of that size are executed constantly and GME trades
on heavy daily volume so probably won't be noticed.

The biggest concern for pricing here will be his following.  They follow his every move.  If he's in, they are in.  If he's out and they start liquidating, I can't imagine what it will look like.

They honestly may have revived a dying company to the point that they will be able to use this influx of cash and publicity to actually flourish and it will continue on as a $150+ dollar stock based on at least some fundamentals."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Let me say that I am not an expert at this and only have a basic understanding.  However unless we are talking margin, in either of those scenarios you would need to already own the shares (at least 100).  

Think of it this way, if you own 100 shares of a stock that you have sitting in your account they aren’t generating you any money (aside from dividends) until you sell them.  However, if you know what you are doing you can write options contracts on them and generate lots of income over and over again on your same 100 shares.  Let’s say your cost basis is $10 per share on your 100 shares and you don’t believe that the price will go beyond $15 dollars in the next 6 months.  You can sell a “covered call” to someone with a strike price of let’s say $20 (remember, you don’t think the price will get that high before the expiration date of the contract).  So you sell this covered call with a strike price of $20 and an expiration of one month from now.  The contract price is 0.30 per share x 100 shares.  You collect $30 as the premium all up front when you sell the contract and get to keep it no matter what.  The other guy who just purchased a “long call” is hoping that the share price gets to at least the strike price plus the premium he paid just to break even.  So $20.30 per share.  If it only gets to anything below $20.30 the contract will expire worthless and neither party has to do anything.  The guy who bought the long call can only ever lose his $30 premium.  However, if that strike price get anywhere above that strike price the guy who bought the long call can have unlimited losses.  The losses aren’t out of pocket but they are on unrealized potential gains.  So if the guy who originally sold the covered call only paid $10 for his 100 shares he will still profit at contract expiration, he will net $10 per share (he paid 10 but is selling to this guy for 20, plus he got to keep that original $30 premium).  However, he is losing out on the potential to sell at the current market value.  So let’s say at expiration the stock was trading at $50, well he still has to sell at $20 to the guy on the other end of the contract.  The losses are considered “unlimited” because forget $50, what happens if it’s trading at $180 all the sudden like GME.  Well you’ve now had to sell for $20 and lost out on all that gain.  

In a perfect scenario for the guy who sold the covered call, the contract expires worthless and he will just write a new contract on those same 100 shares and make another $30 in premiums."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Almost certainly but that doesn't make for a great story does it!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He is doing this in a Roth, so no

EDIT: yes if he withdraws some, of course, but otherwise no"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Imagine DFV withdrawing some. Guaranteed that’s going back into GME at some point. He loves the stock
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Expiry date for the call. Options are always for 100 shares, that call is for 500 options.

So before it expires he either sells the call on for a vast sum to someone else who wants to exercise it.

Or before it expires he has the cash to cover ( ($12 + $0.20) \* 100 \* 500) to exercise it himself netting him the 50,000 shares if its a physical settlement he can then hold, or sell for current value.

If it's a cash settlement then he'd get the difference between $12 + 0.20 per share and the current price, for 50,000 shares worth. (Pre tax) (I'm not sure cash settled style is an option here [https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/cash-settled-options.asp) )

As he has the cash to exercise them himself, he's not likely to sell the call on.

If it expires he gets nothing, I believe some brokers would handle it for you instead though if it's in the money, as it certainly still should be on the 16th.

If I have something a bit wrong there I'll get back to chewing crayons.

^(Edit2: braces.)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As in the ticker was pulled, all GME stock became worth $0?  
The Cash Total there isn't tied to any stock, that's his not yet invested in anything wallet with that broker, so yes he'd be able to withdraw that, nearly $12 Mil (pre tax)."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Monthly options always expire third Friday of the month, April 16th is the third Friday 

Anybody who bought calls more than a few weeks ago was only able to buy 16april if they wanted options for April - so naturally you will see lots more options for these third Friday of the month dates. 

Right now there’s tons of calls and puts for the 16th, obviously this also applies to every other stock too. You will see that number a lot."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Calls/puts contracts each hold 100 shares/contract.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A single contract covers 100 shares but may be subject to other factors like stock splits
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wicked bad idea, you’ll end up divorced before you even get married."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty simple:

A call is a contract to buy 100 shares at a certain price, before a certain date. The price is called the ""strike price"", and the date the ""expiration"".

So if I buy a GME April 16 call for a strike of $12, it means I have the right to buy 100 shares of GME for $12 a share before April 16.

The price paid for the contract is called the premium, and is calculated on a per-share basis. This means that the price paid of $0.20 on DFV's screenshot means he paid $20 per contract, and he has 500 of those. So he bought $10k worth of calls, and since the price exploded, these calls are now worth $18k **per call** meaning you multiply that by 500 and you have close to 10 million.

The price of the contract went up a lot because since GME is now worth ~$190, anyone with a call can exercise (buy the shares) it and will directly have gains since they'd be buying shares worth $190 for only $12"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are there a bunch of bullshit DDs? Yes, of course, everyone and their mother want to do one for some reason.

I won't find links, but well, overall we're up from last month, we're up from last year, and the future looks bright. Shorts have to cover, so it will go up.

The only reason to believe it wouldn't go up would be that shorts have already covered, and I don't need DD to know they haven't, just by looking at the whole media narrative, the bots spamming, the death threats/fake suicidal intents reports and so on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah there we are, you're pissed because your brother paper handed. You can't predict shit with the day-to-day price, it's too volatile and manipulated. If you try to day-trade, you're gonna get burned, which is what happened.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hands down I'd take the shares.  No question. Is there ANY concern that this stock will be less than $12 (strike price) going forward even after a squeeze?  All signs point to a turnaround in the fundamentals of the company which means those shares he buys for $12 a piece will be worth a lot more.

Yeah, I wish I knew the secret. Trying to go to school so hopefully I can get a career job instead of these entry level positions. 

I also live in a city where in order to be able to afford the average cost of living you have to be making around $50/hr if you compare the average wage versus the average price of living here. Something like 32% higher to live here than the whole states average cost of living"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What exactly are you ""seeing""? You can't have a short squeeze without high short interest. Short interest is much lower than the first squeeze. What is your evidence that this squeeze will be (much) larger, when short interest is lower?

Another caveat - all of the previous short interest got in their positions under $20 (most well under that price). By definition, once the price is over $20, you know for certain all prior shorts are underwater. But now, the stock is down almost $300 from its January high. Even if the short interest percentage was still high in aggregate, there is simply no way to know whether they are short at $40 (in which case they are bleeding) or short at $400 (in which case they are more in the green than someone who bought GME at $1 per share).

There was a mountain of evidence for the January squeeze built over many months and in some cases more than a year. The buffoonery being bandied about as ""Quality DD"" from people who seemingly did not have any interest in the stock market prior to January 2021 is thinly-researched garbage based on hunches and confirmation bias."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is also partially why everyone got a boner over March 19th.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,100% kidding btw - some things are more precious than tendies. Your fiance likely being one of em.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lolol!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Pretty much.

Let's say stock XYZ is at $10 right now, and you think by April 16, it'll reach $15. You can buy a call for then, so you'd buy an April 16 call, with a  $10 strike (or whatever strike you want). You'd pay, say, a premium of $1 per share, meaning the contract costs you $100.

April 16 rolls around, and XYZ is indeed worth $15. You decide to sell the contracts, but this time their worth is going to be $5 (current - strike).

As for why you would want to try calls instead of stocks, it's leverage:

XYZ rose by 50%, you invested $100:

* With shares, you'd have 10 shares now worth $150. You gained $50
* With calls, you'd have 1 call (100 shares) now worth $500. You gained $400.

The big risk factor is the expiration time. If your call expires worthless, you lose your entire investment."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not ""I heard the shorts aren't covered"", it's ""I never heard anything pointing to the shorts being covered, on the contrary"". I mean, the only proof you could get would be them telling it directly.

All the evidence is more than enough, at least for me. As for DFV not giving a fuck, that's probably not true, because he's having the time of his life on Twitter. And even if it's true, too bad, doesn't change a thing.

And even if he's a millionaire already, I'm pretty sure that's a lot of money that would hurt pretty bad psychologically to lose.

In the end, if you want solid proofs, you shouldn't be betting in the stock market. Is this a bet? Of course it is, but to my eyes, it's a very good one."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yes. I got out at 15.95 from 4. Bought another 500 at 45 and sold majority way to low

I mean, the whole ""lemmings follow each other off a cliff"" is a complete myth, so I think you're disproving your own point while highlighting your arrogance and ignorance. That's fun.

>You even talked about “exercised options”. Why would exercising even be on the table when he can just sell?

Because he can buy them for $12 and hold them if he believes the price will continue to climb. This is pretty basic, bud.

>He already sold a chunk of his position. He’s shitposting his holdings for fun and he’s going to pocket a huge profit either way come apr 16 since he’s so deep in the money. Between now and then, it’s all fun and games to him.  
  
Maybe. Maybe not. Either way, you don't know his motivations, thoughts and feelings. Posting such definitives are cocky, smug, and almost always incorrect af.

>“Because it’s a good play” lol. When his original price target was 40 points per share and his original DD about GME’s rep for being the only brick and mortar retail chain dedicated to gaming? Alright buddy.  
  
He thought the price would jump and it did. He was right. I know he was right because it did. You can't debate the facts; he YOLO'd a bunch of money and made a shitload more. He was right.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Take 10k. Add an additional 1k/month. Invest it at 10%/yr which is what the s&p has done historically. You’re a millionaire in 22 years. If someone starts this after college, they can be a millionaire at 44. If you have a better job and invest 2k+/month or be good/lucky at investing it will happen faster.

Obviously 1k/month isn’t realistic for a lot of people but it doesn’t require an absurd salary or anything."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So what your saying is, it’s really easy to be a millionaire- just invest 274,000?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I put away 2k-3k in savings every month and I’m 40. Put it in the s&p you say and I’ll be good at 62? I started gambling late—as in 3 months ago—just with GME. I need a solid financial advisor.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hoping to retire in 15 years. Pros. Went from a combined salary of 150k, next year was 200k, last year was 300k, this year primed to make 400k. Still living the 170k lifestyle. 5k a month in boomer stocks. 100 a week in shit corn at dips and a play account that I started with 2k to 4.5k after a couple if months. My salary alone pays most bills. Husbands comissions are bonus that go into saving, investing, paying stuff off."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah it would be better to just do dividends or investing in something other than the stock market
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s a good beach house cost? Asking because I’m looking to light some coin on fire with something fancy.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yea I don’t understand the hold concept if whole market is tanking like last month. It was much better to sell my shares when they first started dropping and buy back a month later for more shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The person has a big brain 🧠 he is getting a great deal on an out of this galaxy stock. Making the most of an opportunity. This makes me like the stock more.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You just have the extra balls.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends where you live too. Realistically, putting $200 away per month is much more reasonable for the average wage slave.

Source: am currently paid as wage slave, despite doing a 30/hr job (CNC machinist, and I mean machinist, I do my own setups, programming, etc. I have the knowhow to actually model shit too).

PS: I'm a bit of an ape in the morning and didn't make it clear, I DO NOT MAKE 30/h. I make 17/h. I do the job that SHOULD pay 30+/h. In my back pocket I also have 2 years of field service on CNC machines, which by itself is about 20-25/h minimum. I'm doing the job for that SWEET, SWEET EXP. And knowledge, you learn a fuckton in a job shop."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Or a lot less if you used to be poor. I learned to live on $18K in grad school because it was that or drop out. I make more now, but anything extra I spend feels like treating myself so it’s easy to invest 30% of my paycheck."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I make about $30k after tax per year, and invest ~$800/mo. It’s definitely do able if you’re single no kids and live modestly. I can still go out/order take out like 3 times a week, I buy wine or beer for the weekends, buy new games when they interest me etc, so it’s not like I’m pinching pennies. People often don’t realize how much money they spend on things!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey, quadrupling your money without having to do extra work is still pretty sexy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No you need a small loan of a million dollars
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve seen funds and ETFs that did as much as 140% last year (iShares Global Clean Energy), and big tech ones have have 20-30% average returns going back 20 years, although some years they’re negative, other years they’re much higher (the Black Rock Global Technology Fund averaged 37% a year over the past 5 years, and had a 77% return last year). This is not financial advice, because I’m not an advisor, just a risk taking crayon eater, but say you had $30k already saved, put in $2.5k per month, and chose a big tech fund (or split between a few) that averaged > 25% a year (past performance does not indicate future performance blah blah, but if I’m going to set and forget, tech is the managed fund type for me long term). So at a retirement age of 55, 15 years from now, that would be *somewhere* around $4.5m. The key is to start early with these things but if you can’t, “riskier” investments like tech offer can get you there quicker. As an example, if when you were born your parents put just $1k into a fund that averaged 20% a year for your retirement so you never had to worry about a pension, by the time you were 55, that $1k would be something like $20m. If it averaged 25% over that time, it would be $200m."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You ain't gonna find it here.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How much do you spend per month? If you can invest half your income, you can completely retire in about 10 years.

You won't be rich in retirement. But you can live exactly how you live now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you look Panama, Portugal, Brazil etc there's lots of pretty affordable places.  A ski chalet, tho will be expensive pretty much anywhere"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends on where.  In CA you could easily drop north of $40M to be right on the beach.  There's cheaper shit too, of course"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,U r welcome
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So we should be mad at OP right? He just admitted to selling.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, screw securing your retirement, what a stupid thing to want to do. We're here to ""fuck over the hedgies"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. Let me know the next time it peaks and bottoms out.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the more we sell at this low price, the more the hedgefunds buy back to cover. Every day people try to day trade this shit, the more they cover. Theyre slowly covering every day."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea I get it’s more important w the GME shares, I’ve just held them. I meant in the market in general when you hit a huge high of say $50 and stock starts a downtrend, to hold and average down still is losing money instead of just selling at $45 and buying back in at $35"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Computer programming <> CNC programming. Theoretically, you can do both if you understand the logic, but computer programming is an entirely different monster than CNC programming. Also, oversaturated market on the comp sci end, and literally no one wants to work in industry. 

Company I work for couldn't find anyone better than a druggie or a numbskull who didn't understand 'righty tighty, lefty loosey' for two years. Possibly due to low pay, but I can survive for a year or two, and find something for much more money after that, providing our industry doesn't get nuked in the meantime.

 CNC programming is a lot more... conversational, you describe an area on a workpiece that you want the machine to cut and the program you're using will do all the calculations for the moves the machine needs to make. Usually off a model you're using. It's less about the programming and more about visualising how the machine will move, and knowledge of cutting speeds and feeds for different materials. Which you can google fairly easily."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only if you don’t know shit about cars. You can service lambos for much cheaper than what the stealership will charge you. For instance most of them are outfitted with Brembo brakes. If you do a quick cross reference on the part number you’ll find that dodge vipers etc use the exact same parts under a different part number, for a fraction of the cost that a Lambo dealer will charge you. Tons of other car parts fit on lambos from much cheaper cars. Just like how Audi R8 coil packs fit in my VW GTI."

But unlike gas stations, chargers can be scaled, they already are everywhere, and they will be at every parking spot eventually. I hate Tesla's focus on suburban garages as well, duh, 99% of city-dwellers live in high-rise buildings, isn't that obvious, Elon? But I'm still getting one. ICE is finished.

911 GT3 revs to 9000

Ferrari LaFerrari revs to 9250

Mclaren 720S revs to 8500

Even a Lexus LFA revs to 9000 (not sure if I consider this an exotic; probably not)

The new T.50 has a v12 and revs to 12,100  


I'm sure there are more.  Is the Lambo's v10 highly regarding as one of the best sounding engines of all time, yes?, absolutely.  But if you're a huge car guy, I'd recommend learning about some of the other high revving exotics... because there's actually many other great choices in the Huracan's price range. cheers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not saying they aren’t very good cars. They still need care and service to stay that way. I think some did read my post wrong though. The market for these items is not just super rich. The majority are probably just at the line to afford one. For example, over a decade ago there was this idea for a “luxury tax” targeting yacht owners. They got money right? Who really has a yacht anyway? So it easily had support. Not enough yacht owners to resist it. The result was it decimated the boat building industry on the east coast. Took jobs away from countless tradesmen in the supply chain. Hurt the very politicians that championed it. Who then quickly repealed it. Turned out the bulk of buyers were just over the fence and the added tax pulled them back over the other side. That was what I was alluding to. Not knocking the cars or the buyers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Warranties don’t cover regular maintenance, typically only catastrophic failures of non wearable parts or drivetrain. A lambo is roughly 5k a year to service, even if you only drive 1,000 miles a year. If you need tires, add 2k for a set of 4. Bugattis are the most expensive to service yearly which can be $20,000 on the low end and $50,000 on the high end."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So how do you expect people who can’t afford EVS to just give up on gas.? 🤔🤔.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,As soon as my portfolio moons
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"EVs will do to fuel-powered vehicles what the internal-combustion engine did for horses. The horse was the primary power source, and was exploited as such. Once engines took over, people only rode horses for recreation and sport. (And a few specialized jobs.) We'll still have gasoline-powered vehicles, but only for fun, or applications where EVs are impractical.

I don't see electric riding mowers taking over any time soon; the cost-to-benefit ratio is still too high."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did some DD on this areas , some random sharing 
for like minded folks who r into EV 
1) Ev is the future and total addressable market is huge and it’s low hanging fruit to capture market share of ICE cars 
.Globally “first world countries”
Government has announced mandatory ev by when and when seem quite determined 

2) I think EV is a technology play , re imagine how car can be 
Tesla and lucid stand out in this area has the ev / battery patents accumulated over the years shd serves them well in mid range and slightly premium market 

3) Another observation , for  pure EV play only 3 names Telsa , lucid , Arrival has set up its vertical factory and not out sourcing it . I shd think these r the key players who wants to protect their valuable IP / patents in-house 

Telsa will alway lead the industry for sure being the real Pioneer 

4) Tesla has battery storage as another revenue stream too and many more.
For lucid they have another battery storage  biz they started in 2008 to provide battery for all Formula-E race car competition 

5) EV global adoption is not in full gear yet. Stlll has plenty of upsides

I bought on dip recently for Tesla ($580) and ARVL  ($18) stonk.

They're suffering from the same thing Porsche suffers from. All their cars look the same but with slightly different proportions. I guess all the auto manufacturers do that now to some degree but Tesla could use a design overhaul. And please, nothing else resembling that cyber truck monstrosity. 

I think bring back the roadster concept but now with all their new technology and a fresh look. Make a functional large pickup truck that can be fitted with a utility bed. A sports coupe, a crossover, a jeep competitor with a solar sail to charge in remote places. I don't know but their current lineup is getting boring from a design standpoint and the cyber truck is just to far out there to be functional."

Anyone saying that ICE is finished doesn't understand what sports car enthusiasts will do for their passion.  nor do they understand that the infrastructure for ICE is *already there*.  ICE isn't going anywhere.  Will Gasoline rain from the sky?  Maybe not.  But haven't you heard about synthetic green fuels?  Porsche is working on one right now.  Gevo is making biofuel for airlines.  it's only a matter of time before we have a no-compromise green synthetic fuel alternative for ICE automobiles, that can be deployed via the pre-existing national gas station infrastructure.  I personally think that day will come much sooner than the day where all new vehicles sold in the US are EV.

Even if the LaFerrari isn't sold anymore, Ferrari have several cars that are for sale that are NA and are higher revving.

The huracan shares its engine with the Audi R8. (though if you don't consider a gt3 exotic - you're crazy btw, you may not consider an R8 exotic either)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lambo tires typically range between $1,200 to 1,500 on discount sites for mid range tires, after mounting and balancing easily in the range of $1,500-2,000. For high end tires you’re looking at $2500-5000 for a set of 4. Ferrari’s 7 year maintenance package is pretty unique. Lambo’s don’t come with a maintenance package with purchase. You can purchase separate 3-year or 5-year maintenance packages for a separate charge. Lambo’s also only have 36-month unlimited mile bumper to bumper warranties and only if you buy it new. They do offer 5 and 7 year extensions for new purchases and you can have third party companies write custom warranties for used purchases."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol there was actually a post where someone listed rules to maintain your newfound wealth. And the lambo was actually the opposite of one of the rules. Had some good advice. But I’d probably just go with a diesel Denali. Y’all can keep the lambos

Marie Antoinette was so oblivious to the suffering of the French people when told the peasants had no bread she responded let them eat cake.

The $1,500-2,000 figure was cost of tires in the range of 1,200-1,500 + mounting and balancing at $50-$75 a tire so after taxes etc puts you in the $1,500-$2,000 for 4 new tires mounted and balanced."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not insulted, though I'm not fully clear on what you're trying to say. First you are saying those who buy these cars tend to be selfish, but then you say there are exceptions, so, it sounds like we are saying the same thing?  One shouldn't judge someone based on one small thing about their life.  

You are right though (even though you shouldn't have assumed), those in my circle would generally abstain from anything that flashy so I may not have met many lambo/ferrari drivers (that I know of).  Close friends have a chauffeured Mercedes, a bunch of others with Porsches, Mercedes, BMWs, Jaguars, range rovers, audis, etc, many more don't drive at all (large urban centre).  My partner and I have a Toyota Camry that we never use and have a higher net worth than most of our friends, everyone has different priorities.  A close friend of mine built a $30M house and took the subway. We also got bored during the pandemic and bought a few expensive things (art).  I try not to judge."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My guy, you’re in wsb not /r/politics. Go discuss the distribution of wealth somewhere else. All we care about are tendies here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's not entirely an assumption, paying attention to the way any item is marketed you can gain a broad strokes picture of the avatar of a company's target demographic. These companies marketing departments know exactly to a very high level of detail who their target client is, age, gender, other purchases made, net worth, the emotional triggers that convert a prospect into a buyer. I would also go as far as to say they have a name for this person as well (it's not a real person just a composite of the type of person who buys their products). So the fact you would assume owning this type of an exotic car doesn't make a person a douche, would lead me to believe you haven't met many of these people - big ego is a defining feature of the type of client for these products. It is understandable why someone who's dreamed their whole life about this car would get one, and how that car would be a symbol of something more than just the car. Would hope people would dream bigger dreams about the person they want to be, life they want to lead, the impact they want to have on humanity, than just acquiring nice, expensive things to flaunt as a proffering to their ego, but oh well. The material culture in America is such where there's a growing idolization of the idea of ""fuck you money,"" which is so overtly ego driven and spiritually corrosive I find it a shame at large for the society as a whole.

It's less the car, and more the idea of buying these out of boredom. Just a shame. Some people idolize this kind of behavior, I don't.

I second the sentiment on the Camry. Only car worth owning imho."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think what he was trying to say is it's one thing to buy a Lambo because you're a gearhead and appreciate the automotive excellence a car like that provides versus buying it because you just want to look flashy and make pussies drip.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This conversation ended an hour ago. Thank you for your input. Not a guy. Not a socialist. People buying lambo's ""because they're bored"" is a sad reflection of their humanity. It reminds me of someone. End."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All fair points, though I can't speak to American culture (live in Canada). I would have thought there are better cars to own if you are a 'gearhead' though admittedly I know very little about cars.  I don't drive and my partner, now with the pandemic, uses the car maybe once or twice a month.  We use Uber / taxis more than we use our own car, or just walk to the store.  Most things are delivered.  We've toyed with the idea of getting an electric Mercedes if they ever make one, but just doesn't seem worth it. 

I think idolization of money is more complicated than you make it out to be, because there are good reasons to idolize what money *could* do.  I agree it is mostly toxic, and usually tied to acquiring material things, but there is a flip side to it.  It affords freedom, freedom to explore your own life ambitions, freedom to travel/learn, freedom to give back without any material impact on your own life.  I agree that the problem is most don't idolize *that* part of it.  There are toxic people around every corner, poor and rich.  It is really hard to surround yourself with the right people sometimes, especially when it's family!"

I agree with what you're saying, and it is a smidge different in Canada (I went to UBC) in terms of the cultural appreciation of wealth. It is great for a person to aspire to a life of freedom and controlling their destiny. It is great for a person to aspire to solving large problems that impact large amounts of people and great wealth follows. But here there is this whole ""fuck you money"" shitck you'll find. It's not an idea of wealth beyond dethroning The Man and stepping into his place because ""fuck you."" Fuck you yeah I have enough money to buy a 20 car garage worth of lambo's aaaaand what? Fuck you. It's not that everyone with wealth is like this, but living in Los Angeles, it's not an anomaly either. I don't see it as something to aspire to. And the few people I've known who have gotten caught up in that approach to wealth typically are not fundamentally happy because they are externalizing their own sense of self worth on the things they have and there's always the next thing to buy and there's always someone who has something nicer etc."
2021-04-02 03:18:17,wallstreetbets,"TSLA - Cathie Wood's PT broken down in six months segment (April 2021 update). Ark Invest (Cathie Wood) released their new PT for TSLA last month.

Source: [https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target-2/)

According to which, the expected share price for TSLA is $3,000 in 2025, and in bull case it would be $4,000.

Based on $4,000 PT, it comes down to an average of $2.43 gain per day till January 1st, 2025. An average gain of 0.13% per day would result in the same end result. Neither of these scenario are likely to happen as it is impossible for stock price to move consistently in one direction whether it is dollar gain or percentage gain. This is how it would look like for the both scenarios (broken down in six month intervals).

|Date|Projected Price (Fixed $ gain)|Projected Price (Fixed % gain)|
|:-|:-|:-|
|July 1, 2021|$883.33|$745.69|
|January 1, 2022|$1,331.35|$949.34|
|July 1, 2022|$1,772.07|$1,203.87|
|January 1, 2023|$2,220.09|$1,532.66|
|July 1, 2023|$2,660.80|$1,943.58|
|January 1, 2024|$3,108.83|$2,474.39|
|July 1, 2024|$3,551.98|$3,141.91|
|January 1, 2025|$4,000.00|$4,000.00|

We know that TSLA is a highly volatile stock, so it is unlikely to move like this. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to see where TSLA ends up at the end of each six month (or even three month) period. I am planning on using my spreadsheet as a rough guideline to determine if we stay on target or not. Another use is to determine which strike and expiry to grab. If there is any interest, I can post updates and details of any shares/calls I end up buying.

My positions

* 41 shares.
* 2x $700c 4/9e.

As always, please do your own DD. TSLA is a very volatile stock so be patient and extra careful with your plays.

I can't believe there is a possibility of this actually happening. Not to mention that ARK is waaay undervaluing the robotaxi network. They have the robotaxi network at 50% margin, absolute nonsense. It's probably more like 80-90%. They have the tesla owned fleet at something like 10-20% or something like that, also way low. As soon as robotaxi actually launches you can forget about buying a tesla. It will all be produced for their own fleet for at least 10 years until they start saturating the cab and uber market.

Cabs and ubers are about 20m worldwide. If tesla just replaces those, they don't even need to undercut the price by much. It will be like 1.5 per mile. This will be a 20k share price easily with a 30pe (low). And we aren't even counting energy, semi, or anything else.

Someone like me would then be at about 10m net worth. Sure it sounds crazy, but nobody can explain what exactly would be wrong with that model. The only argument is ""thats crazy dude, take your meds"". Warren Redlich will be proved right eventually."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"if a $100 stock goes up 10% each day for 10 days, what will be the price?

You're going to say $200

I'm going to say $260"

TSLA is literally what got ARK to where it is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,General tech selloff plus 2 months is hardly enough time to see if an investment was good decision. Tesla was flat as fuck for 3 years plus

2021-04-02 02:49:18,wallstreetbets,"I'm betting on $ASO heading for a major breakout over the next two weeks after stellar earnings, high short interest, and very bullish options activity. I've done 3 DD posts and have not been wrong yet, check my post history.

* Puts on $DASH when it was at $225 it's now $133
* Buy TGT when it was $170 it's now $200
* Buy $AAPL when it was $116 it's now $122

&#x200B;

**Up next is $ASO and so far it's shaping up to be a great trade.**

There are a couple of key items regarding $ASO to understand why it's primed for a big breakout.

1. They just reported earnings this week, and the results were stellar:
   1. Revenues were US$5.7b, approximately in line with what analysts expected.
   2. (EPS) crushed expectations, coming in at US$3.79, an impressive 41% ahead of estimates.
2. It has high institutional ownership (I've seen conflicting numbers, if I am to go off of yahoo data it would appear that 60mm of the 90mm shares are institutionally owned. )
3. March 15, 2021 short interest was over 39% (It's almost certain that anyone who has shorted this is under water right now...unless they opened a short at 3:53pm today, which is not likely).

April 16, 2021 options:

* The $25, $30, $35 all have more open interest than any single strike in the put column.
* 18,973 for the $30 strike is massive volume for a stock that has 93% institutional ownership.
   * The public float is 31 million
   * Outstanding shares are 90 million
* The 18,000 contracts on the $30 strike representing nearly 2 million shares is pretty significant when considering the public float is only 31 million. If every strike closes ITM this will likely have somewhere in the 40,000 - 50,000 contracts closing ITM which is 4-5mm of that 31mm shares (7%)

$ASO closed the day just over $29 / share and has moved up a little in after hours, nearly 30. We have a long weekend so once Monday rolls around there will be a lot of pressure on MM's due to the fact that 18,000+ contracts would expire ITM at the $30 strike by that Friday.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"you son of a bitch....im in!   


2- 4/16 30c and 3-4/16 35c........first time buying calls, no idea what I\`m doing and this is all I could afford lets see how this goes!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s bound to happen. I sold my 4/16 calls today to liquidate my RH account and move my main trading account to a different brokerage. 
This is the way."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wife is a manager at our local Academy, they’ve already beat their 5 year sales plan since 2019. Last year they beat their *single store* sales by $3m, along with another store in her district beating projected sales last year by $2m. Ammo and gun shelves are bare every time I’m in the store, which is at least once a week. People line up at the door for opening fire that shit, at 8:00 in the morning they usually have 30 of them outside."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Market cap of only 2.56B with revenue of 1.6B just this last quarter...🤔 

Why is this only a $30 stock? Fuck it, I'm in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought a bit early March and plan to hold through next earnings. Background checks for guns at records levels January and March, they're paying down debt, reopening play, plus if I lived in Texas without power for a week I'd be stocking up on some emergency outdoor gear just in case. Not sure if I'll buy in again on Monday but defo looking for a buying opportunity over the next month."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love Academy Sports.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I like it - non tech reopening play.  
I’m bag holding pltr at the top :("
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hope this doesn’t break my heart like my DISCA 30p have so far 😢
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AH closed at $30. Monday will moon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The TGT call was clutch. $200 April 16th, good shit sir!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I am in .. let’s ride
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I need more money, I bought in today before close, but I want more. 💰💰🤪"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,your dd keeps making me money ty 😍
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Please just tell me it won't tank when i FOMO on Monday..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Say no more
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Im in for 4/16 and 5/21 calls 🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Of course ive been holding 20 @ $25 for a month and just sold them after earnings at 26.50 cause i was worried about the lockup the following day. Smh , a true retard right here"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in. 35 calls at open. put it in for .65 hope it gets filled
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Omg this guy said puts at DASH when it was all time high pre lockup availability how could he have known??? Who saw that coming?? Everybody

I called dash would rise from IPO then fall after but this was all obvious

ASO rocks though been bullish on them"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even before I found this post I've said I wish I bought more of this back in November.

20 @ 16.00

My reason for buying was simple. I've given them plenty of money over the years and I've never heard anyone say anything bad about Academy. That's all. Love that place!

I was pleasantly surprised to see it close at 30.00 in after hours."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What am I missing here?  This is a mid size sporting goods chain with decent fundamentals but against dicks, maybe a little cheap but not crazy. Half the sales, similar margins  and maybe 1/3rd of market cap so some room to run.  Much of 2020 sales spike due to COVID and it will be tough to match that growth in 2021.    Maybe if they start paying a dividend.  The industry growth rate is modest at best.  ???"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,$ASO is solid. Its also a Magic Formula stock these days.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m jumping on this on Monday any advice?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Looks solid to me
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even though I'm new in this Option call and the way it works but I can afford to lose some little $$. I throw in $35 call 4/16 Buy. Hopefully, it pays off OP lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's April fool's.... I can't trust shit today.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beginning of March invested $20K in a mix of shares and calls and am down $6K (probably $4K if we figure the price at $30 per share) as of now. Hoping this thing takes off! 🚀🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Make a YOLO play then.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"please wrinkle my brain if i seem smooth af, but i would think that a high short interest in general is bad as the only potential upside would be for them to cover (squeeze) which is extremely rare? GME![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|money_face)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In Dutch an “aso” refers to a person behaving like a egotistical retard (“aso” is the abbreviation for “asociale” meaning something like anti-social) . So I’m selling naked calls and buying puts on aso.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD. Could you share how you’re buying these options or recommend a platform someone from EU can use?

I’ve only started trading a few weeks ago doing CFDs on Capital. They don’t sell ASO."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are calls too expensive or can I still jump in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm still learning about options. OP could you explain why you chose a 30$ strike price expiri g on april 16 and 35$ on may 21?

What is you thesis that these dates will satisfy?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What do I need to do to make a play on Monday?  Will 5/21 calls be the way for Monday?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Think it'll hit 40-50 next week?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good DD. I’d feel more confident if there was updated short interest data. I’m wondering if the recent run up was shorts covering.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I really wanna YOLO everything into 4/16 35c but I'm feeling kinda cautious about this. It had a great run on 4/1 but I'm afraid of a rug pull on Monday, particularly if the market decides to shit the bed and $ASO decides to follow it.

Volume on 4/1 was 3.5 mil compared to an average 1.5 mil. I've read some bearish sentiment that $ASO is likely to reject the $30-$40 range and regress to $26-$27, swing trading in a $5 spread. Every ramp has a slide so I guess everything depends on if Monday it continues the momentum rather than just getting dumped from profit takers who think $30 is the peak."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks for the DD, will load up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Want to join you but proceeding with caution. Won’t do it by selling any GME and extremely nervous about testing unknown resistance over the next two weeks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the April call and not after may? Is the earnings call no longer relevant since they pre announced?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,!remindme 2 days
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Should also look at $VSTO, another great play on ammo and plenty of upside"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,that wasn’t your DD on dash.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah I mean...50/50 chance if you post something that isn't GME you just get soft banned....wish I had seen your post when it was low 20's.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been watching ASO for a while was always surprised it got no volume.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I remember ASO DD last month too. It was solid DD then, as it is now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bastard. My first 10 short term options were all fucking stupid plays. I guess that’s kind of the entry price for learning. However, I’ve started to get the hang of it. Made 4k (400%) on semiconductors last week and already up 100% on ASO.

This seems solid and I wish I had purchased more 10 - 30c and 10 - 35c both for 4/16. I think people really expected this to drop after shares unlocked on the 30th, but it didn’t budge. 

The 35c options were so cheap and OTM last week that they were at 0 delta - ie. MMs considered them free money and was no reason to hedge. Well, that changed fast and even those are up now. 

The earnings report wasn’t just good, it was monstrous. Record gains in sales, earnings, revenue, even an increase In e-commerce of 100%. 

The short ratio on this thing is 10 days. People keep parroting this “not everything is a short squeeze,” because they heard some smarter chucklefuck say it about another stock, but it absolutely plays a role in some situations. The last 3 days were massive, just look at the charts. Unless all those buyers were shorts covering (we can see that they aren’t) and none of the momentum was brought on buy the amazing earnings, there are going to be a lot of people trying to get out of this before the 4/16s print. 

Most of the company is owned by a hedge fund that isn’t going to paper hand this shit. 

I’m picking up 10 more 35c and maybe even some 40c on Monday."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol, gotta learn somehow!

(if you use TD, paper trading options is how I learned + youtube)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, when the Dems are in control of the executive and legislative branches...gun / ammo sales always go up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I love the decisions that come after ""fuck it""....."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$2 billion of debt too and it’s basically a department store so will need to take on more to expand. Price multiple is like 7 though so arguably pretty undervalued. What’s the catalyst for this to 🚀 is my question, it’s already up like 100% since it’s IPO."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To Pluto!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just let those bags go dude. Could be 5-10 years before you see profit again in that SkyNet wannabe.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah just saw that...that means every single person who has shorted is under water right now...if that options activity triggers a gamma that triggers a margin call into the following week....could easily go north of $60.

We'll see !"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"On 4000 share volume too, not just a few"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm wondering when walmart is going to catch up!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What time is best to enter? Usually buying at the opening is the worse time, bu then again with earning like this it might not dip?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m in.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can feel my little dick getting hard already
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ez money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,good to hear!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"80 dollars is still gain money

i was able to pull 300 on calls and 200 on puts on and after earnings

idk how to feel about lockup expiry so i didn't want to keep holding. 

it ended the day at 30 tho. I'm tempted 🥵"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think this will tank....there is pretty limited downside, there is a lot of support a few dollars below. This isn't something that has run up massively already and the floor can fall out from under you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d wait a few minutes after open. Wednesday had a tasty dip we’d where it erased the previous day’s gains before closing green.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🤐
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah...clearly everyone, check the comments in the post most people thought it was a stupid idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, a lot of what I've seen in the comments here is making me even more bullish on this one than I was!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well...consider how well they did during the pandemic for one...when a lot of money was not going towards team sports etc.

Then consider that the short interest is 30%

Then look at what I posted regarding the options activity. If a gamma gets triggered off of that, every single person who has shorted this is under water right now as it hit an ATH in AH at 8:00pm. The higher it goes, the more likelihood of a margin call which means those shorts need to come to the open market to buy shares to cover their position to give back to the lender."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dicks pissed on the 2nd Amendment. Rednecks will always choose Academy over Dicks
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Agreed.  I have seen several posts regarding ASO over the past month or so and I also don't see the catalyst for heavy growth.  But what do I know?  Good luck to the holders.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s why I picked it up. I just happened to be browsing a list of high short interest stocks and the magic formula and we got a double hit!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"buy high, sell higher"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is all public info
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, market has been tough...easy money is mostly over for now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I will almost certainly look at buying more shares / options on monday.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"GME was a once in a lifetime squeeze that ALREADY HAPPENED it went up 1600% in 4 weeks. It had 148+ % short interest and its under 25% now.

ASO likely still has investors in a lockup period from the spac merger, and basically 40% short interest. 

Now look at Viacom for example and sure that was slightly dif but that was a squeeze...yah it didn’t go from 14 to 518 but I think the potential for ASO is similar to that of some moves we saw in VIAC and Discovery."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"smart, buying puts on something that's got 40% SI."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would u get puts lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Let him enjoy his retirement 👏
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME Aspies are insane.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have no idea tbh!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,they were pretty cheap at the end of the day yesteray.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it was cheaper, and also if you look at the screenshot of open interest, it's where most other people have bought options. 

For may I bought a little higher (35) because it was roughly half the cost of the 30 strike."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I posted my positions for April 16, May is probably a safe bet. options, stock, probably all good choices."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Depends how much larger the OTM calls grow, since it hit $30 in AH the ITM open interest is over 18,000 ....if a lot of people start buying in high volume on monday MM's will have to buy shares to cover...if shorts try to close they'll have to buy shares to get out. It could go that high, we'll see."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It hasn't gone up much at all...I don't think those who are shorting are worried right now, the days to cover was like 9, I'm sure it's not that expensive to borrow yet."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well...let's say the 10 year goes to 1.8...it SHOULDN'T really matter here, bc this isn't a tech / inflation fear stock...but you never know. 

I think it's undervalued and has potential for a gamma squeeze that leads into a short squeeze. I'm not dumping my whole account in but I'm putting enough in to see a big return if all goes well."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,the options are pretty cheap...you can get in for a few hundred dollars.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"because it has 39.4% short interest and there is massive volume on the $30 strike calls for April 16th...if we get close to that date and everything is ITM, MM's have to buy more shares, pushes the price up which puts more pressure on the shorts. Anyone who has EVER opened a short position on this is at a loss right now as it hit the ATH in AH Friday. 

To cover a short, you have to buy a share on the open market and return it to whoever the lender is. 

I'm betting on this having enough interest due to it's performance / value that can help push a gamma squeeze which can lead to a short squeeze in the most bullish case possible. If that doesn't happen, due to their performance it's still a solid play."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Huh?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was alot, not sure I folowed all of it but thank you for the response! So im guessing I didnt totally fumble my first call contract buys? That makes me feel slightly better about tossing another $500 into the hole that is my WSB account lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,These earnings weren't even driven by gun sales.  It was footwear and apparel for the most part.  I'm sure gun sales will help this next quarter though.  Democrats are the best gun salesmen.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right!   Then the coup is attempted on rep controlled gov.  lol  people will always be scared and stupid, that is set in stone."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They IPO that thing dirt cheap to make all the institutional investors billionaires. A PE of 7 with almost a billion in the war chest and plans to over double the number of stores. 100 dollars may be cheap for that stock just on sound investment principals. As a company that's growing and making good money it should have a PE over 15 probably in the mid 20's at a minimum. I really like this stock and wish I would have looked at it sooner.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why the 35c? Why not put it all on the 30c? Wouldnt that have a greater return and itm?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have to agree. Opportunity cost is a real thing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I jumped in 1500 on shares at 28.80 before close gonna throw 1500 more monday
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Looking at daily trends, I usually expect a slight dip around noon (eastern time) and a rise in the last hour of trading. Of course it's not always consistent, but it's happened often enough that I tend to rely on it for a bit of extra gains."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m tempted to jump back in on Monday as well!  I may do just a couple of straight calls, we’ll see.  

I love credit spreads though, if I had waited and the stock jumped to $40+ next week, my $100 play would have turned into a $4900 return!

You can’t beat that 49X dangling carrot 😆"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They did ok over the past year.  But a lot of that was just 2021 dollars spent in 2020.  No one needs another kayak once they buy the first one.  And after the gamma trade is done, things should settle back down to fair value.  2021 sales growth will be key.  

That’s the fun part, we get to see how things play out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’d be fine with being proven wrong.   And I’m learning that rising stock prices don’t have to be linked to a good company.  

It’s always “I like the stock”, not “I like the company’s prospects”.   

But then I’m also cynical AF."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,btw  GME short interest is under 25% held by insiders and 110% by institutions if you straight up just go to yahoo finance. So it’s still short af and probably even more than we puplicly know. The squeeze did NOT happen at all. Get ur facts straight literal ape
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking 🌈🐻
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cause stock market does the opposite of what you think
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem, thanks for answering. i guess i should do my own due diligence."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I guess I should have bought more contracts instead of just 5x May 40c
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I'm hesitant on ASO as a long play but I did some more reading and read their earnings call, and as a short play I think the potential is good. 

This looks exactly like RKT did before it ran up 70% in that gamma/short squeeze at the beginning of March, they're just missing the special dividend.

I think I'll see how Monday's action goes then pick up some 4/16 35c. I have a good feeling about this but man, my gut is telling me ""yes"" but my brain is telling me ""NOOO"" so it'll be exciting at least, hah."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,4/16 30c it is then!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,there was DD on dash before your account was created
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 35c for 5/21 on Thursday, already up 40%. These will surely run"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I bought 2 shares a couple days ago and just bought 2 call options through Robinhood. I'm brand new to this. 
I'm confused about something. Why would you wait until Monday to buy more? Can't you buy these options after hours like I just did?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No expiration date. MODS! u/zjz
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This post was not that —I thought he made some solid points.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah there isn’t some massive short player on EVERY stock out there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"just spreading it out, I might buy more stuff on Monday we'll see. 

The 35 in may was like $.50 when I got it so it was just a cheap play."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"As a native Texan, I’ve been shopping at Academy since they killed Rooster Andrews and knocked them out of business. So pretty much since 1999. OG Texans would know what Rooster Andrews used to be. Rooster was a huge sponsor for The University of Texas Athletics. Advertisements were every where when Ricky #34 was running towards his Heisman. They have a Whataburger-like loyalty.

Academy has product offerings in wellness & fitness. So gym equipment, supplements, bandages, ropes, weights etc.

They have equipment for all sports, guys and girls. Tennis, Golf, baseball, basketball and football. So rackets, clubs, golf bags, bats, rims, helmets etc.

They carry all major sporting clothing for day wear and training. Nike, UA, Addidas, and cheaper versions like Champion and Rebock.

They have shoes for all sports, guys and girls, men and women. They have fratty and dad shoes like New Balance. They have running brands like Brooks and Oasics too. 

They carry work boots and boots would that would be needed on a ranch or hiking in Big Bend NP. They have shoes for wadding and fishing, if that’s your thing.

They sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, and they will also help you get your hunting and fishing permits too. Obviously they sell fishing rods and bait and tackle. They sell hunting camo and Magellan and Columbia fat person deep sea fishing shirts too.

They sell tents for camping and tents for tailgating. They sell bikes and tires.

They sell air soft guns and paintball guns. At least they did when I was in high school.

Yeah, Academy has a shit ton of goods. Goods that are all reasonably priced. It goes without saying I’m long on these guys."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah....I bought 5 calls at the $25 strike in my IRA on like Tuesday which I wish I had bought more lol...up over $1200 right now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,okay? I threw $25k at it and the bet paid off well....what's your point?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"anyways,

position: 124 shares of ASO

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Would their next earnings be end of June and not May, might want to readjust your options."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeesh. Long weekend time decay will hurt you bad if price stays constant
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So basically, if the actual price is anywhere above 35, you reserve the right to buy it at 35, making the spread. Am I understanding this right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"All that stuff is low margin and expensive to store.  There’s a reason there aren’t dozens of sporting goods stores: it’s really tough to do well in that space.  It’s also really expensive to expand into new territory.  They are going up against giants or local stores.  If they want to grow and take market share, they’ll have to expand into California and the northeast.  Or overseas."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol. That’s some dark shit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Consumer discretionary & Clear eyes full hearts... can’t go tits up

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You going to cry?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just checked. Next earning date not announced yet. That said, I feel good about a few 5/21 $40 Calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol 10% a week man.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah sure Kayaks, Weights and training stands do take up space, and have low margins. But it’s a small segment of their store both in SF and revenues. Like really small. In terms is SF and layout, Fitness items are in the front left hand corner and bikes are in the back right corner. Predominantly most floor space is clothing. Shoes and other traditional sporting equipment is along the left hand wall. 

The company’s revenues are typically from Youth Sports through Varsity Sport demographics. Moms and Dads buying their sons and daughters new gear for a new season. Hunting/fishing/camping is likely for adults and families who grew up in that outdoorsy lifestyle. When I lived in Georgia I know there were more Academy’s than Dicks. Seems it’s a SE US region for now."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,10% a week is insane
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait please explain this tactic to me. You're saying that so many people have calls that expire OTM because they expect a squeeze, so the pricing on the flip side of the trade (puts?) is favorable and likely due to implied volatility? 

Sorry I am a noob just trying to learn."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it. That coach from Arkansas went to go coach high school football. You don’t make that kind of move unless the new job is kush

2021-04-02 02:05:40,wallstreetbets,"Gaming and Leisure Properties ($GLPI) GLPI is an Americal real estate investment trust listed on the Nasdaq that focusses on aquiring real property assets leased to gaming operators.

As of now they own 48 different properties across 16 states. important to note is that the word gaming is simply a substitute for casino.

The REIT is currently trading at 43.67 dollars. The revenue of this company has been growing steadily over the last quartiles. They have a solid profit margin of 44% and a banging operating margin of 67% 

Furthermore, the company has a forward divident rate of 6% which is quite reasonable for a share. This 6% attracts so many institutions that nearly 97% is held by them.

The beta also displays that this is not a meme stock, it has a beta of 1.07 which means this company is 7% more volatile than the market.

I study architecture and simply adore REITs, so i thought maybe i'd share my find with you guys

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Okay so a few questions for you.

1.  How do you account for the aging client base of gaming establishments.  It's been well documented that table gaming and slots are no as popular among millennials?
2. How do you account for the geographic risk of several of the properties?  Several are in areas subject to natural disasters?  None are located in the biggest hotspots for gambling Macua and Las Vegas?
3. How does the portfolio hedge against the rise of online sports book betting?
4. Why do you like a portfolio that has several Hollywood casinos which thematically pale in comparison to other properties?
5. How many of these casinos have you visited?  I can tell you that Tropicana in Atlantic City has to compete with Bally's and Caesars which happen to connect, so you get two experiences in essentially one large property.
6. Which is your favorite casino and why?  It doesn't have to be in the portfolio."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Firstly thank you for your critical response, it allows me to consider cetain aspects and ultimately improve.

1. That's a solid point you bring up, because indeed, the client base is currently lower than what it used to be, and thus a potential threath to GLPI.
2. Once again, solid point, I personally didnt look into the geographical locations with regards to natural disasters. Ultimately though, most REITs have many properties spread around the US with almost always a few of them in locations prone to natural disasters. The company was founded i 2013 which means they are still quite young therefore, it makes sense they havent yet gotten to own a casino in the gambling hotspots.
3. I guess simply by making sure the casino is always a hotel at the same time. because otherwise i would not see how they hedge against this rising change in betting behavior. And yes, for long term this is a valid threat.
4. For sure, there are many other casinos that look way better, yet how are you going to invest in those? Because im quite certain there not many other REITs focussing on casinos out there.
5. None, i live in Europe lol
6. Unfortunately i do not have a favorite, but generally speaking i like the more modern looking casinos."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For this specific REIT i do not know, but generally speaking. "" The maximum capital gains tax rate of 20% (plus the 3.8% Medicare Surtax) applies generally to the sale of REIT stock. """
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Most stock dividends meet the IRS definition of “qualified dividends,” so they get lower long-term capital gains tax rates. Most REIT dividends don’t qualify.
So the majority of REIT distributions are classified as ordinary income, which is taxable at your marginal tax rate.
However, some of your REIT distributions could meet the definition of qualified dividends. This happens when a REIT distributes a long-term capital gain on the sale of an asset or if the REIT itself receives a qualified dividend payment.

I always make sure to set my strike at a price I would be willing to sell my shares at for a profit. I generally only sell 2-3 weeks out expiry as I want the option to expire worthless. The only downside to this is if your stock moons you cap your upside by being forced to sell your shares at your lower strike price. So say I buy 100 shares of stock for $25 share. I then sell a covered call two weeks out at a strike of $30. If the stock doesn’t hit $30 in that two weeks I keep all my premium and the option expires worthless. If it does hit $30 in those two weeks. I wait until it is exercised and I sell my shares at a strike of $30 making a $5 profit per share and keep all my premium. But say the stock shoots to 50 in two weeks, I am forced to sell my shares at $30 capping all my profits had I not sold the CC and I still keep all the premium. You could also buy back the contracts you sold before expiry if you didn’t want to lose your 100 shares."
2021-04-02 01:40:48,wallstreetbets,"Heath Tarbert to move from CFTC straight to Citadel Securities Heath Tarbert was a chairman of Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) till January 21 2021, when he stepped down to continue as commissioner. Now he is going straight to Citadel Securities as Chief Legal Officer, effective April 5 2021 [as published by Bloomberg.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-04-01/citadel-securities-hires-ex-cftc-chairman-tarbert-as-legal-chief)

[Bloomberg article](https://preview.redd.it/1zijf6zcmmq61.png?width=1233&format=png&auto=webp&s=19f0a2f83eec33f1cd53c57005cb2600fac7cd2b)

What is CFTC and what do they do? CFTC is the **Commodity Futures Trading Commission** and ""... is an **independent agency of the US government** created in 1974, that regulates the U.S. derivatives markets, which includes **futures, swaps, and certain kinds of options.""** [\[wiki\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity_Futures_Trading_Commission)

Now I don't know about you, but to me, this seems as a huge conflict of interests. And as far as I was able to find, so does to their own [Code of Conduct and Supplemental Ethics Regulations](https://www.governmentattic.org/23docs/CFTCcodeOfConduct_2016.pdf).

 

[Excerpt from the Code of Conduct](https://preview.redd.it/1z26tyamnmq61.png?width=1237&format=png&auto=webp&s=a90657364b15e86e48dc2a79516bf34b336d407d)

Which points directly to a [law about this](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/207),

&#x200B;

[18 U.S. Code § 207 - Restrictions on former officers, employees, and elected officials of the executive and legislative branches](https://preview.redd.it/alxyqs5momq61.png?width=1216&format=png&auto=webp&s=181871e38c8665facf73915eca9020f13c2cd7ff)

Since the point of CFTC is to oversee and regulate the very part of market that Citadel is also part of, I would imagine, that there could be instances when these two parties meet. And quick search showed, they do. For example in September, but that's just to prove a point. 

&#x200B;

[External meeting register of CFTC](https://preview.redd.it/7tkjzpnspmq61.png?width=1113&format=png&auto=webp&s=b8a04c21aedf618d793c664977fc0be5432f6aa2)

I truly am just an ape, but I would imagine, that matters of these meetings are advised by a group of lawyers prior to them (maybe even during in some instances). 

And since Tarbert is becoming the Chief of lawyers at Citadel Securities, they will all answer to him and he will lead them. That seems like a clear conflict of interest and, if I am getting it correctly, brakes the rule that prohibits this for 1-2 years after the termination and should be punishable.

Am I getting this right? Is it really enough for him to distance himself by only one level, so for example by not going to the meetings or to not directly communicate with any employee of his formal employer?

I honestly what to grasp this topic better, I'm not drawing any conclusions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Hi.. Mr Tarbert? Great I'm Janet, I've been assigned as your buddy today. Welcome to Citadel Securitieees!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is an egregious violation of the code.

Seems very likely that Shitadel has assessed the price/ risk of violating US code 207 (see the line “punishable as provided in section 216 of this title”) and determined the cost of this punishment (section 216) outweighs the benefits that will accrue to them from breaking the law.

Can you post section 216?

My pay once got transferred to the wrong person by my work and it took a month to sort it out even when the other person was willing to give it back.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to buy more $GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Would have been better if they’d have left it in you account. 😏
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congrats and fuck you on the margin bonus.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Be sure to turn on the “no backsies” setting so they can’t take the money back so frivolously.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I mean... it's their fuck up.. buy GME?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It was just a test run for the National Hedge Short Funds Broadcasting System. The NHSFBS goes into effect sometime this month. They just have to cover a lot of synthetic issues within system first.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citibank wires 500 million to Revlon by accident and didn't get it back. Was suppose to be 8 million in interest payments to the company's lenders (they acted as the loan agent ) and a judge said they get to keep it because they proved the debt although the payment was very early. I would have yolod on gme so fast lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get tricked
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets, 5M of Jan uber puts @20 ftw
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|scream)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,When Citi did this to some hedge funds (except it was 180 times bigger) the hedgies got to keep it. You should call Fidelity and demand that cash
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They are practicing.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope that don’t show up on your tax statement if they aren’t gonna let you spend it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have a Joe DiMaggio card you can have for a song
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,THIS IS THE WAY APES
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,shoulda been wating to wire it to another account where u could have withdrawn it in cash and fled to Venezuela to avoid capture and show them gme stuff
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,damn...all that GME i could hold with that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,”I used to be a millionaire you know...”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You're welcome. Now dump all of that into GME FDs.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Was expecting this to be $4,206,900 ..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Might wanna look into that. Some states, such as Texas, have laws where if money is wired to your account you do not have to give it back cause it is considered a “gift.” In this scenario, they took it back. So potential law suit. I’d contact a lawyer at the very least or ask around. Its 49 mill. 

Texas Case: https://news.yahoo.com/amphtml/judge-rules-revlon-lenders-keep-205750916.html

If you get rich don’t forget about me. I’d really like a Dodge Challenger hellcat out of that 49 mill and possibly my tuition paid for. Fellow ape :D."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you hold GME or AMC they were working out how much you gonna earn.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro I'd be gone
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Didn’t the rest of you get 5 mil put in your margin account? 😬🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well 🦫

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My recommendation is to use it to buy GME. I'm not a cat. Or financial advisor.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just a practice run. Testing for later
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can he keep it?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Reporting this from the Cayman island
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait for the IRS to investigate you now lol. Must have been a rush if you caught it when it was still just the positive.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thats the ultimate uno reverse card.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably just a wire from Melvin sending you your tendies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why not spend all on gme
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have you been asked to buy target gift cards to return it?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Put it all into GME. Ape want bananas 🍌 this isn’t financial advice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is to show you when the squeeze squeezed that’s how much you will have
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What would happen if you yolo'd that before they noticed?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you accidentally wire it to your bank account?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Do they want it back?

But what if you just used VPNs and secrecy and withdrew it.  Then contact fidelity after to be mister honest , terrified of repercussion “get this out my account!”

They’re insured ur fine"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe its an omen 🤞🤞🤞🤞
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Invest it in GME quick

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe they got confused and mixed up $4.9mil with your 5 GM E shares. Easy and honest mistake to make.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The IRS has entered the chat*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash out now!!!!!!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Enjoy doing your taxes next year lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Next year the IRS comes asking where those 4.9 Million from your brokerage account went 😅

HHHMMMMM!!!!???????"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Genuinely curious with what happens in a case like this. Do they just take the money back?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Foreshadowing!?!?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A friend once had HR add some serious zeroes to her paycheck. She received $285k... after taxes.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I had an extra thousand in mine this morning
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I had a similar situation happen with $67k but when I called my credit union there was literally no transaction history with that dollar amount attached to my account. Something didn't add up when it happened and it still doesn't add up now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just dump it in GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s a lot of GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Borrow"" like the hedgies before they take it back and put it in AMC"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've immediately dumped it into another account
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They're messing everything up! I sent all my funds to the Nigerian Princess that took a liking of me over the internet but her inheritance funds she wired are not showing on my account yet!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Those are rookie numbers.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,what happens if you would of transfered it to your bank ?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have YOLO'd it straight to GME or AMC for the craic when you noticed first.  How did you not do it!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Send it to me and I will send it to Fidelity
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wouldve transferred the money and faked my death lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have withdrawn it. I worked for a company once who did something similar. They guy pulled the funds before they caught it and never paid it back. The company had to eat it and prevented him from opening any new accounts or products...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And I accidentally withdrew it once the funds cleared 😆
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"truly fucked up... they should have added a note ""happy april fool's day"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cash out and buy as much stuff as you can!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ouch... If I saw that, I'd... well I don't know what I'd  do."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What happens if you see this and then immediately withdraw funds, would they be out of money or somehow they could take it back?

&#x200B;

Cause I think I see a loophole in how you could technically keep the money if you caught it quickly."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Keep an eye that they don’t fuck you over come tax time.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Whythem
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Those paper handed bitches
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The tax man is lubing up already

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The price for 1 share...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So close...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you put it all on GME???
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why didn't you put it all on GME?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would go ahead and request something in writing from them about what happened just in case it was flagged or gets reported to the IRS.....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If they did it on accident you probably have legal precedent to keep it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The photoshop is strong in this one
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Annnnnnnd ::clicks:: withdraw..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should have bought FDs expiring on Thursday

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Years ago I started a new job and someone in payroll made a small mistake. I was paid my entire first year salary of $50k in my first check. Thought about burning out of the country. Haha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just remember, diamond hands 💎🙌💎🙌 hold on to it...🤣"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be honest, you might be able to get some of that back lol. I read an article about like Wells Fargo or some other large bank having accidentally sent money to the wrong account and they were fighting with the other bank to give it back and there was some rule that said they didn’t necessarily have to give it back lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you had made Fidelity your bank, you could have called them and disputed the transaction and demanded a charge back.

Since you didn't, that makes you king retard.


# I submit my vote to make this retard a mod."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can get back to you if you send me the money for the taxes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,in iTunes gift cards..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey its me, your brother"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buy $5 mil in GME then when it moons you can pay it back no prob
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That 4.8 would have been gone so fast!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would like to know this too
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""oh god... hurry take that money back before he buys FDs"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""... but f'reals we gonna need that 1.3 mil whenever."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"this actually happens a lot with military pay. you get over/underpaid very often, and if you’re significantly overpaid the process can take a long time to get it back. a lot of people invest the extra money and take the gains off the top before they return it"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s how they would handle that
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That sounds like felony fraud lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I keep losing money, why didn't I ever think to just invest in stocks going up"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What happens when that thing you invest in drops 20% suddenly?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sure a similar situation happened where chase(???) accidentally put money in someones account and the person made profit off of it and Chase TOOK both the profit and the mistake
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao if it was that easy we’d all be rich
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think it's bigly illegal to use funds that are knowingly not yours even if it's their fuckup..
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Would you keep the losses though?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They would absolutely not let you keep the gains on money that was never supposed to be in the account.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he was quick enough before they pulled all their cash back, he should have thrown it into 0Day GME 1000calls, let them sweat a little for their mistake and maybe they would settle down on holding the stock down and let it go up to recover their money back!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If ts electric. They can get the money back
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I worked for a pizza joint in high school the manager sent me to the bank to get 100 singles. I gave the cashier the 100 dollars and she gave me a stack of singles with rubber bands around it as I walked out the door I flipped through it was 50 singles and 50 100 dollar bills I walked back in without a thought about taking the money and gave it back.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> Its a write off if the bank fucked up

[That’s not how this works.](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=XEL65gywwHQ)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Except the bank will press charges and sue for the money back.

Whether they are able to recover it or not is another story."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What would be the best way to do that? What kind of consequences were there? Asking for a friend
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"When I wrote a wire to buy my house recently everyone told me ""you better quadruple check that shit, b because once you hit send that money is gone, doesn't matter if you made a mistake"". 

It's good to know that rule only applies to my life savings, and not faceless corps built on exploiting the system."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ballin!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A couple of weeks and you didnt take it out of your account? You definitely are not a paper hand bitch! I would have taken some of the money out.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not with that attitude. 🥳
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How long was the money in your account before they took it back?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Id hold off on your Forbes interview.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What would've happened if you yolo'd it and made a quick return before they reversed the deposit? Wonder if you would be allowed to keep the gains?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,>inspect element
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've got a balance letter while it was in there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I took a screenshot of your screenshot. That’s the closest I’ll be.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s honestly quite a bit concerning how an error like that could happen. Can’t imagine being the guy who deposited 4.9M and it never showed up in his account lol.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The same as writing a fake check worth 4.9m and cash it then spend it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,From experience. They would not allow it to happen. Very likely if you were to wire it out or send through EFT it would get caught before it leaves if you are trying to do large dollar amounts of it. If you send out a few thousand before they caught the mistake you would be required to pay it back 100%.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very. Which is why you run like hell after.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m sure they’d make it a crime. Now if they accidentally withdrew that money from your account, well....that’s just an innocent mistake!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not illegal in most countries, but you will have to return it unless you have a reasonable (in a legal sense) belief that it's meant to go to you. 

I think it was Chase that fatfingered a loan repayment of like 800m making the news a few months ago. It's still being fought over, but so far, they got to keep the money because it was exactly the correct amount, and they were expecting a payment on the loan around that date... Just not that the full amount would be paid off like 30 years early."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"In general you're expected to return it if they ask for it back. Taking it isnt illegal, but if you spend it you're still obligated to pay it back. 

That said theres a funny story from like the past year where Citi accidentally paid $500MM of one of its clients loans off (Citi was acting as an intermediary between this company and the creditors) and when they asked for the money back many of the firms refused, so Citi sued and the court actually ruled that they were not obligated to give the money back."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not illegal as we just saw with Citi Bank. You'll likely just have to go to court for the rest of your life.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very illegal
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagine if removing money from a customer's account without permission was illegal (clawbacks).  I'd think that mistakes like this would probably stop.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Usually.


There was a link posted somewhere in here about a transfer Citi erroneously did to creditors/bondholders but accidentally paid the full balance instead of a usual interest payment. Some of the banks returned the money to Citi but some didn't. When Citi sued, it was ruled that if you pay back a debt early by accident then that's just too bad, and the other banks got to keep the money.


So basically if someone owes you money in installments, but there exists the option to pay in full early, and they happen to pay in full early by mistake, you are entitled to keep the payment.


/e


But you are right. One company I worked for accidentally ran payroll twice and double direct deposited some people's pay check and immediately sent out emails saying not to touch the money, it's a mistake, they're gonna reverse it, etc.


I didn't get the double pay so I didn't have any chance to pull a fast one. But several of the employees were minimum wage/paycheck to paycheck types and they would probably be better off taking the double pay and leaving. Good luck getting it back."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Don't know and honestly don't care. I very much doubt they took this all the way to the judge and got him sentenced. They might've slapped a lien on his assets/income (for all the good that'll \[not\] do) but that'd be about all.

He insisted he wanted to just pay the money back but they weren't hearing it. Dude's paycheck got **zeroed out for 2 freaking months**.

That kind of shit is why I always check my LES."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Maybe in Canada, your paystubs make sense. I've never worked at a job where people fully understood theirs."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"On one hand you're not overtly wrong. US military leadership makes a point to shunt responsibility onto the individual for ensuring their pay is accurate. But our paystubs (LES) are absolute ass to try to read and when they get your pay right 9/10 it becomes easy to be complacent and forget to check until one day your pay is zeroed out due to a clerical error.

I always check mine and encourage my troops to do the same. But at the same time I can sympathize with people who put it on the backburner. Maybe if the LES wasn't written like it was trying to summon Lucifer's accountant I'd be less sympathetic about it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's mostly on DFAS being total shit from what I've been told. But no manner of bitching will fix it because some Congressman's uncle is making a killing being the single point of failure for the entire DoD getting paid correctly.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Or *dumbass*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"youre a good man, thats priceless my friend"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They'd probably just slap you hard af with a **100k!! (OMG SO MUCH!)** fine
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,💯
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It really depends on your carrer/life situation.  For some it's probably not worth it, but for many it damn sure is."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,...you think they’d let you keep it?...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What? You also said you called to let them know. Something's fishy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wrong. Not every bank requires multiple approvals, and certainly not brokerages."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They paid back their loan early. On accident.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That thought crossed my mind as well. If they can just take money out without notice like that, I don’t have much confidence with them handling my business. If I was them, I would eat the mistake instead of being labeled incompetent banker who can’t count. And receipt doesn’t mean anything to them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was a teller for years. You have to balance your drawer several times throughout your shift. They caught the error. The teller didn't steal anything. There are cameras all over and they will check footage if there's a big offage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wire transfer take a few days to clear, they would’ve cancelled it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,just changed mine to Hookers and Blow in hopes of getting a letter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Whenever my friends and siblings transfer money between myself and them, we would always put stupid descriptions like drugs or hookers etc and then a year or two ago the biggest bank in australia said they’re not going to allow that fun shit anymore. But it turns out it was for a pretty sad reason - a ridiculous number of women were being contacted by their abusive exes via transfers of like 1c into the woman’s account from the man’s and the man would put abusive shit in the description. So terrible. But still I do miss our stupid transcription descriptions hahah but I guess it was a good time for us to stop, since one of us wants to buy a home soon and the current regulations have banks going through ALLLL hour bank statements when you go for a mortgage hahah"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, you’re saying I’m gonna have $25m soon?!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would cum in to my nan's ear for 25 mil a share
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"THIS IS THE WAY, LOL"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"25million? There’s no cap, I expect it to be at atleast 100 trillion, it’s just those darn hedge funds right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ay now all apes get a share of the free tendies.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ive got some blockbuster stock ill trade you thats sure to be nothing BUT 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That money is from a Nigerian prince, just return 50,000 of it and you can keep the rest for your troubles."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fabio can buy a lot more dirt bikes with that coin
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.schwab.com/resource-center/insights/content/giving-while-living-do-you-understand-gift-tax

That depends on if Fidelity has used their lifetime gift tax exemption of ~11M yet. Though I am not a lawyer or confident that corporations qualify."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wendy's okay?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How bou dat?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be more about advertising/marketing. Getting the money back would be part of some kind of torture before death. Not saying you can find that cheap.

But being able to spread stories about the guy that stole from them, ran away to a country where the law couldn't touch them. Then tragically got into a car accident. And the car had so many knives."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The defense is flawless sir, he bought a video store with the money"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought citadel was paying me advance for my 10 GME shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,More like I thought publishers clearing house I entered in the 90s finally came through
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re honor, I honestly thought GameStop had finally squoze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Future textbooks coin it as ""The Reddit Defense"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hmm it’s a international banking thing, not exclusively American. The global banking institutions are interconnected through a system called the SWIFT network and it facilitates the transfer of money on an international scale in a (what used to be incredibly) quick time. The advantage, other than speed and international access, are that it guarantees the validity of the transfer and so funds are typically available same day, typically within a couple hours. This is especially desirable for large sums of money that would typically need a couple days to verify."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, this is some of the worst fucking advice I’ve ever seen on this board.

Imagine believing you’re going to get away with being sent paystubs every week, your pay comes out wrong, and then you try to run off with it. First thing your boss asks if you noticed, and unless you’re some ignoramus, it’s really fucking OBVIOUS to tell who’s lieing and who’s not.

Btw, trying to steal an extra weeks worth of pay is so definitely not fucking worth getting fired and losing out on a years worth of pay.

Holy fucking shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol everyone who tried to pull this lost and lost big.  Excited to see your story if you ever get the chance.  “I’m suing the shit out of them since it’s mine” hahahahaha don’t forget the terms and services that you didn’t read but agreed to...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No they went after him. The bank will press charges and there will be a warrant issued. The fraud investigators that I know in my company are former FBI and they don't fuck around.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'd buy a car.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,3x short Prairie Oyster futures
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is now the time to get into krugerrand futures??
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,4-5 months and in the meantime they send you to Syria.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> **zeroed out for 2 freaking months**. 

So he got a 2 month interest free advance

  
When it happened to me I was able to break it down over 4 months which was great"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol.   Canada doesn’t have an army.   Wtf are you even on about?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Our pay stubs are emailed out to our civilian email addresses if we opt into it. They made them super easy to read and comprehend for the retarded army people. But our claims (meal reimbursement and shit) are directly deposited into our accounts without a word on the pay statement so we just gotta keep track of them to ensure we get those paid. I thought the most technologically advanced army in the world would have figured this out by now. I guess we are both full of retards
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah, someone who isn't familiar with DoD Finance.

Most young servicemembers being notoriously bad with money (let's be real, they're high school students 80% of the time) does not forgive the number of times I've seen or heard of people getting pay docked because of an overpayment. Or worse yet, not getting paid at all because some buffoon forgot to update something in the system.

From what I've heard from comptrollers the problem mostly comes at the DFAS level and the usage of seriously arcane, ancient systems that are buggy as hell and nightmarish to navigate."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That is why you multi- wire- to Alabama- to Bermuda - to Cuba then Portugal!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn! Always obstructions of Justice!

Solutions? I mean, just in case."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys really need to get the banks to sort their shit out and match the 2 hour transfer windows between banks, and instant transfers in banks that we have on this side of the pond. It's kind of ridiculous at this stage."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That might work for you, you could wire half of it to Argentina, while they're dealing with the diplomatic faux-pas. You're off-shore"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No extradition
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With enough money and lawyer, TOS can be disputed too"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TOS can easily be disputed, as it's commonly understood that no one reads them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Different situation. One company wrote a loan, the other company accidentally paid it ahead of time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was a case where the people who were wired the money were owed money by the sender's client, and it was ruled that it's reasonable for them to keep and use the money because they were already expecting the transfer. It just turns out the sender sent it before they collected it from the client who owed it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because, frankly, these 90 thousand dollars don't belong to me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you, I try."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They'd have to if I didnt give it back lol. Tell them I instantly bet it on blackjack and lost
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I called to make sure I was reading it right.   But in talking with the rep, I told him, I hadn’t been expecting the money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They told them but still didn’t know when they would take out the money.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess I’ll just take my six years of professional brokerage experience and go fuck off then. And considering I worked at Fidelity and can tell you what their policy is first hand, I’ll go fuck off even further."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They paid back someone else’s loan they had agreed to pay back for them, but the end result is the same"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Last time I made a large cash deposit they counted twice and bundled the cash with a copy of the receipt. I see now that it was so a second teller or manager could verify it. Hindsight I guess.

Next time just show up in person and make a big scene so everyone can hear how the bank made a big mistake and took $1000 of your cash deposit. How much is bad business worth? ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thinking_face_hmm)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's a pretty big bank and only 5 million.  I think they just write it off, fire someone, and move on."

And the worst advice on this sub was MU 90C three years ago."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That aus 4m loan she spent it all was a chinese uni student. Never needed to pay it back lol

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for answering my question, which for some reason has been downvoted haha."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just rob a bank in the first place?

Might be easier ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think a wire transfer of 5 mil from a personal account with no foreign transactions to any bank out of country is going to be flagged by the bank, and by the feds."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The government would convert it to Argentinian pesos at an irreal rate, basically you would lose 50% of your value."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You get fucked if you bring dollars here tho
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, what money?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh I see
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not to mention just the general federal reporting requirements of any transfer over $10,000 too."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why are you taking this personally? I am just telling you that I moved 7 figures left and right, and I don’t have to go through any approval process besides pressing a few buttons. Perhaps the first time only they called me to make sure everything was okay, after which they just increase your transfer thresholds. Not every brokerage is that strict, especially above a certain net worth."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just because the money is deposited in your bank account, it doesn’t mean it’s completed. It can easily be cancelled still and the money would leave your account."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they loan you an amount equal to the wire transfer that is then paid off a few days later when the transfer clears."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And they paid through the ass for great lawyers. 

You have to keep in mind how serious stealing $5 million from a top US bank is. 

You're not getting time served with a public defender. That $5 million is going to take a large hit, especially because that firm is going to have little recourse if you stiff them because you won't have any assets left after federal prosecutors get in."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Charged means nothing. Did he get convicted ?  
  
That's how all these court cases start homie. The bank presses charges against the person. You don't go to court for no reason."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Argentina Is a nice country to live and enjoy if you have dollars but transferring dollars there, oh boy, I'd rather burn it gambling in Vegas. At least I'd a great time while I lose it all. Giving money to the argentinian government for it to blow, I can do it better myself."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,One could potentially make the argument that that's some *deep fucking* value
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Money?

Me ape"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In all seriousness I'd doubt you could get it out of the bank before they caught that little typo
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I saw earlier from your post history that you bought like 2.5 million worth of GME not too long ago. I’m assuming you’re pretty high net worth, and you’ve established a relationship with your broker where you can regularly make those transactions. It works very differently for the rest of us. If someone who’s never had more than $30k in their account suddenly has millions and wants to wire it out, they can’t click buttons. They have to call. They have to get approval. I took the liberty of mocking up a bank transfer for you online in a fidelity account so you can see for yourself how it works for the little guy.

I’m not taking it personally, I was just making a joke about me apparently being “wrong” lol.  https://i.imgur.com/VXdEBMN.jpg"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Or 9 million
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right. They have to get that shit Back In Blood!  Definitely cashing out. I'll make small payments on it for the rest of my life if I have to😎
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I guess they took a short interest in you. 



😏😏😏"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I would yolo it into GME then keep the profit. They won’t be able to take legal action fast enough by the time they do they would have payed back the exact amount and keep a bunch of profit... or loss.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My brother left behind this huge box of Magic cards and forgot about them.  About 3 years ago I remembered it was still there after almost 20 years.  I asked if I could take them and he was like sure I thought they were gone already.  I ended up going through and selling them all online for almost 15K.  Some of the shit in there was super ultra rare and people went insane over it.  When I told my brother he almost cried so I hooked him up.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And the high $ amount is going to cause red flags and a bank will investigate to the full extent.

MU was ~$40 at the time and after looking at their statements looked like a no brainer buy, massive international business with loads of cash and at the time they were in the talks about partnering with intel for some project, no sure how that ever turned out since I was poor at the time and had no investment but damn it's more than doubled since I did that project. Maybe I should get around to doing more actual DD"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,MR. Robot hang in there poster!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AWESOME VIDEO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't believe the diversity of these degenarates that are holding gme. It starts from simpletons like myself to successful youtubers that i watch on casual evenings. It's so fucking wild
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The meme production levels are going **🚀🚀🚀**
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,thought this was cooking with babish for a second
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"LOL, The tendie tho"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,why isn't a banana part of this COCKtail ?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Excellent recipe, although I added an additional tendie"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1000 comment
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,WE LIKE THE DRINK
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Upvote for the chicken tendie
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Cringe nerd trying to fake his way
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Banana, Scotch, and grain alcohol? I'm more impressed you drank it with a straight face than with your diamond hands."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought he was just going to pee into it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bitch, drink the scotch right from the bottle..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s simple. Take all the money you have and divide it by 1.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LOL. bro full yolos erwhere
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So... $700? Cause I just got my stimulus 😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what is a life
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's what you get when you open a margin account or credit card. Really it's up to you! So many ways to make money!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah what does half mean?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"collective life savings. Im sure half of us have yolo'd entire life savings, while the rest of us are paper"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We already lost the other half
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What did he mean by ""on GME calls""?  I was just buying shares and holding?  Is my smooth brain causing me to do this wrong?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think he means, ""half their college tuition loans"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why was that apartment empty? Did he break in there to make that cocktail?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What's a life, or a saving? I'm not familiar with either"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that's what left after buying at 380
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good fucking question.  The most money I’ve got was when my dad died, that went fast (wish I knew about GME stock back then -_-) now if I die my family gets a milli....I’d like to get some more tendies in between those two events!!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Half? Those are rookie numbers
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bet his wife ain't whoring around with a boyfriend.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,💎🙌🏼
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe this drink will make his liver itch less.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,“Did you say he put a chicken nugget as a garnish”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We should hire some apes to go through their boomer newsletters. 🦍🗞
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That would be a sweet fucking gig tho. Read some good DD, invest a shit ton of your money into GME when u get home. Troll some accounts, spread fud, and read hilarious content all day"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hahahaha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So get paid to do what I’m already doing? Sign me the fuck up daddy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It’s similar to the Air Force briefing generals on naurato running for area 51
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They get paid more than you and have way bigger career upside
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Can you imagine thinking Smokey mountain is actual rocket fuel? Lololol..... 


BOYYYY you come down here in my mountains and taste my mason jar of shine. It might enlighten ya with just one sip and no need for a fancy pants diamond hand mixer"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I want to get paid 6 figures just to read wsb. Then I'd actually have time to sleep
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Someone hire George Russel to make a PowerPoint about the GME memes.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sir .... They added salt. Alot of salt. It was an enormous amount of salt sir. My lips are chapped sir!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gross, but I would expect anything less from a pack of 🦍. 💎💎💎🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol boomers, we should make our own stonk report as a collective, collaborative body. This page is basically a newspaper or a compilation of articles about stonks and apetions."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol I bet it is you doing this report.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I heard that Morgan Stanley sacrifices babies at the end of each quarter
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"funny thing, they actually don’t care about you (for better or worse)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I dated that guy he was and still is a retarded coke loving vodka drinker...yeah FU Morgan Stanley
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Glad you apes liked it, had fun making it"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A brain as smooth as your cocktail
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely beautiful line.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not fucking leaving.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This line fucked me up lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lemme get a HODL & Tendy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""With a squeeze of Citron""

All credit for this goes to /u/69PutsOnYourPuts69"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,MONKE
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Monke Shoulder LMAO. That got me.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I always have a bottle on hand.  It’s smooth, balanced, and buttery."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So you like the scotch?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is my new brand, but you should absolutely try sheep dip or pigs nose if you can find them. I can't find them anymore so I now am all on board the monkey ~~train~~ 🚀"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Mmm, monke"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,First whiskey I ever tried. I just can’t taste anything other than alcohol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh please, no."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Short squeeze,

And he said ""HOLD THE LIME""

as if that wasn't fucking genius!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He literally could have said ""next take the lime and give it a *short squeeze*"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Should've squeezed a citron!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Has the lemon squoze? 

No."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Citron.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not very long though...just a short squeeze will do.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wasn't that the whole point? The squeeze comes later?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wait...the lemon has not been sqooze???
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And don't you fucking dare stop holding that ice
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’ll but bacon in a drink, why not tendies.

Also, why the hell is my phone autocorrecting tendies to trendies? I’m just not typing it enough."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did I stutter?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I came here for the Binging with Babish reference and was sorely disappointed until now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Beautiful.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,""" Binge""?  
You spelled required wrong."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Appreciate you sourcing me!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think that's the first time I've heard him talk.

What an occasion for that to happen."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the drink too!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Probably in his wife's boyfriend's asshole.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,To give it that little kombucha feel!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,it would probably taste pretty good tbh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,“Banana liqueur”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah bro, it’s funny for the memes but god damn. Whiskey, banana liqueur, and high test? With a fucking chicken tender floating in it? 

Yikes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Can't hodl your liquor?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m sure more than a few apes will throw some parties on the moon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imagining him serving me *his* cocktail
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unless this is an April Fools joke for the video, personally I don't like how he blatantly steals like 90% of his format from Babish, even how he implements jokes and speaks just screams someone copying Babish. Video quality is good, just wish he felt confident enough in his work to express his own personality rather than trying to be the Babish of bartending.

Maybe its *only* in this video he does this so this opinion is purely formed off of what I see here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,We need more flair!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wolf of wallstreet chant in the movie

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Definitely not a Babish impersonator.  This guy has been making cocktail videos on reddit for quite a while.  Check out /u/cocktailchem
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shame on you. Dude's been doing his thing before Babish posted his first video.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thread was actually decent for a change.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a great blended scotch for the price. I usually can find it for around $30 or less and for that price it's one the best scotches I've had. It's pretty much the go-to scotch for mixing into a cocktail. Do it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He came before Babish though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats not babish, hes been around longer thn babish."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, ive never saved a life..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What is... ""savings""?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys have lives?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, what are those? Please explain."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No it spent all on GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys have a life????
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Half-life Savings. I’m still saving up for a computer fast enough to run the original version of Half-life. I’m hoping for a Pentium 2 with 64Mb RAM. Maybe someday I’ll get a new VHS too.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha I live out of a checking account because what fucking interest am I gonna get on $3000?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have $3.50
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's an acronym for your broker account. Don't worry about it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not anymore
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What's a life savings? I did something wrong somewhere
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,half-life savings.  it shrinks by 50% every year.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Only 🌈🐻 stop at half.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is a half?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My smooth brain could not roll onto this idea. You must have a wrinkle. Thank you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By the very definition, to YOLO half is anathema"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anything will taste better than piss. I’ll have one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I concur I will drink that drink and second eat the tendies....to the 🌙🚀🦍🍌💎 down my glizzy hole....
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Good job, ape 🦍!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Love your videos. Was reading the title like, I wish this was cocktail chemistry instead of some degenerate ape. Little did I know...."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hijacking top comments. Shoutout the creator of this video - u/CocktailChem. His YouTube channel is Cocktail Chemistry. 

I like his Coc... *ahem* this stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hey Morgan Stanley, you have 2 first names."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It'll be an analytics dept. Not the IT dept.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,SUCK MY DICK MORGAN COCKLEY MADA FAKAS. HOLDING TILL THE VERY END CAUSE I LIKE IT
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,'Correction.. that was a tendie sir'
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At this point it's all hemorrhoid treatment ads and buy gold.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read WSB for free and I don't sleep. I just stare hitting ""refresh"" on my AMC like a monkey with Tourette's."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Just impressed with the hodl in the other hand the entire time.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That TF creme de banane is the motherfucking SHIT. I just never know how to actually mix with it because everything I put it in instantly tastes like banana bread. Then I end up craving it so I pour a glass of the stuff on the rocks and go into a diabetic coma.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oi loved your fernet episode! Keep up the good work skipper!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been following your YouTube for a long time, so this was very cool"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I like the content
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,As someone else pointed out you missed a squeeze the citron joke. I love your content and this had me cracking up.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Squeezed, not sturred"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Highly recommend Oban 14
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Check out Stranahan’s Colorado Whiskey. It’s an American Single Malt so not a traditional scotch as it’s obviously not made in Scotland lol, but it’s one of my all time favorites whiskeys. And only about 60-70$ a bottle depending on where you find it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My ape... Monkey Shoulder is actually decent. I had to give up some of my scotch to buy more stocks. Budgeting is important so here is a handy guide:

Glenmorangie 10 year for cheap day drinking.  
The Glenlivet 12 year for good day drinking.  
The Balvenie Doublewood 12 year for weekends.  
OH... and Dewer's for my wife's boyfriend (if he ran out of glue to sniff).  
Half your life savings... understood. But skimping on scotch budget? THATS HARDCORE!

PS... went and got a glass of  Glenlivet 14 year  *Cognac*  finish just to type this.

\*HODL and not to be confused with financial or marital advice. Covid needs to end soon, my liquor bill is outta control."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you like the glen 12 you should really try the 14. One of the best scotches for the money you can get. Not as smooth as the 12, but a lot more flavor. I've never been a big fan of anything Macallan myself, always seemed overpriced for what it is (just decent scotch). Also want to second that guy's Stranahan shoutout. Lastly, try some grangestone, it's blended not single malt, but smooth AF for the price (I had the 18 year)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If your favorite part of camping is when the wind changes direction and blows campfire in your face may I suggest Ardbeg?  It's for people who put iodine on their smoked hams!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try some Japanese whiskeys. They are made with the same care, and excellent in their own right. Also Glengoyne."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm not big into whiskey and scotch but my gf is, I got her a Balvenie 30 and it was a whole different drink"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You may intrested to know Monkey Shoulder has Glennfiddich in it, then."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Glenmorangie is always nice too imo
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I highly recommend trying the Famous Grouse scotch. Super cheap and absolutely delicious. One of my all time favorites.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Bowmore 12 year is definetly a good bottle of whiskey, that's not too expensive aswell."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,In Spanish is limon. So the ape is right.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Blended or not, monkey shoulder is fantastic.  An absolute bargain for the price.  I recommend it as an intro scotch pretty often"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are you mod\*?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No prob!  Hope you got some views :)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great content!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And then the mods removed it... seems like an odd move.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Awww... So this is what they mean by holding and diamond hands.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I was grossed out at first then thought meh, bloody mary has bacon in it, why can't scotch have fried chicken."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you spelled perfection wrong. :)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I too, took this seriously

/hold"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao why did we have to witness it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you did some research you could see that they both started producing that style of content around the same time, so I'd disagree that he copied Babish. Additionally, they both have subtle jabs at each other in their videos from time to time and have even collaborated"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well not everyone can be the TipsyBartender, it could be they just have similar personalities or it could be a marketing thing. I have not really watched Babish but I can say that for a bartender Cocktail Chemistry does a good job of explaining what goes into each of his drinks and where and his content really shines in the experimental drinks. This video is quite different from other CC videos I have seen, I think because this is just a meme video. Normally he takes a drink that already exists and shows an Inexpensive (home) version, a Classic (bartender) version, and a Science-y / Experimental version that makes me think of Molecular Gastronomy."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He has a youtube channel. Cocktail Chemistry I think. He does cocktails from shows like archer and simpsons and things. He is great.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Impersonator might be abit strong but I was definitely confused and came to the comments to make sure.

I still don't think he's shown his face so I thought it was odd he did now"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Cant blame him, I immediately thought of Babish as well"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No he hasn't. Dude's very first video is literally 8 days before Babish's parks and Rec video, but Babish had been on YouTube for a while 9 years before him lol

And even then, it wasnt until Babish had made his format popular and been at it for a year before he suddenly switched his format to be like Babish like 16 months after his first videos."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey man that’s not true there was a tendie in there as well
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,moonshine to the moon!!!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You should try Banane du Bresil from Giffard, it's a French liqueur made with Brazilian bananas and it's insanely good....definitely heavy on the banana bread flavor as well!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Needs to be mixed with other strong flavours. Put half a shot of banana liquor and half a shot of creme de cacao in a coffee. It balances nicely and nothing is too overpowering.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oban 14 and the glenfidditch 12 are my go tos, I love you guys"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you're into Oban you should give Clynelish a try....both Oban and Clynelish use much longer fermentation times than most other distilleries, one byproduct of which is the formation of certain acids/esters/bacteria that affect the flavor profile in different ways than in distillates with shorter fermentation times.

Basically if you like the flavor of Oban there's a fair chance you'll enjoy Clynelish as well, and that's backed up down to the molecular level."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I actually did do research after making this comment. This guy started 8 days before Babish but it wasnt until 16 months later that he started producing this style content. Babish was doing it from the get go. (Obviously speaking of Babish ""starting"" as being when he started his cooking videos rather than the other 9 years worth of videos he did beforehand) Watching this guys first 3 videos and then comparing them to the ones he started making post July 2016 he suddenly becomes basically a completely different person with a huge switch up from his first videos, jokes changed, even his way of speaking changed... coincidentally becoming more like Babish.

So honestly, after doing research I am even more convinced that he 100% copied babish because he saw a similiar youtuber starting at the same time as him but with a more popular format."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Wait, I’m confused, /u/cocktailchem shows his face every video, are you talking about babish?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Very very this
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you mean Deveron instead of Devon? There's a whiskey called Dartmoor that comes out of Devon, UK, but as far as Scottish Highland whiskey there is no Devon...there's Deveron, distilled by MacDuff, which is relatively close to the Macallan distillery. 

That being said, when recommending whiskies I personally would shy away from basing a recommendation solely on region. To use your recommendation as an example....while both Macallan and Deveron bottle 12 year single malts, Macallan is aged in Spanish sherry casks/Sherry seasoned American oak (depending which expression of the 12 you get); and Deveron 12 is aged exclusively in ex-Bourbon casks, seeing zero sherry influence. So sure they might be just down the road from each other, but the flavor profile similarities end with the content of the malt.

If you're looking for another Highland single malt with heavy sherry influence reminiscent of Macallan, I would suggest giving Glendronach 12 a try. And if location is important, the Glendronach distillery is actually closer to Macallan than MacDuff is ;)

Edit: phrasing"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,All Macallan is overpriced and tastes like a watered down version of better whisky.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If he's not going to say it and then violently crush it in his hand and throw the whole thing in the glass, I'm not happy"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I respect the dedication to the research, I can see how you would draw that conclusion, and I kinda agree. I still find their style differs slightly but is a very similar format, I enjoy both their content regardless."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude's very first video is literally 8 days before Babish's parks and Rec video.

And even then, it wasnt until Babish had made his format popular and been at it for a year before he suddenly switched his format to be like Babish like 16 months after his first videos.

This guy 100% copied Babish's format after seeing a similiar youtuber getting started at a similiar time but nailing a format that is much more popular."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"His content is defintely enjoyable, and there is obviously space for the both of them since they focus on two different things. My original critique is still the one I have now, the guys has charisma, a good show idea, and quality videos.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's the lick!

I just cant get the rest of the stuff without Amazon.

But it looks like a legit drink.

Maybe add a spritz of bannana peel as the garnish!

Kinda like a modern old fashioned.

But yea.. 

The diamond hands cocktail is born."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I cannot specify on the specific flavor he has [there are so many flavors](https://olesmoky.com/collections/moonshine) but I can guarantee it’s at least ole smoky. Their Apple pie moonshine mixed with a cider is quite dangerous though.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly you can use any white whiskey there - even vodka would work in a pinch. It's basically just to cut the scotch flavor.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well you were wrong for 9 years. The only thing that makes a cocktail a cocktail vs a mixed drink is having more than 2 ingredients, and even that is just a generalization; a cocktail is still a mixed drink. lol One of THE DUMBEST hills i've ever seen someone die on."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Apple would go nice. Or maple.

Unless it was with a bacon wrapped tendie from Wendy’s."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That'd be one hell of a disease-ridden pp.  But thanks to Dr. Google I know its just fried chicken.  

Still, the drink looks pretty decent."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not selling, soooo.... can anyone spot me some moon drink tickets?? I’ll pay you back after I sell some diamond covered calls."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Age being an indicator of quality/taste is quite a common misconception. Its only really an indicator of price. Older tend to be a bit smoother as the alcohol evaporates off, and they've just taken on more of the barrels characteristics, which you may or may not like depending on the barrel. You might prefer a 12 year from one distillery and an 18 from another.  I can definitely vouch for the Lagavulin 16 though, much better than the 12 in my opinion. Currently on a Glenfarclas 21 which is excellent too."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You’re dying on the hill being wrong here kid, you’re too stupid to understand what a cocktail is and the history behind it, try reading about it sometime"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You want the apeness of the banana liqueur to flex. Monkey is balanced, as blends are, but it's got some minor smoke/peat teeth (unlike lesser blends like Cutty Sark 🤮, Grouse, J&B, etc.), and that shit will readily take over the conversation without some room to stretch. Apes like big, roomy enclosures. We want the banana and the tendie to get a word in edgewise."

2021-04-02 01:02:35,wallstreetbets,"🌋 🐳 W2W REPORT: BLACKROCK-AGEDDON (ICLN/INRG OVERHAUL) 🐰 🐰 check your email inbox if you did the thing. Happy Easter 🐰 🐰 

🚨 **UPDATE: 9 AM PST 4/2** 🚨 

**Just got off the phone with SPDJI, you have to be a LICENSED subscribe**r (key word licensed I certainly am fucking not) to get the file delivery of the pro-forma results today 

**LETS DO THIS TOGETHER:** take a look at the weighting documents and **PLEASE pm or chat me thoughts on inclusion**. We can do this. 

****

**BLACKROCKAGEDDON**

Up too late last week, I found this odd-sounding article titled [Clean Energy ETF May See Big](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/clean-energy-etf-may-see-030000958.html) Overhaul What it meant was so amazing I could not believe it:

>In the latest consultation, SPDJI is now planning to increase [their holdings] minimum to 100, more than tripling the current number of companies featured in the index. This will have a major impact on the exposure of the world’s largest clean energy ETFs, the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF (INRG) and the $7bn iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (ICLN).    

You’re probably thinking “...oh...um...okay. Whatever?”  Well, let me break this Greek down.  **These BlackRock ETFs (INRG and ICLN) track the S&P Clean Energy Index, and because the index hasn’t been updated in 14 years, it only has 30 holdings.  The new rule proposal means that ICLN/INRG (the BlackRock ETFs) will be required to expand from 30 tickers...to 100...right now.**

So, BlackRock currently owns WAY too disproportionate a weight in a small basket of stocks that got pumped during the Biden boom post-election (see: PLUG).  **The BlackRock ETFs currently have a stake of 8% or more of EACH of almost a quarter of the stocks in the Index.**  This rebalance means that on a massive scale and in a specified time frame, *ICLN and INRG are compelled to sell and buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of stake in EACH of the companies already in the index it follows, AND they would PURCHASE initiating stakes in up to 67 other companies.*

https://i.imgur.com/NwenIEq.jpg
-ICLN TOP TEN HOLDINGS. SO. MUCH. PLUG.

[I found a document from SPDJI called a “consultation” that lays out the process.](https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/documents/indexnews/announcements/20210324-1345159/1345159_spglobalcleanenergyconsultationexpscorecountweightingresults3-24-2021.pdf). The next morning I e-mailed SPDJI representatives to confirm, and they replied with key information. 

[My email chat with SPDJI confirming dates and processes](https://i.imgur.com/xMrOMxR.jpg)

So, there it is.  **On the 19th of April, according to the criteria listed, 67 new companies are being added to the S&P Clean Energy Index**—the underlyings of which are to be purchased in large quantities by the BlackRock ETFs.  **As 42 Dugg once rapped...IT GET DEEPER.**

****

**Investment Firm Société Générale released a memo to their clients breaking down the financial implications for current ICLN and INRG holdings—what BlackRock’s gotta buy, and what they gotta sell.** As of this writing they have not answered my calls--apparently the SpotRambo name does not carry much international clout--but [this FT Article had some info on winners and losers currently in the ETF:](https://www.ft.com/content/d43ec8c5-0990-4781-b71f-82cb73a09610)

>This would mean the iShares ETFs (BlackRock) would need to pump more than $400m into each of Vestas Wind Systems, Orsted and NextEra Energy, as well as large sums into Chinese groups such as China Longyuan Power, Xinjiang Goldwind and GCL-Poly Energy.

>This buying spree would be counterbalanced by a wave of disposals. The ETFs would need to sell $405m worth of stock in New Zealand’s Meridian Energy, SocGen estimated, equivalent to 47.6 days of typical turnover.

>For the US-listed American depositary receipts of Brazil’s Companhia Energetica de Minas Gerais, the implied selling of $248m of stock would represent 57.7 per cent of the free-float market capitalisation, SocGen said.

Whoa!  This is a lot of critical information. **Recap:**

**What we know**: On **4/19**, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks.  BlackRock ETFS ICLN and INRG track this index, and will therefore participate in a frenzy of buying and selling on/before/around that date. **On 4/2 the pro-formas are released indicating the weighting and therefore candidates**. 

**What else we know**: New purchases and redistributions--LITERAL pumps and dumps--are a requirement for the BlackRock ETFs.  **According to SocGen, this includes among others: $400m pump for NEE, and extreme dumps for CEG and others.**  Pumps and dumps so large that they represent 40-50 days of the stocks natural trading cycle.

**What we’re pretty damn sure of**: My mans G has been helping me out with some digging.  We are pretty damn sure **PLUG** will go down HARD  once BlackRock divests to spread the wealth.  NEE is a guaranteed add (BLNK not applicable thanks /u/sirajgb) We are also looking at **VST** as an addition to the index based on call flow and fundamentals. 

**What we’ll do**: Next week we’ll give some winners and losers.  I **will keep calling SocGen (sometimes with fake accents to be more convincing), trying to get the report.**  For now, we are looking for clean-energy infrastructure excitement to provide a run on these stocks this week, making it even more juicy to grab some quick shorties. 

****

**ELI5**/**TLDR**: **BlackRock ETFs ICLN and INRG have to buy and sell a bunch of stocks** due to the indexes those ETFs track undergoing a massive overhaul.  It will cause major volatility, produce some big winners, and some even bigger losers. Next week I’ll have more picks.

*Quick note: I actually put this in my newsletter sunday and wasn’t going to put it here, but GM is eating away at my conscience. Consider this my mea culpa.*"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Currently down 90% on my icln calls.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Dalton! I was craving one more your DD’s you son of a bitch!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm mostly following GEVO and it has dumped hard already like many others and recovered about half way. I noticed that it follows ICLN almost exactly (usually by about 2x leverage). I believe it's much more likely this has already happened and the most recent selloff in the sector was precisely because of that. Anything else would be extremely stupid, no? Why would you announce beforehand that you're buying millions of shares? Makes much more sense to activate your media and bot imperium talking shit about all the companies you want to buy in cheap. There was a lot of that at least for GEVO.

Edit: if I'm right then the stocks currently in ICLN shouldn't have recovered and the unknown ones that will be added should have. I did a quick check, plug, enph etc and it seems to kind of work out. Maybe somebody can do this in a more systematic way. Anyways put/call ratio for GEVO eg. Especially for April is basically 80% call, so I'm pretty sure it'll be added.

Ranked by FMC, look at how green they are, and then added? So go long on anything thats big, green and not in the index. 

No wonder my asshole got PLUGged last few weeks"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Went through the US traded tickers that are proposed to be added and looks like BlackRock has enough shares on their own books to be able to meet the weighting requirements for all but the two ADRs on the list.

I dont know if they would just shuffle the shares between their funds or not, but it seems possible that they could mostly take care of ICLN and INRG in house."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"These purchases would likely be in dark pools right?  Might not see as much movement as we would hope for.  But there is some significant open interest in NEE for just outside the money calls for 4/19 and 5/21(over 10,000 for 5/21 at 75.00).  Someone might know something"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> On 4/19, The S&P Clean Energy Index is undergoing a massive overhaul and adding 67 fresh stonks

So does Blackrock have to reshuffle accordingly *before* April 19th, or is that just when the new additions will be official and they'll still have time after that to buy new and unwind old, heavy positions? (basically, wondering if 4/23 or some time between 4/30-5/21 is the better time to yolo some puts)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I believe it is $CIG not $CEG based on their holdings on Ishares site for ICLN.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Great analysis - NEE and VST look like solid plays.  Any updates as of today compared to what was sent out last weekend in your newsletter?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, PUT in the PLUG?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Comment for later; also well done this is the good good DD
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've been bullish on VST since the winter storm dip. Sounds good. Let me look into this. I may increase my position
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got a couple 4/23 $25 PLUG Puts. Last few days have been tough but this makes me feel warm inside
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hey bud I bought 5 calls on NEE for $105 because it was cheap as dirt (or yknow like 1 1/2 videogames). Hopefully we make some tendies!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is BE (Bloom Energy) a target at all? It's grouped up with trash companies like PLUG, but is actually completely different and already profitable. 

I expect BE to 🚀 anyway, but if these ETFs get out of the garbage green tech and into the good ones, it will be even faster."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This means that blackrock probably anticipates GME shorts to crash before this so they can roll the profits from there into this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Positions or ban
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank god I already have put leaps on PLUG anyway.  Dilution as a business model and outdated tech. Add in accounting shenanigans, dubious warrant incentives to buy their product and you got yourself some hot shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Too bad this isn't how institutions unwind their positions 😂 Blackrock isn't entering a market sell for their entire PLUG position into an app with an interface like RH you literal smooth brain
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,My poor $RUN. Explains the insider dumping I guess.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is this why PLUG was red today even after the speech yesterday?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok so what if they buy/sell via block trades?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You do realize what dark pools mean right? If they can't buy it from another big MM they have to buy from the market. GME is a special case since they abuse the OTC for deep ITM calls to cover their short position.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I like their OI too gonna dig around others this weekend

But I cannot imagine that they buy and sell all of a sudden millions of shares, as it will set out a tidal wave in the market. That will cost the index a shitload in value on their asset side and increase the price of their buy list. 

They must want to mitigate that effect themselves, right?"

I compared it to the current ICLN holdings to find what will need to be added to track the reshuffled index. Not all of them are traded on US exchanges, so I limited my research to the US ones since I can't trade the others."

2021-04-02 00:51:49,wallstreetbets,"HIVE as a gambling degenerate Technical Analysis play Note: This is not financial advice. I do not certify any of the material presented is accurate.

I won't go into detail as to what HIVE does, solely to avoid being banned, but do feel free to look it up. In short, this company ""digs for"" ""magic tokens"". However, it should be noted the environment HIVE is in is highly speculative.

At present, HIVE has a P/S of about 35, which appears quite high. However, its competitor RIOT currently has a P/S of about 319 at present levels. As a result, HIVE might have some ability to run upward like its competitor to quite high levels as well. Albeit in the long run, such high P/S levels might prove unsustainable for both stocks.

Technical Analysis of the play: HIVE recently entered into a descending triangle in which the stock just broke out a trendline to leave this pattern on the upside. This suggests HIVE has a ways to run upwards. Currently, the stock is priced at about $5.05. Based on the pattern, one might place a price target at the recent high of around $7.25, just before its spiral into a descending triangle. This would represent a gain in excess of 40%. Values are in Canadian dollars. The stock has also broken above its Ichimoku cloud, which is implicative of a long-run uptrend and might also act as a support (albeit a weaker one).

&#x200B;

[HIVE price + Ichimoku Cloud + Volume \(in bottom\)](https://preview.redd.it/dgj43izmjmq61.png?width=1504&format=png&auto=webp&s=943dcfa7c272e4deb13884afffbf13cd46ee9180)

The stock has also broken above its 5 day (dark blue), 8 day (blue), and 13 day (light blue) moving averages, with the 5 day average crossing above its 8 day moving average. All of the moving averages are also curving upward. This is a positive sign and suggests the stock will continue to move upward. These might also contribute support levels for the stock in the future.

&#x200B;

[Moving Averages and Price](https://preview.redd.it/tlds3swzjmq61.png?width=1744&format=png&auto=webp&s=44766db58be55a41a89b22373f059606a24ba55a)

TLDR; HIVE stock is an interesting, somewhat risky speculative play. The stock recently exited a descending triangle on the upside and this might suggest an opportunity for the stock to fly upward. 

Edit: clarity"

Yet BLOK call options have lower IV than most if not all of them.  If there was a breakout in the next month or two, would call options on BLOK be a cheaper way to amplify gains (or fall to zero)?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He shorted the put option. He sold it for the 51.8. If he wanted to close the position he would have to buy back the put but now the price is only 25.3, so he makes the difference. 

It's a way to either 1) collect premium from bears, or 2) buy the stock in the event the price drops as opposed to setting a limit purchase. 

For example, if price dropped to 160, he would almost certainly get assigned and have to buy 100 shares per contract at the strike price of 185. However, he wouldn't care since he sold the contract for 51.8 it makes his effective purchase price 133.2."

2021-04-02 00:21:32,wallstreetbets,"Sell UWMC to me Disclosure: I already own $10,000 worth of stock and can’t remember why I bought it.

From what I remember, it has a healthy boomer dividend; real estate market on fire, mortgages through the roof, and they have a healthy refi business (but seems disproportionately so in the last Q to the straightforward mortgaging), and stock seems undervalued long term. 

HOWEVER: stock also trading in a downwards turn and only red for a while even on a fucking 400+ SPY day seems there are large positions exiting. Did they flunk their ultimatum deal and is RKT gonna eat their lunch, or is there room for both these bois?

TL:dr read the title you fucking retard.

Obligatory: mods are gay, may the squizzle squazzle the squoze. 🚀🚀"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> real estate market on fire, mortgages through the roof, and they have a healthy refi business 

As someone who works in the mortgage industry, I am staying away from any mortgage lender's stock. 

Since COVID, interest rates have been at an all-time low. That's not an exaggeration. Literally an all-time low. Every company across the industry has seen a record number of refis. Most lenders, including my company, started turning away self-employed people. Not because we couldn't get them qualified, but because we already had to many clients with W2 jobs who we were already working with. Self-employed takes much more man power and time to close. 

We also doubled in size this year. Our backend staff cannot keep up with the amount of business our sales staff is generating. 

Having said all that, it will not continue. Rates are already starting to go up. The mortgage industry will see a big contraction in 2021. While home purchases are going up this spring, there's not nearly enough volume to replace the record number of refis from this past year. 

Full disclosure, I had 1,000 shares of UWMC a few weeks ago. Was hoping to cash in on the Russell listing. Average cost was 8.42. Sold all when the news came out that the Russell listing wasn't happening. Sold at 8.71. 

Good luck!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC taught me noob to never ever buy overnight. buy order at market value at 9 something afterhours, then it mooned in premarket to 12 only to drop to 8 something after a few days and then going to where it is today...

I managed to average down some later, but am still bagholding so hard

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The ultimatum to brokers was a success. Something like 90% sign on rate. They may be the only lender in a position to challenge RKT long term
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No growth thesis. Housing market ripping, very low rates. Those conditions won't exist in a few years. They make a lot now but plenty of companies out to disrupt the whole industry. A stock like that can't get momentum even with the wsb hivemind."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"UWMC is a $3 stock. The majority of their earnings last year (75%) came from refinancing, which was due to the interest rates decreasing. As the interest rates can't go any lower, people can't refinance. When the interest rates will go up most of their revenue is going to come down aswell."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Right there with you. 3470@8.22 shares.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They recommend LMND and like a couple week’s later it dropped 30%. They sent out an email saying it was a great buying opportunity now. How about if you wait til it’s a good buying opportunity before recommending it

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"He's selling calls, not buying.

Sell calls just out of range of where you think the stock could be by expiration.

Ex: if you think shares could be going for $40 maximum by the end of the month, sell 5x $50 calls and collect the premium. If the contacts don't get exercised, you keep the premium. If they do, you keep the premium and they buy your shares at $50 each

This has been an example and is not financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah I paid apprentice's premium that day, would never buy market again"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those shares are in my 401K and unfortunately options are not allowed there. I did sell some cash secured April 16th $7.5 puts in my regular account, so may end up owning 2,200 more shares in two weeks."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That does improve the liquidity compared to ending the year with only 50k in cash... 

I want to point out that they also received a 800m note in November pre-spac that they burned through.

And at 5.5% interest rate doesn't show confidence by the one's who bought the notes. These are ""high yield""

Moody's assigned a credit rating of Ba3 to the notes, which is borderline junk bond.

So although securing further financing is good in the sense it keeps the lights on it doesn't change the fact that uwmc is commonly promoted on here as some type of ""value"" play instead of the high risk stock it really is.

If they improve their financial condition then they will start seeing increased shareholder value... their is significant downside risk though.

Edit to add: and borrowing money to pay a dividend that you cannot afford isn't value creating at all."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Business combo took place Jan 21. 10k is reporting combined financials.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No problem. Be careful with options.

Edit: that is financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You can also buy back the options once the premium has dropped enough to satisfy you. So selling one that expires a month out doesn't tie up those shares for the whole duration

&#x200B;

If you're sitting there week after week waiting for a short squeeze. holy shit you're playing this wrong. Twice a week (Monday and Friday) I daytrade the fuck out of GME. It's not uncommon for me to make a tens of thousands, or today's case, nearly 200k. The stock is stupid volatile and follows the same fucking pattern EVERY SINGLE DAY.

Do you ever wonder if all the people telling you to HODL might \_not\_ be on your side? If you, retail, lock up the float, the big boyz can also manipulate the price UP. Do you seriously think the shorts haven't managed their risk by now? For fuck's sake, you all post the DD here publicly.

My biggest regret is not selling in the January spike; my second biggest was not selling in March. I rectified all that by just dumping it all and hopping in and out constantly.

And before you say ""if he's in I'm in""--you dummy, he already sold a portion of his assets and made millions. I can't wait for a ""maybe"" short squeeze. I want money now. Wasn't that the point of this sub?

Have fun holding and getting worked up over literally nothing.

&#x200B;

EDIT regarding positions, from a comment I made below: 10M is the buying power from margin, so I have a fourth of that (3M). I started with 50k in November and grew it over the months (12 -> 20, 25 -> 40, 70 -> 210) and then started day trading positions from 2k - 10k from there. I usually mess around in the 5,000 share range, and only go 10,000+ if I need to average down. For example, if I bought 5,000 at 180, it falls to 170, I'll buy another 5,000 (putting me at 175), and then jump out at like 177. That's $20k right there. GME is so volatile in the bands and the good news is bullish so I'm usually not worried about the rug being pulled out from under me.

I had bought at 175 I think last week and then just dumped it all today at 195, got back in at 189 and then dumped it again at 194."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"These are the same comments that were directed towards DFV a year ago, now he's worth millions and still hasn't sold. Time. Time will prove who made the right choice. Until then, continue on as you see fit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, they definitely were not (I should know - I commented in some of those threads). Even the degens of WSB thought it was mostly a dumb play and that the company would likely go bankrupt. The share price was also in the single digits at that time. His thesis was that it was severely undervalued in the single digits/under $20, and that the high short interest had a potential for a short squeeze if the price rose above $20. He would have been overjoyed at any of the prices we've seen over the last couple of months. He was not of the delusional mindset that GME would ever be worth thousands of dollars (which is ""too low to sell at"" - right?). Most of the people who wrote the original DD have exited their positions and though some have re-entered, every one of them I've spoken with does not believe another short squeeze is a likelihood. 

And DFV has sold many of his call options. Why not just exercise deep ITM calls for more shares? Because he was taking profits. He has $11M+ in cash that he could buy more shares with whenever he wants, but he hasn't. And I feel bad for him, because he will likely take less profits than he would have if he wasn't turned into this GME Messiah. He is probably concerned about prosecution or that some whacko who invested his rent money will come looking for him for ""derailing the squeeze"" if he sells. Not cool.

DFV has also already banked more profits in cash than 99.99% of GME holders will ever see in their lives. The stock could literally go to $0, the company could go bankrupt tomorrow, and he has still profited over ten million dollars. 

> Time. Time will prove who made the right choice. 

Yes. But also no. What a lot of you guys are missing right now (with the asinine posts talking about ""don't set a date!"") is that the real genius of DFV is he predicted **when** GME would spike. Its a requirement of a successful option play - the difference between an option expiring worthless and printing money. I had $30c 1/15 contracts - if they were 12/15 they would be worthless, but 1/15 they were worth thousands.

The thing about the current overarching thesis (which is, as far as I can gather, ""GME will massively spike in value at some indeterminate future date, absent any defined trigger or catalyst"") is that it is unfalsifiable; you can't disprove it or even argue against it (other than to say that most of the available evidence indicates that is not the case). Maybe it spikes tomorrow, maybe it spike in five years. Maybe it spikes when Cohen is CEO, maybe it spikes 6 months after Cohen is CEO. Maybe it spikes over $300, maybe it spikes if it crashes to $10. The stock could sit at $15 for a year, and you can still claim ""buying more shares at a discount, rocket about to launch!"" and there's nothing anyone could say against it. Because its a guess, not a thesis.

By all means, you all should do whatever you want with your money. Just keep in mind that any type of investing (/gambling) carries risk. Typically, risks and rewards are correlated. If you feel that the potential rewards are significant, all economic theory and market history indicates that the risk is also significant. When I originally invested in GME, I understood that I could lose everything I put into it, and I was OK with that level of risk."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There's a reason the OP deleted his account after posting this. Sorry I didn't read your comment. Take care!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Your comment isn’t showing up for me to respond to, but I saw in the blurb that you said you “weren’t willing to read an essay”. I read that shit in like 3 minutes dude. It is not exactly heavy lifting. But whatever, you do you."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is the perfect encapsulation of the remaining GME bulls. “lalalala I’M NOT LISTENING”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I read it, and it’s all perfectly true. The fact that that dude refused to even read it and educate himself is a perfect reflection of the remaining GME bulls. They don’t want to learn shit about trading, they don’t want to listen to reason, they only want to sit there and believe that they’ll be amazingly rich any day now. I understand the appeal of that thought process, it sure seems easy, but since when does life work like that? Good luck indeed"

I've had a bunch of shoulda couldas about reinvesting and quadrupling that money but that's all with hindsight.  If anything this year has shown me that even if I do throw money at it I will consistently make the wrong choices and am much more likely to lose money than make money.

So far I've taken $1,400 and turned it into $200 by:

• Selling RIOT early (bought a $4.00 call that ended up an $80.00 call but I sold it at $7.50)

• Playing Disney earnings

• buying GME at the first top (also why I sold that RIOT call)

• Buying a lot of puts

If you applied the same logic today and their house is now worth 225k, my wife and I making average (in my area) 55k each would mean it would take us nearly 40 years paying the same percentage of incomes to achieve the same. That's fucked."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The employment gap is still around 9.5-10 million by my estimates for what March 2021 employment would be if Covid never happened.  Keep that in mind before worrying about any doom and gloom from the CNBC/bond/bear crowd over a 900k jobs gain.

Feb 2020: total employment was 158.8 million.

Current employment as of March 2021 is 150.8 million.

We're still down a full 8 million jobs from Feb 2020 based on the household survey and that doesn't include an extra 1.5-2 million jobs from normal population growth over that 13 month span.

A lot of that gap will fill over the next 6 months, but the only way I'd turn bearish over stock pricing is if we see the gap entirely filled by October with 4+% inflation.

That's still an unlikely scenario.  Much more likely is the Feb 2020 gap being filled by December or January and still missing 2-2.5 million jobs due to population growth along with something like 3% inflation for 12 months.

Today's job report was pretty much perfect for supporting asset prices and dovish Fed policy."

I found all this because I'm tits deep in 4/16 MSFT $250 calls. This MVIS company is the primary component and patent supplier for the AR device that MSFT just sold $22B worth of to the U.S. military two days ago, so I picked up their calls as well.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Jobs report was perfect for a Goldilocks scenario.

What you want are good numbers but not ""too good"" to the point where you'd have to worry about economy reaching full employment by end of this year.

Under 1 million for March fits that ""perfect"" scenario where Fed can let economy run hot.

Economy can probably add 7-8 million jobs next 12 months without overheating.

Keep in mind we're still well below Feb/March 2020 in total employment.

Probably won't match Feb/March 2020 for at least a couple more months."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"13 When Jesus heard that tech stocks were up, he took a personal loan and deposited it into Robinhood. Hearing of this, the WSB Autsitcs followed his plays. 

14 When Jesus landed and saw a large crowd, he had compassion on them and told them to Dump their Apple calls

15 As evening approached, the autistics came to him and said, “This is a risky play, and the company is trading at 1000 PE. Send the Boomers to buy XOM/BA/INTC/GE so that they may go live on 3% yield.”

16 Jesus replied, “They do not need to sell. We will give them a YOLO.”

17 “We have here only $500 in our Robinhood accounts and rent is due in 5 days,” they answered.

18 “Bring this $500 here to me,” he said. And he directed the people to sit down on the grass. Taking the $500 and looking up to heaven, he gave thanks to Lord Elon and bought 10 5DTE $900C. Then he gave the play to the retards, and those retards gave to more retards. 

20 They all hit 100 baggers, and the retards then went all in on $1000 0DTE with screams of REEE and MEMES.....and nothing was leftover.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have lost everything, and I'm not sure how to continue. This summer I invested $17,500 (six months salary and my entire life savings) into ornamental gourd futures, hoping to capitalize on this lucrative emerging industry. After watching a video about Vincent Kosuga and his monopoly on onions, I decided I'd try to do something similar with another vegetable. I did some research and found out many agricultural forecasters expected this year's gourd yield would be far smaller than the past, due to deteriorating soil conditions in central Mexico and a warmer-than-average spring. At first, demand soared around Halloween and prices skyrocketed, but the gourd bubble burst on November 12th. Unfortunately, the coronavirus caused a massive drop-off in demand due to fewer families decorating their tables for thanksgiving, and prices plummeted. I had invested early enough that I thought I would still be fine, but then on the morning of December 2nd, a new email in my inbox caused my stomach to turn into a pretzel. The massive gourd shipment from Argentina, scheduled for early March, had arrived. I was planning on selling off my futures right before this, in February, but this ruined everything. To top it off, the gourds in this shipment were absolutely gargantuan, some topping 4 pounds each, causing the price-per-pound to drop like an anchor into the range of 6 cents per pound. I am ruined.

Due to local fluctuations in the tropopause, the jet stream has been shifting rapidly in a counterclockwise vector, causing a rapid disincorporation of the Hadley vortex cells in the lower ionosphere. Because of this, the geostrophic solar wind balance has deteriorated rapidly in the northern hemisphere. In essence, autumnal weather patterns in the western United States will lead to the biggest ornamental gourd yield in recorded history. Investing in gourd agricultural futures could likely produce up to $1600 per day in passive income. However, investing at the apex of the curve would be the most conducive to profit as the arbitrage (particularly 12b-1 fees) will develop at a market share higher than the back-end load. Basically, no one will be able to buy the stock at a higher price than you, and all value invested will be retained. A preliminary market penetration investment of $50,000 would be most efficient in generating this"

> Did you guys see your hair at the levels it was at before? 

You are chasing a fairy tale unless you have the funds for a Matthew McCoughney/Elon Musk style treatment - with plugs and procepia, which can make your penis stop working apparently. 

If you get plugs, you have to continue to get them - your hair doesn't just stop receding, hence the procepia and/or mixodil treatment. If you don't continue treatment your hair will recede beyond the plugs and you will have plug hair islands left behind from the transplants that will look worse than naturally balding.

It's not what you want to hear, but the truth seldom is. Your best bet is to age gracefully or shave it. Acceptance is step one. Become one with Jim Cramer and Kevin O'Leary"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I hope for you and I both that we can find a way out. I've been working on side projects that help temporarily, but I really only have time to do those late at night after work. It's a mixed bag with it though... Those projects make me feel fulfilled, but they usually deeply cut into the amount of sleep I'm able to get, which I feel actually makes things worse after a while.

Point of that being, as a temporary measure, If you have something or know of something you can do for fulfillment, and you're able to do it in a healthy way, go for it. It's certainly pulled me out from some spots I shouldn't linger in too long.

Long term I'm trying to educate myself in my free time on what I enjoy doing to try and make it into something I can make some money off of down the road (currently teaching myself how to use Blender, Premeire Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop). I enjoy doing it, but I don't really have a lot of time to learn it all in an efficient way.

Anyway, I've rambled a lot. I wish you the best. Maybe WSB will make us rich off a random GME like trade and we won't have to worry about a job we hate any more."

Then it happened again a few years later but for her daughter (they said she would have another boy).

Anyway, in the Netherlands, you don't pay taxes on capital gains, only on the total amount of money you own (incl. stocks). That total amount tax only comes into effect when you own more than ~$35,000 ($40,000 might be more accurate considering conversion rates...) though, so if you spend the money you earn from stocks, you don't have to pay taxes on it either way."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"In time you'll figure out the formula.

Many of our greatest minds and entertainers took years to figure it out, to the general public, it merely *seems* easy.

One of my acting coaches puts it best:

""Lifes not really a race soo much as its a marathon.""

Hell I still work a 9 to 5, then try to jam in 3 hour recording sessions *and* auditions (plus look for said auditions because im what's considered an independent actor).... Exhausting dosnt cover it, but the more work it takes to get to a point, the more you'll appreciate the end results.

I now have regular clients in Indie Dev studios. I can now call myself a ""working actor"", and I *know* now that itll continue to build as long as I remember why I started doing acting: have fun.

Just dont *ever* lose the determination that made you want to change your life.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Every year you’re taxed on how much money you have in total? Or is it tax on income for the year less expenses for the year? The first sounds really awful 😳
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Probably not that low of a tax rate if you’re day trading. Any profits from that would be taxed at ordinary income levels. My wild assumptions in that number though were that 1. She was in the US and 2. Her ordinary income is similar to mine. I also just picked 200 days out of the air.

I imagine for most of the folks on here they’d lose About a 1/3 (looks avg fed income tax rate is 24% and then layer on state taxes and other stuff like SS). But yeah still closer to $20k than $10k in that case.

You fucker, I wasn’t doing any actual math or fact checking in my original response."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are first of all based on income level. At my income of around $40,000 I pay around 37% in taxes. That's regular income tax and yes, it sucks. It's very high. NL is unfortunately a socialist country.

You also pay taxes on your total net worth, so to speak. This starts when you have around $35,000 (maybe 40,000 considering conversion rates...) collected in the bank (or in stocks/other assets). Before that, you don't have to pay additional wealth taxes, but there is a scale from that point onward. I'm not sure how much % it is, but it also sucks.

I believe you do get money back for some expenses, such as if you're studying and paying for it yourself, but really, they're basically just taking all the money you work hard for."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Interesting. On paper sounds like a horrible setup, but it’s well known that folks in NL, on avg, tend to be a lot happier and healthier than those in the US, so I’ll assume the tax dollars are used wisely (atleast better than the US)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, I'm fed up with it. I'm paying almost half my income in taxes (my partner actually pays 50% of theirs) and where does the money go? To my shitty (fortunately now) ex-neighbour, who has 5 little children in a 2 bedroom house, who yell, cry, screech, scream from 6 AM - 1 AM, who play their loud, trashy music all day, and smoke weed every day, has lots of different men over all the time, throws trash every-fucking where in the grass field behind the house, in the street in front of the house, generally around the house. I used to have to every day collect cigarette butts and random trash and throw them back over the fence.

That's where my taxes go to. That bitch neighbour hasn't worked a day in her life, several of her children have already been taken away (yes, she had more than 5), she's currently neglecting a baby of 1 year old (the youngest), and threatens people with their lives if anyone talks about calling CPS.

And I don't really want to be the person who finances this. So fuck socialism. I'd love to move somewhere else, and I hope to do it in the next few years."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol well if you decide to move to the US, probably stay away from the southwest quadrant and most of the middle of the country ! I definitely empathize with your feelings. On the federal (national) level I pay 37% as well (35% + some other BS they layer on) and I live in California and these fuckers take another 10.3%. Some years these percentages are even higher. I’m out here funding all these apes’ “stimmies”."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Idk how to do that but not sure what the point would be anyway ICs are not a directional play they lose if the price goes down as well. I guess you’re being defensive because I don’t think your bags are going to keep going up?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not the guy above, but to be clear, I was only asking for screenshots of your short position earlier because anyone that has this much conviction on the direction of a stock should at least have the balls to put their money on the line."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Me too, thanks for asking the questions I'm probably too confused to ask. I'm gonna go Google myself to sleep now."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ok I got it, thank you. He bought the call option contract for  $13 a piece and then resold the contract each for $126. 

Why would someone buy the contract for $126 if all they can make is $1 per share x 100? That’s a net loss of $26."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because the call was close to be in the money and there was a last day uptrend making it go from.useless to Itm. Expiring options with strike close to current price have huge volatility because they go from useless to in the money quickly.

The problem is they are risky as well because all that money can go to 0 in minutes.

But if you are right you make bank because it can easily 500% (a high risk high reward gamble)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Does he need 100 shares as collateral to resell the call option contract he bought?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, you sell to close. 
Write = create option (need collateral shares/money or it is called writing naked)

Buy/sell the owned option to close= only trade the option for it's premium

Exercise = if the call is in the money, exercise the contract to buy or sell 100 shares per contract at the strike. Exercising is not an obligation. Take care because some brokers autoexercise if option expires in the money. 

Options are leverages with maximum risk (for buyers)"

2021-04-01 23:36:27,wallstreetbets,"BlackBerry earnings/call were actually bullish ✅  credit to u/Rivaaal

 I see **many** paper-handed individuals dumping their shares for cheap because OMG BB has missed its revenue expectations for Q4. *(for reference $8.50 -8.7% 31st March 2021)*

Can we please dig a little bit deeper? Thank you.

*During the quarter BlackBerry entered into an exclusive negotiation with a North American entity for the potential sale of part of the patent portfolio relating primarily to* ***mobile devices, messaging and wireless networking.*** *The Company has limited its patent monetization activities due to the ongoing negotiations. If the Company had not been in negotiations during the quarter, we believe that Licensing revenue would have been higher.*

**Boom** pure and simple explanation for why the revenue missed. It’s not on weaker demand. It’s only because they are about to sell their side business and consequently they had to significantly cut that stream of revenue. Which also means that negotiations are advanced.

**What will happen then they sell?** they will receive a big fat cheque (don’t quote me on this but I imagine north of $500m if not a billion+ ; pure speculation) + according to the CEO they will collect royalties for 7 years. And they get to focus on their core businesses: cybersecurity, EV software, internet of things.

Is this good strategy-wise? Absolutely. Focus on your top projects with higher gross margins. Let go of the past and embrace the future.

**any analyst reaction? Yes indeed Canaccord upgraded the stock to Hold** from Sell this morning.

**Canaccord sees 'building blocks coming together'**

*Seeing the business ""turning the corner towards stronger trends”. The firm notes BB's weaker than expected Q4 results driven by licensing headwinds due to sales negotiations for part of its mobile patent portfolio.*

*Canaccord says BlackBerry management has ""created a cogent long-term strategy,"" but the firm is on the sidelines waiting for more evidence of product roadmap execution and emerging cross-selling opportunities.*

*The firm says a deal to sell the licensing business would ""unlock value and provide a capital infusion to drive accelerated software and services growth.""*

So even boomers traditionally late to the technology party are starting to see the whole BlackBerry’s strategy aligning. But these guys stay on the sideline because they don’t like early tendies. They lack the vision to say it’s an actual Buy especially at these levels. They will probably wait that a bigger broker moves first. And they will.

**a quick look at the numbers** BlackBerry has a $5bn market cap with $1bn+ yearly revenue and $800m in cash. I imagine investors can put 2 and 2 together. What do you think will happen to their balance sheet when they cash in the incoming sale of their portfolio. Way more cash to execute their plans and potential M&A if needed and no need for new shares issuance as confirmed by the CEO (no dilution in sight ; enough money in the bank). We could be in the coming weeks in a situation where BB has in cash the equivalent of 25%+ of their market cap...

**how about their core strategy?** *QNX now has design wins with 23 of the world's top 25 electric vehicle OEMs and remains on course to return to a normal revenue run rate by mid-fiscal 2022. BlackBerry IVY also made encouraging progress, with positive engagement from a number of leading automakers and the launch of our BlackBerry IVY Innovation Fund.*

In just one quarter they added 4 more EV OEMs with QNX (from 19 to 23 now).

They are well positioned to be involved in autonomous driving: *BlackBerry expands its partnership with Baidu to power next generation autonomous driving technology.* and *BlackBerry QNX Black Channel Communications to be used in Motional's driverless platform.* These are weeks-old news but it’s funny how it seems to go under the radar when it comes to price the company. Correct me if I’m wrong but Baidu could be the first and/or major player in autonomous driving in Asia.

QNX is still in SpaceX rockets. And I start to hear rumors that Tesla could consider using it too (very speculative but at least you’ve heard it).

And for the people who have ended up here randomly BlackBerry [IVY](https://blackberry.qnx.com/en/aws) is a joint venture with Amazon AWS for intelligent vehicle data platform. When the IVY deal was released BB shot past $9. AWS boss/founder at the time is now Amazon CEO.

So yea the revenue has missed by a few millions for an one-off reason. Have the fundamentals changed? Actually yes they have improved as they are well on track to pursue their strategic goals.

The question you should ask yourself is whether you are pricing BlackBerry based on their FY2020 or on what they are about to become?

I probably bought more June calls together with some shares (please don’t do like me).

*Definitely not a recommendation to buy, hold, sell any security. Besides I have no knowledge in IoT, programming, software etc. I can only read.*

**TLDR** why are you selling BB? if that’s because the revenue has slightly missed because they are selling a big chunk of their unneeded business for big money then you should ask yourself why you are in this ship in the first place. Even boomers analysts upgraded the stock this morning: they are starting to see BlackBerry business model happening.

Bonus: when will the sale happen? 🔮 crystal ball said before the next ER so in a few weeks (totally random and speculative)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You guys expect QNX to print money already, but the strategy is to make it a the facto standard in the industry. Once it is, it will print big money. Android was burning cash until mass adoption."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Selling it? I bought a shit ton of it today to add to what I already had! Been buying from the bottom up to $9 for months. BB is my retirement fund.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is 100% correct. BB is misunderstood and will be a phenomenal stock in 2021 (when it breaks from the unfortunate ""meme stonk"" category) but i have no regrets for selling at 3:50pm on Tuesday. I will definitely buy back in on this dip. but i fear it will probably be below $7 when i do.

Of course now that i say that... it won't hit 7 ever again! lol either way... spin the wheel and good luck BB boys!"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I doubled my position selling cash secured puts this week. The future is bright and once you consider monetization for self-driving and IoT data, the sky is the limit (literally) but its important to remember that this is a long term hold. 

I think one big way BB is currently falling short is advertising- their software is the guts for a lot of key systems and the only people that know about them as a software company are the nerds who actually work on those systems. They need to get out there more and get their story in front of key boomer decisionmakers, who from my experience, barely understand how to open a pdf file let alone the nuances of unified endpoint management or cybersecurity in general"

It's a major shift for a company that once saw self-driving technology as a core investment for its future."" (NPR, 2020). True, however, but just because they gave up on their research division does not mean that in the future, they won't just buy, let's say, a fleet of self-driving Tesla's for some high tourist destination. As the tech progresses, so will $BB. At least we know that Uber is interested in that field of autonomous driving. It could just be their research division just sucked and wasn't worth keeping?"

Who cares though? Free money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"BB and Amazon announced a partnership a few months back, so the more money they invest, the better. From day 1, when Chen took over, he stressed that partnerships were going to be their future, and I totally get what he's saying. All these huge name companies - Apple, Microsoft, Tesla, Uber, etc. are all working on autonomous vehicles, and then BlackBerry comes in and says, ""hey, you're going to need to secure all that tech and data..."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think I like the short windows too. Best return on premium and gives you some protection from a massive spike in price.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that’s a relief! That should be good for them then
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Personally I think you're looking at the covered calls wrong. I just set my strikes to where I won't be mad if they get called away. Sure it would have made me sad to have my shares called; but it would be for around $4/share more than I paid for it. Who gives a shit then? Fuckin' take that extra money, use it to buy cash secured puts with a strike price of your cost basis or lower.

2021-04-01 23:15:14,wallstreetbets,"$ASO and why you apes are gonna be mad you missed this one Alright let’s get right into this. $ASO known as academy sports and outdoors is a large nationally run sports equipment n shit like that store. I’m poetic I know. Academy has 259 stores nationwide but wants to see that grow to over 800.

They just report earnings this week and absolutely SMASHED earnings. EPS projected .46, actual was 1.09. They also beat revenue projections from 1.56B to 1.6B not much but still improved. Their net sales was 5.69(nice)Billion a 18% increase over the prior year. In comparison Dicks sporting goods, which has substantially more stores only improved 9.5% yoy.

Considering the fact that all of last year basically every single sport was canceled and yet they still destroyed earnings has me happier than a kid on Christmas morning. Every single team sport that was shut down last year is back for business this year baby which means more money for $ASO 🤑🤑🤑. Oh they also sell a shit ton of guns and ammo, which is obviously a big deal in today’s political scenario.

Now you say, okay why’s that matter this stock has been trading for only a couple months. Well here’s where things get interesting.

This is a disclaimer, I do not care how high a company is shorted unless there is substantial evidence that would convince me that due to the high short interest and the proponents of a good run company that the price will increase. This is that scenario.

Short interest is at 39%, public float is 31M and market cap is 2B, 9.1 days to cover, read those numbers again, then wipe your ass cause you probably shit yourself.

Now I don’t want to taunt this as “ThE nExT gMe” cause it’s not. I am simply bringing attention to a company with almost 900 MILLION CASH ON HAND, and the fact that EVERY SINGLE MOTHERFUCKING SHORT is currently underwater. Yup you read that right, every single short that has been opened in this stock is currently underwater. Unless $ASO screws up big time these shorts will have no choice but to cover.

Pos: 4/16 $30c

Edit: I forgot to mention 92% is owned by institutions

Edit: wsb mods banned me for 69 days for “paper trading” when I’ve never paper traded a day in my life lmfao what a fucking joke, nobody like a jerkoff mod

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good luck🚀🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes because I’m retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Could you translate this to ape please?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hmmm it’s currently at all time high so you should be up atleast a little bit no?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are they selling sporting goods or drugs?  That is a lot of $$$ in a short amount of time? (Oct 2020)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,P/E ~7 comapred to Dick's ~13?  Interesting.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thank you for clarifying!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Wrong. That’s the exercise payout not the contract being sold payout.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is there data on how many shares insiders sold?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ooga ooga me likes
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good bot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Stonks go up
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"March 2 the 4/16 $30C was about $1.3, March 8 it was at $3.8, and recently it was at $1.5. I had the misfortune to buy at the high (also bought shares then for about $26), but I had thought back then that at least once earnings comes out the stock would be on its way to $40+. I think there is a decent chance ASO moons this week so hopefully I come out nicely ahead.

Edit - Apparently I am an idiot... I am actually up on ASO... I forgot I had previously sold positions and pocketed a gain of about $9,000 (in beginning of March). So instead of being down about $5,000, I am actually up about $4,000."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,ASO could easily hit $40 by 4/16 if shorts cover. It’s been in the top 4 most shorted stocks for months despite great earnings and being a great value.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah I mean you might get like an extra $50 from the premium but not really much
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,9.1 days to cover so this will blast off latest on the 15th?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They hide SI via married puts and synthetic Long's... There's whole lotta DD out there with sources and calculations... Dyor
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yep that's exactly what days to cover means. It's literally that easy to predict a short squeeze, which is why they happen all the time and retail investors frequently make easy money by playing them."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Go take a xanax and calm down
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Happy with my current 5x gains so far, looking forward to more."
2021-04-01 23:08:43,wallstreetbets,"AMC is NOT introducing 500M shares on May 4th. The vote on May 4th is for the RIGHT to introduce them. Apologies if this is going to get skewered but let it be known.

The ""News"" stating the shares are being introduced on May 4th is WRONG.  The vote occurs on May 4th and it is for the RIGHT to introduce the shares, not to actually introduce them.

TS;RA (Too Short; Read Already):  HODL This shit like you Majestic Fucking Apes HODL banana colored crayons!

&#x200B;

Not financial advice, I am a meat Popsicle.  This information is freely available on the proxy report supplied to shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ehhhhhh.... fellas... I mean, amc isn't changing at all and they are taking advantage of the higher share price to line their executive pockets. AMC was kinda dying before covid and now that movie releases are changing forever, I don't really see amc coming out on the other side. Praise be to lord tendies but imo, it might be good to get out while there's still a light on."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC CEO going to make a hugeeee amount of baggies lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"so the real question since there doesn't seem to be any point in holding this stock is where is the AMC loss porn?

not financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"if they introduce more shares, wouldnt the price go down caue of bigger pool?  Im an APE so..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who cares? They obviously need the cash and realize they're vastly overpriced at the moment. This was the obvious move to save the company. Of course, WSB thought they'd someone rise from the ashes like a phoenix on their own. That was never going to happen. 

&#x200B;

If they don't manage to dilute, they go bankrupt. You better be voting in favor of the motion."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Very true,but having a loaded gun and waiving it around can be just as effective (affective? Fuck i hate those words) as firing it ya know?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"People talk about Disney and HBO MAX (warner) and streaming platforms, but how does that compare to the BIG F bucks ticket selling franchises ? are we just going to watch FAST AND FURIOUS go streaming ? is Universal, sony and MGM just going to release a platform for them, and if so that would just be over saturating the market ? we know disney+ is supost to be a big thing, but how they are playing most of the series isn't everything more worth it when they collect BILLIONS on box office with 3 BIG MOVIES ? i'm almost selling at a minor loss on AMC, but i do believe that they can comeback, because the disney bubble will pop.  


  
also, netflix wants to have their movies on theaters."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Paper handed bitch ass whiners. I'm going to the movies

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc fucked investors, entire point of holding amc was because of shorts. Since shorts can buy newly released shares they domt have to buy it from you now"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think i need to buy more stocks so I can have more of a vote on this one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Buying puts for AMC lok
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Stop telling people! I just quadrupled my shares today and yesterday AND lowered my average cost by a lot. If you don't want them, sell them and I'll buy them. 🙃"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Pretty sad how AMC stock holders seem a lot happier & even support the GME movement. As where GME retards are just toxic assholes. You clowns do realize you can support both? At the end of the day it’s a war against hedge funds. So hurt them in more ways than one.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so glad I sold my shares for a profit and bought more GME.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC WILL MAKE GAMESTOPS SQUEEZE LOOK LIKE A PIMPLE. TRUST THE PROCESS WE HAVE UNTIL MAY 4TH UNTIL THEN STAY THE COURSE AND FOLLOW THE MONEY.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,#Imagine still being long on AMC when mgmt is constantly making your money disappear
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"30x AMC Jan 21 2022 8 Call

I don't see it not being at least 8 by end of year, even if they dilute it. Paying off debts and building a ton of cash will give investors a sense of security and will probably bring in bigger money from non-retail investors. You know, the ones that buy more than 1k shares."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry, man. 

The dollar drop yesterday was enough for me to move on. It’s nice that you believe if the vote passes they won’t issue new shares. 

They want the cash. They don’t care about your price point, losses, or hell even your best interest as an investor."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what they are pushing scare tactics it’s because they’re TERRIFIED!!!!!!!!!!!!!


🦍🍿🚀🌕"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There has been a lot of misunderstanding on AMC's dividend program. Contrary to popular belief they DO pay dividends! During 2020 AMC made negative 4.6 billion in profits, there are 175 million shares, so each shareholder on record 12/31/2020 owes AMC a dividend of $39.15 per share. AMC accepts Venmo or Payal for your dividend payments. Send to [no-reply@amc.com](mailto:no-reply@amc.com)."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got my shareholders package and I voted no to those 500m.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"so if shareholders passed the vote and introduced share dilution, means HF could buy shares and close their positions right? THE DILUTION IS WILL KILL THE SQUEEZE!

ME APE ANYONE GET IT?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,May the Fourth be with you!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just vote No on your proxy vote if you don't want this... It's not an instant dilute, its more of a risk management stance for the company.."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think fair to say they will take any rout they feel will keep them alive.  how could anyone even feel slighted by that...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What I never understood about $AMC is why buy them over studio tickers like $DIS or $T?

Studios are the ones making money on ticket sales and they're the ones in the driver seat with the DTC streaming."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Doesn't mean they won't sell the news, absolute retard"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ya after 4th they will do it😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They will release them at some point though. If AMC had no intention of release those shares then why apply for them in the first place. And this is why AMC will not moon. GME has a better shot at really mooning, because the exec team there isn't trying to take advantage of its investors."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted everybody out
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is not news. This is old news but many media outlets used this yesterday as headline AGAIN. Their intention is so obvious when they have nothing bad on AMC, also how synchronized it was tells you what they are after. Hope apes not dumm enough to fall for it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I don't like how money hungry and full of himself uncle bruce is. But his position on AMC is spot on. It doesnt even compare to GME in the slightest. I cant think of a single metric that would make me go AMC over GME if I had a few thousand to invest
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is HF manipulation. They NEED the stock to go down and they need it to happen NOW because in a few weeks the pandemic will get its teeth knocked out and the re-opening will begin. Memorial Day weekend is coming, movies have been sitting on the shelf waiting for the re-opening, people are bored AF not being able to just go out once in a while. Once the re-opening hits there will be a string of “good news” numbers coming out from AMC and the stonk go up. Stonk go up then whatever short interest there is will LOSE. Yes, SI may be significantly lower now but the HF that are shorting this stock don’t care, they want to lie and cheat headlines into making you sell. If you held out this long why the hell would you sell BEFORE THE RE OPENING!?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea, gme and amc bubbles are gonna pop. Dilution is real. Insiders wanna get paid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"IMHO, dilution of a stock worth owning is a buying opportunity..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME IS OLD news! AMC IS GOING TO BE BIGGER than GME ever thought about being!!!!! All we do is Hold Apes!!!! 🦍💎🚀🌕 When everything comes to light AMC will be the stock everybody wished they had invested in! GME IS NOT EVEN IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS AMC’s stock! There will never be another stock that does what AMC is about to do!!!!!!!!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Imma wait for that dilution dip to buy back in.  Lol.  If you read the further down they’re creating 500 mil shares and they also want to use 35 mill shares to immediately raise capital the other 465mil shares goes to the board and execs to line their pockets and also maybe to negotiate off some debt. But when they trade off those shares for debt where do you think those shares go?  They’re sold off in the market.  Diluting the stock even more.  Maybe some of y’all are right they have no choice dilute or die but they’re so fucking stupid they just keep crushing the momentum of their stock cause they’re desperate paper handed pussies.  Wake up and don’t be a bag holder here.  There may be a time to buy back into this stock but the short term ain’t lookin so good for amc.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/01/amc-shares-slide-as-ceo-seeks-approval-for-500-million-share-offering.html

CEO was gushing about what they could do with all the money. If it gets approved, they're issuing ASAP."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC I LOVE THE STONK 👀🤏🍿🥤😂😂😂🚀🚀🚀🚀🔴🔴🔴🔴
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn yall acting like its news, Ive been known and kept holding."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"and Im sure they wont issue more shares, the fact they are considering it after just issuing  hundreds of millions of shares in february....amirite?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Haha all these paper handed losers selling AMC please sell we dont need yall anyway 😂🤣
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You can do what you want, but I wouldn't hold AMC much longer if I had it. It won't skyrocket and is nowhere close to the GME situation. In a few months it will probably be around 3 to 4 dollars a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love to waste my money I used to just burn it for warmth but now that I’ve found AMC my money disappears even quicker!! Dropped another $200 on this failing stock!!! ( /s for those that need it)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"May I ask a question: Everyone knows that Gme was the main game from the start. Also, Gme Doesn't introduce new shares. Why would anyone buy AMC?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC is fucked. The board dumped most of their shares. Gg roll credit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nobody cares. AMC is a distraction.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re an idiot
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme here I come
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bought into the hype a month and half or so ago. Brand new to trading. Joined the amc subreddit. Said i was holding forever blah blah blah. But my gut feeling told me it was never gonna sky rocket like people were saying. Plus reading a lot of other opinions on it and the fact that has so much debt. I bought at 9.24 and when it hit 13+ I just had to bail out. No regrets there.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is everyone so desperate to tell amc holders to sell? It's my fate and my choice. Have your opinions but I'm holding and true amc holders have known about the 500 million shares and alot of cucks have tried convincing amc stock holders that they are going to issue. That is not true the ceo said for the right to issue and only at a given time. I've lost fate in wsb. Fuck your silver and fuck your opinions! If gme did worse than amc I wouldn't go bashing it and try to dishearten its investors. It's about trying to burn the shorts not the company's fundamentals at the end of this game. I agree with another amc investor it's true streaming is nice and convenient but I love going to the movies on a date or with friends. Gamestop is just a game store. It's way better and faster to buy and download games 95 percent of my ps4 library is from psn.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,GME seething lol U mofos sound like bitches AMC to the moon 🌙🌚🤣😂GME RIP
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th? Far away galaxy day? AMC is getting into the meme stuff too?!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,i sold my amc and put it into athx. i'd rather a 10 year hold than 10 months until a billion shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So I should sell my 5 shares avg $16 per or hold like gme?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I voted against it. Being a sharehodlr has benefits.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,haha...they're shorting themselves and leaving us holding the bag.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I got out of AMC in early February after riding high from sub 3. This company is shitty and its executives are just stringing the retail movement along to make themselves richer. I love the movies and enjoy specifically AMC theaters, but this move is played, and now they're potentially trying to dilute their already over-diluted stock. Pass"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"In a stock split does the share price stay the same?  No.  It goes down by about half but you own two shares, and overall it kinds of trends up because the company is healthy enough that they needed to split their stock.   What AMC is doing is a basically a stock split, since they're doubling their shares with dilution, but they are giving the other share to themselves. (VIAC just diluted by 5 percent and their stock tanked by 2/3 share price, but there were other factors too.)

So figure a healthy AMC is when the stock is selling for 11 bucks right now.  So after dilution if it's above 5 that would be pretty good for them.  Smooth brains here don't seem to understand the concept of dilution, when you bash AMC about the stock being overpriced they tell you the shares were 20 dollars pre-Covid, not taking into account they have quadrupled the share count(more since then and they want to double that.)   

I really know I shouldn't say this because I just sold my puts yesterday.  I just want the stock price to still be nine bucks by monday and I can get my precious puts."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The news doesn't care about the truth. They saw a chance to crater the stock today and ran with it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well I’ll buy more puts then. It’s gonna tank, there is no squeeze and never was gonna be one, you’d be out of your mind to hold. The diamond hand mentality has gone a little far in the case of amc"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sell your shares while you can
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For people saying GME is good for a long term Investment and that it has a chance of improving, please stop! Gme has always had bad customer service, bad practices and overall shitty experiences. Gme has no chance of surviving long term. Once GME takes off I hope people sell and make some bank. Not financial advice"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I sold for a small profit and got far away from this corrupt company.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sad ass boomer board
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Puts on AMC 4 life now bitches!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Seem like everyone loss faith on AMC
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,U have the right to remain silent.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time to pack the bag and walk away
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why is this bullish?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I'm guessing AMC share price will drop if they introduce the 500m or will it be like a share split?

And could this vote cause a recall of share?  Forcing shorts to cover?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I keep getting phone calls from an 800 number and they ask me to vote.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I moved some money in degiro cuz i did not trust etoro, but I can only buy 1 gme and 5/6 amc. I did not follow amc data so I have no idea of what a possible floor could be, any good soul that could make a super recap?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,$500 million of shares is far better than 500 mil shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm in Australia- commsec
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What’s the difference introducing means it will happen CEO of AMC is taking advantage of up tic in stock price telling news outlets “we want more people to have access to our shares”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Mr Cramer finished Mad Money today noting issuing some shares could be very good for AMC and shareholders.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I got out AMC because there was only one logical reason for big funds and the CEO buying millions of shares. So they could rig this vote in their favor. Helping out the hedge funds is going to benefit them more in the long run than helping Joe Blow squeeze their stock.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If everyone dumped their shares it would moon off instantly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And guess what. It will pass
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Not looking for financial advice. How do you place a put properly?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,May the 4th be with you!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Multi pass!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they CAN, why would they not? Seriously, if they win the vote, is there any reason they would hold back? The date would be later but the outcome would be the same"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Anyone thinking they're trying to get bought out by another company by lowering their stock value?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Legit surprised retards aren’t googling this shit, they flooded shares right after the GME squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And then give the CEO a fat bonus.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Unlike gamestop, amc is taking advantage of the situation. Gamestop is climbing out with intent to turn things around. Where as amc, they have no alternatives to changing their business model."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seems like a “get rich scheme” by AMC corporate executives. I am a bag holding ape like many of you. This is throwing feces in our face after we helped bail them out. We are apes, they are fucking pigs."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That’s called leveraging up times 2!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEO took a fat 20M bonus the year of covid, while all the theatres shut down and employees laid off. 

Your savior and friend, AMC’s CEO, ladies and gentlemen!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Read this 5 times, and im still confused, or am i, i dunno !?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">bjergbirdnerd

Would you care telling us how many AMC shares you own?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Like the 3 million dollar bonus? The ceo thanks you.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Absolutely. No doubt in my mind they are taking advantage at this point.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Amc/GME were always going to have to issue new shares eventually. 1. What kind of idiots would not when their share price is 1000000% higher 2. After everyone gets theirs, the shorts are going to eventually need the shares. More than likely, retail owns more than 100% of the float and institutions also own more than 100%"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Even if they use 500M (and there's no indication they will) it'll either be to do M&A (feels likely given how they keep unsubtly hinting at it) or to pay off debt cheaply (which is a drag on the share price to an equivalent amount anyway and removing that debt cheaper than letting it run is net positive).

Paper handed bi**es attitude to this is blergh, the simple fact is we don't know when they intend to use them or to what degree and how quickly. Presumably if they do the idea won't be to just dump them on the market all at once; not least because that would be a breach of their fiduciary responsibility to shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeee boi! Anyone who looks at the actual value of amc shares knows this aint something you should yolo calls into
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah i bought into the hype and had to sell my AMC at a loss, $10k USD down the chute. What broke for me was when the CEO goes out in the morning and tells everyone hell yeah, we are going to issue more shares! even if there are many steps, he's out there shouting it out at the top of his lungs. I don't care what the line of questioning was, he needed to answer it better. The wrong msg was put in his mouth and that tanked us hard."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I can't wait til there's 500 million more shares to short
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I cant believe people trust an organization that charges 20 dollars for popcorn and fucks over shareholders when we got Papa Cohen and friends at GME giving us deep fucking value
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I've seen too much DD on GME to even feel worried about parking my money there. I'm happy to wait it out through spikes and dips.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Already got myself into May 21 Puts before this news was even announced. Was getting a little nervous as that 10-11 dollar resistance seemed to be holding the last couple weeks. Glad I did now though!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Near may i expect
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Honestly seems like free money at this point
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea lol like vote no and the squeeze play might happen but the company will probably also go bankrupt or vote yes and the squeeze play definitely won't happen but the company will survive... 

Legit the AMC shareholders are between a rock and a hard place"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't get it . People saying GME is a long term investment.
But please explain to me how ? Physical games are going extinct . It's much more convenient to download a game . There are even console versions without a disk slot beeing sold.  And all that stuff you can buy in their stores you can much easier buy on Amazon . 
Amc is in debt yes . But cinemas will stay . Other cinema company's are going up. Only AMC is going down and the press is bashing it . Why would the media care ?
Imo AMC is , if it doesn't squeeze , the better long term investment"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,U are a bad investor if you didnt know about the vote for months now
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Then why did you buy amc in the first place u dumb fuck. FUCK UNCLE BRUCE TOO lol.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No they dont have to. Voting is already happening.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah thats a blatant lie spread by morons like you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"sell before that, tf"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, I don’t understand why all the losers here crying paper hands. 
What is going on with people?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yea . Saw so many comments saying they buy some more puts on AMC, let them die etc . Meanwhile in r/AMC people are chill and say apes together strong .
The whole media is bashing AMC right now . Why would they do that, why would they care ? There is more behind AMC .
Other cinema company stocks going up right now . It doesn't make sense to me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Four comments above you: """"⁸GME seething lol U mofos sound like bitches AMC to the moon 🌙🌚🤣😂GME RIP"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's also because GME was the original, AMC was likely always a pretty cheap distraction to keep retail from buying GME, has one could buy many more shares of AMC."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"one is worth hundreds of dollars and currently trading at $190\~ the other is worth $1\~ but is trading at $9\~

I feel bad for these AMC people who think they are sticking it to the HF but AMC stock is more and more worthless by the day."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So smart dude. I legit feel sorry for the people trying the amc play 😬
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,what fucking restaurant serves hot dogs and steak?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Have fun holding 1 share at 200+ 😂😂😂😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, it's old news that the CEO brought up on tv making many people hear it for the first time. Then alot of other outlets ran with the story. They brought this on themselves."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How is this HF manipulation? It's literally the ceo of AMC doing this...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEO: ""guys i will dilute the shares""

Idiots: ""this is HF manipulation"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, it will go up to pre pandemic highs..... 10$ a share."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"But this is legit coming straight from the CEO of AMC... Like, come on bruh..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ape together strong but the prisoner's paradox is real.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,not that i wouldn’t love for u to be right but could you explain why you feel that way?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go back to Citadel, take your 1 cent per comment salary."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Institutional voters are long termers. They want the company they are invested in to avoid bancruptcy and resolve debt. For them it doesn't matter if it takes 10 years to get return on their investment as long as it doesn't die today.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Depends if you believe in the compamy or not. Do your own DD and invest accordingly.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Honestly, thank fuck amc is gonna die 🤣 feels like it's been dragging GME down this entire time"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Seriously?  The last time I went into a GameStop (seriously over 5 years ago) it looked like a fucking Spencer’s Gifts/pawn shop with dumb ass posters and pop culture chachkies. Everyone is downloading video games and buying consoles online. There’s absolutely no future for this brick and mortar. It’s grasping at straws to stay alive and it’s pathetic. They’ll probably start selling Nerium and Mary K. 

Movies will ALWAYS need theaters. Get over your GME blind worshipping shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Physical games are going extinct . How can people think GameStop is a good long term investment ? Even if they switch to e commerce so what ? They won't bring anything new to the table . 
Microsoft / Sony already have their gamestores on their consoles . No need to buy it from a third party like GameStop . 
I just don't get it . 
Yet cinemas will probably always be around . And 99% here are bashing AMC , just like the media every day ..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only some idiots here lost their paper hand, we are all holding strong.

HF is the enemy not GME or AMC community"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's not. It's bearish but less so than some people thought. 500 m shares will not be released all at once on may 4 but it will be voted on and probably released in batches thereafter.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It will not force the shorts to cover but may give them an opportunity of doing so at a discount. A split would split the existing stock and its price but not give revenue to the company. This will be issuing of new stock which will bring money to the company as the seller and decrease the price and share percentage of the average shareholder. 

Lets put it in ape language. If you own 1 banana and there are 10 in existance.
Share split: you now own 2 bananas out of 20 in existance. Your value is retained even if the individual banana is just half the price.
New shares issued: You now own 1 banana out of 20 in existance and the company gets cash from the new banana sales. Your value is cut in half."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"except that its actually 500 million shares not $500M dollars

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Who told you that? Everyone on r/amc was voting “no” on this proposal. 

I’m all for healthy skepticism but stop the disinformation."

Not retail, really, it's HFT"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dump your 100 shares in principal, that’ll show em"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I have a small position, and I agree it felt like a real fuck you when they announced the dillution.  I'm still holding on because I feel like when GME pops, people are going to FOMO into AMC because of the association."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Must of us dont give a fuck about the company lol. We just want the "" squeeze "" to happen and sell out. I personally couldn't care less what happens to amc after I make some money, I doubt the movie experience will go away, but who knows if amc will"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,AMC CEO also gave himself a fat bonus... during a pandemic where he was close to bankruptcy.  Dumped my AMC shares and went all GME.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We will see about that. Y’all weird af... instead of teaming up against the hedgies, y’all want to talk bad about AMC."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you don't. The post above is correct, and yet with that dilution in AMC share value, its still the smarter play short term than GME. GME's Cohen Thesis from January was based on 2023 revenue projections using multiples pulled from Chewey, which is about as oranges to GME's apples as you get. Even with those models and realistic market share projections, GME should only be worth about 60-80 on FORWARD EARNINGS. Even using the Chewey multiples on the March earnings you're still in the 30-40 range. There's absolutely no play above 80 that makes sense right now on GME, and all the cultists circle jerking in each others' mouths in Wendy's parking lots doesn't make the price make any more sense."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm out of AMC as well. Sold CC and got em covered at $11 when my basis was $10. All back into GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Also. DUNE.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's a whole other issue, one thing at a time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The switch to Digital e-commerce being spearheaded by the founder of Chewy.com billionaire activist investor Ryan Cohen.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I dumped the stock once it hit $14
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right... I'm the moron for asking a question.... You ain't no ape. You're a snake.

Bleh, just looking through the first little bit of your profile you sound like a toxic asshole. I hope you find a reason to be better some day."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No chance.

FUDPROOF."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"CEO’s are doing what they need to do. The fact that this is actually already established news being PUSHED heavily again is something else. It’s not accepted that this is going to happen. The desire by the ceo for his own reasons is the only truth at this point. Go back and re watch Cramer’s manipulation video. He gave us the playbook. “Call your buddies at CNBC AND MARKETWATCH and push bullshit news to suit your agenda. Create a “new truth” because it’s legal and it’s satisfying. You HAVE to get that price down. Go back and re watch his playbook on how this all works. When you read a news story any news story involving stocks, ask yourself why this has been written. Look pst the obvious reasons. Who does this article serve? It’s not just written for long shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You must be easily impressed by card tricks too. All parties involved are doing so for their own selfish reasons. You, me, the CEO, hedge funds  and the news source."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I agree, it was flailing before the pandemic. It was run like shit. Not debating you there. Lots of companies are run like shit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Straight of what? CEO didn't confirm anything, it's just one of his plans to raise more capital, he just said it might be good for the future, most likely it's not gonna pass, even if passed he won't be dumping those all shares in the pool in the near future, could stretch years.

&#x200B;

It is also an old news, everybody knows that when they sent email few weeks ago. The media is trying to make dumb people think it's a sudden breaking news...

&#x200B;

If you are on reddit, you should be stand by AMC's back, the shorts haven't bought back yet, so the media won't stop attacking.

One day if GME has rumors and media attacks it, I would never be a GME basher, we are in this together.

Never realise so many clowns jump out when AMC bumps a bit."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Keep talking, I'm almost there. 

Tell him how they quadrupled the float in the last year and I swear I'll nut like a virgin."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That’s pretty presumptuous. I presume they like to make money, on any timeline."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The person you are answering didn't say a word about GME
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why would they do that... did they say what they want to use the money for?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"LoL ape language.  That's what I figured it was.  But it sounded like such a bad idea I thought, no way."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Exactly how can the ceo make a statement about limiting dilution with such an announcements
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"all the meme stocks were basically manipulated at the same time GME was blowing up, you look at the 1 year chart on all of them they pretty much blew up at the same time every time. Imagine if all those meme stocks had the money focused on GME"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,How will they pay off their debt without issuing shares?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They flooded shares around the time that all of the meme stocks squeezed. Too lazy to find the DD on it. I pulled out at that point. There’s still a short on the company, just not to the point everyone was hopping in the train for"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,its amazing how many people watch these shows where the person doing the show clearly is just some idiot who has been trading 6 months on robinhood and watching some other idiots on youtube.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I could argue GME is undervalued at 200 with their recent moves and position
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not any more after they continually fuck their shareholders. Honestly do you and I support that, but holy fuck there are way more shares and more coming. Impossible to squeeze a stonk if shares get diluted what seems like monthly at this point. 

Glad the execs got paid tho."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> But at least GME has potential to survive as a company

lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its almost like fundamentals dont matter for spmething to squeeze
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My puts, which are ITM are still losing me money. I can't win."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m dumping AMC Monday. Already down 15% with AMC so hopefully GME gets a nice dip so I can dump $2k and average down
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This. I feel like everyone is so focused on short term stock value. But if AMC raises money to pay their debts they can actually begin to reinvest in the company leading to longer term share value. Better than then going bankrupt and everyone’s share prices dropping to 0.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yall really doing this gme vs amc
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah if it ever breaks my avg price of $14 again I'm done. Don't like what management is doing but don't want to eat too much of a loss sandwich
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And yet, they immediately look to dilute again..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There is nothing smart short term about going into a play that is going to dilute 100's of millions of shares
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why in the world would I buy digital copies of a game from GameStop if the consoles already have stores Microsoft / Sony on them where you can buy games ? 
GameStop wouldn't bring anything new to the e commerce market . And that's something that defines succes"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes you are. Its the literal basics you lack understanding. Noone's here to hold your hand. These shit can be debunked in a 5 min google search.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, they already diluted like 2 times since january. Their float was like 100mill shares at the start of the year. Everytime there is a little runup they dilute. Now the float is 450mill and they want to double it again. They do not care about your votes lol"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Omg literally retarded lmfao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO is trying to make AMC profitable of course. I’m not questioning his motives.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The CEO was on CNBC talking about dilution.  There's being in this together and then there's denying reality.  You're denying reality.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My broker told me they have no info about a vote on AMC . 
I'm in Europe aswell . Trade Republic"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The board is doing what they can to save the company. They converted much debt to equity... And then paid themselves fat bonus because fuck the idiots in reddit.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yes, and therefor they do not want the company they are long in to go bankrupt. If they did they would have shorted it. Institutional longs will vote yes and keep a long timeframe. The ones who would have voted no sold the moment the news of possible dilution hit their bloomberg terminal."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is WSB. They don’t have to say anything about GME. it’s implied.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They have accrued billions in debt over the past year. They need to stay solvent, pay off some of the debt and reduce interest fees. For the long term survival of the company this is the smart play. Issue new stock while riding a wave and get cash on hand to invest in the health of the company. For the squeeze and short term holders it's really bad."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think he's stating just because they can issue stock doesn't mean they will.  But if approved I mean its kinda expected that they are going to issue quite a lot of it.  500M is more than the current float out now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not against it, they were in a bad spot due to COVID and I’m glad they got saved. People are investing with the idea it’s another squeeze."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"By taking profits? Same as every other company. 

People act like AMC is going destitute. Unlike GameStop they actually stand a chance to make a lot of money in the first year after Covid to dig themselves out of a hole."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Well that’s a totally different point. You said no one is googling what share dilution would do. People are concerned about it for a good reason. They are voting against it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’m not sure what your point is. Yes AMC quadrupled their shares in the past year. 

The only people acting like this is news are the ones who bought into the hype in January and can’t read a 10k or understand why dilution is bad. 

That’s why everyone is voting no to authorize **another** 500m shares from being issued."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ok lets hear it
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol the self righteous delusion is nauseating.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMC barely put a dent in their debt. In their own words, they raised enough to survive until the end of the *year*.

They still have multiple billions in debt"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes. Imagine being so confident and yet so wrong at the same time.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">and the movie experience isn't something that is just going to go away especially in a sector that is so consolidated nowadays.

I will likely never go to the movies again. $40 for two hours and limited, overpriced snacks? I do not miss it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Sorry but GME has new revenue streams while AMC is lucky to go back to their status quo.

Gme value is dependent on their new leadership not us apes. You are delusional"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"AMCs problem is the “movie experience” is now available to me in my living room.   And the snacks are better/cheaper and I don’t feel so ghetto for smoking weed in my car in the AMC parking lot.  I can do that shit in my garage, where weed is meant to be smoked"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Gme as a tech company can the shopify path.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well lenders would be over the moon if this dilution happened. And AMC is so debt leveraged that they are beholden to the lenders above all else.

If they go under lenders get paid first. If they can raise $2B from this share issuance I think amc could be around for quite a bit longer and could pay off their bonds significantly before finally dying off.

I’ve heard that some have been buying the guaranteed bonds with 10% interest rates for 50 to 70 cents on the dollar. If they can be paid in full they will look like the bond kings. They also are the only organized group with enough pull to influence amc. Now that Wanda holds less that 10% and silverlake made a full exit, their largest shareholder by far is retail. Not organized, 95% not educated, not realistic. They hold no power

Equity holders are fucked in either situation. Lenders get paid and execs keep their jobs for years if they can raise this capital by issuing more shares. If they don’t issue shares they go under and lenders get scraps, shareholders get literally nothing... so what do you think will really happen? Lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Paper handed bitch
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good man now your thinking
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m with you not to mention  the hedges now know there’s a chance to wait us out you’d think the ceo would have waited intill after a squeeze. Not to mention he did the announcement on one of our rivals
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That was me. I went in 131 @14.33 in January. As soon as it went back up last month, I sold all @14.37. I just didn’t trust AMC. Although I am no longer in GME, I have more faith in the moves they are making and it seems like they are at least trying. AMC is just taking advantage of the situation"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Press X to doubt
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah they need to do it. But being invested in them knowing this would happen and while they do it is retarded. Literally volunteering to loose value.

Elder this is a retarded response."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,For a squeeze play. Any other reason given is just cognitive dissonance to avoid selling and buying GME. Self sabotage.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You called it these comment smell of hedgies
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,100% agree
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why did you buy AMC at $14? LOL
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hope Hollywood gets everything it so richly deserves.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> AMC broke even or lost money in 2019 with the greatest money making lineup you could hope for. 

They lost money. It's in their 10-K."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Go woke, go broke. 

Hollywood gotta inject politics, anti male and anti white into every thing.  You even see that in sports too.  How is it that during a pandemic where people stuck in homes but yet tv ratings for sports are tanking?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I mean I’m convinced I could turn that shit around...go heavy into marketing on the experience side.

Buy whatever the fuck ironic shit could get people out for a date night as reopening is going on

Literally every pandemic in history commerce picked up, cities came back, economies roared...if they can’t capitalize on that they’re even stupidest than me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao but maybe as WSB we should unite to oust the CEO if it comes to it. Find someone for us all to proxy voting right to get that greedy little prick out of there
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"at this point to think either is a ""free money machine"" is a bit delusional. GME probably has a better chance than AMC at this point but its really a crapshoot right now because nobody actually know the full situation, just a bunch of retarded ""DD"" written by people who have been holding $400 bags since january which was coincidentally their first month trading."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Time for wsb to go the way of the hedges and start shorting AMC?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Sold at 21. Bought back in multiple times and somehow now average 18. I am brilliant.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You gave the answer in your statement. If you think the price is going down, short sell the stock."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Streaming rentals. Case closed two seconds of brainstorming. Now let’s see what Ryan Cohen does with it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You sound a bit angry like someone who owns AMC offends you
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Nah thanks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I know more about markets more than you would like to give me credit for, but hey.....good luck to you too!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Of course it’s being pushed both ways! If the stock doesn’t go down in price how does a put make money? If it doesn’t go back up how do calls make money? A stock going sideways does nothing for both sides
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The 10% of HF who have shorted the stock are just going to lose money? Or will they attempt to convince holders that they should sell? You should wake up my friend. Lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Reality is CEO is talking about it as a financial plan, but it is highly likely not going to happen, we share holders decide the outcome.

That's the reality. You are bending reality.

The way the interview is constructed makes this topic inevitable. What's with all those fear spread?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,*lights a cigarette*
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yeah, go in to go bankrupt is not good. I wonder why the market is so unpredictable if institutions all do exactly what you say? weird..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm not even sure why you're glad they are saved? They should go bankrupt and redesign their business. Even before COVID they were going down the gutter due to streaming. There's a reason Netflix has a market cap 10X of AMC and why AMC hasn't had a profitable year in almost a decade.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"go look up the last time AMC made profit for an entire year. take that profit and then look at how much they are paying in interest for their 5 billion in debt.

smh"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"My point is they already flooded shares and people are still pushing that it’s a massive short squeeze like GME. It’s an alright long term position, but WSB has been flooded with people only going for squeeze stocks. 


I already pulled out, hoping for tendies for the people still holding though."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Gme is undervalued at 190 once the e commerce starts to move. The newly hired people offer great potential, and the apes are ensuring marketing is not an issue.

Unless they do something stupid as issuing more shares, gme should easily touch 250 and grow depending on movement, just from society's position."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,When you go against the hivemind you should expect downvotes and attacks.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Then you never really liked going to the movies in the first place.  if 10 bucks a ticket is too much for you, thats understandable, some people are cheap af and or dont like paying for fun.   i knew a kid who never got toys, he still played just fine."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"i guess movie experience is different for people who dont really like movies or doing activities.  people still do date nights, there are still movie buffs, and even my 75 oled with nice atmos doesnt compete to going to the movies."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hate smoking in my garage man lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I hear you man. But millions of people want the experience of going to the movies. For example KonG Godzilla is making huge profits in the movies around the world!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You sound like a fucking loser, go out and have a good time instead of being couped up in your mom's house all the time. 
""I'm never going to a bar again because I have beer in the fridge."""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If that's the way you feel about the ""movie theatre experience"", I feel kinda sorry for you. Of course you can get yourself a Ultima 40 system and a big screen, but hell nah that' just watching a movie, no experience there. Never took a gal to the movies? Whole different experience from Netflix&Chill, and that is what AMC lives off and will live of again once the pandemic's over"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"consoles come with  gamestop killing digital stores built into them, psn and xbox live.  they were both heading toward being obsolete.   the thing is that i think more people like going to the movies rather than buying games from 3rd party"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly, people cry about why fidelity and others dont have some slick user friendly UI, its because they dont really make any money off some high school kid making a million $0 comission trades with a $500 balance in the account."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Obviously if you have a conviction that AMC is going to return to it's pre-COVID glory, you do you.  I hope you're right and make tons of money.

I respectfully disagree that people have to be long term holders to bring value to the economy.  In my opinion, you could argue that long term holders are *worse* for the economy because they pay less taxes and make less money available to the economy by keeping their money tied up and not spending it.  

I also think you have to look at the totality of circumstances in raising capital through new equity issuance.  In my view, there is a big difference between issuing stock to raise funds to complete a strategic merger/takeover that will quantitatively benefit shareholders and issuing stock to raise money to pay debt that accumulated while no revenues were coming in.  

Sure, if AMC actually goes ahead with the issuance and uses the funds to pay off/down their debt and that ultimately keeps them out of bankruptcy, that's a long term win for a shareholder.  Their shares don't go to $0, but they're certainly going to be worth less than the are now by virtue of supply and demand.

All this to say that I think you and the poster you replied to are just looking at this from different perspectives and I don't think either of you are entirely wrong."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yikes bud
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Oh yeah I'm paid by hedge funds... That's why amc is issuing shares too. It's all a big conspiracy. Almost like there was a reason this company was heavily shorted 🤔🤔🤔 good thing there's a ton of idiots that will buy their newly issued shares besides the hedge funds.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You clearly weren't around here in January when it was only GME and than bots flooded this place screaming AMC, Nokia, BB, RKT, UWMC!!

Doggy boins went flying that day. 

It was all a distraction from GME"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"its because they can see the writing on the wall. Major studios streaming all releases to homes the same day as theater debuts was  the final nail in the coffin. Movie theaters wont go away completely, but they probably wont ever be the same."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Have you ever gone to the movies in the last 10 years without knowing what movie you wanted to go see? Everyone decides they want to go see a movie, looks at the list finds one that they want to go see, and then goes. But even before the pandemic often people wouldn't find a movie they actually wanted to go see and then they wouldn't go. Right now it's a movie desert out there there's never a good movie to see, so no one goes. You can advertise all you want but if they don't have movies people won't go.

Also of note, is I've never really seen movie theaters advertise themselves. It just isn't something that's done."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have nowhere near that clout, this is a 5 to 10 billion dollar company, even if 10% of the Wall Street bets members invested that would be a million people, they would have to average 2-5,000 each. And all vote together"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol even taking the argument of the dude arguing with you, so Netflix or Amazon will pay  that much for some Oscar nominations? Yeah seems like smart business!

If anything, these threads have really opened my eyes to how conspiratorial and insular people can quickly become on the internet.  

These posts and memes are hilarious but then also you see some people that really treat dd posts on these subs as literal, written gospel. Its weird and reminiscent of religious fanaticism."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Netflix or Amazon have been rumored to looking for a brick and mortar theater chain to buy so their original productions can qualify for Oscar awards
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If they actually do issue the 500 million worth of shares, it probably wouldn't be a bad idea. As an added bonus, AMC's share price getting pounded for issuing new shares and screwing over the people who propped the company up might give the GME holders more resolve to hold and it also might prevent future companies from taking similar dilutive tactics."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They were in trouble long before Covid. Now studios are releasing movies to their streaming services within 5 days of premiere. It will be a smaller market so yes some will fail. AMC? Who knows but I wouldn’t want to hold diluted shares honestly, mainly because I just don’t believe in the company. If you do good for you, your the investor they are looking for. If your in it for a SS hang it up, all these share offerings fucked that idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I wish GME the best . I have a share . But otherwise I'm all in in AMC
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I dont really care what dumb shit people spend their money on, I care however that the sub is flooded with false info. I check amc threads because people being retarded amuses me at times, other times not"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Man you act like everyone holding AMC is holding till retirement. 

I bought it last year for under $4/share. Once I reach a one year mark and lower cap rate gains I’m selling. 

I’m hopeful Q2 or Q3 earnings are encouraging (which is why I’m annoyed they want to dilute further) but if it doesn’t happen I doubled my investment in a year. I’ll take it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah yeah I’ve got a totally different thesis but then again I bought at under $4 last year. Annoyed about the dilution all the same though and agree there’s not enough discussion of it. 

I’m keeping it quiet though because it’s not in my best interest to push this until I exit. I’m sure others who understand the situation do the same."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ah the context was a bit different. If you scroll up the first guy was saying they issued tons of shares lately and then the guy I responded to was saying that one was paying attention to it. 

My point was that no, people *are* paying attention and that dilution earlier in the year was obviously bad news for shareholders. So now they are pissed AMC wants a free reign to issue 500m more shares and are voting no."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To over simplify, GME fundamentals are still undervalued when compared to B&M competitors like bestbuy.  As they transition more to e-commerce and use tech industry multipliers, the upside is even higher.  Ref to chewy, RCs old company.  

Now tack on the free marketing campaign of the squeeze creating millions of loyal, young customers."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,At least use some common sense if you are going to take a stand. What you stated is factually incorrect. Doesn’t matter if there is a hive mind.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">Then you never really liked going to the movies in the first place.

I did but I don't miss it. You can't pretend like the world hasn't changed.

> if 10 bucks a ticket is too much for you, thats understandable, 

So you don't get anything while you're there? Because I specifically mentioned snacks as one of the things I don't miss and you completely ignored it.

>some people are cheap af and or dont like paying for fun.

Neither apply to me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love movies but I love adult content and well thought out plots.  I don’t get excited about stamped out scripts with CGI and green screen super heroes.  That’s so played out it’s boring.

And market makers add liquidity and stability to the market, not short term investors. At most short term investors add volatility (which I guess is fine....). 

I really don't care if AMC adds shares - I never said anything about it. Just don't wine about short-term investors feelings when a company does what companies do"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol you know the studios already took care of that. HBO max and Disney+ will be getting every new box office release the same day they come out in theaters. If you want to invest in movies, invest in DIS or T."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Exactly. I was thinking about AMC as objectively as possible, with my crayon analysis and smooth brain business acumen...there is no real innovation/transformation.

They dropped quite a bit before the pandemic."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Right, but that's where the aforementioned vision/leadership comes in. Gamestop was a dead business model as well to many, ""the next Blockbuster"", but look how a fresh approach can shake things up. Granted, it's far from done and a lot of it is the hype from the short squeeze, but under the hood you can see a lot of things shifting.
AMC needs to attack deals with the major studies and try to get exclusive rights to stream/show the movies. Most studios still have to still stream through a platform as they don't have their own services. I'm sure there are many ways to approach it by people far more intelligent than me but that's a start."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,are you literally retarded? Netflix and Amazon originals have already been nominated and have received Oscars.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Totally agree. AMC leadership has shown its true colors.  Massive bonuses during a pandemic?  Come on.  This is one company that deserves a short.

You do realize most of the “news articles” you see on a daily basis are actually paid advertisements. The CEO wants to make money for his company and himself. Got it. The HF involved want to make money shorting a stock they think is overpriced. Got it. Individual investors are long and short on the stock. Got it. What part of this are you not getting?

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh yeah AMC is still billions in debt and it's extremely worrisome that places like Disney with Disney+ are destroying their exclusivity window by releasing movies direct to stream.

GME on the other hand has more cash in reserve than debt, but their model has been to lower expenses by shuttering stores despite strongly decreasing revenues year by year with a big 21% drop over the past year. 

However the reality is AMC has tried to reinvent itself with better rewards and streaming programs more so than GME which just has way more capital right now and because of the natural pandemic related short term advantages."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmfao not only are you a fucking home dwelling loser. Your a full blown retard as well. Nobody bought $15 AMC here stupid. Your girlfriend must fuck you in the butt at the night.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are agreeing with me: it's the movies! You saw a MOVIE that looked interesting and wanted to check it out. Not a new snack, not a seat, not a ""experience"" you decided there was a movie you wanted to see.

No movies that are enticing, you don't go."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Buy indie movies and sell cheaper tickets? That's your advertising idea?

We are in the indie movie renasance on every streaming service. You want to buy indie movies people already have had the chance to watch and then play them in theaters? Or compete with streaming services to buy new ones? Why buy a new indie movie if they will let you put it in the theater and keep a good portion of ticket sales?

Remember, theaters by and large don't have indie movies because they don't make money with them. They never have. They make money when millions of advertising dollars are spent on a movie to get people in the seats.

You have to remember, theaters are used to about 100 million a week being spent on advertising for movies to draw people into the theaters. 4.9 Billion in 2019 in the US alone.

I don't think AMC needs a few indie movies and some ad dollars."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Its ok kid. Everything will be alright
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thx for the award! My first one
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The movies that were nominated for an Oscar like Roma had to have a theatrical release so they made it a limited run with just the bare minimum of movie theaters to qualify which was a costly expense for them because it didn't have a nationwide release. Netflix and Amazon doesn't want to have to pay other companies to run their movies, they'd rather have everything in house."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We have years of historical data on theaters. Their growth is easy to map out over the last 100 years

There is no transformation happening. They are trying to get to normal. Their normal shareprice was like 20/share before they quadrupled their float.

This is a bad investment. Full stop.

We can talk about how fundamentals dont matter but they are actively killing squeeze potential so hard that we now need to look at fundamentals.

AMC management fucked their shareholders that saved them. They didn't look big picture like GME and took the quick and easy money.

And with the dilution if the price does go to 20 we are saying AMC is coming out of the pandemic 5 times more valuable...wtf?

AMC was a recovery play. You guys are pricing it in like a transformation play."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's true, I'd be a lot more sympathetic if the CEO was tightening his belt along with everyone else."

Maybe try stepping outside dude"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What are you talking about??? I never said anything otherwise

Edit: I actually didn't even mention short vs long term tax, so what are you smoking?? Will you share?

Lol, love when trolls just delete their comments & move on..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No you said people know what move before they travel to a theater. I just said every time I went was on impulse only, while near a theater. Those are opposites

I would’ve gone in for any interesting looking movie. Interesting isn’t a high bar

And they’d have to market it, in a way that’s never been done"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look this is all overall based on my belief that experienced based businesses and hospitality will see huge boom when everything fully opens up

Every pandemic saw a huge boom after. I think experience is how that will take form in our current time period

So all I’m saying is it is very *possible* for them to capitalize being the biggest chain in the US"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"They’ve never beeen allowed to own them, because of conflict of interest with studios and theaters.

But now that laws gone. Indie movies aren’t profitable to make, but often times you can buy the rights for less than they cost to make, cause they’d rather something than nothing

From their it’s all about driving them impulse to sit back and watch a movie on location"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You guys are both fucking rarted.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"you must be actually retarded if you think Netflix or Amazon would buy AMC. I'm so sorry I didn't realize.

By the way they already changed that rule, theatrical releases are no longer necessary - just look it up."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Did you find the meaning of life after reading all my posts? Pray tell!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They are not going to add 500 million more shares. This is a proposal. If they actually added 500 million shares the stock would go through the fucking floor and they would go out of business. It would be a completely moronic move. But the narrative is trying to be pushed that it’s already a done deal.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Damn it you browsed my Reddit history!! Oh noooo!

Lmfao your a god damn joke buddy, you prob didn't find much since I spend my time outdoors instead of reddit. Sucks to be you, and sucks to be whoever lives with you. Your one boring mother fucker ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|thumbs_down)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Long term 5-10 seems realistic, but the price will sure go up after the pandemic for a brief period due neither transformation, fundamentals or a squeeze, but due to hype. I'm pretty confident in that, so yeah, as an ""investment"" in the sense of long term investment it's a bad idea. But it'll go up when pandemic ends, i'm quite sure about that. There will not be a lot of growth be happening, but I also think that their numbers won't drop like they did historically. Like with a car, when you get yourself that fancy new lambo, it loses a third or more of it's value over a few years, but when you buy an old polo who drives but that's it, you get it for 500 bucks and can sell it again for 500 bucks if it still drives. By now (w/o 'rona) , people only go to the movies because they want to got to the movies for the feeling and because that' s the only way to watch most productions w/o having to wait for half a year until it's released on DVD. And that won't change any time soon i think"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Just like archego (this part was a joke, but not really). Were as now that I look more closely at the option chains for AMC, they are not as high volume as I expected, especially when compared to GME or TSLA. I am sure there are plenty of naked shares though, even after January, with there being a big spikes in Call options at $21 and $29 per share. The problem at this point is getting that high."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">Why would AMC even offer shares if not to raise capital?

They wouldn't..... In 2019 they had ~100M shares..and the peak share price in 2016 was $35. If they sell another 500M that will bring their total to close to ~1B shares. 10x what it was at its prior peak. If a shareholders goal is to try and save the business ok. If their goal is to make a return then it sucks for the shareholders."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,No. I think they're trying to raise capital to pay interest payments.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They can make money now the theaters are open. Sell alcohol that will boost sells 🤣😇
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Did you go by yourself? Solo movie yours is a very small market. 

Are you saying that you are in the area and thought you might want to see a movie so you saw what was playing and then you decided to go to the theater? Are you saying you literally went into the theater without knowing what movie you wanted to see yet?

I guess I don't want to say that no one goes into a theater without knowing what they want to see, rarely do groups of people do that. I suppose it was fairly common for people on dates to go into the theater and then try to decide which movie they wanted to see. But that's sort of behavior is going to be very infrequent after people show up and don't have a good movie to see.

I also think that in general at least one member of the party is trying to go see a specific movie."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It's literally been talked about for several years at this point. With both Amazon and Netflix being potential purchasers, Amazon almost bought Landmark theatres in 2018 but they got sold to the Cohen group instead. I never said it was happening as a certainty just that the interest in one of them buying a theatre chain historically has been there for years now. Perhaps you just haven't paid attention."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hold
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It will bump to $8
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m super new this is like my second time buying options I don’t know how to roll calls in Robinhood... does that mean just sell them for the .08 then use those funds towards the purchase of may calls?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,HOLDING UNTIL AT LEAST MONDAY!!!!!!!! (on account of the fact that it's the anniversary of jesus's crucifixion)

2021-04-01 21:22:20,wallstreetbets,"(DD) ASO options ladder is enticing, high short interest + good earnings This data is based off of ShortSight, paid real time short data from S3 partners.

As we can see, in the last few weeks, short interest in ASO spiked to \~44%.

https://preview.redd.it/t98kwbfwflq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5c15011205d06acd072aa2d039288dad69dd71d4

ASO killing earnings on 3/30:

* All time high net income, 157% increase y/y
* 311% increases y/y on adjusted net income
* .97 EPS, for a 304% increase y/y

I see this as a reopening play + potential for a gamma squeeze.

**Gamma squeeze + pressure on shorts to close**

As we've seen w/ stocks like GME, options provide more leverage than holding shares for moving a stock's price. If there are a chain of strike prices w/ high open interest and we manage to get close to the first link in that chain (in this case, $25 was the first link, while at the time of writing it is now $28.34), it can cause a reaction where MM need to delta hedge these options by buying shares (as they want to stay delta neutral and just make money off premiums), which increase the stock's price, which lets us hit the next link in the chain, etc. etc.

Forbes has a good article that explains this concept when applied to GME: [https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/](https://www.forbes.com/sites/georgecalhoun/2021/03/10/gamestop-the-second-surgeanatomy-of-a-gamma-swarm/).

As we can see, open interest is also high on options (ex: 19000 calls on 4/16 for $30).

https://preview.redd.it/2ph9enq8hlq61.png?width=570&format=png&auto=webp&s=5f7105dc532cce8fc36164931e890c51656b9c65

If the stock can near/hit $30, it will squeeze upwards due to the delta hedging by MMs. This will be exacerbated by the high short interest of 43%, all borrowed when the stock was at a lower price (\~$23), shorts will feel high pressure to cover in order to minimize losses if this stock trends upwards.

**Reopening play**

Dicks Sporting Goods no longer sells guns in Texas. As people go out more / reignite their hobbies, ASO will receive more business as now it is in position to be a primary seller of guns. Even as a long term hold (instead of playing the options chain) this seems like a good play.

**The play**

I think there's potential for a gamma ladder squeeze on the call options priced for 4/16. The open interest is there, the catalyst is there (run up in stock price due to amazing earnings), and there's the additional high short interest which means if things moon, they'll moon even harder. The options right now are reasonably priced for this date as well.

**The bear case**

The earnings report isn't enough to drive this stock near 30$ by 4/16. Another catalyst doesn't come, or the market in general corrects (as we are at ATH). In this case, the call option ladder will fail to materialize.

**Positions:**

200 4/16C w/ $30 strike price."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Anyone have a realistic PT for this if it were to trigger a lil squeeze, or an idea for its true valuation? I mean, Dick's is trading for around $79, and they don't sell guns in Texas ... Also, given the fact that it's heavily shorted and there's a ton of institutional ownership, I'm wondering if it's not too late, and if I should scoop up some 35c 4/16 on Monday. I'll probably  buy shares as well just in case. 

Currently sitting on some 30c 4/16s that I scooped up during the dip today, and I'm confident they'll print. Just don't want to get burned by the theta decay like with RKT."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,A gamma ladder squeeze.... new terms every day
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"There’s so many issues with this “DD”. Your entire thesis is based off high open interest can cause a gamma squeeze. Open interest is just a number that totals all open contracts for a stock. It doesn’t mean all those call contracts open are on the buy side. They could be on the sell side too. MM’s process both buy and sell orders for market participants.

Also, MM’s make money off the bid-ask spread. Not premiums.

This is not good DD."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is it too late boys? if it is lemme know
2021-04-01 21:11:57,wallstreetbets,I keep buying dips and holding! 🦍💎🙌 
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ooof big ooof, don't be on a margin account with GME. That's a rookie mistake"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Ily
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Type Margin 😅
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Click the middle button under all those red numbers and keep going
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe don’t buy the space suit on margin
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Don't forget red since purchase, kinda important around here"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What do you mean?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You get to borrow on margin against the equity you have in your account in cash or investment up to a certain percentage.  For example if you have 1000 bucks in investments you get to borrow another 800 bucks to buy more stocks. If the price of those stocks go down and value of your investment is too small to borrow 800 you have to either deposit money or sell your stocks and pay back some of the money you borrowed until you’re back to the same ratio.  So they can force you to sell at a loss when the broker wants their money back.  They get the money they loaned no matter what and you can lose the money you started with when maybe you wanted to wait for the stock to come back up.  You can’t 💎✋a volatile stock on margin.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's implied.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,you can request level 2 without margin if you want to start getting the hang of it

2021-04-01 21:02:09,wallstreetbets,"Why uwmc is a great buy at this price Uwmc share price has been falling ever since the Russell inclusion confusion. It sitting near its 52 week low rn at 7.83. There’s no way this stock should be this low with he good it’s financials are and how good the housing market is going rn and will continue for at least another year. They just did a 700 million note offering that was supposed to available til April 7th but had already been bought up by the largest banks with J.P. Morgan buying the biggest percentage. This is very good for uwmc. Now another reason why the stock is trading low is because of shorts and no it will not have a short squeeze. Most of the daily volume from the last 2 weeks had been shorts. My theory is they are keeping the share price lower to get a bigger dividend bc it free money. The dividend pay date is April 6th. And most analysts have a price target above 10 but we all know analysts sacks of shit but on this one they are right for once. Overall I think uwmc is a very safe investment right now bc it’s bottomed out and volume has been low for the past couple weeks and once volume picks up the price will start to increase.

Positions: 15 5/21 10c

Houses on the cheap.

High class urban is where it gets expensive.

That’s where people come to you and more than likely will default on rent without a major job. Because it’s too high class. And it’s easy to get a credit card.

My advice is to play poker online with like $100 for a couple months. It's great practice for position sizing. I always lose in the long run but i can make $20 last 2months because I only ever risk $1-2 on a poker game. TIME is actually an important but overlooked element to any betting strategy. If I have 20 bets i won't use them all on the same day, I make sure to wait 1 day if I lose $1-2. The strategy means when you win every day you are also adding profits to your cash pile. It's always better to make $1 a day for 5 days in a row, rather than risk the full $20 on a single day. Hope this makes sense, good luck.

Personally with the housing market the way it is right now where I am I might sell my house ans take all the profit and invest it and take 100% interest only loan. Keep paying the principal but instead of to the bank to my financial advisor and let that money work for me. Even at 7% over 10 years without adding anything else to it you should double your money. It has its risks and that type of loan would only be available to someone like you with enough capital in your portfolio"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Earlier 20’s making 145kish.

I would ask what you do but I honestly think if I do the IRS would be on your ass like grass. Lmao

145k a year. Where you at Cali? They taxing you to death. Nah, congrats and fuck you.

But anyway. Im a scientist man. The issue with america and rental property is that those “bumfuck” nowhere places soon become important after people in Cali government fuck shit up and people bitch.

Then instead of fixing it, they move to “bumfuck” nowhere and suddenly your property is worth a hell of a lot more than it is now.

Texas, Florida. Look at them.

Good gov, good legislation. Boom. Property boom.

Till people fuck with it, and fuck it all up till they have nowhere to run and we end up killing each other out of pure rage and hate for dumbassery. Till then they will run, run, run like locusts. Hopefully not screwing the good things up. But if you know people, often times they fuck with shit they shouldn’t.

And nature bites them in the ass.

And it’s not even that republicans are better people either they are shit too. It’s just the fact they are better with money than dreamy spend spend spend spend democrats.

They know the money game. They plan accordingly. They fuck us. But not as hard as pulling the rug out from under us. Instead a few jabs with a knife you see coming and it’s over like that till the next time.

Honestly I don’t like politics, I stand in the middle. 

But even I can see that red states are better than the assfucked states that are blue.

They defunded police in even some cities that are blue.

DEFUNDED THE POLICE. How fucking idiotic can one be?

Oh a world without government! A world without taxes....yeah, sure. When people stop looting and shooting let me know player. Fucking hell..... what the fuck they think would happen. Mary would find her little lamb without a glock shoved up her ass?

Anyway, I’m on a tangent, point is you should look for property with the best value and potential. In states with good legislation and ideals that know what the fuck they are doing.

Me? First chance I get. Apartment complex. 1 mil.

Maybe a few side gigs.

But uh, dont fuck yourself in the ass. Do your research.

Same age as you. Not making 145. But then again IRS isn’t on my ass and I’m saving peoples lives so fuck everyone in my way. Lmao

Would also advise making 400k or less a year.

Higher tax. You want to avoid that.

And no LLC until you have more than a few houses.

The fees aren’t worth the squeeze unless your didn’t vet your renters unless they are out to fuck you with false claims.

Apartment complex? 8-20k month LLC. No shit. It’s worth the squeeze if filled.

Would also advise you consult with a lawyer and make up rules and regulations for the property and it’s fees and damages.

There’s a lot out there to help with that from real experts if you know where to look.

You want to have the legal documents and shit worked out for every scenario especially if they don’t pay.

Before you even find such people. Make a plan, plan it, find experts to help and do it.

Hell, I’d even help out but I’m sure you’d want all the income for yourself. Lol

Anyway, that’s my two cents."

The one thing your plan doesn't account for is risk.  The reason that mortgage money is available to you in the first place is because banks value loaning that money to you over just using their even better financial advisors to use it in the stock market."

Interest rate on the loan will be lower than the capital gains tax + gains on the underlying so it seems like a no brainer.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I didn't give you any advice in my comment.  I was just critiquing the idea that you presented of currency only possessing whatever power over you that you give it.  I was saying there's many circumstances where that statement wouldn't hold up, which means when you evaluate the validity of that claim (money only possessing the power you give it) it simply isn't true in many circumstances.  The power money has over your behavior is directly related to the severity/priority of what it's presence/absence will yield.  The statement is too simple to explain the relationship that people have between themselves and currency.  Currency allows people to acquire healthcare services, food and shelter, that's the baseline, when those critical aspects are threatened for themselves (and whatever they consider their family/tribe) then money has a good deal of power of the individual regardless of their choice.  This doesn't mean that they have to be unhappy, it is just that money does hold a lot of power as they have to dedicate themselves to its acquisition in some way regardless if they want to or not.

An obvious example, if you have a child who requires an expensive surgery of some form for their survival, in instances like this money has TREMENDOUS power over you without you deciding it does or not.  In scenarios like this, it would be like telling a starving person ""food only has the power over you that you give it"".  Yes it only has power over you that you give it, but often you don't have a choice how much power you give it because the result of said money and successful acquisition/loss of it could rob you of things you find to be the most important in life.  I'm just saying there's a lot of cases where you actually don't have a choice how much power it has when it no longer becomes optional.  The power money has over us is directly correlated to how much it is needed for things we consider a necessity.

I get what you're saying, the try to enjoy life regardless, money comes and goes aspect.  I'm just saying that the relationship between people and currency is much more complex than that and currency itself is a system of power which controls critical parts of our lives that are directly correlated to our survival.

&#x200B;

I don't what you mean by ""I'm guessing you've still only ever been on the one side of this feeling"".  I've struggled for long periods, done very well in others.  That isn't really relevant to what I had said either way though cause you can critique the validity of a statement by seeing if the statement remains true under differing conditions.  Doesn't have anything to do with how financially well you are/aren't doing cause I'm not really advocating for anything in my own self interest, just evaluating an abstract idea."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Nah your good, specifically?

Small cities near the big cities in Ohio, Montana, etc etc

You look at the land out there, those houses.

People moving out of cities. It’s a lucrative idea.

Especially with inflation hitting us in the next couple of years as I have researched that the gov will fuck us all to save themselves.

It’s only a matter of time, trillions of debt who can pay without inflation? Not Americans, not even musk. So property is a fail safe to that.

But yeah, to top this off. The country may have no ideal 145k or my kinda work. But.... it does have the peace and quiet so many people crave. And if the exodus continues. They will move out there close to the cities but far enough to feel safe.

Plus I’m seeing this in my own town and nearby towns. As properties rise and rise. Soon they’ll fall maybe in June. Due to the mandate being up.

But they are rising to demand.

Build, build, build for the calis with big money moving here. Destroy the beautiful farm land crate a shitty city meant to crumble over time to crime and sin.

Not great to see but I learn to deal.

Just waiting for the inevitable housing crash.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Laws were a concept made up by man as well but they also exert power we have little to no say in.  I'm just stating that the existence of and societal acceptance of currency as the primary means to acquire resources exerts varying degrees of involuntary power on everyone to some degree or another.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"And I'm saying it only exerts the power you have over it. At one point I was going to shoot up north and live in a forest for a year. I get your point.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Thanks! I needed to read this. Got 8 gme shares cause it's all I got hope for. Rocket emotis and diamond hands.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I feel like you didn't really get what I said because you're still asserting that I'm trying to convince YOU of having a different mentality.  I'm not saying that the sentiment can't be true for you and the conditions which you currently exist, I'm saying that said conditions vary by circumstance, that the power money holds over us fluctuates based on various conditions, which I think is a pretty reasonable assertion.  To say that a single line catch phrase without specific conditions outlined has summed up the relationship between survival, currency and the individual in all conditions is something that no person has ever been able to do except maybe for a small handful of physicists because the matters they deal in are so general.

I think you're misinterpreting me as some free market capitalist that is saying ""you must submit to the power of money"" but that's not remotely what I'm saying.  I'm a Marxist in many regards theoretically.  I dislike the current state of global capitalism and its extreme irrationality and advocate for movement towards more rational forms of production.  The idea that all power exerted by currency is voluntary is a fairytale for anyone trying to live in an ethical manner though, to deny that it has any power or impact over your behavior is false (we're literally on a gambling subreddit, if money had zero power over us, we wouldn't be here in the first place).  Someone who is having to take care of their children, sick, elderly, etc can't just ""shoot up north and live in a forest for a year"".  Again, I'm not trying to convince YOU to think differently, I'm not telling YOU not to do those things, I'm not saying anything about you and your behavior or your mindset not being true for the circumstances in which you exist.  I'm saying that your statement, when evaluated in a general non-specific sense, under certain conditions, such as where an individual has people who heavily depend on them for survival, is false because the need for resources is very real even if the goal is to reduce the need for currency (which typically requires resources to ensure initial acquisition of resources needed for an autonomous life).  In certain circumstances like that abandoning the pursuit of resources and the involuntary power it holds for their own selfish reasons means unethically abandoning others who are dependent on you which many are not willing to do because they don't view those things as optional which is often rooted in deep biological/psychological truths of our operation.  The statement is heavily dependent on certain other conditions remaining true for its validity to hold up, to say that your sentiment holds up unequivocally for all people regardless of these conditional variants is just kind of absurd.  That isn't really an opinion even, it's literally just an abstraction of the interactions between the responsibilities one has to one's self, tribe/group of loved ones and currency."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Who is this man...and how can I meet him?!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,These comments are making me realise that some people around here actually *are* retarded
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t banned!,!,!🤑🤑🤑"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Show some FUCKING respect to u/chainsaw_vasectomy
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy fuck. I recognize this guy - 4 years ago me and my friends got him to do a birthday message for a buddy. He’s the exact same In every way.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Welp... I fell hard for that one 🤷🏼‍♀️
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,LMAO
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought he was going to say ""haha, you got FUCKED!"""
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Holy shit you guys are retarded.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I thought it was funny. Webull has paper trading competitions all the time so I wouldn't have joined and I would be insanely mad if I somehow scored big but it wasn't real lol. Didn't get the Hawaiian shirt thing. Whys everyone digging on him, because he's older? I thought it was pretty cool to see the diversity of this crowd. Id like to see who at his age still has humor and laugh like that still, and engages in reddit pranks ."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I went short on wsb users for this edition of the paper trade contest. Guess I did allright.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So a lot of new gay people?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Hahaha, nice. I must have just missed the last competition because I didn't know this was a prank...although I was certainly raising an eyebrow for why the mods (gay) were encouraging banned behaviour.

Can't wait til next year."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm truly retarded. I've been lurking on this sub for about 2 years and I have either forgotten about the competitions or didn't see them. This is the best place ever. Now ban me
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"yes, ban me senpai"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Got me one year hhaha
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,###BUT WHY DO YOU ONLY HAVE 1 SHIRT u/CHAINSAW_VASECTOMY!?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Hawaiian Shirts"" Pepperidge Farm 'Members"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The butthurt is strong... again...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was gonna sign up but then i thought why would i waste time signing up and papertrading when i can use real money and pretend in paper trading.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Got emmmm
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So am I a banned retard or a retarded ban?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Every time I open wsb I see this old fuck and laugh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fucking funny shit and you’re adorable don’t care what any of those other apes say.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Who's auntie is this?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,mods please stop making daily gme thread. let them go on the normal daily thread and get downvoted to oblivion 😌
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Some of these cry babies need to go for good
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"To be fair, most of us who signed up did so because we thought we'd get a run down on options trading. Well i did anyway. GME brought me here but it's not what keeps me here."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Some of you’ve never been hazed and it shows,

Taking the path of least resistance will often get your position vaporized, this was an important lesson nonetheless.  Toughen the fuck up if you want to survive in this market. 

Bravo grande to the mods, LONG LIVE THE MODS!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao get rekt
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Got em! (again)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Is that joe biden?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know what, I feel just a bit betrayed but that's what I get.

Full disclosure I signed up after the post was linked on the GME megathread and the part excluding people with brokerage accounts was removed and had formated it wrong, probably saving me. I then panicked and deleted it when I saw this post, but honestly that defeats the point of this. I should have read the post more and instead I fucked up

Fair is fair, come get me"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What an old fart! Right guys???
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Get stickbugged nerds
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I legit thought he had a heart attack mid video.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Heh, after all the hype from the OGs about the paper trading competition I was really disappointed I couldn't participate or even comment.

Edit:  Wait, we don't get banned for commenting in this thread,  do we?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Do I have a flair now?

edit: no I don't"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I bet this grandp fucks and is holding GME 💎🤲🦍🚀
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The Hawaiian shirt and jeans at the end killed me.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This guy fucks!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"So, Hawaiian shirt futures?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is great. I read the post and thought they were totally shitposting - so I “joined” to be an ass! Ha ha! Lesson learned? 🤷🏼‍♀️
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Words can't express how much I love this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Christ, its like Richard Dreyfus and Wilford Brimley fuzed together."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This mofo has craziest eyes and I’m certain has something just off camera that he should be in jail for.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Amazing. I’m crying paper tears right now.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a little weirded out by how funny I actually found this.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Is this fucking real

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I love this fucking retard. He's like my Grandpa
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The shitposters are younger than I thought.

Love it!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Test again
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You know, this whole thing is actually very educational. I am sure everyone who fell for it will learn something out of it. Do your DD properly guys. The market fucks around hard than this."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"hey I don't own a Hawaiian shirt, can I wear a tie-dye shirt instead?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lmao reading the original thread has me in tears
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, how high are you? Follow up question : Will you share?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I never knew this sub was run by wise people.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He’s wholesome. I love it.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Are we gonna be banned if we wear a hawaiian shirt next Friday?  The paper trading I get, but the clothes?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’ll take a hit of whatever he’s on.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""...sightke, you got banned. A guh guh guh""."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Bro can you get off my feed so I don’t have to keep scrolling past an old man saying chainsaw vasectomy over and over?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,This is hilarious and creepy af.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I am 17 and ready to blow all my fake money on GME calls and $DICK. TO THE FUCKING MOON, GENTLEMEN

EDIT : Just found out this was a trap, not deleting and accepting my temp ban like a man, cuz i ain't a paperhanded BITCH"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What a gross old man
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Been a member for over a year, love interacting in this community on a daily basis yet im getting banned bc i signed up for competition i half way read and just did bc it seemed fun. What a funny joke. 1-2 day tempban is funny but 1 year is fucking stupid."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Fuck you mods. I thought the competition seemed suspiciously out of character.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,So..... I just smoked a jammer outside and I dont know if this is just me but.........  Im kinda feeling this this guy is a right fucking bellend.  Correct me if wrong.   It kinda killed my high man.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I knew a paper trading competitions was too intelligent to be on this sub.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"all i know is the phrase ""chainsaw vasectomy"" is getting added to my short list"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Haha I didn’t fall for it and I’m new here hagahahdaaagghaahaaaaaaaaaaaajaaaa 


GgaaaaaaAHAHA"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Man I thought the second paper trading competition was a joke and decided to join the 3rd one for some reason and I deserve it. Paper Trading is for the kids. Ain't no paper hand
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Shit like this is why I hodl
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,is this creepy old man really a mod or this a prank?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You don’t need WSB to paper trade, you can [use this platform](https://youtu.be/cvh0nX08nRw)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well, now I can go back to buying my AMD weeklies in peace, at least, after GME moons"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,🖕😂🖕
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,lol yall doing the lords work on april fools
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""The paper trap"" Lol how did they not figure it out."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Laughing at all these smooth brains who signed up and didn’t even think nothing fishy about it.  😂😂
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m just happy that this guy is still alive and doing videos. Thanks for the laugh you funny fucker
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,HE CANT KEEP GETING AWAY WITH IT!!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Idk what everyone's issue is, I wanna adopt this Ape specifically"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah I fell for the old “paper trade ban” when I was new, (thankfully the “ban” was very short) After that I grew some balls and started taking risks and my life is exponentially better because of it.

Adapt and survive, don’t be the curmudgeon that just complains because “this seems like a bait and switch” or “the mods on some power trip” because that isn’t true. If you don’t want to take 5 minutes and read the DD in the comments to truly learn the lesson here, you fucking deserve to be banned."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I never read first comment it's usually beneath me tbh
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"9.7mil still the count on the sub OP, any chance we can get a count on the number of rejected degenerates"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I have been banned in my main account. When will you be removing the ban? I got a message it was for 69 days.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ngl, I fell for it. Cuz comments sent me to Mikey Millions Kamikaze Cash on YouTube, where he explains options and the Greeks, and plays.  He has a dozen videos on a $3k competition.  Thought this was legit. Whatever, The vids are good and I recommend them before trying options."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"it's pretty great how salty ppl are, and how many believe that guy is a mod."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It’s a temporary ban, y’all are welcome back. Half of this sub has been banned at one point or another (pre GME)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Lol, how the fuck you been here two years and not know about the paper trade joke?  Stick around and see all the suckers we get next year."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How could you not know about the competition, if you been active for so long."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If you knew options and finance well enough to create an algorithm you wouldn't be in GME. Theta always wins
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,there's some delicious salt in here.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You misspelled 'sexy as the days I first laid eyes on him'.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"We don't paper trade here.  If you don't trust your DD enough to spend money, inverse the DD and spend some fucking money."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Isn’t this the [peanut butter sammich guy](https://youtu.be/QaYF9hwoaBY)?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," Yeah your personal strategy is shit. No doubt you hold like .4 shares.

This sub is for options bets. Get absolutley fucked"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"lol how did you post this

Edit: nvm, it seems clear that it took a few hours for the bans to go out. it's hilarious to see all the dead men walking in this thread."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those ""jokes"" are terrible"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"OMFG WE BANNED THE CRAMER JOKE GUY!!?!! YASS!!

Thank you mods. Today you have done us all a huge service."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You mad bro?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah if u don’t actively trade (big dick trades) get the fuck outta here. We aren’t here for your entertainment, try r/funny"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,TF is this?  was there a comment this was a reply to?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"""Hi, it's Chainsaw Vasectomy again"" is a phrase I was not prepared to hear come out of this old guy's mouth"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Why so angry Jessica?

I have 100 shrs of GME.

If this sub is for options only, then some needs to send another memo.

I can get fucked whenever I want. How 'bout you? 🤔

Happy Easter sweetheart

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You’re gonna need a bigger infinity gauntlet...
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You must work for Facebook
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,But you did learn something. You learn not to trust random post on the internet.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You called?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"No, no you didn’t come back and respond. Do you seriously have 💩 for brains or are you the 🌈🐻 that we 𓀐𓂺 for tendies? I will be waiting behind Wendies for my blowy. Don’t be late to start your shift."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I choose to believe that this is all an elaborate satire account and no real person would ever post a comment like that.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Try seven years. Before 1983 most computers didn't have a standard way to communicate with one another. Even after that for a long while the internet was a lot more like a Dos Interface, it wasn't until the 90s when the internet began to take shape in a way much more familiar to what we see around today."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,If there's one thing that should be immediately obvious to any new comers is that the people here take bets very seriously. What's even the point in paper trading?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Preach! In it to win it!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Finally, we're culling the Apes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah but then they'll just come back on their alts so it probably won't make much of a difference.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol what about this sub where everyone is gambling and calling each other retards made you think it was a good place to learn?

Show Positions or ban.

You are getting fucked with your ""100"" shares you probably bought at 480

Again. Positions or ban puuuuusssssyyy"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Under a million we weren't struggling for content.  GME brought the vast majority here, but if they're only here for that, the point of this sub isn't really for them.

If you want to keep wsb the way it was, the new users need to transition to the old culture.  Which many have.  If people just want to talk about GME all day they can make their own sub.  You don't see people joining /r/carsfuckingdragons and telling them they need to change their content."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Good so do the paper trading thing and fucking ban the people who arent yoloing on fds its not that fucking hard. Sounds like r/investing is a better place for u

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Came here because I heard of GME. GME too much for my poor ass with no savings so I bought AMC then I got into NOK then weed stocks. They all went to shit. Then I saw everyone win at yolo FDs and they got 2800%+ returns and I got into option trading. They all went to shit. I'm still here 2 months later at almost breakeven. Also I got a 90% portfolio for GME now and everything else goes into option trading.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,What is unfair given the boom?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I’ve been selling AMC options but currently too poor to get into the GME game. Next time...

Also next time maybe I’ll reply to the correct comment."

Still, I feel like we've reached new heights, and those standards should be more like $20k and $100k, respectively."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’d like to petition to get banned for a yr. So that when GME goes to the moon I can gloat about all my tendies. 👐🏼💎🚀 oh and fuck you mods.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thats why I think the paper trading competition is a great filter. If a tardlet falls for it, takes it on the chin and laughs it off then we have a great new member of the community. If they get super unironically aspie and start ranting and screeching, well at least they are banned and will probably get bored and find some other niche"

GME is not the best play out there, it's already been played.  The IV is not worth the risk reward at this point.  You could've made a fortune on costco calls just this past few weeks.

The culture here is not really to help out newbies, other subreddits are better for that."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Since alot of retards here don’t understand the GME hype and haven’t read any DD about it, they just shit on it and have became some sort of elitist bitches. Really fucking cringe because i’ve been on this sub for like 3 years and there was another vibe in here. Really sad stuff considering that it was my favorite subreddit. GME is a game changing opportunity, where rules will be changed in our favor. Shitting on it is shitting on the retail investor. Self harming ignorant elitists. It’s cool to make jokes, but now it’s time to get serious, hedgefunds are finally attacked and it was about time."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Well... Yeah. This sub is basically a casino a ""sure thing"" machine is definitely a scam"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I was giggling like a schoolgirl reading the thread.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I thought there was only r/dragonsfuckingcars !
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,There is only one type of content that’s the problem. You know there are other stocks where you can make more money than GME?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I own GME, so do plenty of people here. I do not want to see a million posts about GME everyday. This sub used to be a wild place where people yolo’d their life savings into totally retarded shit and the memes that came from that were gold. There was also solid DD on everything, better than you can find in most places. Now it’s just a bunch of normies saying cringey shit and posting the same regurgitated rocket memes with ape this ape that. It was funny for a month but now it’s getting old.

If y’all want to talk GME day in day out make your own sub. It has ruined the goldmine of what this sub once was."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"> GME is our stock

If you weren't invested in GME or part of WSB prior to January then it isn't your stock or your sub. You're a colonist with millions of others here now, not a native. And I really don't mean to sound pretentious, but I was one of those people in since last fall, part of this sub since the March crash last year, made a killing off GME in the squeeze and moved onto other plays, which is what WSB is about - finding great plays in a market full of stocks and making very risky and leveraged trades on them, usually via options. It is not about bagholding shares in a single company and posting about it daily, chasing an exceedingly rare event which already happened.

If you want to hold GME, do so in silence. There is no reason for a million posts about one single ticker on the homepage. None. No justification outside of another squeeze. All it does is crowd out better content. There could legit be another GME play in another ticker and none of the dumb apes would know about it because to them the stock market is one stock.

I welcome newbies, but the reality is more people need to lurk. I made $140k off GME and didn't feel the need to post a thread about it. Now someone simply *buys shares*, posts a screenshot and gets thousands of upvotes.

This is how subs are killed and all the OGs which made it great flee elsewhere."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because it's not.

It is a great play sure. But I'd rather swing trade it daily due to high volatility than chant like Retards."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lmao you are stupid ape —> this is the position you take when you jerk the other apes off 🦧
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,That chart doesnt show exact months though. But you can see at the very end of 2020 we were still under a million subs. About 8 million people showed up here strictly from gme media coverage for sure
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Massive difference in one major thing.

Options have expiration dates and cab go to zero a million times faster than shares. 

Ask yourself what was the last company to be fully deposited and go bankrupt? And how fast did it happen? Shareholders have countless opportunities to make out with even a shred of thier initial investment. 

When it comes to options, if you aint itm and it's the day of your expiration you'll be lucky to get a buck for em at best. 

When you write them you can then be responsible for the shares they allow to purchase at the price, which when assigned can make your shit go negative in an instant.  

None of this happens in the share game, options are purely gambling. 

Think of it as a casino. When you bet s hand of black jack to you get opportunities to buy your way out of the hand and still keep some money? No, you knew the risk when you got there, the casino lives on, take your lesson and share bullshit and head on out. It's time to get back to weekly otm yolos"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"If you’re banned, how would you gloat?  You do realize that everyone that didn’t join this sub in February already made their GME tendies?"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think you might be reading it wrong, the sub crossed a million in early 2020. By the end of 2020 it was almost 2 million."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Half these retards in here don't do research and weight their options they see a DD that looks sophisticated and buy the ticker lol
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Actually this past year I’ve been betting certain stocks would not go bankrupt and beat covid, aero, cruises and theaters. It was a “safer” bet than options especially since I’ve tried to cover the board vs trying to learn options but a huge chunk had/has the possibility of bankrupting. Gme was a bet also along those lines but I felt more confident with 3 game systems no one could get their hands on. Bets nonetheless because all were risky with no end in sight last summer."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[removed]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I literally couldn't care less. Apparently, I can be banned for things I said about you in my last post. That kind of makes my point about this sub changing for me."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yup, diamond hands became a thing when we were buying SPY puts at the bottom of the market last March and holding them into April while fighting JPow and his money printer. I lost so much being a gay bear too late into the correction, but some people made an absolute killing off SPY puts for a week or so. The diamond hand meme was about holding your position as the market moved against you, leading to a major loss. But now it's paraded around as a good thing which is sort of hilarious because the result will likely be the same."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"People laughed at the Wright Brothers, invented that plane any sooner they’d have burned at the stake for witchcraft. Don’t know why GME peeps come in and shit on Blackberry or any other stock that isn’t GME. I bought 10 shares at $22 or so and sold at $115 and was happy, but I’m not touching that stock or company again, even with the awesome executives coming in. Blackberry had a lot going for it and it’s just going to keep getting better. Did I buy $12k of 2/19 and 3/19 calls when the share price was $20 that expired worthless? Sure, the brokerages fucked a ton of people. I still have 1000 shares and have bought a bunch of $30 Jan 22 calls. The prices hardly has to go up much for me to be at even and in the green. Most I bought a few Fridays ago when it dipped to the current price. That’s pretty optimistic and want to grab some $20 calls for then as well. Blackberry is a solid company and will keep adding revenue streams. Not sure if they will sell a big chunk of their patents or keep and license but either way all of the other things they have and involvement in EV.......it’s definitely going to move up in share price throughout the year and beyond. Fuck the haters, BlackBerry’s marketing should help bring people in as too many people still think of cell phones lol."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, I was kicking myself for not selling at the top, too. But how do you ever know? In the past, I've sold other stocks at the ""top"" and then watched them double the next day haha. The stock market is just one big sh!t show."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It takes 5-10 minutes to complete a battery change in this vehicle, once you are in the bay. You might be in line waiting on the bay for upwards of 30 minutes.

People simply don't have that kind of time on their hands. Imagine it took you a half hour to fill up at a gas station because the hose to your gas tank only allowed in gas very, very slowly. Would you buy such a vehicle?

Now, I'm not a rocket scientist, but I'd also note that there are some very enterprising thieves who will be cutting those batteries out of that bay and selling them as junk for drug money. Once you get outside a coercive country like China, which actually prosecutes thieves hard, this business model doesn't work.

Lastly, assume for a moment that your country gets into a military conflict with China. Do you want your car held hostage?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Noise. Any Chinese company is tinged with a bit of “China risk”. However I’m more focused on the demographics. Billions of people with increasing discretionary income will drive massive growth over the long term. Chinese government can try to stifle speech/rights etc but the Chinese consumer wants to consume.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I think gme is going to go flat for ANOTHER DAY. I have been looking at order flow today and volume is RIDICULOUSLY LOW. Like zero volume that’s ZERO with a Z. We’re used to some HF bs but this is a new low for them. Here is what I think is going on and why Ken Griffen is behind it all.

About 2600 years ago a prominent figure emerged in the world and introduced a radical book that would revolutionize the financial world, that’s right the book of exodus. In it they outlined how charging interest should be outright banned. ZERO INTEREST ON EVERYTHING. Housing loans, business loans horse loans ZERO INTEREST. This pissed off the banks as they could no longer charge interest so money was extremely hard to borrow back then. That means only people that were going to 100% pay their loans back would receive loans. The stock market was a snooze fest with relatively low volitility. Banks made no money from loans and had to rely on their steep over draft fee of 14 shekels. As time progressed banks started charging and increasing interest rates. With interest rates banks started betting against businesses hoping they would not be able to pay off their loans and their business would go under. They would borrow inventory from these businesses hoping the business would go under and they would not have to return the inventory when the business closed. Sound familiar? They got greedy until it all came to a head 600 years later when someone was born that was going to reintroduce the preaching of zero interest rates. This man started gaining a following increasing the popularity of charging zero interest. The heads of finance got worried because they were making tons of money from selling off the inventory of these closing businesses that they borrowed. As the man preaching for zero interest rates grew he gained a close following. The banks saw an opportunity and approached one of his disciples about betraying this financial revolutionist to kill the idea of zero interest loans. 2021 years ago today on a Friday their plan was set into action and with their guy on the inside they put this financial guru on a cross. LIKE FUCKING LITERALLY THE GUYS NAME WAS JESUS CHRIST. LIKE FUCK SLAP HIM WITH A 150,000 shmekel fine and ban him from finance for 5 years or something but anyway I digress different times back then. Now your thinking what does this have to do with gme today? Well I’ll tell you. The man that betrayed Jesus’s name? JUDAS FUCKING GRIFFEN. Yeah that bloodline Griffen. This dumbasses plan backfired as Jesus’s following held a holiday for Jesus called Good Friday where the banks would be boring as fuck for a day. Ken Griffen and Judas Griffen both are dumb fucks who got greedy and fucked themselves.

TLDR: Ken Griffens distant relative Judas Griffen got Jesus killed and that’s why today is boring as fuck on the stock market."

And i did look at his past posts. Why the fuck are you all upvoting him? Has he ever told his floor? He seems like a retard who puts many K's into it and sells as soon as it gets to  mildly high level (10k). Im dissapointed in wsb. You support someone who will make it slightly harder to get to 1mil, shame. And if he isnt selling at 10k and not making it slightly harder for us, he sure as hell aint telling us and thats worrying me.

Like seriously do you all blindly upvote everyone who puts sone money in it now? What if he sells at 1000, then its all pointless.. 

Ive been in wsb since 2017 and i know we are fucking stupid as fuck but god damn there is a limit. And ofc there are many new retards, i guess what im saying is wsb is not wsb anymore and man do people upvote dumb shit.

And ofc i never want to hate on fellow ape but show me proof."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,They’re giving you a price which in inferior to the one you would get at any other broker. They fucked their client over when they stopped people from buying GME in January. It’s gonna be very difficult for them to come back and I hope they will go bankrupt soon
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"1) **Loses money, always**: this company was $1 because it nearly went bankrupt.  it keeps losing money

2) Every one else loses money at this: they bought another company in CA for $1.  Not $1/share, ONE ACTUAL DOLLAR.  in their annual report THAT company lost $20 mil and defaulted on its loans.  BLNK picked them up by paying a dollar and assuming the loans.

**3) their chargers suck fat donkey cocks:** very few of their chargers are level 3 (super chargers).  the whole portfolio are slow ass level 2 chargers.  Takes high end skill and $$ to do level 3s.   level 2's are cheap an easy but charge a sedan at only 25-40 miles per hour.  Whose bothering to stay parked that long?  

If some one needs charging away from their home, they need level 3 or GTFO.  level 3 can charge 150+ miles per hour.  

**3) Competition: Any one can do this.** Its easy to lose money doing this, and no lack of idiots trying.

4) **EV's don't need public chargers:** When they were founded years ago, the 'affordable' evs ($30-40K) were the leaf and bolt.  80-140 mil ranges.  There were some sales of gasoline powered 'plugin hybrids' (prius prime 25 ev mil range, chevy volt 50 mi ev range).  None of these cars are for sale anymore.  New Ev's are all 200+ mil ranges.  Ev's don't need public chargers anymore

5) **They have very few Level 3 chargers:** yeah yeah, f()CK-all I'm repeating myself.  The ONLY charger an EV driver needs or wants are the fast ones (1 hour or less).  Level 2 chargers are like that busted crazy drunk girl.  You'll smash her if she's right there and an there is an easy post nut exit strategy, but the moment she mentions calling the next day its total ghost mode.

The market just had its drunked frat party night with this loose as a goose drunk 2.  Don't be the simp who's catching feelings.  She's still got the dried bakkaki crust all over her from that last offering.  Just go to the clinic and get tested already and hope you don't wind up in paternity court in 9 months."

anyway, that CME trading simulator was the cleanest trading platform i've ever seen.  i wish they were a real brokerage.  they had all the data you could ask for, all easy to read and right in front of you.  it was like [waffles.finance](https://waffles.finance) meets Webull, and with the Robinhood All Time Performance chart.  

It looks like it's changed since then.  But it was all so intuitive and easy to use.  No matter what brokerage app I use I just feel like I'm chasing the dragon."

Mine was not as scary - in high school he would call me constantly, and sometimes if he was drunk it was really fucked up messages, get his friends involved, went to my bf at the time making up shit. I went to the police with my mom and got some bullshit well we can’t prove it story but we’ll give him a warning. It took years for him to stop. He got married but now he’s recently divorced and lives in my area so he keeps showing up in my Bumble likes now too"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I couldn't find any sources online but I am speculating Tesla and BYD, the BEV market leaders in the US and China market respectively.

BYD has a [partnership](https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201809/06/WS5b909369a31033b4f4654921.html) with Baidu to mass manufacture self driving cars. These cars use Baidu's Apollo platform which is built on top of Blackberry QNX. So I wouldn't rule out the possibility of BYD switching to QNX as the connected cars and self-driving cars platforms becomes consolidated."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I think you are vastly overstating how critical BB is to anyone's EV or IoT operations 🤔🤔
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,bro you're going to be so rich in 2022 maybe earlier
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm so f-$4$ thrill
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"This is very funny. If BB have been doing security and IOT since I’ve been in diapers, why have they shrunk steadily over the last 10 years? That proves my point. They’re a tech company that can’t compete with other tech companies. And while almost every other company is growing rapidly, and more opportunities exist in their sector than ever before, BB finds a way to shrink. 

Their [annual revenue](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/BB/blackberry/revenue) is 1/20 what it was 10 years ago and less than 1/3 what it was 5 years ago. 

Your “research” is hype. Let me guess what other stocks you own: FSR, RIDE, SOS, ..."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,">p level the playing field for non-Tesla EVs (Tesla's supercharger network has been a key selling poi

Yes, well put!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"How is my research hype when its literally what it is lol.

You're talking about ""more opportunities exist in their sector"" when literally BlackBerry is partnered with 23/25 top EV makers including Baidu, and with AWS developed a first seen marketplace for ev software development."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Because of the way it is presented. As you say, BB has no contracts with Tesla. Tesla has 79% of the market share for EVs in the US now and 21% in China (that’s about doubled in 2020). So claiming they have 23/25 “top EV auto” companies is kind of misleading. It’s likely many of the smaller EV players will fizzle out anyways. Many reports on companies like RIDE, FSR, and NKLA for example are that these companies are smoke and mirrors already. 

It’s good that BB/QNX software will be in vehicles iff (not a typo) these companies are able to compete for market share with Tesla. 

I don’t see it happening. But again, I’m rooting for you guys."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You think getting bought by Apple (getting paid lots of money in the process) is *losing*? One of those companies listed is NeXT, which was founded by Steve Jobs with the main purpose be to get bought out by Apple.

You realise the main reason a large company such as Apple buys another company is because they are afraid of losing to their market share to them right?"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With BEV (battery EV) accounting for only 1.8% of all vehicles sold in the US in 2020, I think it's still too early to conclude that Tesla will dominate the entire EV market. 

The competition in EV market is getting very heated with Lucid Air, Mustang Mach E, Volkswagen ID4, Nissan Ariya, Rivian etc. coming to market equipped with the $7500 tax credit. Tesla will still have its place in the market for sure, but it's unlikely it will be the monopoly. The EV market will likely follow the oligopolistic market structure of ICE vehicles today with many players at different segments of the market."

Macd is better used to see underlying weaknesses in the current trend through the use of divergence or to assess trend strength and momentum, the thing is though all these things can be accomplished by just analysing the price itself and you can gain a better entry this way because price can't lag itself."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,moo makes the cow -> moonish
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Dude, how high you think this is going in the next 3 years?  If I thought the price was going to drop in the coming months before slowly rising, why wouldn’t I wait?  For example I’m bullish for gme long term, but ain’t going anywhere near the stock right now.  It’s clearly massively over inflated. It’s just not a good deal right now.  But if it dropped to 60, I’d probably start thinking about going long.  I mean even if the stock goes to 1 K in the next 3 years, I’d  have over twice the shares if I bought at 60. 

I’m mean what kind of person takes the stance. “I don’t care what the price is, it’s going to go up, so any price is a good deal”. That’s ridiculous"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Mooooooooooonish
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,1k - 1500.  I doubt we see sub 100 again.  Good luck to wait it out
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yeah that’s delusional.  Good luck to you too though
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Look back at the history of ""Banana Tree Coin"" as I've seen it called on here before. I'd consider the early rises and falls of that to be very similar in terms of volatility as GME. Very similar battles fought over price stabilization between the FUD/FOMO, general hypes and doubts, people taking profits, etc.   


That time period was FILLED with incredibly violent price swings, because of all of those things. Despite the large number of people 'holding' through it all.   


Did it pay off for them in the long run? Clearly, as I believe GME will too, but to suggest that we'll never see sub $100 again when we've gone from $480 to $40, are sitting below $200 and price action has only been happening for 3 months seems silly to me. An assumption based on emotion imo.   


This isn't financial advice. I'm not suggesting you buy or sell. You do you, partner. What I can say, from personal experience, is that had I traded with the mindset I had now based on things I charted on banana tree coin in the beginning instead of living in a drunken state in my late teens/early 20's, I'd be sitting a lot prettier right now. Fuck, some of my friends took my advice drunkenly and have their houses paid off. Prolly fucking my ex-wife too.   


Best of luck to you out there, my guy. We all want the same thing, but need to try and think reasonably along the way to maximize the benefits."

You are talking about 45 days but your options expire in 16.

you also quote ""they didn't sell at $40, why would they sell now at $190"" . I think you have that backwards. 190 > 40. People who bought shares around 40 might sell at 190 to realize profit..."

I see “fuck you” money as meaning I could retire immediately and keep my current lifestyle. 100k *after taxes* isn’t gonna do that for you unless you have some self-masochistic leanFIRE plan.

This is all assuming we both see some value seen in long term financial planning, but since we’re here there’s probably none of that shit going on, so I take it back, let’s call it “fuck you” money."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah while a $100k is nice to have, it’s definitely not fuck you money by any means where I live. Fuck You money, to me, is having enough money to just quit and retire from your job if your boss is being a dick to you one day. Having fuck you money means you are still working because you want to, not because you have to.

$100k barely pays for a 20% down payment on a good house where I live now. Sucks."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Same bro I turned $15k into $80 and then YOLOed $40k into BNGO and sold at the absolute bottom. Did I mention I bought at the top. 🤦🏻‍♂️ I’m down to $48k
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Only the 500 contracts times the price of the premium paid, $19.04. 19.04 x 500 = $9520. The reason it showed a million is that the *value* of those 500 contracts was $952 000, and that is because, by definition, option contracts trade for 100units of the underlying (1 option on VW, let's say, equals 100 shares of VW when exercised). 

Thus, 9520 x 100 = $952 000, and since the premium of the contracts he paid is now $1.20 (19.04-17.84), that means the total *value* is 1.20 x 500 x 100 = $60 000. There come his ""loss"" of 900 000. It's not a real monetary loss, since the contracts are only gonna expire worthless, meaning he only lost his initial $9520. (Unless he sells before the 16th at 1.20 x 500 = $600. He could recover $600 out of his initial 9k, but I unfortunately doubt he'd be able to sell those calls to anyone)"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,india is a mess
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets," Vaccines are not improving conditions, cause it's way too early, not to mention a couple of other factors:

1) They have a population of 1.4 billion people, and they only have 3-4% of the population vaccinated, of course that's way too low of a number to make any attributable claims about vaccine efficacy. 

2)  Mask compliance is pretty terrible. I've had friends tell me that after the initial decline, plenty in the country thought he pandemic is going to be over, and they opened up prematurely.

3) Their testing levels as a percentage of their population has been subpar for a while.    


That said, economic growth is tied to economic activity, and there is no way India is going to tighten the covid restrictions belt as hard as it had before; there is too much risk to livelihood. This is why they've further capped vaccine exports and accelerated vaccination efforts in the country.  Secondly: A majority of the holdings under $EPI are service based (ie workforce capable of working remotely), which explains their growth levels. [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EPI/holdings/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/EPI/holdings/)     


...so yes, too early to see covid recovery in India, but economic growth indicators specifically tied to the Indian stock market aren't as bad. I might scoop up some potential shares if the markets do fall."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why don’t you short GME ? It’s a no brainer
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Those vaccination stats don't seem very reassuring. Indias pop is 1.3 billion.
65 million vaccinated = 4.5% . 10 million per week is 0.7% of population. 

I am sure vaccination speed will increase, but to get an upper bound, going by current rate will take 2.5 years+ to complete vaccination of the country."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Not really. It's more closer to 1% per week atm.

Also, remember that India has a very younger population than someone like us. Majority of people are in 30s/40s.

Besides, the pace would pick up massively in coming days because at the moment, it's 2 million per day for 5 days and barely anything on 2 days of the week, so I'd say India could easily double that."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"The spreads on monthlies are extremely tight compared to weeklies. Look at 6/16 $60. $0.03 spread, $1.67 ask, 19661 (about $3.2MM) in daily volume. If there is a rebound, they will benefit from the bullish price movement and potentially higher IV. Time is also the most valuable asset in the market. You’re doing yourself a disservice if you think trading weeklies is a good idea by default.

Real talk, if you are trading options often, extending your expiry is the easiest way to increase your win rate and your returns. Weeklies inherently have a low probability of success, it doesn’t matter what you think. 

Do you know why weeklies are called FDs? Because people that buy them like getting fucked in the ass by market makers. If you’re into that kind of stuff, more power to you.

Anyway, if you follow through on those weeklies, I wish you the best of luck. It’s in my own self-interest to root for you"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I totally hear your points and that's exactly why I usually stay away from weeklies. That's not normally somewhere I like to play, and I agree it's typically a suckers game. It could very well be here too.

I don't think you are silly for doing monthlies and maybe I need to reconsider my own approach. I will explore it over the weekend for sure. My aversion was paying for extra time premium in a highish vol name when I don't want it. I looked at this like a 1-2 week binary event and made my bet accordingly."

> he was walking down the streets and pledging his stocks as collateral.

Wrong. When trading these total return swaps with these prime brokers, the prime brokers understand that this postion will come with credit risk. The risk managers job is to then offset this risk and this is done by having the counter party post an Initial Margin worth a percentage of the reference assest's value. That means Hwang would've had to post IM to each individual conterparty that was leveraging him ""There was no reusing the collateral"". On top of this Hwang would've had a variation/variable margin. This means that, on a daily basis, as the price of the reference value increases or decreases Hwang would've been credited or had to post the amount as additional collateral (This is known as Mark to Market)"

Edit to explain: you are right if you state it’s not an actual deposit in that kind of form. You are also right if you mean that it’s an agreement between a buyer and a seller. After reading it back, I get why you (or anyone) would make such a comment.

However, I don’t want to get too technical about what form a CFD as a complex financial product is. I want to break down what it does, what it influences (and what it doesn’t), and what the consequences are of using CFDs. This article gives practical understanding of the basic principles of it."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"It actually is the exact same thing from what I've read in other DD / Analyses. 

Then again: RH (as any broker) can see your positions, stoplosses, etc, but RH also counterinvest your money from what's I've read somewhere here (I assume DD was done properly). So for example, when you're long, they buy shorts."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"robinhood has very weird leverage. most brokerages will not let you leverage over 100% on options due to their innate leverage and high chance for total loss. You could go on robinhood gold with 2x leverage and spend everything on FDs and that would be probably be riskier than what bill did. The mean time to blow up your account would be days, while bill won for years before blowing himself up. 

&#x200B;

Also although options have max loss of the principle, that does not make them unleveraged. You can easily get 10x leverage or more relative to the underlying with options, which is basically the crux of what wsb was about before the GME crowd arrived and how some of the biggest legends of wsb made their fame."

To the moon! But i think that when we'll moon, no TA will foresee it..."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Hang in there! We’re in this together.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Why are you so CUTE
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Congratulations everyone should consider their own exit strategy!
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"$FUBO to the moon! 🚀 

6700 @ $41"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Tbh the sports betting is not even the real cash cow for Fubo . If they just break even on gambling but accumulate more and more subs this stock flies. Ad revenue is huge for Fubo as advertisers want their viewer demographic
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Long with about 700 shares low 20 cost avg
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Maybe buy an actual American company? One with licenses in New York.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,With zero licenses in New York. Ok.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I wasn’t aware the success of these two companies revolves around having a license in New York. I should have researched all their international business ventures, the upcoming merger to become thee largest cannabis company in the world, 4 straight quarters of profitability or the fact that Aphria owns thee largest craft brewery in the US which opens the door for future distribution in the US etc ect ect.....I should have done more research on New York licensing before I commented...how narrow minded of me.....my bad."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,The Number 1 listed Catalyst by the OP: “New York recreational cannabis legalization”
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Ahhhh I see....so if a company isn’t impacted by “The Number 1 rated catalyst” it’s not going to be successful or go up in stock price due to other great things happening surrounding the industry. Got it. Thanks for clarifying. Again, how narrow minded of me. I was out of pocket making such an irresponsible statement. Thanks for correcting me."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,You need to work on your issues with a licensed professional
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,[deleted]
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Yes please. We need a lower per share cost so our other ape friends can buy in for 18$ before it goes up even more!!!!

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Deleted a bit because it wasn't clear, due to my own confusion over something I still consider a pain.

""selling calls"", ""selling call options"", ""call option seller"" is thrown around a lot and can mean two things depending on context,  there is a big difference between 

* selling on a call or put that you bought from someone else (your responsibility ends as soon as transferred). Your potential losses are capped at what you paid for the call/put. This was being a call holder, not a writer.
* being the writer of the call or put, you're responsible for the underlying assets, potential unlimited risks beyond the cost of the option premium, confusion arises because ""writing calls"" is also often referred to as ""selling calls""

working out actual costs/risks properly requires knowing if your talking about being just a holder, or a writer."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh alright. Sounds complicated lmao but thats a good comment for me to learn, thanks a lot. 
I ll defo read more about it in the future, but I am already certain that ""writing calls/puts"" is nothing what beginners should do. 
Thanks again and happy easter :)"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It has been dropping still. Where do we see VIAC in a week or two?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,He sure as shit wouldn't be taking it back to the station that he ripped it away from either. CC is dead lol.

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Rehoboam instructed Karp to make this investment.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"TA isn't about predicting the future price 100% of the time, it's just a way of reducing risk and positioning yourself in such a way to benefit from volatile moves. It allows for accurate entry points and tells you quickly when you are wrong so you can cut your losses early, this is why it works and allows for the creation of an edge."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I’m frustrated that this post didn’t gain traction. It is the smartest thing I have read in wsb in awhile! The issue is infiltrating to the media now: [article](https://www.randomlengthsnews.com/archives/2021/04/01/barragan-ruiz-grijalva-merkley-and-warren-urge-president-biden-to-shutdown-dakota-access-pipeline/32654)
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,And another article[article 2](https://www.rt.com/usa/519897-black-snake-pipeline-protest-dc/).
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Yeah, but once the tendies come, I don't care. The stock has been tricking upward and is at $33 since I've posted. I actually might sale to cover losses before the court date, so  no possible losses. I did not anticipate the stock moving much before the court date."

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,I'm a believer generally in not ascribing to malice what can be explained by incompetence.
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oooooo. Never heard of him, but that’s now on my list!!! Thanks for the recommendation!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"That's kind of a naive statement but I suppose for the sake of discussion, I could assume they're burying their heads in the sand because it pays the same to do nothing as it does to do something, assuming they're not being paid on the side to have their head in the sand to begin with."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"With regards to the SEC and other regulatory bodies in general, I think the lack of action is from them looking to be hired by the same groups that they're supposed to be overseeing, mixed with some incompetence. With congress not holding their own regulatory agencies accountable, I think its mostly incompetence combined with some corruption. 

Less grand plan, more grand fuckup."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thank you for the financial analysis.  I’m in deep and long but struggle to confidently say how much of a marketcap/SP Orladeyo supports.

Two points; 
1. Factor D is now officially in PH3 for PNH.  As you note, you didn’t include Factor D in your analysis.  PH3 is scheduled to start 2H 2021.  At the time it starts, early PH1 patients will have been on Factor D for 16 mos.  So, there is significant time of sustained response and no SAE entering PH3.  I fully expect that trial will move quite quickly.  Additionally, it appears to have enrolled more patients (double) than competitors when they went PH3.  

Cowen gave an off the cuff estimate that Factor D could do 1B+ each year in sales for each of the 8 indications.

Given the above...  what do you think that should add to the SP at this stage of development?  And, when do you predict the market might start adding value to BCRX for Factor D?

Actually, I so want an answer to those last two questions.  I’ll just stop here.  TY."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,30 after market today this is aging well
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,yeah this thing is blasting off
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Oh, my bad.. sorry!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"You are delusional. You are un-ironically retarded compared to these funds. They probably have covered most, if not all of their shorts. You will get fucked from every direction if you continue being this idiotic"

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"Thanks, can't take credit for though. Reddit auto-created it and kept logging me into it. Actually something I really hate about the site now!"
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"I don't think you apes understand fundamentals.

Tell me, what were the fundamentals and general consensus for a boomer media stock to just about 3x in less than 3 months?

Word around good DD, Hwang gang caused the *overvaluation* (tf is that word!?). Now, it's up to the market to determine a new valuation. Let me give you a hint. There is no fucking way it's ""recovering"" (Some would say it has recovered from being inflated) back to $100.

Congratulations, you bought a boomer stock. Try thinking for yourself instead of following the herd like a sheep, or ape in this case."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Lol fundamentals don’t matter this is a casino dude. Didn’t buy shares just bought /sold options on it. The stock was oversold and there was/is opportunities to make money
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Because you haven’t clipped it into memes yet

04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,Are... you actually retarded?
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,It's a squeeze play
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"For those of us like myself who have no patience and want immediate tendies, yes."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"u/Tight-Sort-5050 has it right.  MSOs have to be traded on the Over-the-counter markets cause the banks won't touch the Cannabis sector as long as it remains Schedule I at the federal level.  If SAFE banking gets passed that  opens up the flood gates and the whole sector can finally access traditional financial services.  The only way the Canadian LPs benefit from this is by setting up shop here in America, which the MSOs already have a huge lead because of license restrictions.  Forget about Canada exporting to the US, it'll be a while before we see interstate commerce, let alone cross border."
04/02/2021,wallstreetbets,"What makes you think the market would be so free. Maybe it’s the wild west in California and Oregon but it really isn’t in any East Coast rec state and won’t imagine 

Between taxes and startup fees most would have to pay their state. There won’t be much mom and pop competition. And with already wild success among many states, availability in nearly half the United States depite it being federally illegal, how can a company like Curaleaf be a bad buy for the long term U.S. cannabis play. I am a med card holder and if you ask ANYONE in NY where to get good legal weed, it’s Curaleaf. It’s honestly the only reason I ever thought to buy it’s stock was because of how big they already are, theres an advantage to establishing a foothold and theres definitley brand loyalty for some of these companies already. 

BMW doesn’t make the best cars, in fact they make fucking horrible cars and guess how many douchebags buy one every damn day."
